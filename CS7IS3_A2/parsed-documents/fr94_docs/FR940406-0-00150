FR940406-0-00150 FR940406-0-00011 4. Section 86.115&hyph;78 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(5) to read as follows: §86.115&hyph;78 EPA urban dynamometer driving schedules. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (3) *␣*␣* (ii) When conducted to meet the requirements of §86.129&hyph;94 or §86.153&hyph;98(d), up to three additional occurrences of speed variations greater than the tolerance are acceptable, provided they occur for less than 15 seconds on any occasion, and are clearly documented as to the time and speed at that point of the driving schedule. * * * * * (5) When conducted to meet the requirements of §86.129&hyph;94, 86.132&hyph;96, 86.146&hyph;96, or 86.153&hyph;98(d), the speed tolerance shall be as specified above, except that the upper and lower limits shall be 4 mph (6.4 km/h). * * * * * 5. Section 86.132&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (h) introductory text, (j) introductory text, (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(viii) to read as follows: §86.132&hyph;96 Vehicle preconditioning. * * * * * (h) During the soak period for the three-diurnal test sequence described in §86.130&hyph;96, evaporative canisters, if the vehicle is so equipped, shall be preconditioned according to the following procedure. For vehicles with multiple canisters, each canister shall be preconditioned separately. In addition, for model year 1998 and later vehicles equipped with refueling canisters, these canisters shall be preconditioned for the three-diurnal test sequence according to the procedure in §86.132&hyph;96 (j)(1). If a vehicle is designed to actively control evaporative or refueling emission without a canister, the manufacturer shall devise an appropriate preconditioning procedure subject to the approval of the Administrator. * * * * * (j) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in §86.130&hyph;96, one of the following methods shall be used to precondition evaporative canisters during the soak period specified in paragraph (g) of this section. For vehicles with multiple canisters, each canister shall be preconditioned separately. In addition, for model year 1998 and later vehicles equipped with refueling canisters, these canisters shall be preconditioned for the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence according to the procedure in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. Canister emissions are measured to determine breakthrough. Breakthrough is here defined as the point at which the cumulative quantity of hydrocarbons emitted is equal to 2 grams. (1) *␣*␣* (i) Prepare the evaporative/refueling emission canister for the canister loading operation. The canister shall not be removed from the vehicle, unless access to the canister in its normal location is so restricted that purging and loading can only reasonably be accomplished by removing the canister from the vehicle. Special care shall be taken during this step to avoid damage to the components and the integrity of the fuel system. * * * * * (viii) Reconnect the evaporative/refueling emission canister and restore the vehicle to its normal operating condition. * * * * *
