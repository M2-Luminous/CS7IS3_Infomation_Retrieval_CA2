Vladimir Solovyev, the Ostankino correspondent in Yugoslavia, managed to interview specially for our program the man who is probably the most belligerent of the war leaders, the Bosnian Serbs' commander, General Ratko Mladic. What does he think of the prospects for a peaceful settlement? [Begin recording] [Solovyev] In the Serb Republic and in Yugoslavia he is called the Serbian Zhukov. In the West, some regard him as a war criminal. Others study his victories in military staffs and academies. Fifty-year-old Colonel General Ratko Mladic commands the army of the Bosnian Serbs, the largest and the most efficient army in the Balkans. [Mladic, in Serbo-Croatian, with superimposed Russian translation] Our people hold two things sacred -- the land and the woman, because they give birth to new life. We never declared war on anyone. We are defending ourselves, our ancient land, our women and children, our monasteries and churches, our culture. Look, even now, during the war, throughout the Serb Republic, from Banja Luka to Trebinje, there are Croats and Muslims who are not fighting against the Serb nation and who enjoy all the rights of our citizens. [Solovyev, in Serbo-Croatian, with superimposed Russian translation] Mr. General, what do you think of the possible division of Bosnia-Herzegovina? What share of the territory would Bosnian Serbs agree to have? [Mladic] This is inevitable, and we do not demand more than we own. Serbs used to have most of the territory in Bosnia- Herzegovina. The 1910 land register shows that nearly 90 percent was theirs. The Serb nation stands for peace, and we propose that our adversaries sign an agreement on a universal and lasting end to the feud and the hostilities throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the separation of forces along the present front lines. And let politicians solve all disputed issues later in conditions of peace. [Solovyev] Do you think peace is a long way off? [Mladic] As far as we are concerned, there can be peace right now. But looking at it strategically, the forces that unleashed this war and their sponsors have not yet reached their goals, either by force or by ruining Yugoslavia. They do not need peace at present. Therefore I am somewhat pessimistic. I do not believe that they want peace soon, because they profit immensely from the war. [Solovyev] What do you think of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force] ability to bring peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Mladic] One cannot generalize, but most UN soldiers and officers do what they have to do quite well. But unfortunately, there are some who forget about their peace-keeping mission and openly side with the Croats or Muslims. I have to say that so far not one UNPROFOR soldier has been hurt on the territory of the Serb Republic. I am sure this will continue to be the case. I would like to assure the parents of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers with UNPROFOR that they are perfectly safe on our territory and that the people welcome them as a force of peace. [Solovyev] One last question: what is your greatest dream? [Mladic] Peace. [end recording] [Announcer] If General Mladic were to put his assurances about striving for peace into practice, I think the entire international community would breathe a sigh of relief. But somehow I find it difficult to believe.
