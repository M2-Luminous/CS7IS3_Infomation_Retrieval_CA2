In a statement at the airport before his departure, Cetin said that Turkey welcomed this step taken by Bosnians and Croats and hoped that real peace comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina when Serbs join this process too. "Turkey is ready to contribute to the UN Forces in the region, for a lasting, equitable peace," Cetin said. "Turkey, which has the confidence of both Croats and Bosnians, will continue contributing actively to the peace process in the region," he said. Cetin added that the ceremony, to which he was invited by his American counterpart Warren Christopher, showed once more the importance and weight of Turkey in the Balkans. On Turkey's proposal to join the UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] in the region, Cetin said that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who was visiting Turkey, said that his country did not oppose this initiative. Evaluating Juppe's visit, Cetin said that the French Government was not displaying a disturbing stand toward Turkey and was very careful in not intervening in Turkey's internal affairs. Cetin will proceed from Washington to New York and will return home on March 20.
