The president of the party, Mr Sansuma Khungur Bwismutiary, has been removed. The 75-member Central Working Committee elected at the political conference of the All Bodo Students' Union at Debergaon near Kokrajhar in last July has been dissolved. Mr Prem Singh Brahma, general secretary and the chairman of the Bodoland Autonomous Council has taken over the leadership of the party at a special conference held at Tamulpur on April 30. A new Central Working Committee was constituted and the office bearers were named there. Expectedly, Mr Bwismutiary challenged the validity of these steps. He described the whole exercise as "a conspiracy" hatched by the Assam Chief Minister, Mr Hiteswar Saikia, in collusion with his agents in the Bodo movement. According to sources, Mr Bwismutiary will continue to lead a rival faction of the Bodo People's Party with the old guard, Mr Rabiram Brahma, as general secretary. However, his position has definitely weakened since he quit the post of chairman of the BAC [expansion not given]. Mr Bwismutiary's deputy, Mr Brahma, was elevated to the post of chairman. The power to distribute resources coupled with the backing of the Chief Minister, helped him win over support from unexpected quarters. The split in the leadership was expected to percolate in the organizational spheres.
