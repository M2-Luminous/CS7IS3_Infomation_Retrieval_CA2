The U.S. and British diplomatic missions appointed to Cyprus have developed relations with the illegal regime and Ankara's spokesman in a form that directly recognizes the pseudostate and legalizes the invasion. After Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative on Cyprus, British High Commissioner David Dain, and U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher had separate meetings with Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy under secretary, at the Turkish "embassy" building, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis yesterday revealed: On 29 October (Turkish National Day) every year, U.S. and British diplomats participate in a reception hosted by the Turkish "ambassador." Kasoulidhis confirmed that these two countries maintain consular offices in the occupied areas. (Britain's office is on Shakespeare Street in occupied Nicosia and the U.S. office is in Kyrenia). According to reliable information, Turkish Cypriots work in these offices under U.S. and British diplomats. The same reports say that the U.S. and British diplomats often violate the Cypriot Government's rule and stay in the occupied areas for over 24 hours. (One diplomat recently stayed in the occupied areas for three days) The Cypriot Government knows the identities of the diplomats visiting the occupied areas. Asked, the spokesman said the government would not control the movements of diplomats who cross to the occupied areas at the Ledra Palace Hotel. He added that no action has been taken or demarches made with regard to these incidents. The spokesman said the foreign minister will talk to the U.S. and British ambassadors about their meeting with Ulucevik and refer to their relations with the Turkish "ambassador." He will also ask Feissel to explain. Asked about the meetings, Kasoulidhis said that despite these countries repeatedly stressing that they do not afford the occupation any status, we cannot consider meetings in the occupied areas with representatives of the occupation force as an acceptable policy. Kasoulidhis was quick to explain the reasons persuading Dain, Boucher, and Feissel to meet Ulucevik. He stressed: "These meetings obviously aimed to exert influence with Ankara at a time when Ulucevik would be communicating with the Turkish Cypriot leadership to formulate the Turkish position on the confidence-building measures. These and other actions highlight Turkey's responsibility for the ongoing deadlock and for future developments." Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis yesterday had a working luncheon with Feissel. He is expected to meet the U.S. and British ambassadors in the next few days. DIKO [Democratic Party] issued a statement saying that the foreign diplomats and UN representatives' meetings with Ulucevik, at the very least, show contempt and a lack of respect for the legal Cypriot Government.
