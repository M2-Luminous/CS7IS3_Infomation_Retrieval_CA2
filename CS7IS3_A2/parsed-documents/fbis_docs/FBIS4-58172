Even now, Israel is stealing water. It is trying to divert the waters of Lebanon and take them to its own side. In other places also there is fighting over water. They sit down with Turkey and talk about water. May God bestow some intelligence on those who, due to distorted thinking, provide a foothold for the Israelis to come to the Islamic countries. They do not realize that they are inciting their own people against themselves. Turkey is an Islamic country. Even if the Turkish officials turn the world upside down, Turkey is an Islamic country. The Turkish nation has not deserted Islam. No matter what Ataturk said, he said it simply for his own benefit. The Turkish people are Muslims. Can Muslim people tolerate the fact that Israel, which is killing Muslims, will find a foothold in their country, and that Turkish officials are making such arrangements? In any case, we need to make savings in water, in electricity, and in other things. [passage omitted]
