Al-'Attas was answering a question put to him by AL-HAYAH, which contacted him in the hospital where he is receiving medical treatment in the United States. He said: "All the contacts I have made in the United States are aimed at halting the war. The situation which has emerged is saddening and we have warned of it a lot in the past. It is easy to launch a war, but it is difficult to end it." Asked about the way out, he said: "The way out is to halt the war and return to dialogue in order to implement the Pledge and Accord Document. We have agreed in the past that war is not the way to settle disputes, because it will bring nothing but destruction and tragedies for our people." [passage omitted]
