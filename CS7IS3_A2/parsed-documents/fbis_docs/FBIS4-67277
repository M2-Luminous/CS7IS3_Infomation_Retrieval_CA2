Chong Yong-sok and Kim Kil-tae were among the six arrested. According to the prosecutor's office, the leader, Chong Yong-sok, paid Wang four million won [approximately U.S. $50,000] to accompany Chong and Kim Kil-tae to Taipei, Taiwan and interpret for them. Chong purchased one kilogram of philopon for five billion won [approximately U.S. $6.25 million] in Taipei and returned to Korea through Kimpo International with the drug concealed in the clothes Kim was wearing. The smugglers were arrested on 28 March while they were contacting drug dealers in the Namdaemun market areas in Seoul. The one kilogram of philopon was seized as evidence when they were arrested. Along with scrutinizing the background of Chong's drug business, the prosecutor's office has expanded the investigation because of Wang's involvement. The investigators are looking into the customs office and its employees for possible involvement in drug trafficking.
