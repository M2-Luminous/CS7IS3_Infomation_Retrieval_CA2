He was asked to explain the German Government's decision on the mass deportation of Yugoslav citizens from Germany. The German charge d'affairs stressed that the media reports on the expulsion of a large number of people were unfounded, that the number of the so-called asylum-seekers was not so large, and that deportation measures would be applied only against those who are in Germany illegally. The German charge d'affairs was told that the method announced to deport the Yugoslavs is not acceptable, that it would represent the violation of human rights and international conventions, and that the deportation measures have been adopted in a discriminatory fashion without prior consultations with the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on solving complex humanitarian problems. The Federal Government has taken certain steps with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees with regard to this issue.
