FR941019-2-00116 FR941019-2-00080 Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations 1994 1. Introduction For more than a century, the U.S. antitrust laws have stood as the ultimate protector of the competitive process that underlies our free market economy. Through this process, society as a whole benefits from the best possible allocation of resources, which in turn maximizes consumer choice and maintains competitive prices. Although the federal antitrust laws have always applied to foreign commerce, that application is particularly important today. Throughout the world, the importance of antitrust law as a means to ensure open and free markets, protect consumers, and prevent conduct that impedes competition is becoming more apparent. The Department of Justice (``the Department'') and the Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission'' or ``FTC'') (when referred to collectively, ``the Agencies''), as the federal agencies charged with the responsibility of enforcing the antitrust laws, thus have made enforcement of the antitrust laws with respect to international operations a top priority. In furtherance of this priority, the Agencies have revised and updated the Department's 1988 Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations, which are hereby withdrawn. 1 1 The U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Guidelines for the Enforcement and Acquisition of Intellectual Property (Proposed), the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines (1992), and the Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy and Analytical Principles Relating to Health Care and Antitrust, Jointly Issued by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (1994), are not qualified, modified, or otherwise amended by the issuance of these Guidelines.
