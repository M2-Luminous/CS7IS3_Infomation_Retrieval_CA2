The superiority of using a competitive pay price rests upon the economic principle that dairy processors in a highly competitive economy will tend to purchase milk at prices close to the price an efficient processor could pay for that product. Increasing labor and other costs tend to reduce prices that processors are willing to pay for milk. On the other hand, new assembling, processing, packaging and marketing techniques that reduce costs or increase product returns tend to increase the prices processors are willing to pay producers for milk. As these factors fluctuate, shifts occur in the prices that different processors may be able to pay producers. Other groups of processors must meet or approximate these prices or risk losing their supplies of milk. Similarly, various economic factors affecting producers (i.e., taxes, inflation, feed costs, capital assets costs, salaries, etc.) are automatically reflected in the competitive price that producers are willing and able to charge for their milk. Therefore, a competitive pay price was and is viewed as an excellent and superior indicator of the upward and downward adjustments in costs which are automatically reflected in market prices paid to producers for their milk. The M&hyph;W price is a competitive equilibrium market price that represents an estimate of the average of prices paid to dairy farmers for Grade B milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin by plants producing manufactured dairy products such as butter, nonfat dry milk and cheese. The M&hyph;W price was first adopted in 1961 as the basis for setting all minimum classified milk prices in the Chicago Regional marketing area. By 1975, the M&hyph;W price had been adopted by all federal milk orders. Both the industry and the Secretary view the M&hyph;W price as an accurate indicator of the value of milk in large part because the price reflects all of the supply and demand conditions that must be considered under section 608c(18). Manufactured dairy products (cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk) can be made from Grade B or Grade A milk. Because manufactured dairy products are eight to ten times less bulky than raw farm milk and can be stored for much longer periods of time than raw farm milk, these manufactured products are less expensive to move and market than raw farm milk on a per pound basis. As a result, manufactured dairy products can and do compete on a national market basis while competition for raw and packaged fluid milk occurs on a more local or regional level.
