As far as the reasons for Maj. Gen. Gheorghe Diaconescu's dismissal are concerned, numerous variations have been circulating, and the decision of the SRI Director Virgil Magureanu are explained through accusations of espionage against presidential counselor Marin Pancea. Unauthorized sources at the SRI Press Bureau told us that the dismissal of the head of the SRI Counterintelligence Division is only settling accounts at the level of the SRI leadership. In fact, it was for the first time that the reason for Diaconescu's dismissal has been mentioned, namely: "He was concealing documents of an intelligence nature." This is the claim made by SRI Director Virgil Magureanu before the Parliamentary Commission in Charge of Supervising the SRI Activity. In reality, it seems that Diaconescu has been in possession of certain files according to which the SRI director, that is, General Virgil Magureanu, and his first deputy, Maj. Gen. Victor Marcu, were involved in certain crooked affairs that brought them a lot of money. Diaconescu notified the Prosecutor's Office of Romania, namely, the deputy prosecutor general, Maj. Gen. Mihai Ulpiu Chercheleanu, head of the Military Prosecuting Magistracy and former prosecutor general of Romania, who sealed the file containing the respective documents and affirmed that he is not authorized to solve the respective issue. The SRI leadership acted immediately and, as a result of their action, the head of the SRI Counterintelligence Division was dismissed. At the end of the talks that he held with the SRI director, the head of the SRI Counterintelligence Division, Diaconescu, warned Magureanu that it would be advisable for him not to empty the filing cabinet, because he is able at any time to reconstruct them from memory. Dismissed, Hospitalized, Released On Friday 18 March, a Bucharest daily published an article according to which the former head of the Counterintelligence Division General Diaconescu is hospitalized at Bucharest Hospital No. 9, undergoing alcoholic detoxication treatment. More than that, the reporters of the same daily found out that Diaconescu was being treated in a severely guarded ward and his meals were brought to him from home. The second day however, in the same daily that published the aforementioned piece of news, Diaconescu himself published a denial of the respective news. In reality, things happened rather differently. One day before the "bombshell" was published, SRI Director Virgil Magureanu had a discussion with Diaconescu and ordered him to go to a hospital. The former chief of the Counterintelligence Division refused categorically to do so. The publication of that piece of news, which was sent to the paper's editorial office before learning about Diaconescu's reaction to Magureanu's suggestion, could no longer be stopped. Thus, the next day, the denial was published, representing Diaconescu's right to respond to accusations. The Documents That Were Not Reported by Maj. General Gheorghe Diaconescu and Were Sealed by the Prosecutor's Office Are Compromising For the SRI After having been on active duty for over 25 years at the head of Romanian Counterintelligence Service, Diaconescu was dismissed from his office by SRI Director Virgil Magureanu on 15 March 1994. [passage omitted] The dismissal of Diaconescu, head of the Counterintelligence Division on grounds that "he failed to inform the SRI leadership of the contents of certain documents" was generously offered to the press by the SRI leadership because they knew that the true reasons for this demotion will be clarified much later. The fact that the head of the Counterintelligence Division "held back certain documents" is not unusual. Through his duty, Gheorghe Diaconescu could hold back not only a few but hundreds of documents that contained information of an operational nature, because the nature of his office allowed him to do that. SRI sources affirm that the respective documents contained data with "certain aspects that might have been compromising for certain people in the SRI leadership." [passage omitted]
