The assailants, after overpowering the watchman, raided the residence, which they ransacked and looted, taking away valuable objects and money. The attack, which did not result in casualties, has not been claimed but various sources attribute it to a new organization called the "Armed Resistance Group," which recently released a leaflet carrying threats to attack foreign interests -- particularly, French, American, and German -- in Mali. According to official sources, there is no information about the perpetrators of the attack, which coincided with the political opposition's ghost city operation organized in Bamako to demand the reopening of schools closed since mid-February by the government.
