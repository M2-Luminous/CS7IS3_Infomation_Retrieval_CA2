FR940527-1-00239 FR940527-1-00014 The significance of non-inpatient and skilled nursing services also has increased, although it varies by hospital location (see Table 1&hyph;4). In 1985 about 40 percent of rural community hospitals reported having any organized outpatient service; by 1992, more than 84 percent had this capability. While 17 percent of rural hospitals surveyed derived more than half of net patient care revenues in 1993 from ambulatory services, this was true for only about 6 percent of urban hospitals (see Table 1&hyph;5). These revenues were also a larger share of net patient care revenues for non-teaching than for teaching hospitals. Skilled nursing services were provided by 34 percent of community hospitals in 1992, compared with 18.8 percent in 1985. Further, a significantly higher proportion of rural, compared with urban, hospitals furnished this care. This may partly reflect the attempts of rural institutions to compensate for reduced inpatient utilization by expanding skilled nursing care capacity. The percentage of rural hospitals with swing beds (beds certified by Medicare as either acute care or skilled nursing beds) has also risen.
