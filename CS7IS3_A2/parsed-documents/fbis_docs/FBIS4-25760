"We are advising Americans not engaged in essential diplomatic or humanitarian work and to depart Haiti as early as possible," Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly told reporters at a regular news briefing. "The political situation in Haiti remains unstable with potential throughout the country for random violence, sporadic disturbances and criminal acts," she said. Shelly also issued a new travel warning on Haiti, saying that "U.S. citizens are warned against travel to Haiti" because of the suspension of the commercial air passenger service. U.S. President Bill Clinton announced earlier today a ban on commercial air traffic between the United States and Haiti, which will take effect as of June 25 in order to allow those Americans who wish to leave Haiti to do so. "U.S. citizens should make arrangements to leave as early as possible as airline seating may be limited," Shelly said. She told reporters that about 120 Americans at the U.S. Embassy would be departing and approximately 80 would remain to provide services to American citizens, to continue refugee processing and to report on the situation in Haiti.
