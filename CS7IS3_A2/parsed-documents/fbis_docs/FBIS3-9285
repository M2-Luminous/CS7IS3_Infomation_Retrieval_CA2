Here is a report by our Zagreb correspondent Nada al-Isa: [al-Isa] The first result of the Washington agreement is already evident, the clashes between the Croats and the Muslims have virtually stopped. This marks a turning point in general Croat-Bosniak relations. This was stated by Ivo Komsic, member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at a news conference in Zagreb today. However, the agreement is still only a preliminary agreement since the public, the people will have to express their view on it, Komsic said. He said that the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina will give its final word on the Washington agreement on 28 March. The Bosnian Serbs should now be included in the negotiations. We should talk to them on the return of the occupied territories. The Serbs can join the federation, Komsic said, but parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina joining Serbia is out of the question. They can only take a bit of Bosnian dust, whatever is left on their shoes. Asked to comment on the statement by Croatian President Tudjman at the news conference today that there is a possibility of a part of the so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina joining Serbia, Dr. Komsic said that he did not know where Dr. Tudjman obtained this information, and that this was out of the question. Komsic expects some difficulties in the implementation of the Croatian-Bosniak agreement, which could come from individual persons. The implementation of the agreement will be hindered by the same persons who artificially caused the Croatian-Muslim clash. It would be interesting to see what the reaction will be here in Croatia to the statement by Dr. Komsic regarding the so-called Herceg-Bosna. Replying to the question as to what would now happen with the so-called Herceg-Bosna, Dr. Komsic said: Nothing, because it has never existed. Only the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina has and will continue to exist. All artificial creations must completely disappear.
