The spokesman said in Damascus today that Israeli authorities have been seeking to strike a demeaning and cheap bargain with the detainees requiring them to undertake in writing that they support the Gaza-Jericho accord. The detainees, noted the spokesman, rejected the deal that seeks to deprive them of their legitimate right to pursue the fight against occupation and settlement activity. He urged human rights organizations to move to obtain freedom for the detainees and guarantee their right to free self-expression.
