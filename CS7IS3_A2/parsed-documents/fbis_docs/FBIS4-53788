FBIS4-53788 "dreas098_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 South Korea U.S. Firms To Soon Sell Cars in Installments U.S. Firms To Soon Sell Cars in Installments SK1905065994 Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean 19 May 94 p 1 SK1905065994 Seoul HANGUK ILBO Korean BFN [By Hong Son-kun] [Text] It has been learned on 18 May that the government has decided to allow U.S. motor companies to establish joint ventures for financing installments sales in the ROK within this year. Accordingly, U.S. motor companies, including Ford, will be able to sell cars in installments through their own financing companies from 1995. The government policy is a partial acceptance of U.S. pressure to allow U.S. companies to establish installments financing companies on the grounds that not allowing the participation of U.S. companies in the establishment of domestic installments financing companies is discriminatory and a violation of the provision requiring foreign companies to be given equal treatment as domestic companies. The government previously decided to allow ROK companies to establish installments financing companies in the first half of this year. A relevant government official revealed that as the U.S. demand has emerged as a core subject of the trade dispute between the two countries, the government has decided to partially accept the U.S. position by allowing the establishment of installments financing companies by ROK companies first and later by U.S. companies after a certain period. The ROK Government notified the U.S. Government of the policy towards the end of April in trade talks. The official said, however, that the government policy would not allow for 100-percent ownership by U.S. companies, but only investment amounting to 49 percent in a joint venture with ROK companies. Ford Motors has reportedly led the demand for the establishment of installments financing companies in the ROK by U.S. companies.
