FR940405-1-00107 FR940405-1-00013 The cost for providing maintenance first requires an estimate of the number of buildings without regular HVAC maintenance. The 1989 Commercial Buildings Characteristics survey by the Department of Energy estimates that 46 percent of the buildings have regular HVAC maintenance. Therefore, the total number of buildings requiring maintenance is estimated at 2.3 million. OSHA then determined the number of problem buildings without HVAC maintenance by applying the OSHA estimate of 30 percent (presented in section B). The number of problem buildings without HVAC maintenance is estimated at 0.7 million. In general, the average cost per year to maintain a commercial HVAC system is a function of a number of factors. These factors include the type of system, the age of the system, the size of the system, layout of the system, reliability of the equipment installed. In addition to the physical characteristics of the system, the cost per year to maintain the system also depends on the operation of the system, the maintenance policies of the owner, the skill levels of the operating engineers and maintenance workers, and whether the maintenance is carried out by employees of the building owner or is the responsibility of an outside company. Bank of America's maintenance costs for its 2,000 worksites averaged $4 million per year or an average of $2,000 per worksite [Ex. 3&hyph;552]. One facility, a high-rise office building, reported an annual cost of approximately $0.6 million [Ex. 3&hyph;448]. DOW Chemical Company's estimate for ventilation systems maintenance ranges from $0.17 to $0.25/sq.ft/yr [Ex. 3&hyph;502]. Therefore, OSHA used an average of $0.21/sq.ft/yr to compute the cost of HVAC maintenance. In addition to regular HVAC maintenance, buildings with known IAQ problems will require other improvements such as (1) relocating air intakes and other pathways of building entry to restrict the entry of outdoor air contaminants, or (2) installing local source capture exhaust ventilation or substitution within workspaces where air contaminants are being emitted, or (3) increasing ventilation effectiveness, or (4) reduce unwanted infiltration, or (5) monitor outside air quantity to meet ventilation requirements. The National Energy Management Institute developed a cost model for implementing IAQ improvements which is based on the distribution of buildings with IAQ problems by climate zone, building activity and size, and characteristics of ventilation systems. The average cost to implement the actions listed above are estimated to be $1.14 per square foot. These improvements will only be required for the initial year. The cost equation for implementing the compliance program is as follows: C p =M s (N h ×C a +N p ×C a +N p ×C i ×A 20 ) where C p =cost for providing regular HVAC maintenance M s =mean square footage per building (14,000) N h =number of buildings without HVAC maintenance C a =cost per square foot for providing HVAC maintenance ($0.21) N p =number of problem buildings without HVAC maintenance C i =cost per square foot for providing HVAC maintenance and IAQ improvement actions ($1.14) A 20 =Annualization factor at 10% over 20 years (0.117)
