SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Indian Arts and Crafts Board was established by the Act of August 27, 1935 (49 Stat. 891; 25 U.S.C. 305a), and is responsible for promoting the development of American Indian and Alaska Native arts and crafts, improving the economic status of members of Federally recognized tribes, and establishing and expanding marketing opportunities for arts and crafts produced by American Indians and Alaska Natives. The 1935 Act established criminal penalties for selling goods with misrepresentations that they were Indian-produced. These original provisions, in section 1159 of title 18, United States Code, provided for fines not to exceed $500 or imprisonment not to exceed six months or both. Although this law was in effect for many years, it provided no meaningful deterrent to those who misrepresent imitation Indian arts and crafts. In addition, it required ``willfulness'' and ``intent'' to prove a violation, and very little enforcement took place.
