The troops conducted exercises on 28 March for about two hours near the regimental base. In this regard, Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata, the Armed Forces social communications director, reported that the tanks from the "Colonel Felipe Toledo" No. 2 Armored Cavalry Regiment were mobilized within the framework of a training exercise program for new recruits. He explained that citizens were not informed about the mobilization because it was scheduled to be held in the vicinity of the regiment. He added: "The people are not informed when a two-hour exercise is held. They are informed only when tanks will cross the Paraguay River so that no one is alarmed." Medina Monjagata stated that normally the recruits participate in two training exercises, the first during the basic training period and the second during the advanced program.
