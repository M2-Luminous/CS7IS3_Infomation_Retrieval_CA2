"The Romanian spring," as some people called this period, ended in 1971, after Nicolae Ceausescu's visit to Asia. He returned enthusiastically from what he saw in China, where the aberrant and bloody "Cultural Revolution" was in full process of implementation. The darkest period of the Bolshevik totalitarianism in Romania began after that visit. That was a period that ended only with the anticommunist revolution of 1989. The application of the Chinese model -- because, in fact that is what this was all about -- in the 18 years of the Ceausescu dictatorship left tragic marks on the Romanian people in the biological, psychological, economic, social, and moral sphere and many of those marks can be felt even today. Four years after the December 1989 events, the history of the application of the Chinese model seems to be repeated. In a moment when, with immense efforts and sacrifice and in spite of the opposition of those nostalgic Communists, complex processes are taking place in Romania aimed at gradually leading toward democracy, free economy, and European reintegration, a careful observer might distinguish with astonishment and fear certain elements that suggest a new attempt to follow the Chinese model, with the appropriate modifications that it went through in the decades that have passed since it had been implemented by Mao Zedong. In this respect, one cannot ignore the numerous visits paid in recent months to China by important personalities of the current leadership, among them Adrian Nastase [president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament and president of the ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania] and Mircea Cosea [chairman of the Council for Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform]. However, we should pay special attention to the fact that some declarations made very recently by President Iliescu and Adrian Nastase are very close to the general concept of the Chinese model, the way it has been remodeled in the past years by Deng Xiaoping. For example, during the talks held at Cotroceni [Presidency] with the representatives of the Democratic Convention, the head of state let it be understood that the current leaders are ready to hold dialogue with the opposition, but in no way can there be a question of sharing power, although the catastrophic situation of our country and the obvious lack of confidence of the public in the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and in its allies would make a change of government imperative for the benefit of the country. This position adopted by Mr. Iliescu has been confirmed also by the president of the Chamber of Deputies, on the occasion of an ample interview granted to the Romanian Television on Monday, 17 January, immediately after the major current events program of that evening. In the interview, the leader of the ruling party shared with millions of television viewers who were following the program another idea that derives from the Chinese model, namely that privatization is not a goal in itself. The Chinese leaders have launched in recent years the concept of "socialist market economy" which is a flagrant contradiction of terms, because the socialist economy (in fact the communist economy) is not compatible with the market economy, as can be seen from the tragic experience of the past 75 years. However, market economy cannot exist without massive privatization, the proof of it being what is currently happening in our country and in the former communist countries which carry out half-measure reforms. The two major leaders of the current neo-communist power in our country have also spoken out for other "theses" that derive from the typical cliches of the Chinese models. Thus, on the occasion of the visit paid to Cotroceni by Mrs. Madeleine Albright, the representative of the United States to the United Nations, Mr. Iliescu stated that the current economy is going through a crisis of system and its major cause is the contradiction between rich and poor countries. In turn, during his aforementioned television interview, Mr. Nastase affirmed that Romania's admission to the Euro-Atlantic structures does not depend on the democratic reforms in our country but on our geostrategic position. Thus, the phantom of the Chinese model is haunting our country again, but this does not stop us from being optimists, just as we have been so far. If we look at what happened in less than three years to the "glorious Soviet Union" and to the aberrant ideology on which the colossus with clay legs that frightened the civilized West for three quarter of a century relied, we can predict what is going to happen in a few years to the other communist colossus that tries to invent new funny formulas of survival. The same thing that will happen to those who try to follow that model. There is nothing we can do except tell all of them at the right time: "God forgive them for the evil they inflicted on humanity," because we are too small to do this.
