The office will gather information on such issues as the movement in the U.S. Congress for patent law revision and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) Goal of uniform judicial precedents for IPR in the United States. IIP has appointed as its first office director Hirutsuna Yamashita, a chief researcher from the Patent Office presently on loan. IIP in the past has invited such influential individuals as CAFC Chief Judge Helen Nies and former U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Commissioner Harry Manbech obtained information on trends in U.S. patent suits and system revision. However, cases with Japanese corporations caught up in law suits at the court level have been increasing, and there is a growing need for detailed information. IIP also opened the local office because there has been a change in administration from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party, and it is important to develop new connections. In the Clinton administration, the power of the hard-line faction on Japan has increased with the appointment of U.S. senate staffer Bruce Lehman as USPTO commissioner. Individuals involved in patents also see the intentions of the hard-line faction in the U.S. request in the Framework talks for the total prohibition of conputer program reverse engineering.
