FR940620-1-00035 FR940620-1-00007 Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal because it would only clarify the structure of a trust as a vessel-owning entity, correct certain errors and omissions made in the final rule for 46 CFR part 67, clarify a cross-reference with regard to calculation of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and address the statutorily required endorsements for vessels employed in towing or dredging. This proposal would bring the regulations into conformity with current policy and practice. These matters are administrative in nature and do not have any economic impacts on the regulated public. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The coast guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This proposal has been determined to be categorically excluded because the changes proposed are administrative in nature and clearly have no environmental impact. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES.
