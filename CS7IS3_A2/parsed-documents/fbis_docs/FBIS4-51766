Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku said North Korea's planned withdrawal from the truce commission is an express violation of the existing Armistice Agreement and the basic South-North agreement. "Their move is an irresponsible act of scheming to neutralize the existing armistice agreement," Yi said. He is concurrent National Unification minister. In an interview with three major broadcasting stations, the deputy premier said that any issue related to the existing truce agreement should be discussed duly through South-North dialogue. He noted that the basic South-North agreement stipulates in its Article 5 that issues related to the Armistice Agreement should be resolved through inter-Korean concurrence. Yi said, however, that this is no time to discuss the issue with North Korea. "It is not desirable to raise another question at a time when the nuclear issue has arrived at a vital point," he said. Meanwhile, spokesman Kim hyong-ki of the National Unification Board said the North Korean intent represents an outright violation of the provisions of Article 61 of the Armistice Agreement and Article 5 of the basic South-North agreement. "Our unchanging position is that the issue of changing the existing armistice system including replacement of the truce agreement should be resolved independently between the direct parties involved, namely, South and North Korea," Kim said in a statement. The spokesman charged that the North Korean act of threatening the existing truce mechanism at this time when the nuclear issue has reached an important juncture, cannot but be an attempt to delay the resolution of the nuclear issue and becloud the essence of the nuclear question. "The existing armistice system should be preserved faithfully until an alternative to the system is worked out," Kim said, adding that no attempt to neutralize the existing truce mechanism can be justified.
