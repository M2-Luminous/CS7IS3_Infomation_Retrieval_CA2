FR940630-0-00076 FR940630-0-00031 Based on information received during the 1992&hyph;1993 season, NMFS has determined that algal concentrations may be characteristic of the restricted area or may recur in an intermittent or unpredictable pattern and, thus, render TED-use impracticable. NMFS will continue to monitor algal concentrations to determine whether these concentrations are consistently problematic or whether there are times or seasons when TEDs could be used. Shrimp trawling observed out of Sneads Ferry, NC, on April 28, 1994, confirmed the presence of algal concentrations sufficient to clog three of four Anthony Weedless TEDs used in the observed tows. This rule makes effective for the remainder of the traditional shrimping season, through November 30, 1994, the policies and procedures that were temporarily in effect in the North Carolina restricted area under previous exemptions. Specifically, under this final rule, tow times in the North Carolina restricted area are limited to 30 minutes through August 15; 55 minutes from August 16 through October 31; and 75 minutes from November 1 through November 30, 1994. These measures should not, in the long run, significantly impact fishermen's normal trawl times, since heavy algae concentrations characteristic of the warmer months cause fishermen to voluntarily shorten tow times to approximately 15&hyph;30 minutes. When algal concentrations are light, shrimpers usually opt to use TEDs. Also, under this final rule, registration with the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), is required before a vessel may trawl in the restricted area, and vessels using the tow-time alternative are required to carry a NMFS-approved observer if requested to do so by the Regional Director. The observer will monitor compliance with required conservation measures, including restricted tow times, and resuscitation of any captured turtles in accordance with 50 CFR 227.72(e)(1)(i). Data collected by observers may be used for enforcement purposes. Violations of tow-time restrictions documented by North Carolina enforcement officers may be prosecuted under the ESA by the Office of the General Counsel, NMFS, Southeast Region. In addition, violators may face prosecution under State law. NMFS and North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF) will jointly monitor compliance with the tow-time alternative. In addition, this rule makes a technical correction to the general tow-time provision of 50 CFR 227.72(e)(3)(i). The interim rule published September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48977) inadvertently amended this section to apply only to 1993. This final rule revises the general tow time provision to apply every year, as intended. Additional Sea Turtle Conservation Measures Pursuant to the provisions of 50 CFR 227.72(e) (3) and (6), the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (AA) may modify the required conservation measures by publishing notification in the Federal Register , if necessary, to ensure adequate protection of endangered and threatened sea turtles. Under this procedure, the AA would impose any necessary additional or more stringent measures, including more restrictive tow times, synchronized tow times, or termination of the tow-time alternative, if the AA determines that: (1) The concentration of algae no longer makes trawling with TEDs impracticable; (2) there is insufficient compliance with the required conservation measures; (3) compliance cannot be monitored effectively; (4) significant or unanticipated levels of lethal or non-lethal takings or strandings of sea turtles have occurred in or near the North Carolina restricted area; or (5) the incidental take level, authorized by biological opinion, of one mortality of Kemp's ridley, green, hawksbill, or leatherback turtles, or two mortalities of loggerhead turtles attributable to shrimp fishing in the North Carolina restricted area is met or exceeded during the exemption period. Classification The AA has determined that this rule is consistent with the ESA and other applicable law and is ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that the proposed rule if adopted would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As a result, a final regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. The AA prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for this rule that concludes that the rule will have no significant impact on the human environment. A copy of the EA is available (see ADDRESSES ) and comments on it are requested.
