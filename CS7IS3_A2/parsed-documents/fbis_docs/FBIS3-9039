"I was only expecting a few of the deputies from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to support the law on shortening the electoral period. It was the most beautiful parliamentary game in the history of Slovakia," Weiss said. He added that he would like to believe that this was the germ of an election campaign which would not be a hate-filled struggle between political personalities, but would be a correct and proper competition of manifestos on how to lead Slovakia out of its crisis. Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Deputy Frantisek Miklosko said the voting was a clear signal that HZDS deputies, after the lack of success of their referendum petition (which was found not to contain enough proper signatures) had understood that calling an election through a referendum was no longer possible, and clearly did not have the strength to do so either. Thus they had chosen the strategy of deciding on one of the dates put forward after all, he said. Chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) Bela Bugar said it was good that the question of early elections was being solved in a constitutional way. This was the most simple and cheapest solution, he said. Another way, such as approving a proposal to call a referendum, would cost a lot of money. Milan Knazko, chairman of the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic (AD SR) said he believed that for the deputies of the former government coalition this was the last possibility of achieving early elections. All that they had tried to do before was their usual "variety politics," including the referendum, in which (judging from the inauthentic petition signatures) even fairy-tale beings would take part. Knazko said he hoped that by the elections his party would be able to create a stable liberal right-of-centre bloc with Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic Party and Moravcik and Roman Kovac's Democratic Union of Slovakia. Chairman of the preparatory committee of the National Democratic Party Ludovit Cernak said he thought that the Meciarites had made a proper assessment of the consequences of not supporting the election date proposal. Refusing it would have meant a fiasco for them; they were trying to limit the damage. Cernak said he was glad that, in spite of their huge differences, Slovak deputies had sent the world a signal that there were things they knew how to agree on. However, he did not think the Meciarites could be said to have turned over a new leaf, as they were still fiercely oppositional in their behaviour. "There was no whistling in the Slovak parliament for two years; now there is. Nonetheless, I am glad that the first step is behind us," Cernak said.
