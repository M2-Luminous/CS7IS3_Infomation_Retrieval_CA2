We pay the highest tribute to the teachers, parents, and persons in various circles in society who have worked hard for the healthy growth of children! In this joyful time as we celebrate "1 June" International Children's Day, General Secretary Jiang Zemin has written an inscription for the Young Pioneers of our country: "Learn knowledge yourself, manage yourself, protect yourself, strengthen yourself, discipline yourself, and be a qualified builder of the socialist undertaking, as well as a successor to it." This fully indicates the ardent expectations the CPC Central Committee and the old revolutionaries have regarding the next generation, and enables Young Pioneer workers in the whole country to further pinpoint the duty and orientation of education. If China is to gain an edge in the trans-century competition, if the Chinese nation is to rise, and if millions of people are to realize the great aspiration of building a strong and modernized socialist country, the ultimate factor is the emergence of millions of various kinds of professionals who have integrity, knowledge, and good physique. In a modern society where science and technology develop rapidly and competition of various kinds is intensifying, people have a new understanding of a capable person. A capable person's integrity includes not only political awareness, of which the basic requirement is to uphold the party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," healthy thinking and sense, and good morals and integrity, but also a strong will, positive and rich sentiment, and voluntary behavior conforming to legal and social norms. By knowledge we mean that this can no longer be purely measured by the degree of knowledge we possess; that is to say, one must not only have extensive knowledge, but must also have the ability to acquire knowledge and to transform knowledge into real productive forces. By physique we do not merely mean the concept of a kind of physical strength, but also include the strength to struggle courageously, as well as a tenacious ability to endure. However, real life is obviously different from people's wishes and demands. Among some young students, there are still certain acute problems and weaknesses, which cause concern throughout society. Therefore, the topic of how we can follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's demand that "education must face modernization, the world, and the future," to cultivate students' all-round quality and enable them to shoulder the important trans-century duty, is a strategic topic which badly needs attention. Precisely based on this kind of understanding, the All-China Children and Juvenile Work Committee has launched a "Five Self's" campaign among Young Pioneer organizations. "Five Self's" means: Learn knowledge yourself--the cultivation of an ability to voluntarily study and to acquire knowledge to become a master of knowledge; manage yourself--learn how to independently solve problems and difficulties in daily life and to possess the basic ability to make a living and work; protect yourself--understand the law, social norms, and common knowledge of life so as to be able to protect one's legitimate rights and intelligently and bravely handle difficulties and even dangers one might run into; strengthen yourself--be adventurous and confident, have a strong and persistent will, and have the courage and ability to overcome difficulties; and discipline yourself--voluntarily observe the standards of behavior of primary and secondary school students and possess the ability to restrain, regulate, and control one's own behavior. Launching the "Five Self's" campaign is a basic project for training of capable persons. It meets the characteristics and needs of youngsters, and is needed for their healthy growth in the future. Its direct purpose is to help children and youngsters to learn how to become young masters of daily life and to upgrade their sense and ability of living, learning, working, and creating. "Five Self's" activities are activities belonging to the children and youngsters themselves and is a kind of training and learning, and its main principle is practice, through which improvement is sought. Children and youngsters are the main body and master of activities, and what schools, teachers, and Young Pioneers workers have to do more of is guidance work and work to pave the road and build bridges. We believe that the inscription written by General Secretary Jiang Zemin will certainly further arouse enthusiasm among children and youngsters for participation and will enhance their rich imaginations, positive enterprising spirit, and potential for learning and creation; it will certainly enable the "Five Self's" activities to become rich and colorful and score numerous great results. We sincerely wish the broad masses of children and youngsters who start from here drill to harden their wings and soar to great heights.
