Take notice that on December 2, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR) tendered for filing an ``Expedited Request for Limited Waiver of Tariff Provision.'' ANR is requesting that the Commission permit ANR to delay, for two months, its filing to ``true-up'' its Above-Market Dakota Costs, as required by ยง28.1(c)(7) of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1. ANR is requesting this limited waiver to permit ANR to collect the data underlying its actual revenue collection experience for the applicable true-up period. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426 in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211, 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before December 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this application are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
