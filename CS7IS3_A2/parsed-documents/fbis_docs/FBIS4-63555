The Belarusian Government considers itself to be wise. We, they say, will observe our neighbors, estimate costs and present the most rational program [for carrying out privatization] to the Belarusian people. However, many people have already realized that these words are for those wretched people who continue to trust the government. As do the sane people, they prefer analyzing a performance. The official performance is as follows. Official privatization began much later than unofficial privatization. The unofficial privatization has been in progress for over three years. For example, according to an important official from the Ministry of Trade, all more or less profitable enterprises dealing with public catering in Minsk were already privatized in 1991-92. The same concerns profitable enterprises in other sectors. The mechanism of privatization is very simple: A joint stock enterprise is organized, or an enterprise is leased by a working collective, or a people's enterprise is established -- there are a lot of versions. The absolute majority of stock is taken by the initiators and their entourage. At a specified time, a group of people declares that they have a controlling interest in an enterprise. So, you understand what happens next. Belarusian citizens can obtain vouchers beginning 1 April. This means that various investment funds should have already begun their operations, saying nothing about the implementation of the legislative and executive mechanisms. As of today (early May), 24 investment funds filed applications to receive licenses for conducting operations with vouchers. However, none of them has yet received a license. The Committee for Administration of State Property has even not drafted a regulation regarding licensing -- and you know why. We also lack a mechanism for changing vouchers for stock. In addition, an investment fund can buy only 10 percent of an enterprise's stock. This is foreseen by the "Law on Demonopolization and Privatization." There is no opportunity to buy the entire stock of an enterprise. Thus, The Committee for Administration of State Property has found itself in a rather unusual situation. On the one hand, it should fulfill promises given by Comrade Kebich regarding "fair privatization." On the other hand, privatization has already been carried out, the property has been divided, and there are new owners. The chairman of the Control Chamber has already spoken on this subject: He claimed that people can only hope for leftovers from their masters' tables; nothing more is left. Generally speaking, people are well aware of this: As of 15 April, only 2,123 certificates [sertyfikaty] (something like a savings-bank book where the number of a person's vouchers is registered) were issued. The cost of a voucher -- 25,000 rubles -- does not change. At the same time, the Cabinet of Ministers banned the auctioning of vouchers to protect them from complete "devaluation." If an auction is conducted, people would see that a voucher has a very low market price. It is planned that the trade in vouchers will begin as early as 1 July -- already after the presidential campaign. Until this time, it is only possible to buy the vouchers, however, nobody knows how to do it. How can any operations with vouchers be conducted if auctions are banned and it is impossible to estimate its price? Belarusian businessmen consider that Valery Matsyushewski, chairman of the Committee for Administration of State Property, is an adversary of privatization. This is only partially true. Enemy number one of privatization is at the top. Mr. Matsyushewski only carries out his orders. [passage omitted]
