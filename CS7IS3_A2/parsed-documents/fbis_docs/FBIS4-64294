FBIS4-64294 "drweu084_o_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 CYPRUS Kliridhis To Seek Appointment of U.S. Observer Kliridhis To Seek Appointment of U.S. Observer NC3004201594 Nicosia I MAKHI in Greek 30 Apr 94 pp 1, 4 NC3004201594 Nicosia I MAKHI Greek BFN [Report by Fanos Konstandinidhis] [Excerpts] Reliable information by I MAKHI notes that President Glavkos Kliridhis plans to ask U.S. President Bill Clinton to appoint a personal envoy on the Cyprus issue who will act as an observer. The U.S. observer will have the same mission as the observer from the European Union. However, an effort will be made to give the U.S. observer more important duties and to have him submit reports directly to President Clinton. In this way, the U.S. President will get more involved in the Cyprus issue because he will have direct knowledge of developments. As it has become known, Washington has been sounded out regarding the appointment of a U.S. observer and the reaction was not negative. U.S. officials and people from President Clinton's circle are studying the request from Nicosia for the appointment of an observer as a substitute for the special coordinator who is under the State Department. Nicosia estimates that the institution of the "special coordinator" on the Cyprus issue has not been productive so far, and the various "coordinators" at times did not do anything worthwhile, as they usually resorted to small talk and useless and deceiving statements. In the meantime, important officials of the Greek community in the United States are trying to arrange for a meeting between President Clinton and President Kliridhis, perhaps in June in Washington. Political and diplomatic circles stress that a possible new meeting between Clinton and Kliridhis, especially following the collapse of the proximity talks, will give the opportunity for personal intervention by the U.S. President in the Cyprus issue. Irrespective of whether a Clinton-Kliridhis meeting takes place, information notes that the Cyprus Government plans to ask for a more active involvement by Washington in the Cyprus issue. One of the basic issues that the Clinton Administration will be asked to support is Cyprus' demilitarization. According to government information, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council view Kliridhis' proposal for demilitarization positively, and the government is determined to move toward this direction. Furthermore, it is not ruled out that a special appeal to the Security Council will be made so that the body will take an official position on the issue. According to the estimate of diplomatic circles, following the collapse of the talks on the confidence-building measures there will be no action on the Cyprus issue until the Security Council decides on the next move and after UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali submits his report with the relevant suggestions. The report is expected to be submitted in three weeks and will be based on the report of Joe Clark's [UN secretary general's special representative on Cyprus] report to the secretary general after his fruitless deliberations with the Turkish side. The estimates are that the Turks--Ankara and [Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf] Denktas--have recently intensified their intransigent stance. [passage omitted] In the meantime, both Britain and Germany have openly criticized the Turkish stance on the Cyprus issue and have let it be known that the new impasse could lead to the process for Cyprus' accession in the European Union to be accelerated. In Nicosia there is information that the German presidency of the European Union [which will take over from Greece on 1 July 1994] has given assurances that it will promote Cyprus' application for membership in the European Union.
