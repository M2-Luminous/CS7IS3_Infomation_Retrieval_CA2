FR940527-1-00262 FR940527-1-00014 Marginal Cost Factors_ Once a case exceeds the relevant outlier threshold, the payment rate depends on the marginal cost factor. For example, hospitals are paid 75 percent of the estimated cost beyond the threshold for cost outliers and therefore must bear 25 percent of the additional estimated cost beyond the threshold. This is intended to provide an incentive to continue to control the costs of outlier cases. In addition, it is believed that the additional payment for outlier cases should be less than the estimated cost beyond the threshold because of a potential bias in the way cost is estimated. The changes discussed above would improve the effectiveness of outlier payment policy in identifying and directing payment to the most costly cases. Outlier payments no longer would be made for cases on which the hospital incurs only small losses or even gains. Given these changes, the Commission believes it would be appropriate to compensate hospitals for a higher percentage of the losses beyond the cost outlier threshold. The marginal cost factor for cost outliers therefore should be raised to 80 percent. Outlier Payment Pool_ The outlier pool is expressed in terms of the percentage of total PPS payments (excluding the IME and DSH adjustments) that is set aside for outlier payments. By law, it must be between 5.0 percent and 6.0 percent; it currently is set at 5.1 percent. Last year, ProPAC recommended that the outlier payment pool should be increased to 6.0 percent of total PPS payments. Upon further examination, however, the Commission has determined that the reduction in DRG payment rates required to fund a larger outlier pool would offset the benefit from reduced losses that hospitals would have to incur before outlier payments begin (see the discussion below). The Commission will continue to examine the implications of changing the size of the outlier pool in the context of recent and proposed changes in outlier payment policy. Financing Outlier Payments_ Outlier payments are financed by across-the-board reductions in the DRG payment amounts for urban and rural hospitals_5.5 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, in fiscal year 1994. These reductions reflect the difference in the anticipated percentages of outlier payments for the two groups. In fiscal year 1995, with the elimination of the differential between the standardized payment amounts for rural and other urban areas, these reductions will be equal for all hospitals. Recent ProPAC analyses indicate that outlier cases and payments are concentrated among groups of hospitals and DRGs. These findings suggest that financing outlier payments by an equal reduction in the basic DRG rate paid for each case results in overpayment for DRGs with a high percentage of outlier payments and underpayment for DRGs with a low percentage of outlier payments. Financing outlier payments by reducing the payment rates for cases in each DRG, based on the anticipated percentage of outlier payments in that DRG, holds promise in improving the effectiveness of outlier payments and overall payment equity. Last year, ProPAC recommended this change. The Commission is concerned, however, about the potential redistribution of payments that would result. ProPAC intends to continue its work on this issue, specifically in analyzing the impact on payments across hospitals and types of cases. Transfer Cases and High-Transfer Hospitals_ ProPAC has also examined the impact of the outlier payment changes enacted in OBRA 1993 and the additional changes proposed by the Commission. The results indicate that while the OBRA 1993 changes generally target a higher proportion of outlier payments to the most expensive cases, they actually reduce estimated payments to transfer cases and the hospitals that most frequently receive them. This reduction is due largely to the application of the IME and DSH payment adjustments in estimating outlier costs and calculating outlier payments. As discussed earlier, the application of these adjustments results in substantial underpayment for outlier cases at teaching and disproportionate share hospitals. Because many of the hospitals that receive the most transfer cases are teaching hospitals, and because a high proportion of transfer cases are outliers, the effect on these cases and hospitals is particularly adverse. The implementation of the additional changes recommended by the Commission would substantially increase payments for transfer cases and hospitals that receive a large number of these cases, by targeting more outlier payments to the cases associated with the largest losses. ProPAC's analysis of these issues will be described in more detail in its technical report, Outlier Payment Policy (June 1994). Recommendation 19: Level of the Indirect Medical Education Adjustment to PPS Operating Payments The Commission recommends that the indirect medical education adjustment to PPS operating payments be reduced from its current level of 7.7 percent to 7.0 percent for fiscal year 1995. This reduction should be implemented with the anticipated decrease in indirect medical education payments returned to all hospitals through a proportionate increase in the standardized payment amounts. The Commission also recommends continuation of the indirect medical education adjustment to PPS payments until an alternative system of compensating appropriately for the higher costs of patient care in teaching institutions is fully operational. The IME adjustment is intended to recognize the higher costs teaching hospitals incur in treating Medicare patients. These higher costs have been attributed to caring for patients with more severe or complex illnesses, providing a broader scope of services and more services per patient, and using a costlier mix of staff. ProPAC annually estimates the relationship between teaching intensity and standardized Medicare operating costs per discharge. The standardization controls for differences in costs that are accounted for by other PPS payment factors. These include geographic differences in the PPS base payment amounts, the local area wage index, the hospital's Medicare case-mix index, and outlier payments for extremely long or costly cases. The most recent analysis was based on cost data from the eighth year of PPS and payment rules for fiscal year 1994. The results indicate that, on average, a 10 percent difference in teaching intensity is associated with a 5.2 percent difference in Medicare operating costs per discharge. The estimated relationship between costs and teaching intensity is affected by other aspects of the payment system. For example, the differential in rural and other urban standardized payment amounts will be eliminated in fiscal year 1995. If the elimination of this differential were effective in fiscal year 1994, the IME estimate would rise to 5.3 percent. Implementation of improvements in the PPS hospital wage index and outlier payment policy would increase Medicare payments to teaching hospitals. (See Recommendations 16 and 18.) These changes also would require that the IME adjustment be reduced to reflect more accurately the relationship between costs and teaching intensity. The Commission recognizes that since PPS began, the Medicare program has more than adequately compensated teaching hospitals for the costs of treating medicare patients. The current 7.7 percent IME operating payment adjustment is substantially higher than the empirical estimate of 5.2 percent indicated by the most recent analysis. Moreover, PPS operating margins consistently have been higher for teaching hospitals than for nonteaching hospitals. PPS margins have been especially high for major teaching hospitals (that is, those with the highest levels of teaching intensity). However, the Commission is concerned that the continued operation of these hospitals and the fulfillment of their unique role in the provision of health care might be impaired by a substantial immediate reduction of Federal support. ProPAC believes the Medicare program's responsibility to its enrollees is broader than merely paying for services for beneficiaries. This responsibility includes maintaining access to the quality of care and types of services available at teaching hospitals, which might be affected adversely by a sharp decline in IME payments. Given these considerations, the Commission believes a gradual reduction of the IME adjustment is a prudent course of action. ProPAC's recommendation would reduce the adjustment by approximately one-third of the difference between the current adjustment and the Commission's estimate of 5.2 percent. The Commission will continue to examine the financial status of teaching hospitals to avoid any deleterious effects on access to quality care for Medicare enrollees. This approach recognizes as an ultimate objective the use of the IME adjustment to compensate appropriately for differences in Medicare costs that are attributable to differences in teaching intensity.
