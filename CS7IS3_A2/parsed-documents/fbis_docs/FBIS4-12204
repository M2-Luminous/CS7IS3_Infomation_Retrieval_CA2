In an article published here today, the paper adds: The United States is going to the limit in its aggressive approach. It is flouting all laws and norms, including the unfair resolutions passed by the UN Security Council. The paper goes on to say: Those endowed with an analytical mind that enables them to read between the lines are well aware of the reasons prompting the United States to proceed with its anti-Iraq campaign. These reasons are manifest in the way the United States is managing this campaign. The paper says: And within this context falls the bizarre U.S. position at the UN Security Council, and the U.S. determination to overlook the fact that the reasons for maintaining the anti-Iraq embargo have been fully removed, that Iraq has fulfilled its commitments toward the UN Security Council, particularly with regard to Resolution 687, and that the world body must honor its commitments toward our country through the rapid implementation of Paragraph 22. AL-'IRAQ adds: It is the U.S. colonialist policy, which is rooted in hegemony and a willingness to do the impossible to promote the image of the Zionist entity as a key regional player, that is pushing the United States to circumvent this resolution, and to obstruct the crystallization of any fair relevant position that could be entertained by the other members of the UN Security Council. This was made clear during the UN Security Council's recent periodic review session. AL-'IRAQ concludes by saying: The rancorous and intransigent U.S. position, which professes to uphold legitimacy and international law, has nothing to do with either of the two. As a matter of fact, it is the outcome of an evil and frenzied endeavor to weaken Iraq and cripple its pan-Arab and humanitarian role. The paper urges the parties that have taken a constructive and fair position inside and outside the UN Security Council to promote their positions in the interest of true legitimacy and international law, which the United States seeks to undermine in order to advance its own interests and the interests of its agents and stooges, as well as its evil schemes.
