He has come to Rwanda to gather information on the development of the situation -- in particular the massacres -- and to seek possible solutions to that problem. He had the opportunity to hold talks with certain government military leaders, including the chief of general staff and the principal private secretary at the Defense Ministry. Their talks touched on the issue of those people now taking refuge in certain buildings in Kigali, which are surrounded by Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] militia, notably the Hotel Des Milles Collines, the (Amohoro) hotel, and King Faisal hospital. The government military leaders, among them Chief of Staff [COS] Colonel Augustin Bizimungu, reportedly promised Mr. Ayala Lasso that they would facilitate the liberation of these people -- but undoubtedly this promise will not be translated into reality, given the statements made by this same government army COS this morning on Radio France Internationale. When RFI correspondents asked him what the soldiers needed to neutralize the MRND militia [Interahamwe] so as to prevent the massacre of innocent people, Colonel Bizimungu answered that it was a lack of soldiers, given that the soldiers were busy repulsing the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA].
