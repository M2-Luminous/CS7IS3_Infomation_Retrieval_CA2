He made the remarks at a meeting in Beijing with Wu Yi, the Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. He said speeding up the admission of China and other applicants to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) remains one of his top priorities after the conclusion of the drawn-out Uruguay Round in Morocco last month. And he urged both China and the trade body's members to work closely together to solve the remaining obstacles. "There's a general willingness among GATT members to work constructively to bring the negotiations (over China's re-entry) to a conclusion," he said. He expressed the hope that a draft protocol of China's re-entry would be hammered out by the end of June to pave the way for later negotiations. He also called for a balanced treatment of China's entry, saying that it is not realistic to ask China to meet all demands before being re-admitted. China should make "a big effort" to achieve re-entry as soon as possible, he said, adding that the key is to further open up the country's trade regime. He said that he encouraged transparency and China's maximum participation in the current negotiations. "This will get a positive response from GATT members," he added. Wu Yi said China will be able to make its trade regime more transparent. "China not only has the political will, but also has the ability to further its economic reforms," she said. She stressed that the latest reforms in the country's finance, foreign trade, investment, taxation and foreign exchange control systems will create a basic framework for China's market economy.
