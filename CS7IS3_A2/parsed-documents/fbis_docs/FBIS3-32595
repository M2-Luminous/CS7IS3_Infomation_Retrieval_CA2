Approximately 100 members of the Indian Council of Chiapas came to the official residence in Los Pinos this afternoon to discuss with the president their needs for potable water, high schools, health centers, and better administration of justice. They came to Mexico City in an Air Force plane, arriving at the presidential house in tour buses. The group was led by Governor Javier Lopez Moreno. The meeting was private. It extended beyond the allotted time. Later President Salinas personally explained the reason for his delay to the workers, electricians who waited in another room at Los Pinos. [Begin Salinas recording] I come from a meeting where I heard, talked, and adopted decisions with Indian municipal presidents from 13 municipalites in Chiapas State. I heard their proposals with due attention and respect. I learned about their decision to work for peace, harmony, and justice. They want two things above all: they want harmony to prevail in their communities, region, and their great and beloved Chiapas State, and they want pledges fulfilled. This was my reply: For Chiapas and for Mexico, we will work for harmony, and we will fulfill pledges. [applause] [end recording] The Indians were from nine ethnic groups -- Chamulas, Tzotziles, Choles, Lacandones, and others -- in Los Altos de Chiapas. They said they were happy about their meeting with President Salinas but they warned that if authorities fail to fulfill all their pledges they will come back and report this to the president of the republic. They also said that they share the reasons for the Zapatists' struggle but not the way in which they have done it, meaning with weapons. Asked if they will continue to vote for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] in future elections, Pascual Gustavo Rodriguez, municipal president of Mitontic, said they have yet to decide for whom they vote in the next general elections. It is appropriate to mention the question was asked because voting in this region has always favored the PRI.
