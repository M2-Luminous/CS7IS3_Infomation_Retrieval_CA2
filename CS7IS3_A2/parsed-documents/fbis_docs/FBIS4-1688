A Foreign Ministry spokesman of the DPRK today said that the DPRK's nuclear issue "is not at all an issue to be discussed by the Security Council," the official newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" reported. The statement is a product of the U.S. policy of being hostile to the DPRK and strangling the country, he said, adding that the United States has "taken advantage of the UN Security council" to bring pressure to bear upon the DPRK. In a statement issued in New York on March 31, President of the UN Security Council Jean-Bernard Merimee urged the DPRK to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to complete its inspection of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities. The spokesman said the statement has seriously violated the purposes and principles of the UN Charter because the Security Council discussed the DPRK's nuclear issue just after the IAEA had made "an improper and biased" conclusion of its inspection. He stressed that since his country is now at the temporary stage of not pulling out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it is "totally unreasonable" for the DPRK to undergo an additional inspection. He warned that if the United States continues to break its promises and bring pressure to bear upon the DPRK, the country will have to resume the "peaceful nuclear activities" which it had ceased unilaterally during the DPRK-U.S. talks. The DPRK has been taking the stand of peacefully solving the nuclear issue and any pressure exerted on the country will surely end in failure, he said.
