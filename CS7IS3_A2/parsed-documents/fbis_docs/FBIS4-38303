Are you moving in this direction? [Muhammad] We feel that Sanaa has wasted the time of the UN envoy and made Lakhdar Brahimi believe that it will accept a cease-fire and respond to his efforts. The UN envoy, who became certain that Sanaa continuously lies, will submit his report to the UN secretary general. We are waiting for the Security Council to take deterrent measures against those refusing to implement its resolutions. We are not only exerting efforts with our brothers in the Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula, but also with all Arab brothers and countries in the world to make them recognize the old situation and the old entity. The four-year old unity failed to merge it [with northern Yemen]. All merging efforts have failed. This requires new acknowledgement of the existing situation -- North and South. [Ahmad] There were Egyptian-Emirian and Saudi initiatives to contain the Yemeni crisis from the beginning. What is your assessment of these initiatives and of the statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] regarding the crisis? [Muhammad] We welcomed all these mediations before and during the war and interacted with them out of our desire to save Yemen from the military option. However, Sanaa did not respond to these Egyptian and Gulf initiatives and efforts and refused to deal with them. Therefore, we expect our Arab brothers to support the victim of injustice. God willing, we will see this coming. Regarding the GCC statement, the brothers tried their best to stick to reason and dialogue. Sanaa, however, ignored all this. We, on our part, ask the brothers in the Gulf states, and in the Arab states in general, to recognize us expeditiously regardless of the military situation, because we are the owners of rights and cause. We have a right to make our own decisions and refuse to see tanks, a tribal chieftain, or al-Zindani [member of the Yemeni Presidential Council] deciding our fate. [Ahmad] Has the military situation, which is almost settled in favor of the North, affected Arab and international recognition of Yemen? [Muhammad] Undoubtedly, this is true. Even if we move to Socotra Island we will never give up. We will continue resistance regardless of the military situation in any governorate. The situation on the ground is not very bad. Sanaa's attempts to end the war in three days failed and the war has been going for more than six weeks. We will continue resistance and make others admit the realities on the ground. [Ahmad] How do you view the American stand, and the western stand in general, vis-a-vis the crisis? [Muhammad] The U.S. stand is in harmony with its steps. Certainly, the coming days will reveal the exemplary end of this role, because we are certain that the Americans, Europeans, and the Arab brothers cannot allow a small Saddam to appear south of the Arabian Peninsula. [Ahmad] What is your assessment of the Egyptian stand vis-a-vis the Yemeni crisis? [Muhammad] Egypt is concerned about the situation in Yemen on the historical, geographical, political, security, and military levels. Therefore, it must have a role in the crisis. I believe there is an Egyptian role, but it takes into consideration certain internal and external factors. Egypt is dealing with the situation in a mature and wise way. However, we feel that the situation in Yemen is serious, and I do not believe that Egypt will accept a fundamentalist government in Yemen or want to see Bab el Mandeb and the Red Sea under the control of two fundamentalist states (Yemen and Sudan). I believe Egypt is aware of this. Hence, we depend on the Egyptian role and warn of the dangers of what is taking place in Yemen. This is despite the fact that we are victims of studying the situation thoroughly.
