Here is our comment on the issue: The most important event in the Vietnamese-European Community is the official visit by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to some EC countries in early July 1993, since the two sides had established diplomatic relations in October 1990. On this occasion, the Vietnamese prime minister had talks with Chairman Jacques Delors, and two vice chairmen of the EC. The two sides agreed to promote bilateral relations to a new stage. The EC chairman was interested in the socioeconomic situation in Vietnam and its diplomatic policy which help improve relations among nations in the regions and held that Vietnam has followed a correct political policy. Chairman Jacques Delors committed to create favorable conditions for Vietnam to broaden its relations with the EC member countries. For their part, the EC member countries also promised to encourage their group to do business with Vietnam. The two vice chairmen also held that the visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet was on time and believed that the Vietnam-EC relation will be further developed in the future. Before 1990, the EC had provided Vietnam with neccessary aid worth of $110 million, (mainly with flour). In 1992, Vietnam and the EC signed a contract to manufacture 106 items of textile products. The contract had been implemented since early 1993. However, due to the lack of technical equipment, Vietnam was able to hand over to the EC 54 items of goods. The two-way trade between Vietnam and the EC was estimated at $530 million, but Vietnam's export was only $224 million. The EC also funded Vietnam's program to integrate those who left the country illegally. However, the aid provided for Vietnam by EC is still limited, and did not respond to the expectations of both sides. For this very reason, at 19 November session, the EC Parliament adopted a resolution on the EC participation in the international program on the repatriation of the Vietnamese refugees. The resolution appreciated the results of the program which was manifested by the increasing number of voluntary repatriates from 1988 to 1992. The resolution called on the EC committee to take appropriate measures to complete the program on time, and called on its member countries to fulfill their commitments. The resolution held that the program result can only be sustainable with the help for Vietnam to promote socioeconomic situation. Vietnam needs to have (multiple) aid granted by EC for developing countries. The resolution called on the EC committee to carry out a large scale cooperation program with Vietnam. The resolution also advocated further talks for the signing of a framework agreement on economic and trade agreement with Vietnam in this year, [words indistinct] of the representation of Vietnam, following the signing the agreement. These activities are in conformity with the statement by EC Chairman Jacques Delors at the first meeting with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, that let's start a new stage for the future.
