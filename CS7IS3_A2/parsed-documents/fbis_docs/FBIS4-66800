FBIS4-66800 "jpnea027___94041" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 31 March 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Modifications to Export-Import Policy Told Modifications to Export-Import Policy Told 94AS0268H Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 31 Mar 94 pp 1, 13 94AS0268H Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] New Delhi, March 30--Expanded list of imports under the Special Import Licence (SIL) covering a host of items, introduction of a new category of super star trading houses, simplification of duty exemption scheme and continuation of value-based advance licensing (VBAL) with some safeguards are the salient points of the important changes in the export-import (Exim) policy, reports PTI. The modifications announced to the 1992-97 Exim policy by the Union commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, in Lok Sabha today, also paid special attention to the simplification and streamlining of the procedural aspects of the Exim policy. To make the SIL financially more attractive, a number of items relating to healthcare, sports, communication and office equipment, some consumer goods/consumer durables not reserved for SSI [Small-Scale Industry] units and spares and components are being permitted under the modified policy. All existing valid licences and the ones issued hereafter will be eligible for import of these items of payment of normal custom duty. For import of second-hand machinery, the condition of maximum seven years of age as well as submission of chartered engineer certificate has been dispensed with. The commerce minister said the important changes being announced in the Exim policy take effect from today. For deemed exports, the policy is designed to strengthen industrial base by offering more facilities to indigenous manufacturers. The duty-free licence holders would be able to source their goods from local manufacturers instead of importing the same with an added advantage of deemed export benefits. The facility of advance release order has been extended to special imprest licences, advance intermediate licences, transferred advance licences and sensitive list items in terms of value. The powers to grant export promotion capital goods (EPCG) licence, currently centralised in the office of the director general of foreign trade, is centralised, Mr Mukherjee said. Regional officers can now permit imports up to Rs 25 [rupees] lakhs. For 100 percent export-oriented units (EOUs) export processing zone sector, their areas of activity have been broadened by providing for trading, re-export after repacking and labelling and also repairs, reconditioning and re-engineering. The requirement of prior approval of development commissioner of EPZs [Export Processing Zone] for inter-unit transfer has been dispensed with. EOUs/EPZ units debonding modalities have been liberalised and procedures for third party exports by these units have been further simplified. The new policy also has taken away some components required for the manufacture of finished products in the electronic industry. Fishermen can now import outboard motors freely. Relaxation has been provided for the import of prototypes/samples for product development. For the import and export of items which are not covered by the negative lists of exports and imports, the restriction of value addition, which was acting as an irritant has been removed. Under the special import licence, the minister said the fillip provided to the exporters by SIL was not serving the desired objective as the premium on these freely tradable SILs has dropped to very low levels due to general import liberalisation. As such, it has been decided to render the SILs more attractive by including a host of items. However, gold and silver will now be importable against SIL on concessional rate payment of customs duty in foreign exchange, as applicable to incoming passengers, by the holders of EEFC [expansion not given] account. On VBAL, the minister said a marginal misuse by unscrupulous elements should not be allowed to create hardships for the larger number of genuine exporters. As such, he said the scheme is being continued with safeguards. Procedures have been simplified under the duty exemption scheme. Minimum value addition under the advance customs clearance permit has been reduced from 15 to 10 percent. Third party exports under the scheme will now be permitted. Four zonal licensing committees have been set up at Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras with a view to rendering quick, efficient service and they will permit licences up to Rs one crore in respect of cases where norms have not yet been fixed. Revalidation and export obligation procedures under VBAL scheme have been further streamlined by permitting regional offices to allow extension up to 12 months. Input-output norms have now been finalised for 3,383 items as against 2,200 on March 31, 1993. For Small Scale Industry (SSI), it is permitted to increase their capacity by way of investment inplant and equipment beyond Rs 75 lakhs, provided they undertake a minimum export obligation of 75 percent of their annual production. In a bid to ensure cost effectiveness and in order to make the life of exporters less bothersome, legal undertaking (LUT) has been further rationalised. LUT limit granted to export houses/trading houses/star trading houses which was three times of the last year's exports, will now be five times and in respect of other exporters, LUT limit has been enhanced two times from one-and-a-half times permitted earlier. Unlimited LUT facility has now been extended to super star trading houses. Exporters under advance licence scheme can now give the bank guarantee in two parts in respect of licences issued for a value of one crore of rupees and above. In other cases, they can replace their original bank guarantee with a reduced value after completing 50 percent of exports. The requirement of supporting manufacturer to be indicated in the DEEC [expansion not given] book has been dispensed with. Handicapped persons can now import cars fitted with special controls. Items relating to computerised braille printing presses, text reading system for visually handicapped, spherical lenses of magnification like spectacle magnifier, hand held magnifier and table magnifier will now be permitted to be imported freely. Artificial limbs for physically handicapped and disabled and frequently modulated hearing aid systems for hearing impaired persons in group situation will also be freely imported, Mr Mukherjee said. Explaining the details of the new category of super star trading houses, the minister said all those exporters with trade turnover of Rs 750 crores average free on board (FoB) during the preceding three licensing years of Rs 1,000 crores during the preceding year are eligible to become the super star trading houses. Such houses, he said, would be entitled to the membership of apex consultative bodies concerned with trade policy and promotion, representation in important business delegations, special permission for overseas trading and special import licences at enhanced rate.
