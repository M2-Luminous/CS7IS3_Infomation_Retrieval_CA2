According to the newspaper EXPRESO, National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) agents on 11 April found a trail leading to "Feliciano" when they raided a house in Lima's Callao Port where Red Path leaders held meetings. Five people were arrested in the raid and in addition Dincote agents seized guns and propaganda implicating the so-called Red Path "Central Committee" and the "Lima Metropolitan Committee" headed by Ramirez Durand. EXPRESO reported that according to a Dincote spokesperson, it is known that Feliciano is in Lima with some of his main lieutenants and that Dincote is following his footsteps. In the last two weeks, Dincote has arrested in Lima more than 20 Red Path terrorists, some of whom, it seems, have supplied information that will lead to the arrest of their main leaders.
