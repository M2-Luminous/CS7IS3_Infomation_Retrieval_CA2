The cash in the market was returned to the banking institutions in the amount of 210.7 billion won and 42.3 billion on 13 and 14 June respectively, thus decreasing the cash currency rate from 9.2 percent to 9 percent last week. With the recovery of the stock market, the financial market returned to a normal track. The stock market, which plummeted as much as 32.3 point for two days on 14 and 15 June as the general public investors massively dumped their stocks, rebounded on 16 June as the institutional investors bought stocks heavily as soon as the stock market opened that day. The composite stock exchange index increased by 10.16 points to 901.08 points. The recovery came as the authorities tried hard to assuage people's worries which abated considerably upon hearing of the one-month grace period which would be applicable to sanctions the United Nations may take against North Korea. The report on the government plan to ease restrictions on the stock market, such as the release of future deal items for the stock exchange index and the abolition of the institutional investors' deposit, also contributed to a recovery with the blue chips taking the lead. The stock experts say that although general public investors are not yet completely relieved of their worries, institutional and foreign investors are actively buying stock, and therefore, the strength to support the stock market seems to be sufficient. The currency in the market is following the pattern of "supply on weekend and returning at the start of the week." On 10 June, 470 billion won was issued for soldiers' salaries and 70 billion won went into the market fund for the weekend, but 273 billion won returned to the banking institutions for two days on 13 and 14 June. This is an amount larger than the 264.4 billion won that returned on 7 and 8 June after the 5-6 June holiday. On 14 June, 771.6 billion won--566.3 billion won of demand deposit, 205.3 billion of savings deposit--returned to the banking institutions. This is an amount similar to that returning under ordinary circumstances. Therefore, the cash issuance decreased to 12.6 billion won and 42.3 billion won on 14 and 15 June respectively. The price of gold remained the same 41,200 won per Korean ton (3.7565 grams) since 10 June. Only the black market dollar price rose from 820 won to 835 won per dollar on 14 June, but it remained static on 15 June.
