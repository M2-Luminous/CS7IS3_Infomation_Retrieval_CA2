L."-initialed report: "The President -- One for All"] [Text] It was Herbert Wehner who once said mockingly before a presidential election that the Germans would prefer to have a Bishop Dr. von Hindenburg as president. These expectations -- both comprehensive and contradictory -- have obviously not changed, if one looks at our latest poll on the elections. According to this poll, the president should get involved more in active policy (64 percent), should basically make the interests of everyone a guideline of his actions (71 percent), primarily try to come to an understanding on contentious issues (68 percent), and, above all, tackle issues that affect the future (69 percent). In eastern Germany the percentages are generally higher than in the west: As many as 78 percent of the eastern Germans hope for more involvement in active policy. The idealized expectations placed on a head of state can be interpreted as quite definite expectations on political integration, which is carried out less and less by the parliamentary mechanisms for quarrel and decisionmaking. In addition, these high-flown claims are also a reflex reaction to a certain "disenchantment with politics." And, of course, they are a response to the extremely ambitious and extremely satisfying way in which Richard von Weizsaecker has fulfilled his office. No wonder that the majority of the voters advocate a direct election of the president: A total of 80 percent of all Germans want to elect the person on whom they place their highest expectations, themselves. The eastern Germans are once again more eager for integration: 91 percent demand direct elections, compared with 77 percent in the west. The question in connection with constitutional policy, namely whether such a mode of election would conform with the architecture of the office as laid down in the Basic Law, naturally does not appear in such polls. Regarding the forthcoming election of Richard von Weizsaecker's successor, all this results in tension between the citizens' expectations and the parties' game for power. Basically, the Germans want to vote themselves -- and if they could do that, the majority would vote for Johannes Rau. If four candidates are involved, Rau is ahead with 36 percent, followed by Roman Herzog with 22 percent, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher with 14 percent, and Jens Reich with 5 percent. If the election is narrowed down to two candidates -- Rau or Herzog -- Rau gains an additional 18 percentage points and gets 54 percent; Herzog, on the other hand, only gets an additional 8 percent and manages to get 30 percent; in the east Rau would get 69 percent. Certainly, the Basic Law deliberately did not make the office of president subject to popular vote. However, if Roman Herzog were elected because of the all too obvious considerations of party and coalition policy, this time clear tension would arise between the mood in the population -- as regards the person and the political process -- and the institutional mechanics. However, some other observations are quite remarkable. First: The voters are clearly turning away -- at least for the presidential elections -- from the targets of the coalition and party machinery; however, by doing that, the majority of them come out in favor of a politician who has long worked in the establishment; the offer of a candidate who is removed from the parties did not catch on. Second: The slogan that an eastern German must become president did not catch on, either; even in the new laender only 12 percent are in favor of eastern German candidate Jens Reich -- 3.5 times as many vote for Rau. Third: Even though during the initial period of the election campaign the Social Democrats -- and Rau in particular -- were accused, also by Chancellor Kohl, of having betrayed Germany's unity before 1989, in direct comparison 69 percent of the eastern Germans vote for Social Democrat Rau -- more than 3.5 times as many as for Herzog (19 Percent). All this refutation of myths also reflects a certain "social-democratization" of eastern Germany -- or the disappointment about the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and unification. When asked about the parties' power of conviction, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] gets 32 percent in the east, thus being ahead of the CDU (19 percent) -- in the west the CDU/CSU is ahead of the SPD for the first time: 26 to 25 percent. A similar picture can be seen in connection with the question about the future chancellor: In the west, Scharping got 1 percentage point more than last time, thus reaching 38 percent; Kohl is stagnating at 33 percent. The difference is not as large as it used to be, but it is not becoming smaller, either. In the east, Scharping is falling slightly behind, from 48 to 47 percent; Kohl is catching up, from 30 to 34 percent. It may be that the elections will also be decided in the east in the very last instance, but the majority of the people live in the west -- and in all new laender there are just as many voters as in North Rhine-Westphalia, the land where Johannes Rau comes from -- and where he will remain? Infratest Burke polled 1,000 voters for DIE ZEIT. Those polled were chosen through a representative sample (random procedure). The poll took place from 18 to 25 April 1994.
