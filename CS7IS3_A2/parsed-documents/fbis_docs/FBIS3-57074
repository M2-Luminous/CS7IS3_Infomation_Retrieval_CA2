The law was rejected during repeat consideration Thursday [20 January] by a 53-13 vote, with 34 abstentions. The abstentions virtually determined that the president's veto would come into effect. 71 votes were needed to approve the law repeatedly. In such case, the president's would have to sign the law and to promulgate it within three days. During debates, a majority of lawmakers said the problem of income declaration by officials should be referred to the Constitutional Court. President Algirdas Brazauskas sent the law back to the parliament for reconsideration because, in his opinion, some portions of the law contradict the constitutional principles of property inviolability and equality before the law. The law was first adopted Dec. 23 under pressure of the rightist opposition. The law set two deadlines for income declaration by officials - May 1, 1994 for property owned prior to Feb. 1, 1994 and March 1, 1995 for property acquired in 1994.
