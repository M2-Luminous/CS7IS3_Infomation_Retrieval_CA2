The meeting transmitted the guidelines of the State Council meeting on anticorruption and heard reports on the state of the anticorruption struggle launched in this region since August. The meeting also put forward specific demands for anticorruption efforts in various government departments this year. Zhou Shengtao, member of the Standing Committee of the regional party committee and secretary of the regional commission for discipline inspection; Yusufu Aisha, vice chairman of the regional government; and other leading comrades attended the meeting. Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: Since the major policy decision made by the party Central Committee last August on launching the anticorruption struggle, governments at various levels in the autonomous region have attached great importance to launching the struggle and have promptly made arrangements in line with the central guidelines. We have achieved initial good results in the anticorruption struggle. However, we must also realize that the progress of our anticorruption struggle still cannot keep up with the expectations of the broad masses. The problem of the unhealthy tendencies of various trades and professions has not been fundamentally solved, and the people are still making complaints. This shows that the anticorruption task is still very heavy, and so we must further strengthen our leadership over the task. Abulaiti Abudurexiti pointed out: We must further deepen the anticorruption work this year and grasp the work in a solid manner. First, we must continue to implement the five provisions put forward by the party Central Committee last year to ensure honesty in performing official duties by cadres at and above the county, department, and bureau level. Second, we must implement the five new provisions put forward by the party Central Committee this year. A small number of leading comrades who have not seriously carried out self-examination must take the initiative to check their own behavior this year. Those who have found irregularities but have not corrected the situation must make corrections in a prompt manner. Abulaiti Abudurexiti emphatically said: The key for leading cadres' practicing self-discipline and being honest lies in raising their consciousness. They should take lead in implementing the first and second of the five provisions put forward by the party Central Committee. They should adopt effective measures to ensure honesty in performing official duties in light of the existing problems. On the issue of investigating and handling cases of violating law and discipline, we must lay stress on investigating and handling cases of violating law and discipline by cadres of leading organs and judicial, administrative, and economic management departments. We should let the masses see that we are resolved to seriously solve the problem and realize the determination and strength of our party and government in punishing corruption. In conclusion, Abulaiti Abudurexiti asked leading cadres at various levels to carry forward the fine traditions of the party, be faithful public servants for the people, foster news customs of being honest in performing their official duties, create a good social environment, and make new contributions to accelerating the pace of reform and opening up and to promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy.
