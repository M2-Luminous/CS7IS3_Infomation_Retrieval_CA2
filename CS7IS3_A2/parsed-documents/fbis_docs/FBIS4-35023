With this move, the government expects to stop speculation on the international market and to reduce abusive prices on the domestic market. Coffee producers are apparently taking advantage of the frost that has in recent days been affecting the coffee producing regions in the states of Parana, Sao Paulo, and Minas Gerais to increase their prices. Coffee price increases have been a factor in increasing the June inflation rate. Frederico Robalinho de Barros, secretary for commercial policy at the Industry and Commerce Ministry, believes the coffee price increase could jeopardize the implementation of the real on 1 July. The New York Stock Exchange today opened with an increase of 49 cents per pound, representing a 42-percent increase compared to the price on 24 June. Coffee prices have also increased markedly at the London Stock Exchange, where on 24 June the price stood at $2,230 per tonne but today rose to $2,980 per tonne; that is, a 33- percent increase. The government has confirmed that in only three days -- 25, 26, and 27 June -- coffee exporters have requested licenses to export 1 million sacks. This is a much larger volume than what was exported for the entire month of May. Within three days, government experts will survey the affected coffee plantations to assess the damages provoked by the frost last weekend. Ailton Barcellos, executive secretary of the Industry and Commerce Ministry, said: "Preliminary assessments indicate that coffee production may have been damaged to a level of between 30 and 35 percent in Parana State." Robalinho said that losses in other regions may not go beyond 10 percent. Robalinho announced that the government will have the damage assessment reports by 4 July. Barcellos said: "When we have this data we will be able to reopen the export registries." Barcellos added that "there were an overwhelming number of export license requests during the weekend." Showing indignation, Robalinho said: "These were stupid requests." He added that "within four to five days we will have reports on the extent of the damage." Earlier, Robalinho had met with leaders of the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (Febrae). To avert abuse and speculation, the government today issued two decrees that will be published tomorrow (28 June) in the DIARIO OFICIAL DA UNIAO. The first decree temporarily suspends export licenses for soluble coffee that had been granted on the basis of the 24 June prices (Friday), and turned down all petitions submitted today to export coffee at today's prices. The second decree suspends the export of coffee beans and cancels all export licenses issued on the basis of prices prevailing on 24 and 27 June. To contain price increases on the domestic market, the government plans to sell part of its coffee buffer stock, which is estimated at 17.5 million sacks. It is estimated that the 1994-95 coffee harvest will yield 22 million sacks.
