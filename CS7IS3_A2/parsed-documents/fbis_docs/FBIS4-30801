This is what Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the peoples' assembly of the Srpska republic, stated for the SRNA news agency after the talks with the contact group for former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the French town of Talloires. According to him, during this meeting the Serbian negotiating team pointed at the harmful effects of the provision that stipulates the territorial division of 51 against 49 percent and emphasized that this cannot be discussed in advance. We believe that percentages, without taking into account the quantity and the quality of territories, mean nothing. The members of the contact group acknowledged this with understanding, Krajisnik pointed out. He added that nothing qualitative and new has been accomplished regarding the finding of a solution to the crisis. It is also characteristic of this meeting, Krajisnik specified, that the members of the contact group wanted to hear new ideas and proposals of the Serbian side to convey them to the governments of their countries. We have pointed at the problems that we have been encountering lately and the Croatian and Muslim side not being willing to accept the end of hostilities, which definitely increases tensions on the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik emphasized and added: We are encouraged by the fact that the contact group has acknowledged our view that the most important task is to end hostilities. The group has promised to mediate for as quick as possible establishment of peace with the Muslims and the Croats. In the opinion of the chairman of the assembly of the Srpska republic, the meeting in Talloires can under no circumstance be called negotiations, bearing in mind the platform of the peoples' assembly of the Srpska republic according to which there can be no continuation of the talks until the Serbian side has received an equal treatment and the sanctions have been lifted. We will need to invest many more efforts as there is a difficult battle ahead of us before the final solution. The differences in opinions are great and, with some of their radical statements, the Muslims are making the achievement of the final agreement more remote, Krajisnik said after the talks in Talloires, SRNA reports.
