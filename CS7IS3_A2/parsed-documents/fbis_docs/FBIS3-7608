FBIS3-7608 "dreas061_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-061 Document Type:Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 North Korea `Military Provocation' by South Criticized SK3003045594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0435 GMT 30 Mar 94 SK3003045594 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Rash Act Should Be Refrained" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets held a "meeting of all the staff of the Army" on March 26 to discuss a matter concerning "immediate commitment into action in the event of contingency" and, at the same day, the puppet prime minister visited puppet army units in the frontline areas, instructing them to maintain a "full-dressed posture to provide against an event of contingency". NODONG SINMUN today says this shows that the wildcat war provocation moves of the South Korean puppets have reached a most dangerous phase. The news analyst points out: Such military provocation moves of the South Korean puppets are all the more dangerous as they are timed to coincide with the aggressive U.S. military actions against the DPRK now at a very grave stage. It has been made clearer that the "civilian government" and "unification" on the lips of the Kim Yong-sam group are no more than a smoke screen to cover up its moves for confrontation and war. The traitor Kim Yong-sam clique, clean [as received] indifferent to the destiny of the nation and busy to find a way out in its military adventure as a stooge of the aggressive imperialist reactionaries, will be under fire at home and abroad. The DPRK is ready for both dialogue and war. If the South Korean puppets ignite a war, continuing reckless military provocation moves in league with outside forces, our heroic People's Army and people will deal one thousand-fold fatal blows at them.
