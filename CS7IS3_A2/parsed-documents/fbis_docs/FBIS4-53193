Commenting about King Sihanouk's request for arms assistance from western countries and Australia to fight the Khmer Rouge, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri says Thailand will have nothing to do with that; it involves only the countries giving and receiving. However, he said, there will be no solution to the fighting if one resorts to the military option. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Has there been any request for sympathy from Australia? [Prasong] Well, it is impossible for us to say: You should not give them the weapons. That would be an interference on our part. But we can tell them that we will have nothing to do with that; it's your business whether or not you are going to give them the weapons. Anyway, we believe that a settlement of the Cambodian problem should be achieved through political not military means. [end recording]
