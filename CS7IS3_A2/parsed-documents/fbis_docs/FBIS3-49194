The same sources note that units of the regular Croatian Army and the Croatian Defense Council have for days been engaged in combat activities against the Serb side, especially in the region of Posavina. In reference to Muslim-Croat clashes, the same sources insist that the Serb side has not and will not interfere in the months-long fierce clashes between former allies. The same source also drew attention to an increase in the number of helicopter flights to the Muslim enclaves of Zepa and Srebrenica by the so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite the existing ban. As stressed by the Srpska army sources, the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] Command is well aware of this, especially as blue helmet units are deployed in these enclaves. The Serb side has already warned UNPROFOR Command of this but there has been no appropriate reaction. VSR antiaircraft defense units will therefore in the future take measure to prevent all Muslim helicopter flights contravening the flight ban, the high-ranking VSR sources warned.
