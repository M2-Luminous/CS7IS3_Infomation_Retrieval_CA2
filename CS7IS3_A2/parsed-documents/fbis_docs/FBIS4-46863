Ruslan Bodelan, Chairman of the Odessa Oblast Council and People's Deputy of Ukraine, Shares His Thoughts on This Problem"] [Text] [Bodelan] First of all, regions should participate in a direct and full-fledged manner in drawing up such local budgets as would meet all the urgent problems of territories. This is a mandatory condition, because to this day there are so many dictates and abuses and so many violations of legislation in effect by the central structures in this area that oblasts, cities, and rayons face extremely difficult situations time after time. The last session was also compelled to adopt an address to the president, the chairman of the Supreme Council, and the Government of Ukraine proposing that they immediately take measures in order to ameliorate the financial situation in the oblast, which the deputies considered critical. After all, the banks withhold all of the revenues of local budgets without recourse toward the payment of their debt to the state budget. The latter is drawn up in keeping with norms which in no way take into account the needs of territories and in essence push them across the disaster line. This is how it happens that the debt of some rural and rayon budgets exceeds the planned annual level of revenues. Besides, the state structures force local organs to finance a number of outlays that are not properly theirs, and later do not defray the losses. At the same time, outlays on the maintenance of enterprises owned by the state are not funded from the state budget. These enterprises fail to settle with the energy supplier enterprises: The debt of the state budget to such enterprises has already exceeded 500 billion karbovantsy in our oblast. Delays in the payment of wages to the employees of organizations have become more frequent; hospitals have no funds in order to feed the patients; and many other troubles have developed. Here are all the "attractions" of excessive centralization for you. Thus, in addition to taking a number of prompt measures, the oblast council, which is extremely alarmed by this situation, proposed to the structures of authority of the country to leave at the disposal of local budgets all receipts from the tax on the income of citizens and proceeds from the privatization of municipally owned facilities, as well as no less than 30 percent of the proceeds from the privatization of state-owned facilities. We expect the new parliament to accommodate the territories in consolidating their financial standing. I think that regions should have more extensive rights in setting quotas and issuing licenses for products that are exported from their territories, as well as in importing products from neighboring countries. Here is a specific example for you. It was long the case that a lot of vegetables, fruits, and berries were shipped to the Odessa region from neighboring Moldova for processing at the local enterprises. Some of the finished product was retained by us, the oblast and Ukraine; some was returned to the suppliers of raw materials to meet their needs. Everybody was happy. Insurmountable obstacles have now arisen in the path of such mutually advantageous relations, and everything has come to a halt. No, we are not at all against borderland and customs rules applying in our state, but they should take into account the specifics of relations and the feasibility of bans or excessively high customs duties. What happens otherwise? Ukraine fails to receive a considerable quantity of canned products; we are forced to reduce production or altogether close down processing enterprises, laying people off. All of this could be avoided if regions had an opportunity to regulate such contacts. In a word, if we want to create an effective structure of government in the territory of the state, the new Supreme Council should adopt without delay an appropriate law which would clearly set forth the powers of councils at all levels and endow regions with real rights. [Vorotnyuk] As a people's deputy of Ukraine, are you personally prepared to introduce some specific proposals in conjunction with this? [Bodelan] They have actually already been developed before, and have been introduced in the "old" parliament. A special working group of our oblast council is currently carrying on such work so that the people's deputies from Odessa will be able to promptly submit an appropriate draft law, to be considered by the Supreme Council. [Vorotnyuk] Understandably, the draft law would apply equally to all regions of Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Odessa area has its peculiarities; the oblast council raised a number of issues that are strictly its own before the structures of authority of the country. In particular, I mean proposals for conducting an economic-legal experiment in the oblast and creating free economic zones. Have there been any genuine results in this matter? [Bodelan] The Presidium of the Supreme Council has considered our proposals for conducting an experiment that would grant to the region additional economic rights and in principle approved them. The proposals have been referred to the Cabinet of Ministers for the latter to state its point of view. In the meantime, legislative acts have already been passed which take into account some of these proposals of ours. It is possible that decisions of the new parliament and government concerning the rights of regions will altogether remove the issue of conducting the experiment from the agenda. If they do not, we expect that in the future, meeting our requirements with regard to one oblast, Odessa Oblast, will provide an opportunity to ascertain the effectiveness of what we propose and to extend its effect to other regions. Now about the free economic zone. Some believe that there is too much talk about it, and too little action. A certain lack of coordination was indeed a factor at the first stage. Individual enthusiastic leaders got the-bigger-the-better "disease": They wanted all of Odessa, and adjacent territories to boot, to be a free economic zone. Only after the Cabinet of Ministers set up a special committee to develop the Odessa special economic zone (I was appointed to head it) and after this committee began operations did everything come within a realistic framework. With the use of prominent foreign specialists, we are completing the development of a draft law on the special economic zone, which we are certain the government will submit to the Supreme Council for consideration. It is based on setting up five local zones in comparatively small territories: in the Odessa, Ilyichevsk, Southern, and Izmail ports, and at a 200-hectare site in the vicinity of Odessa where the creation of an industrial zone is conceivable. This concept has already gained the support of the government. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development took a positive stance regarding it; it has resolved to provide assistance with investment in certain projects in the free economic zone. I believe that following the passage of the law, we will succeed in drawing not only domestic but also foreign investors into the creation of free economic zones. It is just that, once again, the oblast council should have the appropriate authority to do so. [Vorotnyuk] Well, does the oblast council intend to run the free economic zone? [Bodelan] Not directly. However, we propose to set up, under the oblast council, a coordinating council which, while reporting to both our oblast Council of People's Deputies and the Cabinet of Ministers (in line with the authority of both of these organs), would facilitate the emergence of the free economic zones, help them to establish relations with investors and among themselves, and finally be the transmission element between the local organs of power and the administrations of the free economic zones. Such a structure will possibly operate only at the first stage, and later it will be replaced by a more feasible one. Therefore, my firm conviction is as follows: While preserving and strengthening the most significant elements of centralization, we should simultaneously create the most favorable conditions for the development of territories by granting to them additional rights and powers. I am certain that by thus playing, so to say, a duet, we will dispense faster with the critical phenomena that are now besetting us.
