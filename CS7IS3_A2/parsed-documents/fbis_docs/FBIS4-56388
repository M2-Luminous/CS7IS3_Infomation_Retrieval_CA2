This is in connection with the campaign that EL UNIVERSAL, SIEMPRE!, and IMPACTO are conducting to lay the blame for the armed uprising in the Chiapas Highlands on Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal. The article says that Father Otilio Lopez Lopez said that several priests from the diocese of San Cristobal left because they disagreed with Bishop Ruiz's pastoral line. Among the priests it mentions are Oscar Macias, Jose Reyes Rangel, Aurelio Zapata, and Pedro Ramuco. I disagree completely with Otilio; his assertion is false and deceitful. I am Father Oscar Macias. I worked in the northern area of the Chiapas Highlands from 1962 to 1983. I did my work in Yajalon, Tila, Tumbala, Salto de Agua, and a bit in Sabanilla: five municipalities, one of them Tzeltal and four Chol. I spent 15 of those years, up to 1983, in the Tila parish working with my Chol brothers. I performed my work in full support of the pastoral line that we and Don Samuel were pursuing in the diocese. The reason for my leaving the diocese and the parish was totally and exclusively personal. I had fathered a child and gotten married; I currently live in the state of Morelos. As for the colleagues of mine whose names are mentioned, I would dare say that Don Samuel's pastoral line was not the reason for their departure. Jose Reyes Rangel (may God keep him in his Kingdom) saw his addiction to alcohol worsen and had to leave. Aurelio Zapata, who like me is from Chapa de Corzo, devoted himself generously to the peasants of Zocoltenango and suffered reprisals from the cattlemen: he was kidnapped and tortured for several days. He has recovered slowly and incompletely; he is unable to work. Pedro Ramuco was of great help to Don Samuel as vicar general of the diocese. He left because of a severe nervous breakdown caused by death threats owing to his pastoral work with the peasants. As for the three other priests that Otilio mentions, Jose Conrado Ruiz was already elderly and fell ill; Juan Inocencio Galvan was or is a traditionalist, a follower of Monsignor Le Febre; and Antonio Patino was there before Don Samuel. Elias Martinez, Bulmaro Gordillo, and Cecilio Baraibar left for personal reasons. Cecilio got married. Their work was in the seminary. Otilio Lopez himself was not the vicar of Ocosingo; he worked in the Comitan area. He did not grow in his priesthood and left it. I know from a recent report that he belongs to PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] and works in the Chiapas CNC. Congratulations. It is very easy to say that Don Samuel, as a punishment, is denying the sacraments to those who do not think like him. Couldn't the same thing be said here in Morelos? Because those who want baptism, confirmation, matrimony, first communion, and the coming-out celebration at age 15 have to attend a series of talks on the sacraments by the catechizers. Otherwise, they are not accepted. We should keep in mind that the bishop of this diocese is Monsignor Luis Reynoso, who is not like Don Samuel and presumably opposes his pastoral activity. I must emphasize that Don Samuel's pastoral activity can be none other than the gospel of Jesus, who was born and lived among, supported, helped, and opted for the poor right up to Calvary. I congratulate Don Samuel, of whom I think highly and with whom I was very pleased to work, and my colleagues in the diocese, many of whom I no longer know, for their resolute devotion to our Indian brothers. I would have liked to be with them during the events in early 1994. Yours truly, Oscar Macias
