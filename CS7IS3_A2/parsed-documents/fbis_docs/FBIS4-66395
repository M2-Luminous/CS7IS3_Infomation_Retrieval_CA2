The contract-signing ceremony for the construction of the facility took place in Chengdu on 15 April [1994]. Vice Minister Shen Chunnian of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense and Ma Lin, deputy governor of Sichuan Province were among those who attended the ceremony. The wind tunnel is an indispensable piece of ground simulation equipment for research on aircraft and space vehicles and provides aerodynamic data on these flying bodies under different speeds and flight conditions. It is possible to satisfy the requirements for aerodynamic testing of flying bodies only with a large-scale wind tunnel that provides realistic model aircraft, good flow field conditions and high measurement accuracy.
