Andrusenko, R.G. Dukov, and Yu.R. Fomin, Voyennoye izdatelstvo, Moscow, 1989, 70,000 copies, 336 pages, illustrated] [Text] Annotation This book examines the actions of a motorized rifle (tank) platoon in various types of battle based on the requirements of formal documents containing regulations, advanced experience of instruction, and the experience of the Great Patriotic War. It uses specific examples to show the work of the platoon commander for organizing combat, command and control of the platoon in battle, and organizing its all-round support. The book is intended for subunit commanders of the Ground Forces and officer candidates at military schools. Foreword Guided by Lenin's doctrine on protecting the socialist fatherland, the Communist Party and Soviet Government are tirelessly concerned with increasing in every possible way the defensive might of our homeland and further strengthening the combat readiness of its armed forces. Our country's successes in development of the economy, science, and technology have made it possible to equip all services of the armed forces and branches of troops, including the Ground Forces and their basis--motorized rifle and tank large units, units, and subunits--with the most modern armament and combat equipment and thereby sharply raise their combat capabilities. Motorized rifle and tank subunits equipped with armored fighting vehicles [BMP's], armored transport vehicles [BTR's], and tanks are able to carry out the most diverse missions in battle, reliably engage enemy personnel, tanks, BMP's, BTR's, artillery, and antitank weapons, combat enemy aircraft and helicopters, advance swiftly, and defend stubbornly. But it is still not enough to have modern armament to achieve success in battle. A decisive role here belongs to the person--the soldier--who possesses high moral-political, fighting, and psychological qualities and has mastered combat equipment and weapons and the art of organizing and waging battle in complex and diverse situation conditions. A platoon commander must be highly educated in the military-technical and tactical respect, know the combat capabilities of his subunit, and skillfully and tactically competently use them in battle. The basic purpose of this book is to help him do this. The book's material corresponds to curricula for training officer candidates of higher combined-arms and tank command schools in military disciplines. The theoretical heritage of the classics of Marxism-Leninism on military issues and the works of M.V. Frunze, M.N. Tukhachevskiy, and P.I. Batov were used in writing this book. At the basis of this work are the requirements of the Field Manual of the Ground Forces and regulations and manuals on preparing, organizing, and waging modern combined-arms battle by subunits. The authors of the book set as their task to disclose the basic questions of preparing, organizing, and waging the basic types of battle and to examine the actions of a platoon during battle in special conditions. The authors devoted primary attention to the work of the platoon commander for organizing battle, command and control of subunits in battle, the actions of a platoon in the defense, the offensive, on the march, in march security and security at the halt, and on reconnaissance. The drawings and tactical diagrams illustrating the platoon's actions in various types of modern combined-arms battle will serve to master this material better. The book is intended for subunit commanders of the Ground Forces and officer candidates at military schools. Chapter 1. Fundamentals of Modern Combined-Arms Battle 1. Essence of Modern Combined-Arms Battle Soviet military art regards battle as the basic form of tactical operations of troops, an organized armed clash between large units, units, and subunits of the warring sides which is strikes, fire, and maneuver coordinated by objective, place, and time to destroy (rout) the enemy and carry out other tactical missions in a specific area during a short interval of time. Before the appearance of firearms, hand-to-hand fighting of soldiers armed with edged weapons was the essence of battle. With the development of firearms, fire became the most important significant element of battle. It made possible confrontation of the warring sides at a distance without making direct contact (but not precluding it) and thus increasing the spatial scope of battle, which was also significant for that period of development of society and military affairs. Massive equipping of troops with automatic weapons, artillery, tanks, and aviation resulted in battlefield success being achieved through coordinated efforts of subunits, units, and large units of all branches of troops participating in it. Battle became combined-arms battle, and its spatial scope increased even more. Defeating and routing the enemy can be achieved only by powerful strikes by all types of weapons, timely exploitation of the results of their strikes, and also by aggressive and decisive actions of subunits, units, and large units of all branches of troops and special troops. Modern combined-arms battle requires skillful use of all weapons and combat and special equipment, a high degree of mobility and organization, full intensity of moral and physical forces, inflexible will for victory, iron discipline, and combat cohesiveness. This is achieved by high combat proficiency; conscientious fulfillment of one's military duty; steadfastness, bravery, courage, and readiness of personnel in any conditions to strive for total victory over the enemy; superiors' knowing their subordinates, personal contact with them, attention to their daily combat life and needs, and high exactingness towards them; instilling in subordinates faith in the rightness of our cause and devotion to the socialist homeland and the Soviet Government. Modern combined-arms battle can be waged both in conditions of using nuclear and other weapons and with using only conventional weapons. The presence of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the enemy's hands, at a high degree of readiness, requires their continuous detection and destruction by the troops and, at the same time, accomplishment of measures to protect against weapons of mass destruction and the ability to wage battle in conditions of their employment. 2. Forces and Assets of Modern Combined-Arms Battle The nature of battle and the methods of waging it depend primarily on the material basis, that is, on the armament, combat equipment, and people using these means of warfare. Based on an analysis of a large amount of historical material, F. Engels concluded: "Nothing depends on economic conditions like the army and navy. Armament, personnel, organization, tactics, and strategy depend primarily on the level of production achieved at a given moment and on means of communication. It is not the `free creativity of the mind' of genius military leaders that functioned in a revolutionizing manner here, but the acquisition of better weapons and the change in soldier material; at best, the influence of genius military leaders is limited by the fact that they are adapt the method of waging battle to the new weapons and to the new fighting men."* Means of warfare have the most revolutionizing influence on methods of combat operations. "Military tactics," noted V.I. Lenin, "depend on the level of military equipment..."** Another component part of the material basis of battle--people and their morale--also has a great influence on the change in the nature of battle and the methods of waging it. Characterizing the role of the morale factor, V.I. Lenin wrote: "In any war, victory in the final analysis is determined by the morale of the masses who shed their blood on the field of battle."*** These words of V.I. Lenin fully retain their importance in today's conditions. Despite the tremendous power and capabilities of the new weapons, people remain the fundamental principle without which any equipment, any weapons will be useless and armed conflict is simply inconceivable. The current period of development of military affairs is characterized by the appearance and rapid development of qualitatively new weapons fundamentally different from those which were used during the last war, full motorization of the army, intensive mechanization, and also an ever-increasing introduction of electronics into the troops. Nuclear weapons are the principal, most powerful weapon of the enemy. Skillful use of them makes it possible to destroy with a high degree of effectiveness and in short periods of time the enemy's weapons of mass destruction, inflict large losses on the enemy, destroy structures and other installations, create zones of radioactive contamination and areas of destruction, debris, fire, and flooding, and also exert heavy psychological pressure on the population and armed forces personnel. They are used without warning, massively, and in combination with conventional weapons. Nuclear weapons include all types of nuclear munitions and means of delivering them to targets. Massive, group, and single strikes can be delivered by nuclear weapons. Destruction of enemy installations by nuclear weapons can be accomplished by air, surface, and underground (water surface, underwater) nuclear bursts. Various types of missiles and aircraft are the primary means of delivering nuclear munitions to the targets. As the primary weapon, nuclear weapons have a decisive influence on the nature of battle and give it an exceptional decisiveness, dynamic quality, and unprecedented spatial scope. Conventional weapons comprise all fire and strike weapons using artillery, antiaircraft, aircraft, small-arms, and engineer munitions and burning mixtures. Conventional weapons can be used independently or in combination with nuclear weapons to destroy enemy manpower and combat equipment and also to demolish and destroy various installations. The dialectics of military affairs are such that in addition to the decisive importance of nuclear weapons, the role of tanks, artillery, aircraft, and other conventional weapons remains great. It is especially important to bear in mind that under certain conditions, combat operations can be conducted using only conventional weapons. Thus, the task is in modern battle to learn to how to make skillful use of the increased role of motorized rifle subunits, units, and large units, the fire and striking power of tanks, and the effectiveness of airstrikes and artillery fire. Changes in weapons and combat equipment have had a significant influence on the content, nature, and methods of waging battle. 3. Characteristics of Modern Combined-Arms Battle By characteristics we mean the important attributes and particular features which disclose the nature of battle in one or another war. The nature of battle is the sum total of general characteristics inherent to this a given battle and determining its attributes and particular features. The characteristics of battle are not unchanging; improvement of the material basis of battle also entails a change in its characteristic traits. The comparatively low level of development of weaponry during World War I predetermined the exceptional slow rate of development of battle, its limited scope, and insufficient decisiveness. Conversely, the sharp qualitative improvement in weapons during World War II and the increase in their numbers gave battle a new content and caused its high maneuverability and dynamic nature. Equipping the troops with various types of nuclear weapons and other latest combat equipment and the changes associated with this in training personnel created different conditions for combat operations and caused profound changes in the nature and methods of conducting them. Modern battle is characterized by decisiveness, high maneuverability, intensity and fluidity, rapid and abrupt changes in the situation and diversity of methods used to wage it, development of combat operations on land and in the air over a broad front and to a great depth, and conducting them at a high tempo. Decisiveness of combat operations is predetermined by the decisiveness of political goals, the acute class nature of a future war, the use of powerful modern weaponry creating all the necessary prerequisites for conducting such operations, high moral and fighting qualities of personnel of the Soviet Army, and the progressive nature of our military science. Decisiveness is manifested in the goals of battle and the methods of achieving them, in the selfless actions of the troops, their inflexible desire to carry out the combat mission fully in all types of battle and in any situation, operating with initiative and maximum persistence and perseverance. Of great importance is educating officers in the spirit of decisiveness, boldness, persistence, the ability to carry out to the end, irrevocably and without hesitation, the decision to crush the enemy, willing to assume responsibility for demonstrated initiative and to use every opportunity to carry out the combat mission. Indecisiveness and passiveness in battle lead to defeat. Further qualitative development of weapons and combat equipment will increase even more the decisiveness of battle and the requirements for training of personnel of subunits, units, and large units. High maneuverability of modern battle is the result of the use of powerful weaponry and a sharp increase in the mobility of combined-arms subunits, units, and large units due to their complete motorization, their being equipped with highly mobile combat equipment, and also the lack of a continuous front in the defense and in an offensive. Modern weapons make it possible to inflict heavy losses on the enemy, and the high mobility of troops makes it possible to utilize quickly the results of nuclear and fire strikes, attack the enemy on the move and advance swiftly into the depth, and accomplish maneuver with various goals in short periods of time. In the past, maneuver of troops was usually limited to their relocation to occupy a favorable position with respect to the enemy to make strikes. Today, maneuver is also used for troops to utilize in a timely manner the results of nuclear and fire strikes, quickly shift efforts to the depth or to a new axis, negotiate zones of radioactive contamination and areas of debris, flooding, and fires, withdraw troops from under enemy nuclear strikes, and replace units and subunits suffering large losses and losing combat effectiveness. Intensity of combat operations is the result of the aspiration and ability of potential enemies to conduct aggressive combat operations with decisive goals. In these conditions, achieving victory in battle will require our troops to have high combat proficiency and moral-psychological training, skillful actions, and maximum intensity of physical and spiritual strengths. Fluidity of battle is caused by the might of modern weapons, their speed, and ability in a short period of time to inflict a decisive damage on the enemy, attack swiftly on the move and complete the rout of the enemy following nuclear and fire strikes, and exploit success into the depth at a high tempo. In conditions of fluid combat operations, the struggle to gain time and the ability of officers to assess the situation quickly and assign missions based on good tactical training and sound skills in command and control become more important than ever before. Rapid and abrupt changes in the situation are a new characteristic of modern combined-arms battle. The rapidness of the change in the situation is determined by the short time during which significant changes take place in the positions, condition, and nature of troop operations. It depends on the ability of modern weapons to suppress or destroy certain enemy targets in a minimum amount of time and also on the speed of troop movement. The abruptness of the change in the situation is expressed in the radical qualitative change in the disposition of friendly and enemy troops, the correlation of forces and assets, and the radiation and chemical situation, the rapid approach of the reserve, the drop of an assault force, the making of powerful surprise strikes by combat helicopters, and, as a result, in the abrupt change in methods of operations and in the shift from one type of battle to another. In the past, when there were continuous fronts and close contact between subunits, battle developed evenly from one line to another, particularly when breaking through an enemy defense. A change in the correlation of forces and assets took considerable time. In modern battle, both sides' use of powerful weapons, the high mobility of troops, and their great fire and hitting power lead to a radical change in the situation not only in hours but in minutes, and when nuclear weapons are used--even in seconds. The increase in the speed of effect and power of weapons, particularly neutron and laser weapons, and also the mobility of troops will also increase the importance of this characteristic of battle in the future. This makes it necessary to train troops to carry out any combat mission under conditions of extremely rapid and abrupt changes in the situation and train commanders to be able to react quickly and competently to these changes, demonstrating decisiveness, initiative, creativity, and independence. Diversity of methods used to wage battle is a characteristic resulting from the high dynamic and fluid nature, diversity of the situation conditions, rapid and abrupt changes in the situation, the possibility of shifting from one weapon to another, rapid changing in the types of combat operations, and also the sharp increase in the combat capabilities of troops and the great diversity of their weapons and the missions being carried out during battle. The lack or limited effect of the above factors in wars of the past resulted in the theoretical elaboration of only a few methods of waging battle. In one battle or another, subunits, units, and large units chose, as a rule, one of the methods, which rarely changed during the course of carrying out the mission. For victory over the enemy today, a commander must have the skill of using the entire diversity of methods of waging battle. By method of waging battle we mean a variant of employing forces and assets to defeat the enemy and achieve the set goals. As historical experience shows, methods of waging battle continuously change and improve as its material basis develops. They also depend on the missions assigned to the troops, the conditions of carrying them out, the capabilities of the troops, the composition and nature of actions of the enemy, and terrain characteristics. The great diversity of missions being carried out by subunits, units, and large units and of the weapons they use and the diverse nature of enemy actions and of terrain conditions result in the fact that methods of modern combined-arms battle will be quite diverse. In a defense, the basic methods of waging battle are: engaging the main enemy grouping during the process of its advance and deployment for an offensive by using surprise nuclear strikes, airstrikes, and artillery strikes; repelling attacks by enemy tanks, motorized infantry, and airmobile troops by using the fire of all ground and air forces and assets in front of the forward edge of the battle area; and stubborn holding of the most important areas in the depth combined with conducting counterattacks. An offensive with the use of nuclear weapons is accomplished by inflicting decisive damage on the enemy with nuclear strikes, delivery of conventional strikes, and the swift advance of subunits, units, and large units following these strikes to complete the rout of the enemy and seize vitally important areas (installations). In an offensive using conventional weapons, the necessary degree of damage to the enemy can be achieved only on a narrow sector of the front. Therefore, the following must be at the basis of the methods of the offensive in these conditions: massed use of weapons and aviation on a narrow front; breakthrough of the defenses on this sector by motorized rifle and tank subunits; exploitation of success into the depth and towards the flanks; encirclement and destruction of the main body of the enemy's defending forces in coordination with adjacent subunits. Development of combat operations on land and in the air over a broad front and to a great depth, and conducting them at a high tempo is the result of the increase in combat capabilities of troops and the maximum range of weapons. This has resulted in a considerable expansion of the spatial boundaries of battle and an increase in its tempo. For example, before new models of small arms and BMP's (BTR's) entered service in the motorized rifle platoon and new models of tanks entered service in the tank platoon, a platoon could advance on a front up to 200 meters wide and defend a strongpoint up to 300 meters across the front and up to 200 meters deep. A platoon's capabilities increased sharply when they were equipped with new weapons and equipment. According to contemporary views, a platoon is able to attack a defending enemy successfully on a front up to 300 meters wide and defend a strongpoint up to 400 meters across the front and up to 300 meters deep. In the future, with an increase in the firing range of artillery and the development of aviation, the spatial boundaries of battle will continue to increase in depth. At the same time, a similar development of our potential enemies' means of waging battle and an increase in the combat capabilities of their troops will not make it possible to increase substantially the width of the front of advance and defense of our subunits, units, and large units. 4. Basic Principles of Modern Combined-Arms Battle Principles of combined-arms battle--these are the basic guiding tenets and the most important recommendations for organizing and waging battle as a whole. The principles are the fundamental base for a platoon commander's creativity for his making the correct decision. At the same time, they are not the decision itself, for in such a case they may be turned into a predictable pattern and unsound recipes for victory. They must not be examined isolated from one another. To achieve success in battle, a platoon commander must skillfully use all the principles, taking into account the situation at hand. The basic principles of waging modern combined-arms battle are: constant high combat readiness of the subunit; a high degree of aggressiveness, decisiveness, and continuity of waging battle; surprise of actions; maintaining continuous coordination in battle; decisive concentration of the main efforts on the main axis and at the necessary time; maneuver of forces, assets, and fire; consideration and use of the moral-political and psychological factors in the interests of carrying out the assigned mission; all-round support of battle; maintaining and timely restoration of the platoon's combat effectiveness; firm and continuous command and control of the platoon; inflexibility in achieving the planned goals; carrying out decisions made and assigned missions. Constant high combat readiness for carrying out the combat mission is achieved through correct understanding of one's mission, excellent combat proficiency of all personnel, and their readiness for operations in conditions of the enemy using weapons of mass destruction; a high political-moral state, discipline, and vigilance of personnel; manning and supplying the platoon with everything necessary for waging battle; constant readiness of weapons and combat equipment for immediate use and readiness of personnel for carrying out assigned missions; skillful command and control and accomplishment of combat support measures. A high degree of aggressiveness, decisiveness, and continuity of waging battle involve the constant striving for a complete rout of the enemy. The platoon commander's decision to crush the enemy must be firm and carried out to the end without hesitation. The platoon commander must instill this determination in his subordinates and constantly train them for successful accomplishment of combat missions. This is achieved by: thorough knowledge of the enemy; seizing and holding the initiative; boldness, daring, persistence, and perseverance of personnel in carrying out combat missions; quick utilization of the results of nuclear and conventional engagement of the enemy and also the results of fire from the platoon's own weapons; skillful crossing or bypassing of obstacles, zones of contamination, and areas of destruction, fires, and flooding; waging battle in the day, night, and in any kind of weather; combat support; timely replenishment of expended ammunition, fuel, and other supplies, as well as servicing and maintenance of armament and combat equipment. Surprise of actions involves using techniques, methods, and weapons the enemy does not expect. It makes it possible to catch the enemy unawares, cause panic in his ranks, paralyze his will to resist, sharply reduce combat effectiveness, disrupt command and control, and thereby create conditions for defeating even superior enemy forces. Surprise can be achieved by non-stereotyped use of available combat equipment and armament; keeping the scenario of the upcoming battle and preparations for it secret; misleading the enemy with respect to our intentions; secrecy in bringing the subunit to combat readiness and reducing the time period for preparing for battle; striking the enemy where he does not expect it; beating the enemy to the punch in actions; skillful maneuver of fire, forces, and assets; and strict accomplishment of camouflage measures and secrecy. Maintaining continuous coordination between squads (tanks) in the platoon and attached assets involves coordinating their efforts by missions, lines, and time. In organizing coordination, the platoon commander must thoroughly know the combat mission of his subunit and the methods of carrying it out, the missions of adjacent subunits, reference points, and warning, control, and coordinating signals established by the senior commander, and have communications in the platoon and with adjacent subunits. The platoon commander determines the coordination procedures when making the decision and gives instructions on coordination after assigning the combat mission. Coordination is organized and maintained throughout the battle. Decisive concentration of main efforts on the main axis and at the necessary time enables the platoon commander to achieve superiority over the enemy or successfully oppose numerically superior enemy forces, make most effective use of available forces and assets, and place the enemy in an unfavorable situation. Maneuver of forces, assets, and fire is an important component part of battle. It makes it possible to seize and hold the initiative, foil the plans of the enemy, and successfully wage battle in a changing situation. Maneuver of forces and assets is accomplished in order to occupy a favorable position for firing against the enemy's most vulnerable spot or for attacking him in the flank and rear. The types of maneuver of forces and assets are close envelopment, wide envelopment, a combination of them, and withdrawal (diagram 1). Close envelopment is a type of maneuver accomplished to break out to attack the enemy's flank. It is done usually in close fire and tactical coordination with subunits operating from the front. Diagram 1: Types of Maneuver by Subunits in Battle Wide envelopment is a deeper maneuver executed to break out to attack the enemy from the rear. As a rule, it is accomplished only in tactical coordination with subunits operating from the front. Withdrawal is primarily a forced type of maneuver used to pull friendly troops out from under an enemy attack and occupy a more favorable position with respect to the enemy. It is conducted only with permission of the senior commander. A maneuver should be simple in concept and be conducted quickly, secretly, and suddenly for the enemy. Speed of maneuver is achieved by organizing it in a short period of time, high speed of movement of subunits, and crossing various barriers and obstacles on the move. Maneuvering of fire involves concentrating the platoon's fire against one important target, timely shifting of fire from one target to another, and simultaneous firing by the platoon against several targets (Figure 1). Figure 1. Types of Maneuver by Fire [CO--Concentrated Fire; MCO--Motorized Rifle Consideration and use of the moral-political and psychological factors in the interests of carrying out the assigned mission are an important condition of achieving success in battle. This is achieved by always having a thorough knowledge of the political-moral and psychological state of platoon personnel, organizing and conducting active political work to strengthen it; systematic study of the enemy's moral-political qualities; revealing his strong and weak points; and actively countering his ideological subversions and propaganda. All-round combat support involves organizing and accomplishing measures aimed at maintaining the platoon's high combat readiness, preserving its combat effectiveness, and creating favorable conditions for successful and timely accomplishment of assigned missions. All-round support of the platoon includes: combat, technical, and logistic support. Combat support in the platoon is organized based on the commander's decision in all types of battle and also when moving and getting into position. It includes reconnaissance, protection against weapons of mass destruction, camouflage, engineer and chemical support, and security. When organizing technical and logistic support, the platoon commander must take timely steps for replenishment of ammunition, refueling, performing servicing and maintenance of combat vehicles and armament, and providing personnel with individual protection and decontamination gear, food, and other supplies. Maintaining and timely restoration of the platoon's combat effectiveness involve organizing and conducting measures to ensure high combat proficiency of subunits, their timely manning and supplying them with everything necessary for battle, and also the ability to carry out assigned missions. Firm and continuous command and control of the platoon and inflexibility in achieving the planned goals and carrying out decisions made and assigned missions are achieved through constant knowledge of the situation; timely decision making and implementation; precise assignment of missions to squads (tanks) and attached and supporting assets; initiative and personal responsibility of the platoon commander for his decision; correct battle employment of his and attached subunits; and stable communications with them. 5. Fundamentals of Combat Employment of the Motorized Rifle (Tank) Platoon A motorized rifle (tank) platoon, being a tactical subunit, carries out an important mission for destroying the enemy in battle. Numerous combat examples and the experience of combat training of troops show that the platoon, possessing powerful armament and combat equipment, in coordination with subunits of other branches of troops, special troops, and independently, is capable of the following: --in the defense--using organized fire, inflict damage on the enemy in front of the forward edge of the battle area; repel attacks by enemy tanks and infantry; battle low-flying air targets; and stubbornly defend an occupied strongpoint; --in the offensive--boldly combining fire and movement, swiftly attack the enemy, destroy his personnel, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, artillery, antitank and other weapons, and offensive nuclear and chemical weapons; combat enemy aircraft and helicopters; at a rapid pace develop the offensive, repel counterattacks, and pursue a withdrawing enemy; make hasty crossings of water obstacles, negotiate obstacles and debris, and consolidate captured lines. In addition, the platoon can successfully carry out other missions in reconnaissance and security. When carrying out combat missions, a motorized rifle (tank) platoon usually operates as part of a company. In reconnaissance, security during movement and at the halt, and also in an assault group, it can also operate independently. Depending on the nature of the mission being carried out, the terrain, enemy pressure, and other situation conditions, a motorized rifle platoon can carry out missions operating dismounted (on skis in the winter), on armored fighting vehicles (armored transport vehicles), and as an assault force on tanks. Machinegun, grenade-launcher, flame-thrower, and antiaircraft squads may be attached to it; a combat-engineer squad and chemical reconnaissance scouts can be attached when performing independent missions in march, halt, and combat security and in reconnaissance. During operations in security and as an assault group, tanks may also be attached to a platoon. Motorized rifle, combat-engineer, and flame-thrower squads and chemical reconnaissance scouts may be attached to a tank platoon in a combat situation (as a rule, when performing independent missions). Depending on the situation, a motorized rifle (tank) platoon carries out its mission in march, approach march, and combat formations. A platoon's march formation is a column. In a column, a platoon executes a march, pursues a withdrawing enemy, displaces as the battalion reserve, and also can execute a maneuver on the battlefield. The march formation should ensure the platoon a high speed of movement, economy of forces and assets, and rapid deployment into combat formation. During dismounted operations, a motorized rifle platoon may also use the approach march formation, which is the alignment of the platoon in squad columns dispersed frontally into a line of squads abreast (Figure 2). the intervals between squads in this case may be up to 100 meters. Reinforcements attached to the platoon proceed behind the guiding squad or are located at a position indicated by the commander. The approach march formation of a motorized rifle platoon is used to reduce the time for deployment into combat formation and reduce vulnerability to enemy artillery fire and airstrikes. Figure 2. Approach March Formation of a Motorized Rifle Platoon The platoon takes up a combat formation for waging battle. It must correspond to the assigned mission and ensure successful waging of battle; complete utilization of the combat capabilities of the platoon's and attached subunits, the results of engagement of the enemy by nuclear and conventional fires, and favorable terrain conditions; stability and aggressiveness in defense; least vulnerability to enemy fire; and maintaining continuous coordination and command and control of subordinates. In defensive fighting, the combat formation of a motorized rifle platoon consists of the combat formations of squads located at positions, combat vehicles (armored transport vehicles), and reinforcements occupying fire positions both at the forward edge of the platoon strongpoint and in its depth. The combat formation of a tank platoon in a defense consists of tanks and reinforcements located at fire positions at the forward edge or in the depth of the strongpoint. The combat formation of a motorized rifle platoon in an offensive during operations on BMP's (BTR's) and of a tank platoon consists of an extended line of combat vehicles and reinforcements (figures 3 and 4). The intervals between vehicles in the extended line may be up to 100 meters. The combat vehicles of reinforcements may operate in the extended line or directly behind it. Figure 3. Combat Formation of a Motorized Rifle Platoon in an Offensive Figure 4. Combat Formation of a Tank Platoon in an Offensive During a motorized rifle platoon's operations dismounted, its combat formation consists of an extended line, armored fighting vehicles (armored transport vehicles), and reinforcements. The squad combat formation consists of an extended line and the combat vehicle (armored transport vehicle) (Figure 5). Figure 5. Combat Formation of a Motorized Rifle Squad in an Offensive 6. The Platoon's Combat Equipment and Armament Organizationally, a motorized rifle platoon consists of a headquarters element and three motorized rifle squads. A motorized rifle platoon's armament consists of armored fighting vehicles (Figure 6) or armored transport vehicles (figures 7 and 8), machineguns, assault rifles, shoulder-fired antitank rocket launchers, a sniper rifle, pistols, and hand grenades. Figure 6. Armored Fighting Vehicle Figure 7. BTR-70 Armored Transport Vehicle Figure 8. BTR-80 Armored Transport Vehicle The armored fighting vehicle is designed for waging battle by a motorized rifle squad. It considerably increases the firepower, mobility, and protection of personnel on the battlefield and makes it possible to operate successfully in various situation conditions. The fighting vehicle has armor capable of defeating small-arms fire and designed to protect against shell fragments, a system of collective protection from weapons of mass destruction, and thermal smoke generating equipment, and has high maneuverability. It can cross water obstacles afloat, be transported by air, and negotiate sectors of contamination, destruction, and various obstacles. The BMP-1 armored fighting vehicle is armed with antitank guided missiles (ATGM's), a 73-mm smoothbore semiautomatic antitank gun, and a 7.62-mm machinegun (PKT) paired with it. The assault compartment of the BMP is equipped with firing ports, which enable personnel to fire their machineguns and assault rifles without leaving the vehicle. The BMP can engage enemy tanks at a range of up to 3 km and also deliver effective fire against his personnel and weapons. Accommodation of platoon personnel in armored fighting vehicles is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Accommodation of personnel in BMP Armored transport vehicles, being the platoon's means of transport, largely perform the role of armored fighting vehicles in battle, supporting squads with machinegun fire in an offensive and when they are conducting a defensive battle. The BTR-60PB (BTR-70, -80) armored transport vehicle is a fighting, wheeled, armored, amphibious vehicle armed with a 14.5-mm KPVT heavy machinegun capable of destroying lightly armored targets and a 7.62-mm PKT machinegun paired with it. The armament is situated in the turret mounting. The armored transport vehicles have a high off-road capability and are able to make hasty crossings of water obstacles, trenches, and vehicle pits. Like the armored fighting vehicle, the armored transport vehicle has armor which makes it possible to protect personnel reliably against small-arms fire and shell fragments and also reduce severalfold the casualty-producing effects of nuclear weapons. Accommodation of platoon personnel in armored transport vehicles is shown in figures 10 and 11. Figure 10. Accommodation of personnel in BTR-60PB Figure 11. Accommodation of personnel in BTR-70 The Kalashnikov assault rifle (AKM) is the basic individual weapon of platoon personnel for engaging enemy troops at a distance of up to 400 meters. When delivering concentrated fire by a squad or platoon, the effective range can reach 800 meters against ground targets and 500 meters against air targets. The Kalashnikov light machinegun (RPK) is the automatic weapon of a motorized rifle squad. It is designed for destroying enemy troops and weapons at a range of up to 800 meters and aircraft, helicopters, and paratroopers at a range of up to 500 meters. Kalashnikov machineguns (PKT) mounted on armored fighting vehicles, armored transport vehicles, and tanks can successfully destroy enemy troops and weapons as well as air targets at a range of up to 1000 meters. The motorized rifle platoon is also armed with a sniper rifle, which makes it possible to destroy important individual targets (enemy officers, observers, snipers, gun crews, low-flying helicopters) at a range of up to 1300 meters. To combat tanks and other enemy armored assets, besides the BMP's armament, the platoon also has shoulder-fired antitank rocket launchers, capable of reliably destroying targets at a range of up to 500 meters, and antitank hand grenades. Organizationally, a tank platoon usually consists of three tank crews. It has modern tanks which possess high fire characteristics, powerful armored protection, and high maneuverability. The tanks have guns with high ballistic characteristics and rate of fire, armor-piercing and high-explosive fragmentation shells, and gun control equipment. The armament makes it possible to engage ground, air, and surface targets by both direct and indirect fire. A tank platoon is capable of delivering effective concentrated fire against openly disposed tanks at a range of up to 3 km, against enemy weapons and troops at a range of up to 4 km, and against concentrations of combat equipment and troops at a range of up to 6 km. The capabilities of the tanks' armament control system make it possible to carry out fire missions successfully by firing on the move at a speed of up to 20 km/hr. The armor of a modern tank makes it possible to decrease the effect of a blast wave on the crew by a factor of 3-4 and the effect of penetrating radiation by a factor of 10, completely eliminate the effect of thermal radiation, and successfully withstand fire from conventional weapons, including antitank weapons. All this ensures, on the one hand, a high degree of survivability of tank platoon personnel and, on the other, combined with fire, gives it great striking power in battle. A tank's maneuverability is demonstrated in its mobility, off-road capability, and its ability to relocate quickly to threatened sectors and open fire on the enemy. Thus, a tank platoon can move in a column at an average speed of 25-30 km/hr, attack the enemy at a speed of 8-12 km/hr, pursue the enemy at a speed of 10-15 km/hr, and cross water obstacles up to 5 meters deep under water.
