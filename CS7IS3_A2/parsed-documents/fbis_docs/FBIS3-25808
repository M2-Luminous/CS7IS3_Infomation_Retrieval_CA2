This decision reflects the government's preferential treatment for farmers, who need a stable rural market with few price fluctuations in agricultural-related products. "Chinese farmers cannot afford a further swelling of price surges on the agricultural production materials this year," said an official with the administration. Last year, the country's 14.5 percent inflation rate seriously hurt the improvement of farmers' real income, which chalked up a rise of only 2 percent. As a result, the taxation administration hopes it can contribute to the government's macro control over the rural market as well as to the development of the rural economy, which is crucial to social stability, the official added. Some domestic speculators are now taking advantage of the farmers, he said. Since the farmers do not have the latest information about the consumption tax, speculators have been profiteering by raising prices of farm machinery and blaming the need for the increase on the new tax. Fearing further price increases, some farmers have been staging a buying spree since the last month of 1993, snapping up tractors, harvesters and other big farm machinery. Official figures show that in 1993, the gross value of agricultural machinery owned by the country's rural residents hit nearly 125.4 billion yuan ($14.6 billion), up 3.9 percent from the previous year. However, the amount of farmland that was ploughed by machine remained essentially the same over the two-year period. In 1993, 51.4 million hectares were ploughed by machine, down 0.01 percent from 1992. Analysts say some farmers now believe they can protect their renminbi from further devaluation by purchasing agricultural machines, although some of their machines are already lying idle in their backyards. In fact, farmers have become reluctant to use farm machines to help round out their field work, due to the rocketing prices of diesel oil and the lack of a machine-repairing network in the countryside. Last year, some 110 million hectares of farmland were sown with grain. Of that, only 26 million hectares were sown by machine.
