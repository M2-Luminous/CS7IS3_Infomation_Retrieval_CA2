A statement by the director of army public relations said that while Nigeria had resorted to diplomatic, political, and judicial means to resolve the dispute over the peninsula, Cameroon had consistently displayed arrogant repression. This, it said, had resulted in the death of two Nigerian soldiers recently. The statement stressed that despite the provocations, Nigerian troops had remained calm, as war is not the only means of resolving disputes. While Nigeria continues to pursue a peaceful approach, it said that Nigerian troops will continue to keep to orders to protect the lives and property of Nigerians residing in the disputed area.
