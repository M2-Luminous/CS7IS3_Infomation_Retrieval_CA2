Units from both north and south Yemen were locked in intensive artillery duels around Madinat al-Sha'b, 10 kilometres (six miles) west of Aden city centre, where northern forces broke through on Saturday. The sound of gunfire could be heard from within Aden itself, an AFP correspondent said. Al-Jumhuriyah hospital sources said the day's shelling had killed six civilians and wounded a further 56, while 13 soldiers were also killed and 124 injured. Since June 11, an estimated 415 civilians have been killed and more than 1,100 injured in bombardments in and around Aden, according to statistics compiled from official and hospital sources. A southern military spokesman said meanwhile that southern troops had managed to halt "new attempts by enemy forces to progress towards Aden." "Four northern tanks were destroyed and hundreds of enemy soldiers and officers killed or wounded," the spokesman said, while others had been taken prisoner. A southern statement vowed that "Aden will resist and will transform itself into a cemetery for the new invaders." An unspecified number of northern aircraft earlier launched a raid on Aden's oil refinery, 18 kilometres (10 miles) west of the city, the southern spokesman said, adding ground defences had downed one plane. Eyewitnesses said two planes fired four missiles at the refinery, one of which hit an empty building. Another damaged pipelines. A spokesman for the north in Sanaa denied its planes had launched an air raid. [passage omitted]
