Quite the contrary, he said, the Church offers to act as mediator to reach a consensus and prevent useless bloodshed. The prelate explained that the recent events are a desperate measure in the face of the poverty and deprivation in which the Indians are immersed, above all in the Lacandon zone. Bishop Felipe Arizmendi warned that any violence in Chiapas will result in worse repression of the Indians. He said the important thing is to know who is behind the Zapatista army and to learn if they are acting in favor of private interests that do not include the Indian population. The Catholic Church in Chiapas has reiterated its appeal that political wisdom and historical responsibility motivate the parties to the conflict to seek an honest and responsible dialogue.
