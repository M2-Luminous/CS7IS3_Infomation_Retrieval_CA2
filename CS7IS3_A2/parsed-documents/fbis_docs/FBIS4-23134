He will talk to us about his visit. Minister, a very good evening. [Chipilika] A very good evening. [Ribeiro] What made you visit the United States, and what was the outcome of your visit? [Chipilika] Good evening, viewers. I would first like to thank TPA for giving me this opportunity to talk about my visit to the United States. First, I would like to note that I was invited by two agencies -- namely, USIA, the United States Information Agency [preceding four words in English], and the Afro-American Institute. The invitation came through the U.S. Embassy in Luanda. With permission from his excellency the prime minister, I visited the United States for two weeks. The main goal of my visit was to see how the U.S. judiciary functions. I can say it was an extraordinary experience from all aspects. I was able to see a judiciary with prestige and reputation, a well-organized and independent judiciary. In fact, this is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. The people we spoke to, either from district, state, or federal courts as well as the Supreme Court [preceding two words in English] stressed the independence of the U.S. judiciary from the legislative and executive branches. We visited prisons in Washington and in Alexandria, Virginia. We also exchanged views about our intention to establish a National Institute for Judiciary Studies, INEJ, and the training of magistrates for the judiciary and the Office of the Attorney General and Public Prosecutor. We were in Atlanta, Georgia, where we visited a number of prisons. We were in Springfield, Illinois, and in San Francisco, California, where we visited district and federal courts. We went to the Law College of Stanford University. We were also in (?New York). So, those were the goals of our visit. [Ribeiro] Your visit suggests that changes have been introduced within your ministry. [Chipilika] It is obvious that we cannot....[pauses] We are a new democracy and, as we have stated time and again, the Angolan judiciary was negatively affected over the last few years. But there are common aspects. We have been calling for the independence of the Angolan judiciary. We are in favor of a dignified judiciary and that calls for suitable legislation and a sound remuneration. We saw that in the United States the judiciary is the foundation of democracy, and magistrates in that country are well remunerated--sometimes better than state governors. We were told that that was designed to prevent any form of corruption because there can be no justice with corruption. [passage omitted]
