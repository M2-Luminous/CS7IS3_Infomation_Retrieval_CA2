Meanwhile, five of these organizations issued an ultimatum that negotiations should resume today by 1800 local (1200 GMT) [times as received] after the dialogue reached an impasse on Wednesday night. In a communique, the organizations called on their "allied forces" in seaports and at the international airport in this capital to join the strike to support the protest staged by members of the transportation sector over the past four days. The Federation of Nicaraguan Passenger Carriers (Fetracolnic), the Federation of Nicaraguan Cargo Carriers (Fetracanic), the Nicaraguan Transportation Council, the National Transportation Commission (CNT), and the National Transportation Association (Anatra) signed the communique. The communique, which was read by a transportation sector leader over a local radio station, warned the transportation unions would paralyze all traffic nationwide, as well as international freight transportation, if a satisfactory agreement is not reached tonight. Meanwhile, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo reiterated the government's decision to continue talking with all groups on strike. The official ruled out a bilateral meeting with the CNT, the organization that promoted the strike which began at 0000 local on 24 January. "We will meet with everyone, not just with one group," Lacayo said in a meeting with journalists in front of the National Assembly building. The members of the transportation sector called on the Catholic Church to ask the Nicaraguan Government to lay aside its "hard-line" position on fuel prices in an effort to resolve the costly crisis. Construction and Transportation Minister Pablo Vigil, in statements to LA PRENSA newspaper, ruled out the possibility of negotiating fuel prices after the government released a communique on Tuesday night, in which it announced the freezing of gasoline prices, a slight decrease in diesel prices, and a subsidy for the freight and passenger transportation sector. Nevertheless, this moved failed to meet the strikers' demands. In related news, the National Police have released 61 of 277 people who were arrested on Wednesday and Thursday during operations conducted along the Northern Highway and in Ciudad Sandino in Managua, according to CNT sources.
