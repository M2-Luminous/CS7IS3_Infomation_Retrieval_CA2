SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given related to the emergency use restriction of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administered lands in accordance with regulations contained in 43 CFR 8364.1 (a). This action affects approximately 300 acres of public land comprising the Samoa Dunes Recreation Area (T5N, R1W, Section 31; T4N, R1W, Section 6, Humboldt Base & Meridian). These public lands will be closed to all vehicle use 1/2 hour following sunset to 1/2 hour after sunrise. Employees, agents and permittees of the BLM may be exempt from this restriction as determined by the authorized officer. DATES: This restriction order will be effective immediately following the installation of an entrance gate and posting of signs. ADDRESSES: Maps and supporting documentation of the area affected are available for review at the following location: Bureau of Land Management, Arcata Resource Area, 1125 16th Street, Room 219, Arcata, CA 95521. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lynda J. Roush, Area Manager at the Arcata address given above. Telephone: (707) 822&hyph;7648. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of restricting vehicle use at night in this particular area is to protect persons, property and public land and resources. During the past year, there has been a significant increase in vandalism, theft of property and other illegal activities during the evening and early morning hours, all of which have been associated with the use of vehicles. Restricting vehicle use to only daytime hours will substantially reduce these illegal activities from occurring. Dated: September 7, 1994. Lynda J. Roush, Area Manager.
