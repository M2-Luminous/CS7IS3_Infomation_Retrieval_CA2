This means that the directors of FLER are ready to examine investment proposals that have to do with developing production in privatized enterprises. The Fund was registered as a private corporation in the state of Delaware in March 1994. It is managed by a board of directors comprised of leading U.S. experts in investment and banking, as well as venture capital investment. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, former Secretary of the Treasury of the U.S., Michael Blumenthal, was appointed personally by U.S. President Bill Clinton. The Fund is financed by the U.S. Congress (a $100 million grant has been received), as well as by the Corporation for Private Investment Abroad, the Export-Import Bank, and the U.S. Agency for Trade and Development (for now, the money from these sources is limited to $150 million). According to the management of FLER, the origin of FLER is directly tied to the decision of the "big seven" countries (adopted in Tokyo in July 1993) to support a program of privatization and organizational restructuring in Russia. In contrast to the already functioning Russian-American Fund for Entrepreneurship (with a financial reserve of $340 million for four years and area of interest in small and mid-sized businesses), the new investment organization will concentrate on mid-sized and large privatized enterprises. American investors, through accumulated "risk" capital, may be able to take a leading position in the Russian domestic investment market. Obviously, this will also be facilitated by the fact that the program for supporting privatization has been approved by the presidium of the government; FLER already has its own niche. The Fund will have to initiate commercial investments in capital stock of enterprises located in regions that the Fund considers as having the greatest potential. FLER experts firmly believe that official support of their activities by the Russian Government "will open all doors to them" in the most desirable regions and will "guarantee access to necessary information." Russian experts are assessing these possibilities more sceptically. Nevertheless, even though they are counting on protection by the Russian authorities, Americans are not planning to use their own "risk" capital in a struggle to purchase enough shares to control Russian enterprises. They intend to divide the risk of capital investments between both foreign and Russian investors and "will be open to any interesting proposals."
