Political analysts in Kigali are discussing how the RPF dares reject a government that is coming to fill the constitutional vacuum left by the almost simultaneous tragic loss of the head of state and the prime minister and other leading figures of the country. For them, this attitude means the RPF does not want any interlocutor, but that it alone wants power and that it wants to take it by force. This attitude is also seen as destined to mark the beginning of ethnic struggles within the RPF where General Paul Kagame, the head of the movement's army, which is mainly Tutsi, is reported by Kigali private Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines to have carried out a coup d'etat in which the president of the RPF, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, and many other Hutu officials have been killed. The RPF has not denied the information.
