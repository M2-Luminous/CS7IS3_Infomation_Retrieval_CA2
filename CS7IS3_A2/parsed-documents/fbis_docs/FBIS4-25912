Madeline Albright, the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, read to reporters the elements of the U.S.-drafted resolution. "Phase one will impose significant sanctions and will impose heavy price in terms of diplomatic isolation on North Korea," she said. "And these sanctions will take into effect after a relatively short period of time which is normal in our sanctions resolutions," she added. Generally speaking, the sanctions fall into five categories, she said. The five categories are as follows: First is stopping technical and scientific cooperation, that can be contributed to DPRK nuclear knowledge. The second is terminating all economic assistance through the United Nations or its subsidiaries. The third is reducing the size and scope of diplomatic activities with the DPRK both bilaterally and through international organizations. The fourth will be curtailing cultural, technical, scientific, commercial and educational exchanges with the DPRK both in that country and elsewhere. And finally, prohibiting the DPRK from exporting and importing any weapons or components, and that is mandatory. "If there is further backsliding by North Korea in terms of safeguarding present and future nuclear material, we will tighten the sanctions by cutting all financial transaction with Pyongyang," she warned. But she said this would not be a sanction by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. She said that it was a complex problem, that the U.S. would be working with all members of the Security Council, as well as the Republic of Korea and Japan, in this particular issue. The DPRK officially notified the U.S. On Tuesday that it was withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
