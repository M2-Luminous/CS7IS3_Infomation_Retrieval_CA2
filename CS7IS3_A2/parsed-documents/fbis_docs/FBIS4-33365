The anonymous threat against Cardenas stated: "We are ready to eradicate social blights. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is one of them. Remember what happened to Colosio. Say good-bye to your candidate, this week he dies." Colosio, presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), was assassinated on 23 March and although the perpetrator was arrested, the motive has yet to be clarified. The source indicated that the anonymous threat, which was received by the Oaxaca state committee of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD, center-left), was sent by an organization called Lady of Guadalupe Archdiocesan Sanctuary. At an event in the community of Macuiltianguis, Oaxaca, Cardenas scoffed at the threat, indicating that "their bark is worse than their bite." He added, "when someone wants to do something, he does not announce it. There is nothing to worry about."
