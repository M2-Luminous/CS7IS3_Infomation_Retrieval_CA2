This is understandable: Some 24 hours before our conversation the mayor had had a beautiful daughter, weighing in at 4,400 grams. So even Moscow Spartak's crushing defeat in Barcelona (Luzhkov did not watch the match, of course) did not have a significant effect on his mood, as is evident from the photograph [photo shows him grinning broadly]. Our conversation, alas, focused on matters far more prosaic. [Simonov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, Muscovites are greeting spring not only with joy, but with a degree of apprehension: They all remember May Day last year, the battle in Leninskiy Prospekt, and the Moscow militia's sense of total impotence. Have lessons been learned from this? [Luzhkov] It is primarily those who organized the riots in Moscow who should learn the lessons. The lesson is simple: Extremism no longer works, you will not achieve any objectives using it. I hope that after the spring clashes last year and after the October tragedy, the majority of political movements and structures intend act entirely in accordance with the law, because no one benefits from blood on the streets. If you want power, act, but by parliamentary means. Gain people's favor, win the elections, and form organs of power. But society will not allow you to implement your slogans through attacks, through threats, and through bloodshed. Of course, rallies and marches are unavoidable in our turbulent times -- but they can and must be carried out in the capital strictly in accordance wuith the rules laid down by city hall and the government. We are not against people expressing their will normally -- peacefully! I would point out, incidentally, that disputes arose when city hall lifted its ban on demonstrations following the court ruling. But the leaders of the masses must show the same respect for the law. [Simonov] But these are all political conclusions. What about practical ones? [Luzhkov] What I will say is that we are making very serious preparations for possible trouble. The police are equipped. The law-enforcement organs have been instructed to stop any activity that poses a threat to Muscovites' safety and peace. As for last year's confusion... There was confusion. We were unprepared for the fact that the nature of the demonstrations changed completely. Basically, what we faced on 1 May was organized thuggery. We are prepared this time. [Simonov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, what is the situation on the other front -- the food front? Some analysts are predicting empty shelves by the spring, linking this to the introduction of the new customs duties. [Luzhkov] There will be no empty shelves -- I can assure you of that. We will not allow any breakdown in food supply, it will remain stable. As for prices, I do not understand and do not accept the government's decision on new duties on foodstuffs. We have already been through that: We imposed excessive duties on imported cars -- and prices of "Zhiguli," "Moskvich," and other cars immediately soared. The same would happen to food. The struggle here at the moment is not for increased production volumes, not for economic work by enterprises -- what they are trying to do is ensure production viability solely by increasing prices. But this is a dead-end street! This measure will help for a -- short -- while, and then it falls apart. Look: There is a surplus of cars on the market at the moment. The plants, having jacked up their prices, are failing to resolve their problems because they are unable to sell their cars. People cannot buy cars at that price, cannot invest their money. This is a double damper on an already barely warm economy. But the food situation is even more serious. This decision hits the big cities first and foremost, and northern areas -- those that do not have their own agricultural base. Take Moscow. A large proportion of our food is imported. Some 50 percent of our traditional meat and dairy products are actually produced abroad. You do not have to consult a fortune-teller to be able to predict that home agricultural producers are going to raise their prices now -- and again there is no competition. Will this breathe life into our agriculture? Obviously it will not, since it is the same old production forces and production relations in the countryside. On the other hand, the purchasesing power of the cities, particularly big cities, is falling. For example, we can already see how much less Muscovites are eating. [Simonov] And how much is it? [Luzhkov] Well, nearly 50 percent less vegetables, for instance. At this time of year daily sales in Moscow are traditionally more than 5,000 tonnes. Now it is 3,000-3,200. Yet people's personal stocks of potatoes and carrots are now exhausted. The meat situation is as follows: Not long ago 4,000-4,300 tonnes would go in a day; it is half that amount today. On the other hand, bread consumption has increased considerably. Therefore, I regard the increase in customs duties on imported food as an unfair, unfriendly step against Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg (Editorial note: As we know, the three mayors of the aforementioned cities put together an appeal to the Russian president condemning the government's step), and the North. I can see this policy having most appalling consequences for Muscovites. Let us take a closer look at this decree: What I wonder is who is it working for if it envisages that there will be no duty on food coming into Russia from the particularly underdeveloped countries, the underdeveloped countries will get duty reductions, while the industrial states will get the full works. Where do Russia's interests come into it? Is the idea to make Russians' food worse and more dangerous? It is crass politicking and stupidity again! So we are supposed to give up guaranteed high-quality food and support underdeveloped countries' economies instead. Very Soviet. [Simonov] It is a very banal question, but there is no getting away from it. I am talking about Moscow's highways. It appeared they could not get any worse, then the snow melted, revealing an absolute nightmare. [Luzhkov] Yes indeed, in the winter I banned highway repair, because we were sinking money in mud. The repairs will begin in April, covering 20 million square meters. It could be more, the potential is there, but the money is not, and we have to face this fact. The Ring Road is a very difficult task, but we will deal with it this year. It has a bad reputation and has become extremely dangerous. There will be lighting and a median strip along the entire length of it. [Simonov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, what was the outcome (did it have an outcome?) of your dispute with Anatoliy Chubays over privatization methods? [Luzhkov] The president instructed Chernomyrdin to sort out our differences. They are certainly fundamental. It is not me getting on my high horse and it is not some great-power policy on Moscow's part. I believe Chubays is not behaving properly in carrying out the president's direct instructions to enable privatization to take place in Moscow on our terms. It all boils down again to the methods of the State Committee for the Management of State Property. No account at all is taken of Moscow's mighty infrastructure, banking and exchange network, and technological caliber, and people's skills. I have said it before and I say it again: Without taking these facts into account Moscow will be sold short. I don't want to let this happen, I don't want my name to be linked to the major mistakes Chubays and his department are making on matters of privatization. These mistakes will have repercussions in the state. [Simonov] What do you think of the fact that you are figuring more and more prominently in the political ratings. You are even being tipped as president... [Luzhkoiv] I have absolutely no view concerning this talk and these articles. I follow Pushkin: "indifferent both to praise and slander." I love my work, but I know what I am capable of, and I know my limitations as well. My own sober assessment is that I do not think a mayor responsible for the Moscow economy can be elevated to such heights. Anyway, I do not much like the talk about presidential elections. They are still two and one-half years away. What is the point of all the fuss about them today? All it does is undermine the executive power's authority in the state. If people are talking up the elections, apparently, it means that everything is unstable and temporary and the president's decisions and opinion need not be heeded. But there is an interesting, instructive element in the latest ratings. The "managers," if you can call them that, are emerging in the leading roles. They are overtaking the pure politicians. This is a sign, if you like: Society increasingly needs people who know how to get things done, rather than people who talk a load of nonsense. This is a very important change. A person must be assessed in terms of what he has done, rather than what he has said, in terms of what he can do, rather than what he wants to do. Look how leaders are trained in Japan. There a manager is obliged to climb the ladder. But a state is not some kind of office, it is a very intricate system. And that our Russia certainly is.
