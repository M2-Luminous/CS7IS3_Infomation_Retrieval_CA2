That is why it is permitting its territory to be used as an emporium for the supply of weapons and other logistical means to Jonas Savimbi's organization. Our correspondent Joao Caluque reports from Moxico Province: Commander Jose Joao Rafael says that Jonas Savimbi's organization is receiving logistical supplies from trains travelling from Bilondo in Zaire to Luau District of Moxico Province, which has a border with that country. The commander of the government forces in Moxico says that another consignment of military equipment is being carried by aircraft coming from Zaire. Within Angola light aircraft transport the equipment out of Luau, Cazombo, and Lumbala N'guimbo Districts in Moxico Province. Speaking about the immediate intentions of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the province, Brigadier Jose Joao Rafael also said that Jonas Savimbi's organization has brought into Moxico more than two battalions with the aim of attacking and dislodging government forces from positions in the city of Luena.
