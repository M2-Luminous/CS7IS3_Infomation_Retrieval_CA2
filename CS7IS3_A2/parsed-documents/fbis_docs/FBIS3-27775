If Japan should fail to present drastic plans for expanding domestic demands, no accord will be reached at the framework talks, whose major theme is to cut Japan's current account surplus. Then, there will be considerably less significance in holding a summit. Concerned with the deadlock at the framework talks, some domestic observers tend to hope that the summit will be postponed. However, the summit allows for no postponement because Japan must work out measures to stimulate its economy and to open up the market as an immediate task for overcoming its prolonged recession as soon as possible. Certainly, these measures should not be worked out for the sake of the United States. In the sense that the Japanese Government must indicate its targets to the people, efforts must be made to carry out such tasks as the compilation of the draft budget as originally scheduled and before the summit. Deregulation efforts that are directly connected with market opening involve abolition of unreasonable standards and an authorization system as well as bidding system reform. Proposals for such efforts must be indicated to the United States in a positive way. Hardly any progress can be noted at the talks on numerical targets, even at the general meeting at the vice ministerial level currently under way in Washington. Japan and the United States may try to reach an agreement quickly in the future. However, in case Japan should make a political decision to accept numerical targets, there is a danger that foreign countries may come to share an understanding that the best way to win over Japan in trade talks is to bring the issues to talks at the top level. When the current economic situation is taken into account, domestic industries, such as automakers, will lose confidence in promoting business recovery if such restrictions as future targets of procuring foreign products should be imposed on them. Thus, Japan should insist on arguing that the United States is wrong in trying to introduce numerical targets. Japan should make further efforts to find a way to break the stiff stance taken by the United States by making positive proposals for opening up its markets that may also bring about benefits for its own people.
