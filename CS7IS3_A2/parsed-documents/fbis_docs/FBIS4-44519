To meet China's need for foreign cooperation in the extraction of petroleum resources, China follows international practice by drawing on the experience of some of the world's petroleum-producing countries and by constantly perfecting and enriching China's tax policy for foreign cooperation in petroleum as well as its laws and regulations. China has initially formed a set of regulations for foreign cooperation in petroleum that contain clear measures, which play an important role in attracting foreign capital and promoting the prospecting and exploration of petroleum resources. In 1991 China completed the reform of its income tax system for enterprises in which foreign businessmen had invested and for foreign enterprises. At the end of 1993 China carried out the largest reform of its tax system since the founding of the PRC, with the focus on reforming the circulation tax and on reforming the income tax on domestic venture enterprises and individuals. For China's petroleum corporations and foreign petroleum corporations, the main point was the abolishing of the consolidated industry and commerce tax and the changes in the collection of the value added tax, business tax, and consumption tax. To maintain the continuity and stability of the tax policy, so that it is more advantageous to attracting foreign capital and promoting the opening up to the outside world, the Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee passed the "Decision on Provisional Regulations for Value Added Tax, Consumption Tax, and Business Tax on Enterprises in Which Foreign Businessmen Have Invested and on Foreign Enterprises." On the basis of this decision the State Council issued a "Notice on Provisional Regulations for Value Added Tax, Consumption Tax, and Business Tax on Enterprises in Which Foreign Businessmen Have Invested and on Foreign Enterprises." In the decision and notice, provisions were specially made for the tax issue with regard to Sino-foreign cooperation in the extraction of petroleum resources, the main parts being: "The collection in kind of the value added tax on petroleum and natural gas extracted from Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields is at a rate of 5 percent; and, in line with the existing stipulated collection of the mining area use fee, the value added tax will temporarily not be collected, and when the value added tax is being calculated there will be no deduction on the income tax. When crude oil or natural gas is exported, there will be no drawback. The oil (gas) fields at sea exploited by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation will be run in accordance with the abovementioned stipulations." The stipulated tax preference is mainly embodied in: 1. The industry and commerce consolidated tax on crude oil and natural gas extracted in Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields has been changed to a value added tax, but the tax in kind will continue to be collected. A tax in kind on crude oil and natural gas is not exclusive to China, but rather is the current practice of the main petroleum-producing countries of the world. Mainly out of consideration that petroleum is a major source of energy, the governments of petroleum-producing countries should, through tax measures, control part of the petroleum reserves. Now, because of the output of Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields, the tax in kind on crude oil is entrusted to the cooperative oil (gas) fields for selling in a lump and putting in storage according to the actual sales value. The principle of collection of a tax in kind is understood and accepted by Chinese and foreign petroleum companies. 2. After the value added tax was put into effect, its rate on crude oil was 17 percent and its rate on natural gas was 13 percent. In order not to increase the tax burden on Chinese and foreign petroleum companies because of the tax system reform, the State Council notice decided that the value added tax on crude oil and natural gas extracted in the Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields and those at sea would be at a rate of 5 percent. This decision has three advantages for the Chinese and foreign petroleum companies: One advantage is that it is consistent with the principle of China's circulation tax at the 5 percent level on petroleum resources extracted by foreign countries. This principle has been accepted by Chinese and foreign petroleum companies, and it has become an important provision in the petroleum contracts signed by the Chinese and foreign sides. The second advantage is that, under the new tax system, when crude oil and natural gas, on which there is a tax rate of 5 percent, is sold domestically, because objectively the funds held by the bying side are reduced (mainly the funds held by the buying side for income tax, the crude oil and natural gas of the Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields and those at sea possess a superiority in the price aspect. The third advantage is that, because likewise there is no drawback on the export of crude oil, the crude oil of the Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields and those at sea only bear 5 percent of the circulation tax, and before the crude oil is exported it bears 17 percent of the domestic circulation tax, the Chinese and foreign petroleumn companies possess competitive strength in the export of crude oil. 3. Still according to the existing stipulated collection of the mining area use fee, the natural resources tax will temporarily not be levied. The levying of a mining area use fee confirms to international practice, and it is accepted by Chinese and foreign petroleum companies. China's collection of the mining area use fee is at an above-quota graduated fee rate; at-sea oil (gas) fields in which the annual crude oil total output does not exceed 1 million tons and the annual natural gas total output does not exceed 2 billion are exempt from the mining area use fee. The main purpose of this exemption is to encourage the development of small oil (gas) fields at sea and to formulate special policies for them. Similarly, for a medium-sized oilfield at sea that has an annual output of 1 million tons, if the mining area use fee is levied but temporarily the natural resources tax is not levied, then it possesses the advanatage that the Chinese and foreign petroleum companies at this field will get every year a small sum of money to help pay the 8 million-yuan tax. Summarizing what has been said above, because in the past a preferential tax policy was given to Chinese and foreign petroleum companies, including the continued retention of import-export and other preferential policies, the Chinese and foreign petroleum companies will not, because of this reform of the tax system, have their tax burden increased; conversely, because the tax system reform makes China's tax system more rational, the fact that the level of collection management is constantly rising and the tax preferences are becoming more marked is bound to further promote the opening of China's sea and land petroleum resources.
