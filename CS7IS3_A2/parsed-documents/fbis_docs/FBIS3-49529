The communique states that, starting 1 January 1994, another extraordinary obstacle was added. For every exit, even to Macedonia, the Serbian authorities want travelers to pay a tax of DM10 per person and DM30 per vehicle. Another measure, completely contrary to the elementary rights of free circulation, was added to the infuriated regime of crossing the border. With this, the communication between Albanians of Kosova and Macedonia and those of diaspora were reduced to a minimum. Thus, a vital interest is infringed and the Albanian population is practically placed under an almost complete isolation in the eyes of the European powers and the international public. The LDK presidency strongly protests all these limitations and asks that such measures be immediately abolished. The presidency hopes that its request will encounter understanding by the international public and will enjoy support in its demand for immediately invalidating all obstacles of free circulation, the communique says.
