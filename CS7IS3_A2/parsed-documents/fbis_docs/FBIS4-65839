"The best thing one can do is not to comment on the speech," SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping said on Monday evening [23 May]. Deputy SPD Chairman Wolfgang Thierse stated that Herzog immediately lived up to his reputation as an arch-conservative and terrified half of those present. Peter Struck, parliamentary manager of the SPD group, called the speech "disastrous." SPD Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine said that Herzog probably did not prepare his speech well. Therefore, one should not weigh his every word. Reinhard Hoeppner, SPD land chairman of Saxony-Anhalt, was "relatively shocked" by the speech. Joschka Fischer, Hesse environment minister and Greens top politician, shook his head and said: "Read the speech; this says more than any comment." Former FRG Interior Minister Gerhart Baum stated: "My skepticism regarding the newly elected president has not declined after this speech." On the other hand, Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble said that Herzog's election is a "good day for Germany." The elected head of state is a man who has always felt committed to German unification. CSU Land Group Chairman Michael Glos expressed the conviction that Herzog will be a good president.
