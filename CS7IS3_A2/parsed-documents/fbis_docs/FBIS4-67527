The Norwegian environment minister has said there is no reason to express satisfaction with the progress in the work to clean up the nickel works on the Kola Peninsula. For the last two days he has been discussing this issue, among others, with his Russian counterpart, Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, in Moscow. ``I had been hoping that we would have made greater progress in the work to finance the rebuilding of the nickel works on the Kola Peninsula,'' Thorbjorn Berntsen said. ``The Russian environmental authorities are working on the matter. It is impossible to find fault with their work. But they are meeting with resistance at home, not least because of the difficult economic situation. You have to remember that the project has a budget framework of 1.5 to 2 billion Norwegian kroner, of which Norway will contribute 300 million. That is a lot of money in today's Russia.'' Berntsen also stressed that we must nevertheless not give up hope of a breakthrough on the Kola Peninsula soon. ``I have been discussing this matter for several years with the Russian environmental protection authorities. We will solve the problems as quickly as possible,'' he said. At a press conference at the Russian Environment Ministry Berntsen's Russian counterpart got into a heated exchange with journalists present. Danilov-Danilyan said that it is impossible for money to be allocated to the Kola project this year. Berntsen in turn said that its serves no purpose to make a drama out of a crisis. The cooperation between Norwegian and Russian authorities remains constructive, and the Norwegian side is concentrating on one step at a time. As well as the question of Nikel, Berntsen has also discussed the question of building a storage facility for radioactive waste in northwestern Russia. ``Everyone has the aim of building this facility. But where it will be sited is as yet an open question. It is desirable that transport routes should not be too long, whether it is on the Kola Peninsula or Novaya Zemlya. But I would stress that the budget framework is so huge that this will be a major effort. There must therefore be further discussion of financing,'' Berntsen said. He thinks that there is every reason to follow closely what is happening at the storage facilities for liquid nuclear waste near the town of Chelyabinsk in Siberia. At present there are floods in this area. At worst the liquid waste could run out into the River Ob, then the Kara Sea, and eventually reach the Norwegian coast and fishing waters. ``This is a permanent problem, and Russian and Norwegian authorities are working together on the matter the whole time,'' Berntsen said. On Thursday [28 April] Berntsen met with Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov. According to what has leaked out from the meeting, the shape the meeting took was that Mikhaylov launched into a long monotonous monologue directed at Berntsen about the blessings of nuclear power. According to those present at the meeting, Berntsen remained ``surprisingly calm,'' given the claims the Russian minister was making. ``I have to say that one rearely meets a person with so devoted a relationship to nuclear power. To me it seems unsubtle and uncritical. But I would like to stress that when it comes to cooperation on concrete problems, there is nothing to be said against Russia's willingness to cooperate,'' Berntsen stressed.
