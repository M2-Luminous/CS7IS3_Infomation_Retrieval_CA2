Koichi Matsumoto, charge d'affaires ad interim of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, announced his government's decision to give the emergency aid when he met here today with Long Yongtu, Chinese assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation. The aid will include 800,000 U.S. dollars, and 100 small generators worth 200,000 U.S. dollars. Matsumoto said that the Japanese Government made the decision out of humanitarian considerations, since the scale of the disaster was very large, and Japan-China ties are very good. In the past two weeks, rainstorms and floods have hit southern China's provinces of Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Fujian as well as the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
