Idrissa Camara has more: [Camara] [passage omitted] Regarding the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security, the cabinet heard a written report on the consultative meeting on displaced Malians currently living in southern Algeria held from 25 to 26 November in Geneva, Switzerland, and the meeting held in Nouakchott from 13 to 14 December on the repatriation and socioeconomic rehabilitation of Malian refugees in Mauritania. The signing of the National Pact on 11 April 1992 between the Government of the Republic of Mali and the Unified Movement and Front of the Azawad witnessed the end of the rebellion in northern Mali and the announcement of the return and socioeconomic rehabilitation of the people who took refuge in the neighboring countries. Due to the progressive reestablishment of security in the northern areas, the refugees are increasingly desirous of returning to their country of origin. It is in order to organize and rationalize the different repatriation and rehabilitation operations that these consultative meetings were held with our partners -- in Geneva with the UNHCR, the International Fund for Agricultural Development [IFAD], and the Algerian Government representatives, and in Niasso with the UNHCR and Mauritanian Government representatives. The two meetings enabled the establishment of a viable institutional framework for the return and rehabilitation of the Malian refugees, the working out of a monitoring system for the repatriation operations, and support from the UNHCR, IFAD, and the countries of refuge in the implementation of the repatriation operations. The two meetings permitted the establishment of the bases for a rational examination of a strategic approach to the problems related to the return of Malian refugees in Mauritania and southern Algeria.
