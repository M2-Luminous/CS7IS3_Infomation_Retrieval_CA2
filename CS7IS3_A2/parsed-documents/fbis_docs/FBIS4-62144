The Russian ambassador came at the president's invitation to discuss relations between the two countries. The Latvian president's letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin was submitted to the ambassador. Speaking of progress in implementing the Latvian-Russian agreements, Rannikh was concerned about Latvia's insufficient practical work in the area of the Skrunda new radar station. The Russian ambassador also told the president that at the beginning of June the last Russian Navy warship will leave Liepaja port and thus the Russian Navy will have completely left Latvia. During the talks the opinion was expressed that the Latvian and Russian executive powers must act more responsibly and energetically so that the scheduled visit by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Latvia can take place by the end of May. Both the president and the ambassador assessed Latvia's recent joining of the Western European Union as an associate partner as a big success by Latvian diplomacy. Rannikh said that this event is evidence of the unified support by Europe and the Western European Union, which is an institution of European security, for the package of Latvian-Russia agreements signed in Moscow.
