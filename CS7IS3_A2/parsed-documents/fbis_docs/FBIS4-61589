FBIS4-61589 "drsov089_a_94035" FBIS-SOV-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Russia, DPRK Discuss Visit by ROK President Russia, DPRK Discuss Visit by ROK President SK0905020494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0152 GMT 9 May 94 SK0905020494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Report by Kim Hong-sik] [Text] Moscow, 9 May (YONHAP) -- Russia and North Korea are discussing problems related to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's planned visit to Moscow in June and other issues of mutual concern, informed diplomatic sources here said Monday [9 May]. Additional topics of discussion include extension of the Pyongyang-Moscow friendship and Mutual Assistance (military alliance) Treaty and the crisis on the Korean peninsula over Pyongyang's nuclear program, the sources said. The talks involve a North Korean delegation headed by Vice Foreign Minister Yi In-kyu and Russian Foreign Ministry officials. The North Korean delegation arrived here last Thursday. The meeting, held for the first time in two years at the request of the Russian Foreign Ministry, is attracting intense interest as it comes when Moscow is showing "unmistakable" moves to restore its relations with North Korea, the sources said. Moscow and Pyongyang had been drifting apart since former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev introduced perestroyka and then following the collapse of communism. Diplomatic observers here said Moscow apparently called the meeting to discuss the two sides' positions on the North Korean nuclear row that is causing tension worldwide and to seek a resolution of the issue through dialogue. Moscow will resurrect its earlier proposal for an eight-party conference to reach "an overall settlement" of the nuclear problem among South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia, as well as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations. North Korea, for its part, is expected to again demand the suspension of the U.S.-South Korean joint military exercise "Team Spirit" and inspection of U.S. "nuclear facilities" in South Korea, the sources said. Pyongyang has yet to show any official reaction to Moscow's proposal for the eight-party conference. Russia, which wants to play the role of "peace protector," is not in a position to support North Korea in the nuclear dispute. It will nevertheless stress its opposition to United Nations sanctions against North Korea. Another problem drawing keen interest is what the two countries will do with regard to the Pyongyang-Moscow accord, especially the Military Mutual Assistance Treaty. In February 1993, Russia sent then-Vice Foreign Minister Georgiy Kunadze to Pyongyang and explained to North Korea that "the automatic intervention clause" of the Military Assistance Treaty would have to be interpreted in accordance with the changed situation in the post-Cold War era. The clause had stipulated that the former Soviet Union would automatically intervene militarily if North Korea was attacked by outside forces. At that time, North Korea reportedly replied that it would send Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu to Moscow for further discussion of the problem. But the visit has not been realized and the question remains one of the major issues pending between Moscow and Pyongyang. The Moscow-Pyongyang Military Alliance Treaty expires at the end of 1995 and unless either one renounces it unilaterally, it will automatically be extended for another five years. Another issue bothering Pyongyang concerns North Korean loggers at Siberian camps. North Korea is reportedly trying to block any escaped loggers from settling in South Korea. Insisting that all North Korean loggers who fled their camps in Siberia are "criminals," North Korea is demanding their detention under judicial and forestry agreements signed by the two countries. Against this North Korean claim, the Moscow government maintains that any foreigners in Russia can leave for third countries if they take the proper legal steps. In this regard, Russia and South Korea are currently discussing resettlement of fleeing North Korean loggers in the South and, sources believe, they will eventually be able to do so although it may take some time. The Russian-North Korean forestry agreement expired at the end of last year and the two are renegotiating the pact. With regard to President Kim Yong-sam's visit, which is some 20 days away, North Korea is worried that it might "pour cold water" on Moscow-Pyongyang relations, which have been warming up of late.
