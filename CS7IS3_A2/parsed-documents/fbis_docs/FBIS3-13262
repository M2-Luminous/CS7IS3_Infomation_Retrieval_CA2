Yesterday was the fifth day of violent incidents in the Gaza Strip. A 15-year-old youth was killed and some 20 people were wounded, and two fugitives were captured in a special operation yesterday. Nisim Qeynan reports: For a week, there have been serious daily incidents in the Gaza Strip. A wide-ranging operation to capture fugitives was conducted in the Dayr al-Balah refugee camp. A curfew was clamped on the camp, and the security forces operated in a highly populated area to capture two wanted men, Hasan Abu-Daramah and Zayid Hasinat, 21, belonging to the Fatah Hawks, and four others who sheltered them. Palestinians rioted to disturb the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] efforts to apprehend the fugitives. At one stage, the rioters shot at the soldiers. One was slightly wounded, and another was hit by stones. The soldiers fired at the rioting mob, killing a 15-year-old youth. During the searches for the wanted men, antitank missiles were fired at several houses in which fugitives were suspected to be hiding, and the buildings sustained serious damage. In additional searches in the area, many weapons were found. The two detained fugitives are suspected of firing at security forces in Dayr al-Balah. In other locations, 15-20 people were wounded in rioting in the Jabalyah refugee camp, al-Shati', Rafah, and Khan Yunus, according to Palestinian sources. During the incidents in Gaza, a border policeman was slightly wounded when hit by stones and was taken to the hospital. The IDF is on an especially high alert on Fridays. The curfew imposed on many areas will be lifted for two hours to enable the residents to stock up on food. The closure continues until decided otherwise. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0500 GMT on 11 March adds details on incidents at other locations in the territories yesterday. "In Tulkarm, an Israeli truck driver was lightly hurt from glass fragments in a stone-throwing attack when his windshield was shattered, and in Hebron, a shock grenade was hurled at an Army patrol. The grenade went off. No one was hurt and no damage was caused."]
