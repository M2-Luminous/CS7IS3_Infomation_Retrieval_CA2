Kebich pointed out that "there should be no question of the exchange rate of the Belarusian and Russian currencies until the interstate agreement is signed." The rate of exchange of Belarusian rubles and the timeliness of the changeover are the main issues for the two countries' expert groups to solve, according to the Belarusian prime minister. The forthcoming signing of the Russo-Belarusian agreement to merge the two countries' monetary systems "is of no threat to the sovereignty of Belarus," Kebich told a meeting of industrialists in Minsk on Tuesday. Speaking on the launch of an indefinite political strike in Belarus, which independent unions scheduled for February 15, the prime minister described this action as "an attempt to disrupt the signing of the vital documents on the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus." Meanwhile, according to Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, the development of the mechanisms aimed at unifying the two countries' monetary systems is likely to be completed by the end of February. After this we shall be able to develop our own approach to the problem, said Shokhin. He believes that the unification of the monetary systems is only possible if the two countries' national interests are taken into account. Sources close to the Russian Cabinet have told Interfax that Moscow links the possibility of the arrival in Minsk of a Russian delegation to finalize the monetary-union talks to the completion of the work by experts on the problem. A representative of the Russian delegation which recently returned from Minsk has told Interfax that the Russian side suggested at the talks the exchange of rubles for belarusian national coupons in line with the non-cash rate of 1:3, and in cash 1:1. Belarus insists on the exchange of both cash and non-cash money at a rate of 1:1. The chairman of the Duma subcommittee for credit and monetary policies, former Russian finance minister Boris Fedorov believes that Russia's benefits from the two systems unification are doubtful. If there are any, these are political benefits, he said. In an interview with Interfax, Fedorov said that Belarus, which practically had yet to carry out any free market reforms and which is now in an energy crisis with an inflation rate of 45% over the past two months, is, no doubt, interested in receiving the more stable Russian currency. But what is Russia's benefit, I do not understand, he said. Fedorov believes that after he stepped down, Yegor Gaydar left and the speaker of the Belarusian parliament Stanislav Shushkevich resigned, there are no longer any forces capable of preventing the hasty unification of the two countries' monetary systems. He also believes it necessary to investigate the possible consequences of the unification for Russia and to discuss the problem at the Duma's planning and budgetary committee.
