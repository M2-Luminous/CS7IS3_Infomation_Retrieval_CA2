S. Chernomyrdin held talks at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here this morning. In "a sincere and friendly atmosphere" the two sides exchanged views on bilateral ties and international issues of mutual concern. Chernomyrdin arrived here Thursday [26 May] morning for a four- day official visit. On bilateral ties, Li expressed his satisfaction with their healthy and smooth development. China attaches great importance to its ties with Russia, Li said, adding that it constitutes a major part of China's foreign policy to develop long-term, stable and good-neighborly ties with Russia. This is also the common aspiration of the two peoples, Li said. "The Chinese Government and people are willing to constantly enrich the friendly co-operation, together with Russian side, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," Li said. China and Russia are two nations with global influence. The expansion of their ties is not only in the fundamental interests of the two sides, but also conducive to the peace and development of the region and the world, Li stated. Li described the overall development of the bilateral economic and trade relations in recent years as "good". The two-way trade volume hit 7.68 billion U.S. Dollars-worth last year, well above the record in the days of the old Soviet Union, he said. The geographical proximity and economic complementarity provide the economic and trade co-operation of various forms with many advantages, a great potential and bright prospects, Li said. However, the present level of economic and trade co-operation is not high enough, Li conceded. The two sides should further upgrade their co-operative level and quality, explore new opportunities and encourage enterprises with credit on both sides to reinforce their co-operation so as to best play their role as the mainstay of bilateral co-operation. In economic and trade relations, both sides should stick to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, Li said. So long as the two sides take positive attitudes and enhance macro-control, the problems emerging from the growing economic and trade ties can be gradually resolved, thus creating more favorable conditions for the economic and trade co-operation between the two countries' localities and enterprises, Li said. While noting the long and traditional contacts between the two peoples, Chernomyrdin said his visit is aimed at furthering friendly co-operation. The seven agreements to be signed here embody the healthy and stable growth of the bilateral links, he said. Touching on the agreement concerning the Sino-Russian borders, Chernomyrdin told his Chinese host that it is his hope that the border will remain forever as one of peace, friendship and co- operation, and bestow happiness on the two peoples. Referring to the border trade and co-operation as the major part of Sino-Russian economic and trade co-operation, Li said that they should continue to develop and be given active guidance. The improvement of transportation is crucial in the further development of the bilateral trade and economic co-operation, Li said. He cited the Euroasian rail links, saying they should be given high priority and be fully employed. In the meantime, the railways in the border areas of the two countries' eastern parts should be dovetailed, Li said, suggesting that China and Russia reinforce their co-operation in this respect. Chernomyrdin expressed agreement with Li's proposal. The Euroasian railways are important, he said. The Siberian Railway should also be perfected and made full use of, he added. Both leaders agreed that today's talks were fruitful and they will serve to propel the good-neighborly and mutually beneficial co- operation, especially the economic and trade ties, according to Chinese sources. The two prime ministers also exchanged views on international issues. Both held that the enhancement of their co-operation in world affairs will play a significant role in Asia's stability and security as well as in the overall improvement of international environment. On behalf of the Russian Government, Chernomyrdin invited Li to visit Russia. Li accepted it. Following the talks, the two prime ministers signed two governmental agreements concerning the management of borders and the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. They also presided over the signing of five other documents. They were: the memorandum of the Second Session of the Sino-Russian Joint Commission on Economic, Trade and Technical Co-Operation, the agreement between the two governments on the economic and technical co-operation of agricultural and industrial complexes, the agreement between the two governments on environmental protection cooperation, and the agreement between the two governments on the joint protection, regulation and value-addition of fishery resources on the Heilongjiang and Wusuli Rivers. Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin were among those present on the occasion. Later, Li Lanqing hosted a banquet in honor of the Russian visitors.
