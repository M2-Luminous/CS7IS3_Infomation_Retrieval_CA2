PLO security men arrived by grace of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], closely examined military installations, conferred, took notes and marked their maps. But aside from the first reserve duty orders going out to transport and logistical units, and construction started on a fence by the Erez checkpoint at the northern entrance to the strip, real movement has yet to be seen. The trucks stand idle. Even the kitchens are not being disassembled, nor are the men packing up the stores of office equipment at field command posts. Israel is signaling the PLO that nothing will move until the end of the negotiations in Cairo and other secret channels. The detailed plan drawn up by the general staff's planning and quartermaster branches calls for transferring bases, posts, observation points and units from the heart of Arab settlements in the strip, particularly in Gaza city, Dir al-Balah, Rafiah and Han-Yunis, to locations close to the strip's Jewish settlements. The reserve units that received call-up orders this week will start to "fold up" everything they can at the end of December--transport and communications units, operations offices, medical units and storerooms. The first to break camp will be the logistical units; the combat echelon will go only at the end of the process. The military courts and advocate general units will also be "folded up." A number of IDF outposts and lookout points within the refugee camps will be evacuated last. The picture is already clear: Israeli soldiers leaving and young Palestinians overrunning the turrets with the Palestinian flag in their hands. Map The IDF forces will redeploy in a coordinated operation, whose timetable has recently been fixed, in three enclaves close to the strip's Jewish settlements. It is scheduled to take place in April, 1994. For deploying forces outside the strip, the IDF has been equipped with mobile housing units that will be set up in a number of places yet to be finally decided. From the north, the IDF will guard the Erez checkpoint and the Nativ-Ha'ashara-Nisanit bloc of settlements and control a coastal observation post in the region. There, as in the other enclaves, the army will put up new outposts, observation points over the roads and intelligence stations. Near Netzerim, deep in Gaza, the IDF will station a reinforced contingent whose sole purpose will be protection of the settlement. The same arrangement will be made at Kafr-Drom, a sensitive point in the southern part of the strip. IDF command posts will be transferred to a central HQ in the Gush Qatif region, the site of the greatest concentration of Jewish settlements. The bloc will be protected by a series of outposts and lookout stations, some of which will form a barrier between it and neighboring Han-Yunis to prevent infiltration of the bloc from the refugee camp. Eytan Hadari, security coordinator for Ganei Tal, says, "We worked with a senior field commander this week on marking out the places where army camps and lookout posts will go between Han-Yunis and Gush Qatif. Some of the positions in Ganei Tal and Netzer-Hazani have already started to be built." The redeployment of the IDF, explains a senior army official, is based on the following principles: providing maximal security to Jewish residents using bypass routes, traffic "as minimal as possible" on the strip's main roads, and maximum control of the coastal border through shore observation points and regular naval patrols to prevent infiltration by terrorists and smuggling. The plan devised in the Planning and Quartermaster branches calls for large forces around the Jewish settlements and reinforced units on the roads. The presence of massive army forces around the settlements will be felt at night. Netzer and Kafr Drom will look like closed camps surrounded by heavy military traffic. IDF teams are now busy drawing up new operational techniques for the "Samson" unit, which operates in the strip. The IDF is very worried by the possible conversion of the autonomy areas into havens for terrorists. Senior defense officials had no unequivocal answers to that this week. "That worries us more than those fringe elements who are making a fuss over the call-up orders we sent out this week. Our main problem is how to catch a terrorist who carries out an attack and flees into Palestinian territory." The IDF agreed this week to make additional concessions to the Palestinians. A document setting forth Israeli security views stated that Israel does not see any role for UN forces or observers in Gaza and that no need exists for a foreign or international presence on matters affecting relations between Israelis and Palestinians. In the Cairo talks, however, the sides agreed that an international observer force might be introduced into Gaza. Its composition and location are still not clear. The Israeli demand for scattered security zones, in which entry by Palestinians for construction and farm work would be prohibited, also has softened. Palestinians will be able to stay in some of these areas on a limited basis. Israel has also promised a gradual release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Further, the IDF has agreed to hand over Gaza's central prison to the Palestinians, who will take control of the 300 criminals now incarcerated there. Dozens of television crews will arrive in the coming weeks to record the withdrawal from Gaza for posterity. Every truck driving out on its way to Israel will be accompanied by hoots from the locals and sighs of relief from the soldiers. The IDF estimates that the cost of redeployment will be half a billion dollars. Most of the investment will be in improving the fence system and isolating the strip, rebuilding bypass routes and shifting command posts. Some structures will be handed over to the Palestinian police. There is no intention to leave scorched earth. The defense establishment this week was even considering selling arms to the PLO to provide the Palestinian police an initial base for operations. The settlers are very touchy about that, but a senior source in Southern Command said this week, "I'm even for giving them some armored cars so they can quickly get a strong grip on the territory."
