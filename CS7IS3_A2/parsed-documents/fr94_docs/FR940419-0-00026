FR940419-0-00026 FR940419-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Mine Safety and Health Administration 30 CFR Part 75 RIN 1219&hyph;AA11 Safety Standards for Underground Coal Mine Ventilation AGENCY: Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Labor. ACTION: Extension of administrative stay and extension of effectiveness. SUMMARY: MSHA is extending the stay of the effective date of two safety standards for ventilation of underground coal mines to allow completion of a rulemaking involving these and other ventilation standards. MSHA is also extending the effectiveness of three standards to allow the completion of this rulemaking. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 19, 1994. Sections 75.313 and 75.344(a)(1) in 30 CFR part 75 are stayed until completion of a rulemaking involving these and other ventilation standards. Sections 75.314, 75.315 and 75.345 in 30 CFR part 75 will continue in effect until completion of the rulemaking. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia W. Silvey, Director, Office of Standards, Regulations and Variances, MSHA, phone (703) 235&hyph;1910. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 15, 1992, MSHA published a final rule revising its safety standards for ventilation of underground coal mines (57 FR 20868). These standards were to take effect on August 16, 1992. On August 6, 1992, MSHA delayed the effective date of the rule until November 16, 1992, to allow mine operators time to effectively plan and implement necessary changes (57 FR 34683). On November 13, 1992, as a result of discussions with the mining community, MSHA administratively stayed the effective date of §§75.313 and 75.344(a)(1) until July 1, 1993 (57 FR 53856). Section 75.313 was stayed to allow MSHA to further evaluate the effect of fan stoppages in certain mines. Section 75.344(a)(1) was stayed to evaluate whether requiring portable compressors to be located in a noncombustible structure or area could create a fire hazard due to overheating. MSHA also recodified the provisions these standards were to replace as §§75.314, 75.315 and 75.345. On June 7, 1993, MSHA extended the stay until July 1, 1994 (58 FR 31908). Consistent with the stay extension, the recodified provisions continue in effect until July 1, 1994 (58 FR 33996). As a result of meetings with the mining public and further review of the ventilation rule, the Agency is initiating a rulemaking to address the issues which prompted the stay. On December 30, 1993, MSHA published a notice (58 FR 69312) proposing to extend the stay until completion of a rulemaking involving these and other ventilation standards. The Agency received comments from interested parties concurring with the proposed extension. By this notice the Agency is extending the stay of §§75.313 and 75.344(a)(1) until completion of the ventilation rulemaking. This notice does not affect the indefinite suspension of §75.321(a) (57 FR 55457). That action was in response to an order of the United States Court of Appeals which stayed §75.321(a) indefinitely, pending court review. American Mining Congress v. Secretary of Labor, No. 92&hyph;1288, and consolidated cases (D.C. Cir., filed July 8, 1992) (Order of November 16, 1992). Authority: This document is issued under 30 U.S.C. 811. Dated: April 14, 1994. J. Davitt McAteer, Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9393 Filed 4&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;43&hyph;P
