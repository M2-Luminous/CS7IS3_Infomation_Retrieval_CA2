FBIS4-48254 "drafr095_e_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia NPFL Prepared To Provide 2,500 Men for Standing Army NPFL Prepared To Provide 2,500 Men for Standing Army AB1605164694 Gbarnga Radio ELRL in English 1400 GMT 16 May 94 AB1605164694 Gbarnga Radio ELRL English BFN [Excerpt] As the campaign for the formation of a standing national transitional army for Liberia continues, the leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], the largest faction in the conflict, says it is prepared to provide 2,500 men for the standing army. The leader of the NPFL, President Charles Gankay Taylor, said both ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and the AFL [Armed Forces of Liberia] could provide 1,500 men each to beef up the transitional army. He said the three factions in Liberia already have trained men and only need to get together for better acquaintance. We can begin providing uniforms and equipment for our own army, President Taylor continued. The former NPRAG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government] president said: There is a dire need to form a transitional army in order to constitutionally safeguard the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Liberia. He said the alien military force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], dominated by Nigerian armed aggressors, have demonstrated their inability to stop the Liberian crisis by directly facilitating war. President Taylor said: It is constitutionally improper for a government to be in place without a protecting army of its own. The NPFL leader cited revelations of direct Nigerian-ECOMOG support for LPC [Liberia Peace Council] bandits in southeastern Liberia and expressed regret that while there was a cease-fire in place, the so-called peacekeepers were still waging war on the people of Liberia. He noted that the mission of the NPFL to restore democracy, justice, and peace has still not been accomplished. The CIC [commander in chief] then commended senior officers and commanders of the NPFL for their bravery and sacrifices and repeated the commitment of the NPFL to continue to abide by the Cotonou Accord, despite its imperfections, as a way of moving the peace process forward.
