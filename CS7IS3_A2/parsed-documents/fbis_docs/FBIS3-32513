This press release signed by Bernard Sansaricq says: The Senate office makes it a point to inform national and international institutions and the general public that, following the Senate resolution of 4 February dissolving the former office headed by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, and following the new elections that were held, Senator Jean-Louis is no longer empowered to represent, or to make commitments on the part of, the Senate. This new office is headed by Bernard Sansaricq and made up of a number of legislators elected in the contested 18 January elections. This office was formed the day after the visit to the Senate by U.S. Ambassador William Lacy Swing. The U.S. diplomat had openly brought his support to Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, head of the office formed in August, 1993. It was thus in response to this step by the U.S. ambassador that the other senators decided to form a new office. Edner Jean filed a report: [Begin recording] [Jean] Thus, hesitation has ended. The contested legislators elected in the 18 January elections, supported by five regular senators from the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP], on 4 February made good on their warning. The resolution to dismiss him -- that sword of Damocles that had been hanging over his head -- finally fell upon Firmin Jean-Louis, and his position as head of the Senate was put to a vote by the antiestablishment senators, who opted for the split. In their complaints, the senators reproached the legally elected president of the National Assembly for his lack of capability and, mostly, for his unconditional support to the Malval government with a view to imposing on Haitian territory the consequences, so hastily planned, of the embargo supported by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Such an attitude, deemed detrimental to the interests of Haiti in general, was interpreted by the contested legislators and the ACP senators as an act of high treason. However, it is basically the U.S. ambassador's visit to Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis that prompted the events. [Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton] Considering that, to crown the infamy, Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the Senate of the Republic, met with U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing on 3 February to sign with him a joint statement on official Senate letterhead, as if Swing were a Haitian senator; and considering that the Senate office as currently constituted is a cause of tension and exacerbation of the political crisis the country is in; and considering that it is the duty of the Senate faction that is still sane and responsible to shoulder, in this serious circumstance, its patriotic responsibilities in conformity with the duly validated mandate it received from the voters of the nation's nine geographical departments; and considering that for all those reasons, it is urgent that those legislators take measures to protect the collective interest, which is in danger: Article 1: As of today the Senate office formed by acclamation on 10 August 1993 is and remains dismissed. [end recording] [Jean] Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton, who was seen as the future replacement for Firmim Jean-Louis -- he had officially announced his candidacy -- withdrew that candidacy at the last moment in favor of Bernard Sansaricq. Dupiton considered that he had already played the role of Saint John the Baptist, having been the first to shout in the desert to demand the dismissal of the legal Senate office. Dupiton wants to pass the ball to Sansaricq, whom he looks upon as Jesus, the messiah who will come to free the Senate and the country as a whole. Bernard Sansaricq, then, has been unanimously elected head of the ACP [Senate] office and the contested legislators elected on 18 January. Sansaricq is assisted by Ronel Manigat, as vice president, one of the contested legislators elected on 18 January. Ebrane Cadet, the acting president who just completed his mission, has become first secretary. The only woman among the senators was elected second secretary; and Osny Eugene, another contested legislator elected on 18 January, is the quaestor. [end recording]
