"The results of Mr. Christopher's talks in Israel show that there are still wide differences because of the Israeli position on the principles of peace," he said. Christopher left for Egypt on Wednesday after a second round of talks with President Hafiz al-Asad, when he briefed the Syrian leader on his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Israel has offered a withdrawal from the strategic Golan heights over several years in return for total peace, but the Syrian official press on Wednesday rejected any phased handover. The Golan has been the main stumbling block between Israel and Syria since the launch of Middle East peace talks in October 1991. Negotiations between Syria and Israel have been suspended since the Hebron massacre on February 25 when a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshipers.
