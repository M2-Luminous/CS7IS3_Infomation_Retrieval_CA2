Amirkahar, who is the former USNO president, and other officials have been submitting their membership forms to PBS President Datuk Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan over the past few days. Pairin confirmed today that they have become full-fledged members of the PBS since the party constitution requires that those standing on a PBS ticket must be a party member. "It is a temporary measure to comply with the PBS constitution," he told reporters here after witnessing the Sabah Premier League players sign their contract with the State Football Association. Pairin said once the election was over, these leaders could resign from the PBS and join USNO Baru [New] or any other party. "If USNO Baru is registered, they can resign from the PBS and join USNO Baru. There is nothing complicated about it," he said. Pairin said the move to make them members was not to force them to remain in the PBS. When contacted today, PBS-Plus Codirector of Operations Mohamed Naser Mohamed Noor who quit his post yesterday, said there was no longer a PBS-Plus grouping and Amirkahar's group had betrayed their supporters by joining the PBS. Naser, who was the political secretary to Amirkahar, said the move would result in thousands of USNO supporters abandoning their support for Amirkahar and his group. He said he would work hard to ensure these supporters back the Barisan Nasional [National Front]. [passage omitted]
