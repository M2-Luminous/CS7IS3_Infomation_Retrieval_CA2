They prescribed a specialist in Baghdad for him and told him that this doctor would find him a cure and would end his struggle with the disease. The man borrowed a sum of money, left part of it with his family, and came to the capital with 300 Iraqi dinars [ID] in his pocket. According to his account, his family would have been delighted when he returned in sound health. The man went to Baghdad, from street to street and bus to bus, until he found his way to the doctor's clinic, but he was shocked to find that admission to the doctor was "commercial." He asked for an explanation, and they told him: If you are in a hurry, you have to pay more to enter before others. If you have no money, register and wait. The man heard this advice and said to himself: I'll wait; it is better and less costly. He was directed to the secretary so that he could register, but a major disaster occurred because the examination fee was ID100. Medical Specialists and Practitioners Abuse Price Schedule for Medical Services The story of Uncle Kazim is an appropriate entry into the world of medicine and into a discussion of the fees of doctors and their private clinics. Come with us to the world of the angels of mercy. Medicine is not a business. The complaints we hear about high fees and the high cost of drugs, tests, and medical analyses should not be extended or generalized to the rest of private clinics, which are still maintaining their humaneness. The story of exploiting medicine and selling it on sidewalks and in bandage shops must be ended. Every citizen has the right to treatment and medicine, and he must be able to obtain them without being exploited. How can that be achieved? Some of these clinics have very unfortunately been turned into profit-seeking commercial centers and are trading on people's illnesses, especially those people who cannot pay the price to restore their health. For many years, the state has enjoyed excellent health planning, which begins at the point of citizen health awareness and never ends, because medicine is an ever-changing science, advancing minute by minute. From the start, the state has enacted laws eliminating exploitation and monopolization, liberating the citizen from the "deceit" that was being practiced by some, and moving toward "openness," so that the citizen may be free of ailments. Our society has rid itself of all that, thanks to the Iraqi citizen's cultural growth and the expansion of his scientific understanding. Because we do not wish to return to that dark age in the life of our people, we must put a stop to the high fees of doctors' private clinics. The doctor in his clinic should be more relaxed and ready to talk and listen to the patient, in contrast to the situation in the hospital. Certainly, the doctor should think about his private clinic's reputation and seek clients for it. If he only had the same feelings about his work in the hospital, perhaps the picture would change. Some doctors comment on this situation, saying that analyzing the situation in this way does doctors a disservice, since the patient is the same, as is the disease and the medicine. However, many are referred to the hospital, and the severe overcrowding causes the doctor not to give the same care to the referred patient. Perhaps he cannot diagnose the patient's condition. We have heard that certain doctors in hospitals suffer from that a great deal, with the number of patients referred reaching up to 1,000 a day, and sometimes even more! This excuse might be acceptable, but why the excessively high fees for the examination? Is it reasonable for fees to be ID100 in certain private clinics? In certain dental clinics, the cost goes up to ID1,000 when the visit is repeated. The fee to pull a tooth is ID100. Those who cannot pay suffer from toothaches. Should one have to suffer from a toothache? May God protect us and you from the evil of pain. Who is responsible for monitoring doctors' clinics, their fees, and their violations? There are many medical clinics that have a sign bearing the medical specialist's name, but the general practitioner who works there demands a specialist's fees. We think that sometimes there are two signs for one doctor: the first with the name of a general practitioner and the second with the name of a specialist! We have become convinced that lack of supervision has made matters lax. Violations have become complaints that everybody talks about, despite the fact that doctors' official fees are set by law and are ID10 for a specialist and ID5 for a general practitioner. Therefore, receiving a payment that is more than that is a clear and distinct violation of the law. The practical certainty is that diagnosis is half the treatment and perhaps requires the patient to visit laboratories, undergo analysis and examinations, and have X rays. The cost of these services has become excessively high. Doing the simplest analysis is not less than ID50; X rays exceed ID100, and the simplest visit to these laboratories costs ID500 and, sometimes, as high as ID1,000. As for the reason for these high prices, we have heard from many doctors that some of it is because of the blockade, the high prices that the medical market demands, and the current shortage of solutions used in analytical processes, which are imported materials that the iniquitous blockade keeps out of the country and the prices of which have become unreal. This cost is inevitably obtained from the patient, but the consideration is not always money, since there is a greater issue, man's health. From what we have also heard, there are erroneous diagnoses as a result of using commercial medical analytic solutions that are not of the same caliber of medical solutions that used to be imported by the state. Some doctors have converted their private clinics into hospitals in which the patient finds various therapeutic services. We do not call these services harmful, but they might be unnecessary or of no value to the referred patient. However, the doctor suggests having them, and each one costs something. In the clinic of one doctor who specializes in fractures and bone surgery, we have seen a room for natural treatment, another for orthopedics, a third room for examinations, and a hall for physical therapy. In order that the patient may reach a certain degree of recovery, he must periodically be referred to have physical therapy and pass through all of these rooms, all the while paying the fees. Patient 'Ala' Hamid underwent an ankle operation in Dr. H.K.'s clinic. The operation cost him ID5,000, which was just the doctor's fee; ID1,000 in fees for the hospital room; and nearly ID500 for medicine. Since the operation two months ago, he has paid nearly ID2,000 and is still being referred to his private doctor because he has not completely healed. He pays for each referral. I asked him: What do you do? [Hamid] I'm a government employee. [Matashar] Where did you get the money? [Hamid] This money was for emergencies, and I spent it in the hospital. [Matashar] Why didn't you have the operation in a government hospital? [Hamid] They advised me in the national hospital, and I took their word. [Matashar] Why? [Hamid] One day after the operation, they put me out. I paid my money and my referrals to the doctor's clinic began. I even sold my wife's gold, and the journey continues. Another patient told us about the quest for treatment for his illness (heart). He said: "God is the healer. Health is great happiness. One does not know its value, until it is lost, God forbid. [Matashar] How about doctors' fees? [Patient] Doctors are human beings...they are good persons. They help the sick and are generous with them. I have been referred to many clinics, and I have seen those who pay their examination fees out of their daily food money. There are doctors who set aside one day a week to see the poor. I was one who was referred on this day. This doctor hung a sign that said that the examination and treatment were free for those who could not pay. On the other hand, there are private clinics with exorbitant prices. They have reached the point of not being able to differentiate between black and white. Money becomes the primary concern. It is strange that we have begun to hear about the urgent reservation and the ordinary reservation. This is inhumane. It is not right to expose our society to this, because treatment and medicine should be for all, not just for the wealthy but not the poor. We also question whether the blockade has affected food supplies and medicine. Is it true that it affects humanitarian dealings? The answer, of course, is well known. The private dental clinics attract unhappy talk. Fees in these clinics have reached abnormal heights. The extraction of a tooth, ID100; simple gum therapy, ID75; examination, ID50; ordinary filling, ID100; root filling, ID300; operation to extract a wisdom tooth, ID500; manufacture and fitting of a movable tooth, ID300; fixed tooth, ID400; manufacture of a full set of teeth, ID1,000. In Dr. J.K.'s clinic, which specializes in internal and heart diseases, we broached the matter with one of those referred. She was a doctor who came with one of her ailing relatives because she was acquainted with the doctor's skill and his knowledge. He is a professor at the Medical College and a fellow of the largest medical college in the world. This doctor--the referral--thinks the problem of rising medical fees has become apparent in the last few years. It is a case that is linked to the general situation and should not be overblown or media-hyped. The problem will end when matters are stabilized. We asked her: Why did it appear recently? She said: "Because medicine is a skill. The doctor has a right to take an appropriate fee in exchange for his skill or service that he gives to the citizen. The doctor is also a human being who deserves a certain standard of living, along with a car and the ownership of a home, so that he feels that his work has not been in vain." Good, but those who cannot pay? "I don't believe that there are those who cannot pay. Even if such a person is found, he has government hospitals; their doors are open to all." But the patient seeks the best service. "Yes, everything has a price." We spoke with another referral, named Sami 'Abdallah. We asked him, what's the problem? He said: "When you are referred, the doctor in the government hospital deals with you in a sullen manner. You are then forced to visit him in his private clinic, and, when you buy his full services, you are welcomed with a smiling face." Another patient said: "Doctors are not the only problem." What is the problem? "Medicine and searching for someone who sells it. Making the rounds of pharmacies and bandage shops. The black market." As opposed to our findings on this tour, there was a contrary view. Dr. A.S. talked to us about the concerns of doctors, which start with establishing the clinic. In Baghdad, this costs ID150,000 in areas far from the city center, while on the main streets it reaches ID500,000 and perhaps ID1 million. There is also the cost of medical equipment. Some systems cost ID100,000 or ID150,000, but they are necessary in private clinics. In addition, there are the high costs of services, such as rent, secretarial, etc. There are other reasons for the wave of universally high costs, which are linked to the iniquitous blockade imposed upon our country. With regard to the doctor's humaneness, our interlocutor said: "It is unreasonable to think that a doctor would not be humane. First, and above all, he has compassion. Therefore, he does not begrudge helping those who need it. I don't believe that any doctor would refuse to offer his services to the ill." It only remains to say that the Physicians Union, to which we offered a summary of this report, apparently intends not to intervene in this problem. It preferred to remain silent, despite our insistence in obtaining its opinion. However, the Cabinet has formed a special committee to study doctors' fees, preparatory to drafting a special price list. This committee is composed of representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Physicians Union, and other agencies.
