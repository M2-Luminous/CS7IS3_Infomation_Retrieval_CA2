Is it not true that Rauf Denktash is playing some kind of game just to keep busy, rather than trying to come to a solution? [Kliridhis] What is being discussed right now certainly is not the solution for the Cyprus problem, but could be called confidence-building measures. Such measures can only be a first step in restoring a favorable climate. We are conducting these negotiations at UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's request, and we consider it quite an improvement that the United Nations has sent a mediator and the European Union an observer here. We are adhering to our final goal of a peaceful restoration of the country's unity. At this stage, the main purpose is to restore general confidence. This principle also was accepted by Denktash, after his elections (on 13 December 1993, editor). However, this does not mean that we will be ready very soon to sign agreements or even to lay down an agenda for possible future steps. [Schlomer] One could, however, get the impression that Rauf Denktash is hiding behind all kinds of excuses so as not to make any progress at all. First, we had to wait for his elections, now he is waiting for the outcome of the Turkish municipal elections on 27 March. These elections might result in a political earthquake. [Kliridhis] It is not inconceivable that Denktash is trying to buy time. I have known him for many years. I have had many discussions with him, and I can see through his tactics. The situation in Turkey clearly is deteriorating, and these municipal elections even might jeopardize the government coalition. In a way, these confidence-building measures were forced upon Denktash, and he does not like the idea. The Ciller government wants some kind of settlement for Cyprus, and therefore is exerting pressure on Denktash. The present dialogue could be one step in that process, but Denktash's position could change if a different coalition were formed in Ankara. Finally, he also wants to gain advantages that are not offered in the UN-proposed package, which is why he is maneuvering this way. I know these tactics. [Schlomer] The UN package mainly provides for the reopening of Nicosia's International Airport, and for the restoration of access to Varosha, in both cases under UN control. Is Varosha such an important symbol to you? [Kliridhis] Before the occupation, the seaside resort of Varosha in the east, near Famagusta, was a famous tourist center attracting Turkish, Greek, and foreign visitors. Now it is a desolate and dilapidated ghost town, cut off from the outside world by barbed wire. The telephone and electricity systems as well as streets and houses are destroyed, and it will take at least $2 billion to make the town inhabitable again. However, if the occupier would make the town freely accessible, some 20,000 people could return to their homes. This cannot be achieved overnight, but Varosha could be made livable within five years. It is a symbol to the extent that the Cyprus problem would not be solved by the reopening of Varosha, but it at least would become a place where both communities could meet in peace. It could create a change of mentality, and the Turkish myth that we can no longer live together could be unmasked. Varosha could become some sort of a test case, a stepping stone toward future developments. The United Nations also would consider this a success because, believe me, they really are watching closely to see which party is taking an unreasonable position. [Schlomer] Your policy's second objective is to join the European Union [EU]. Can you imagine a situation in which the Republic of Cyprus would be part of the EU while Turkey would still occupy the northern part of the country? [Kliridhis] Listen, the international community wants a solution to the Cyprus conflict. The EU, which is sympathetic toward our accession, will reassess our membership request from 1 January 1995 onward. Europe insists that a political solution be found for Cyprus by then. However, even if no solution is found, our membership request will still be reassessed. Anyway, since we cannot join the EU before 1996, many problems can still be solved by then. In the meantime, we continue to work and already have done much work on harmonizing our legislation with the laws prevailing in the EU. We are meeting practically all conditions for accession. If we adopt a constructive attitude during the various talks, Europe can hardly penalize Cyprus by not admitting it, even if part of it would not be free. The European observer is reporting continuously to Brussels, and he is a firsthand witness to our positive attitude. That is why it is so important that the EU decided to send an observer. [Schlomer] Allow me to play devil's advocate. One might say that Cyprus is a small, far-off island, situated somewhere near the Syrian and Israeli coastlines. Why on earth should this island join the EU? [Kliridhis] The political parties on Cyprus, as anywhere else, have different views and argue about all sorts of issues. But there is absolute unanimity about one thing: Everyone wants to join the European Union, all political parties, the entire population. Including the communists, especially after the fall of the Eastern Bloc. Even the people from the northern, occupied part of Cyprus want to join the EU. I am quite sure of that. And this is not only true for businessmen, who expect economic benefits from the EU. We have been part of Europe for several millenia, our European traditions are innumerable, so it is only natural that we should become a formal member state of the EU. Just ask anyone in the street whether or not he feels European. In addition, our geographic position is interesting for the Union: we are at the crossroads between different continents, and the EU could play an important role in the region through Cyprus. Cyprus always has functioned as a bridge, and it could play this role even more efficiently as an EU member state. The EU without Cyprus is like an unfinished building. [Schlomer] Do you not have the impression that the world has somewhat forgotten about Cyprus? Some countries who have UN Blue Helmets stationed here believe that 20 years is enough, and already have hinted that they may recall their peacekeepers. [Kliridhis] As far as your last remark is concerned, it is true that some countries are recalling their blue helmets from Cyprus, but I do not see why this should be a major problem. Other countries already have offered to send peacekeeping forces to the demarcation line on Cyprus, such as Argentina, Hungary, Romania, and some former Soviet republics. The cost of the stationing should not be exaggerated, either: the operation costs $40 million a year, and Greece and Cyprus together pay half of that amount. By the way, I am a strong advocate of a continued presence of UN blue helmets on the island because they form an essential factor of our security. As regards the world's attention to Cyprus, I believe it is slowly coming back. I perfectly understand that Europe has had other things on its mind in recent years: the fall of the communist regimes in East Europe, the new republics on the continent and in the former Soviet Union, and the terrible tragedy in the former Yugoslavia. I understand that all these issues pushed Cyprus somewhat into the background. The same goes for the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which is presently taking place not so very far from here: the world's attention is focused on that problem rather than on ours. In addition, the situation on Cyprus is -- fortunately -- quiet. Attention also slackened a little because of that. [Schlomer] But your Greek friends are presently presiding over the European Union. Can they not support Cyprus a little more? [Kliridhis] Being president is often useful to determine an agenda, but a president cannot simply promote any issue it wants. Greece may be president, but it also is up to its neck in the all-embracing Balkans conflict, which has a certain paralyzing effect. Its dispute with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] also is taking much of its energy. I talked to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou shortly before Greece became EU president, and I will meet with him again in mid-June on Rhodes; the United Nations currently is working very hard on the Cyprus issue; the European observer is keeping Cyprus in the spotlight in Brussels. So, Cyprus certainly is back on the world agenda.
