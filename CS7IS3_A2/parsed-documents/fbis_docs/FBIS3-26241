Economic issues will also be formally put into today's agenda, the first time for both sides to talk about economic issues. The following is a report by Yang Chin-hui. [Begin recording] [Yang Chin-hui] Just as they failed to reach a consensus on the ideas of judicial jurisdiction, the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] still stick to their own ideas about issues concerning protecting Taiwan investors' rights and interests on the mainland, another focal point of the Chiao-Tang talks. At the second round of the Chiao-Tang talks, ARATS Executive Vice Chairman Tang Shubei brought up economic issues for discussion. Commenting on the SEF's demand to sign an agreement on protecting Taiwan investors' rights and interests on the mainland, Tang said in a strong tone: If Taiwan hopes that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will sign a nongovernmental agreement on protecting Taiwan investors' rights and interests on the mainland, Taiwan should open a two-way channel for cross-strait economic and trade exchanges on a mutually beneficial and reciprocal basis. Otherwise, I would like to ask the SEF what Taiwan has done for Taiwan businessmen while the mainland has drawn up a law to protect Taiwan compatriots' investments on the mainland. [Tang Shubei] As for Taiwan compatriots' rights and interests on the mainland, just as I mentioned earlier, today, when we see such flourishing development in the cross-strait economic exchanges, if two organizations [words indistinct; responsible for?] issues of cross-strait economic exchanges, we should be ashamed of ourselves for failing to live up to the expectations of people from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. [Yang] SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho pointed out disapprovingly: The title and motives of the mainland's law on protecting Taiwan compatriots' investments on the mainland are ambiguous, its contents are impractical, and the wording is unacceptable. The government feels uncomfortable letting Taiwan businessmen invest in the mainland under conditions prescribed by this law. [Chiao Jen-ho] Do you think our government is able to tell our businessmen to feel free to invest in the mainland under the law on protecting Taiwan compatriots' mainland investments passed by the so-and-so republic? I do not think their motives for giving this law such a title are clear and its contents are not practical. I do not think such wording as "other provinces" is acceptable to us, either. [Yang] Chiao Jen-ho said how the mainland legislates laws is their own internal business. Our government still holds that we should protect Taiwan businessmen by signing agreements with the mainland.
