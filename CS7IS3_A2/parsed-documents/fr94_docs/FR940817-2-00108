FR940817-2-00108 FR940817-2-00056 Authority This program is authorized under Section 22(e)(7) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 671(e)(7)). Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission of promoting the protection and advancement of an individual's physical and mental health. Eligible Applicant Assistance will be provided only to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH) for conducting this evaluation. No other applications will be solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to FIOH. The FIOH is the only appropriate and qualified institution to provide the services specified under this cooperative agreement for the following reasons: There is a large asbestos mining, milling, and production activity in Asbest, Siberia, which produces in excess of 1,100,000 tons of asbestos and 300,000,000 tons of crushed stone annually. This mine supplies all of Russia's asbestos and is one of its major exporting resources. There is an existing medical surveillance program in effect for the more than 10,000 employees which could be reviewed for major health effects of asbestos. Russia does not have the expertise or resources to conduct this review and analysis. However, it has expressed a desire to collaborate with others to accomplish this effort. Finland has an existing working relationship with Russia and has the expertise and ability to initiate and coordinate a study of this magnitude. FIOH, NIOSH, and the Institute of Industrial Hygiene and Occupational Diseases of the Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia, all serve as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) Workers' Health Program which has as one of its top priorities the prevention of occupational respiratory diseases. This shared focus has enabled FIOH to develop a unique collaborative relationship with the Institute of Industrial Hygiene and Occupational Diseases of the Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia. As a result of this relationship, FIOH will be granted access to the Asbest mining region and will be given support from the requisite Russian agencies so that they can successfully accomplish the work required under this cooperative agreement. No one in the United States or its territories has this unique capability. Executive Order 12372 Review The applicant is not subject to review under Executive Order 12372.
