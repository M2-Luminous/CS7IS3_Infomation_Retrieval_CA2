The six-person sub-committee on foreign affairs of South Africa's Transitional Executive Council (TEC) spent three days here discussing their country's post-apartheid relations with the EU. "We sensed a very warm spirit of welcome. The EU is willing to do business with us," committee member Stella Sigcau said. Heading the agenda in meetings with EU officials was South Africa's request for a preferential relationship with the community following its first all-race elections next month. The EU is to negotiate a comprehensive system of political, trade and economic links with South Africa after the elections, to replace the frosty relations of the apartheid decades. The South African authorities, including the African National Congress, the election's likely winners, have been pressing for a special relationship in order to speed up the repair of the post-apartheid economy. But EU officials want to place the Union's links with South Africa in a wider regional context which includes neighbouring African countries, so that the benefits of development aid can be more widely spread. A spokesman for EU Development Commissioner Manuel Marin said it was up to South Africa to decide whether and how it wanted to join regional groupings. These include the Southern African Development Community, originally formed to counter the economic muscle of apartheid South Africa, and the 69-nation African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) group linked to the EU through the Lome trade-and-aid convention. "But we believe that whatever the final decision, it will still be important to stimulate regional development," he said. South African Manpower Minister Leon Wessels, a member of the delegation, said: "There has been a greater convergence of ideas. We feel ourselves closer to the heartbeat of southern African." South African Ambassador to the EU Neil van Heerden spoke of an "emerging consensus" about EU-South African relations, and said he was confident that agreement could be reached "on a fast track" after next month's elections.
