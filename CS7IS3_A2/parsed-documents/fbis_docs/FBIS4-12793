Two of the SLA militiamen were in a serious condition and were flown by helicopter to Israel, the spokesman said. The roadside bomb exploded as the patrol was driving along just outside Marj'uyun, the headquarters of the Israeli army and SLA militia in south Lebanon. It was the first such attack in four years in that area of Israel's self-declared "security zone", a security source said. The SLA militia has been the target of repeated bomb and artillery attacks in recent months, claimed by anti-Israeli guerrillas, namely the Iranian-backed Hizballah. In March, 12 SLA militiamen were killed and 25 others wounded in these attacks, the heaviest toll for several years.
