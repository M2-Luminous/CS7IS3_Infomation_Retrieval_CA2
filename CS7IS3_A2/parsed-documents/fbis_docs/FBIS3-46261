Li Junhua, director of the Municipal Commission for Restructuring the Economy, said that one-third of the 1,000 major state-run enterprises in the city are set to be turned into joint-stock companies this year. A breakthrough was made in the number of shareholding companies last year, he said. In 1993 the municipal government approved 140 joint-stock companies, bringing the number of such companies to 176. These companies are engaged in commerce, science and technology, manufacturing, finance, real estate development and consultancy services. Of the 176 companies, 108 are limited-liability companies, Li said. These 176 companies will eventually sell shares to the tune of 9.92 billion yuan, with 95.6 percent to be issued to the state and legal entities; the rest will be offered to Chinese individuals and foreign investors to buy. According to him, Tianqiao, Tianlong and two other shareholding companies had their shares listed in China and abroad in 1993. He said, "their success marks a new stage in introducing the joint-stock system to China's capital, and will help local businesses participate in international competition and institute a modern enterprise system." Efforts will be made to enable more enterprises to issue shares elsewhere this year, he said. The Beijing Department Store Group, the urban and rural trading center and two other shareholding companies are set to issue shares elsewhere in February, he said. Meanwhile, the Fangzheng Group and several other joint-stock companies will try to issue shares overseas later this year. Li Junhua said that the existing shareholding companies will concentrate on transforming their operational mechanisms to as to introduce a modern enterprise system as soon as possible. "The shareholding system has injected vigor into enterprises," he said. For example, assets of the Tianjin Department Store Company, which led the nation in instituting such a system in 1984, shot up to nearly 200 million yuan-worth from 1.6 million yuan-worth last year, and its annual earnings from sales soared from 27 million yuan to 200 million yuan.
