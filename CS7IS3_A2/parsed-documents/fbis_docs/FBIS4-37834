As you know, ceremonies were held today, on the orders of the exalted leader of the Islamic Revolution, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, for the martyrs of the immaculate shrine of Imam Reza on the day of Ashura at Shahid Motahhari College. Dr. Hasan Ruhani, deputy speaker of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, delivered an address at the gathering, which we will hear together. [Begin Ruhani recording] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. [passage omitted] Since the beginning of the glorious victory of the Islamic revolution of Iran, our honorable nation has been faced with various incidents. Our people have witnessed numerous crimes by the arrogant powers and their mercenaries. But possibly no disaster or incident has been as tragic as the incident on the evening of the day of Ashura at the immaculate shrine of the eighth imam. That is so not because a group of our pilgrims were cut to pieces and bathed in blood while worshipping and praying, since from the beginning of the revolution until now our honorable and loyal nation has offered many martyrs to our revolution. The tragedy is important from another point of view, and that is the violation of the sanctity of the shrine and the sacredness of the shrine of the innocent eighth imam -- greetings and blessings be upon him -- in the evening of the day of Ashura at the time when the people's sentiments and emotions toward the leader of martyrs are at their zenith. And that great tragedy occurred by the side of the shrine of the eighth Imam and the mosque, by his head. That tragedy does not merely concern the world Shiites and the people of Iran. That tragedy concerns all Muslims and all the freedom-loving people of the world. From the point of view of any Muslim the household of honor and purity enjoys a particular and special respect. All Islamic sects respect the family of the Prophet and the family of purity and innocence. [passage omitted] In the case of this bombing, as far as all Muslims are concerned, the sanctity of the Prophet's family, the mosque, and prayer have been violated. Innocent Muslims were killed at prayer. [passage omitted] Why did the enemy plan this great tragedy? Why is this calamity unbearable for the brave Muslim people of Iran? Regarding the first question, let us start the discussion from this point: Who has not benefitted from Islam, Shiism, genuine Islam, the Ashura of Aba Abdullah, the shrine of the eighth imam, and the school of the family of the prophet? The faces of which powers have been slapped? If today, Iran's Islamic revolution stands as a strong dam against the moves of arrogance, and if today the power of the Islamic Republic of Iran as the center of all Islamic movements which resist arrogance and oppression...[unfinished sentence as heard] [passage omitted] It is clear to us why the world arrogance designed and implemented the explosion at the shrine of the eighth imam, and at the time of Ashura. The bomb attack was carried out by the mercenaries who consider 20 June 1981 to be important. Their masters, who are the real plotters, the arrogant powers -- these mercenary grouplets have been nurtured in their laps, and continue their shameful life today under their protection. The arrogant powers themselves know very well from where the principal blow against them has come; it comes from the Ashura front [howze-ye Ashura], the family of the Prophet's front and by the honorable and brave Iranian nation, which moves along the path of the Prophet's family. The world arrogance seeks to take its revenge on the Iranian nation. The world arrogance seeks to deal its heaviest blow against the immaculate sentiments of the Muslim people of this land. [passage omitted] They have committed crimes which do not seem rational by any logic. If a grouplet has the slightest hope of coming to power in a place it does not commit actions which result in general hatred toward it. But a grouplet can reach a point where its only task is to be the mercenary of the world arrogance and nothing else. I ask you: Has any grouplet acted in such way -- to go toward and become part of the enemy while the nation was fighting a defensive war; to fight, and even worse, to spy for the enemy in order to kill one's own people? When Iraqi pilots were captured during the war they would be asked in their debriefings: Why did you have to bomb residential centers and not the city outskirts? You would have carried out your mission and would not have killed so many people. The pilots would say: Our problem is the Mojahedin-e Khalq [MKO]; we would have bombed the outskirts, but as soon as we bombed, the MKO informed Baghdad of the whereabouts of the attack. If we did not attack residential areas our lives would be in danger. Is there a comparison to this in history? Which mercenary has ever spied in such manner against its own people and against innocent women and children in cities and villages? Do you know of a similar case? This grouplet has reached a dead end. It has to accept the truth, which it will not do. It never did. [passage omitted] [end recording]
