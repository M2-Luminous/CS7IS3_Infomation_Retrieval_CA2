"An accord on the number of policemen should be concluded during meetings of the PLO and Israeli security committee" which begin here on Sunday, Sha'th said. The talks would also focus on "preparations for the deployment" of the police and security arrangements for the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. "I don't think there is currently a problem on the number of policemen, which will be around 10,000," Sha'th said after talks here Saturday with Palestinian officials to prepare for the deployment. Under a security accord signed in Cairo Thursday Israel and the PLO agreed that 160 foreign observers would be deployed in the mosque massacre town of Hebron, and a first contingent of Palestinian police would be sent to Gaza. Sha'th added that the talks on transferring civilian powers would be held here on Monday, while negotiations on the size of the Jericho autonomous area would be conducted by PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.
