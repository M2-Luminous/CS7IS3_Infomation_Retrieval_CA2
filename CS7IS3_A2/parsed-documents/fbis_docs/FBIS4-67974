FBIS4-67974 "jptot018__l94020" JPRS-TOT-94-018-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 28 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Police Say SL `Definitely Split' Police Say SL `Definitely Split' PY2904131794 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1751 GMT 28 Apr 94 PY2904131794 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- The Peruvian police guarantee that the Shining Path [SL] terrorist group has split. In a report released today by the Counterterrorism Directorate, the police speculate on the possibility of a clash between the two factions into which the group has allegedly split. The report states that the leaders who support peace -- which government officials believe is led by Abimael Guzman, the SL founder and leader -- have been expelled. The other faction does not regard him as a leader -- although it recognizes him as "ideologist" -- because he "does not address (the party or the war) from jail." Government officials believe the faction that does not accept Guzman's leadership believes the alleged peace proposal is not genuine, they consider it a government "hoax." The police report points out that the group split after the establishment -- under the leadership of Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano" -- of a new central committee in March in the Huanta Province mountains. This new central committee agreed to pursue the war that began in 1980. The police report states that this group described the members of the central committee allegedly headed by Guzman as "debased people, traitors, weaklings, and old revisionists." Government officials state that the rejoinder issued by Guzman's loyal followers was disclosed in a communique also dated March. In this communique, Guzman's loyal followers charge the rebels with feigning loyalty to their leader and with "undermining the party" over "personal and opportunist ambitions." Therefore, the police believe "the internal dispute has entered the elimination phase and a settlement of accounts has not been ruled out."
