The change in status for cooperation with the Americans is one of the three parts included in the reorganization of the Antiterrorist Service (IAEV) [expansion unknown]. According to a police source, Greek authorities were not satisfied with the cooperation with the Americans because they were only taking information without providing any. Thus, the Greek officers often felt like investigative employees for the Americans, who continued their investigations after every terrorist action without providing any information. Of course, the cooperation with the Americans will not be suspended, but there will be an effort to become equal. The Greek authorities need U.S. assistance, in means and information, which until now has not been sufficient. The issue of equal cooperation was raised by Minister of Public Order Stilianos Papathemelis during his visit to the United States two months ago. He received assurances that the cooperation would be improved. The other two parts of the reorganization provide for the establishment of a group of 15 to 20 scientists with various specialties, who will be advising the director of the antiterrorist staff, and for more flexible operations of the existing four departments of the service. The scientific staff, in English called a think-tank (reservoir of thought) will be manned by experts who specialize in analyzing leaflets, economists, sociologists, electronic translators, and analysts of information from foreign and local publications, and so forth. [passage omitted] The third and last part of the reorganization aims at disengaging those serving in inactive departments of the antiterrorist unit and greater coherence and flexibility among the four departments of the antiterrorist service. The service is expected to operate in its new form by the summer, while any pertinent decisions [not specified] are expected to be announced officially in the next few days.
