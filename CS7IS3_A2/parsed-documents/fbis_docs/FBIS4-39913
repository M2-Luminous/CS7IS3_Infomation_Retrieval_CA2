Slightly more than a month has passed since the signing of a joint statement by Moldovan and trans-Dniester leaders, he said. This period can be described as organizational. Working groups have been set up to focus on financial, economic relations and political settlement, which is the future state-legal status of the trans- Dniester region. "Economic issues are natural and there are people who are tackling these problems. I think it will be easy for them to pull their efforts and elaborate corresponding agreements. They have already started to do it," said Vasev. In his opinion, the issue of financial-economic relations remains difficult. It is a certain stumbling stone in Moldovan-trans- Dniester relations. "But I think the sides will solve this problem," he added. The most difficult problem is still the state-legal status of the trans-Dniester region. The problem is in the focus of the sides' leaders and heads of expert groups - First Deputy Moldovan Foreign Minister Nikolae Osmokescu and trans-Dniester State Secretary Valeriy Litskay. On the whole, the current stage of negotiations can be described as preparatory. "Despite certain differences and rather heated debates, one can say that the general stand of the sides has become more constructive, they intend to reach compromises and certain results have been achieved. The preparatory period is necessary to reach agreements. The sides have fixed no time for them, but it would be better not to drag out this period," said Vasev.
