The security departments estimate the number of group members at 5,000. A ranking security official has told AL-SHA'B that in the next stage the security service will step up armed confrontation in Asyut. He said a timetable had been drawn up by the interior ministry to liquidate the leaders of the extremist groups inside and outside the prisons. He added that the armed confrontation operations will last for a while. He admitted that the security service has failed to properly monitor the militant elements within the extremist groups. The official said that the interior ministry had covered up this failure by announcing that 98 leading extremists were captured even though most of them were detained arbitrarily. Some of the detainees now in custody of the state security intelligence will appear on television and in the papers and be repentant as former members of extremist groups. The security official added that the announcement on the latest organization was prompted by the political leadership to confront the activities of the lawyers association, which is calling for an investigation into the killing of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. The interior ministry has said that Madani was a link between the Islamic Group's leaders inside and outside the prisons.
