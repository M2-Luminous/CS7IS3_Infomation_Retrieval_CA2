FBIS4-39326 "drsov109_s_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Georgia Shevardnadze Weekly Interview 6 Jun Shevardnadze Weekly Interview 6 Jun LD0606144994 Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network in Georgian 0606 GMT 6 Jun 94 LD0606144994 Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network Georgian BFN [Weekly interview with Georgian State Council Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani; place and date not given -- recorded] [Excerpts] Batono [honorific title] Eduard, last week the CIS executive secretary [Ivan Korotchenya] visited Tbilisi, and it was said that all the CIS republics have agreed in principle to the deployment of peacekeeping forces [in Abkhazia]. However, Russia's Federation Council rejected the idea. Also last week, you had a telephone conversation with President Yeltsin. Should we prepare for some unexpected developments as far as the introduction of peacekeepers is concerned? Another question. How would you comment on the following statement from [Russian State Duma] CIS Affairs Committee Chairman Zatulin: There is an alternative plan to the Russian initiative; it envisages the introduction to Abkhazia of troops of foreign states; if the Russian initiative fails, Russia will lose its reputation not only within the CIS but also in the entire world; as long as Russia is capable of carrying out peacekeeping operations, it will be a key factor in the world; the introduction of non-Russian forces to Georgia will result in Russia losing its influence. [Shevardnadze] Thank you and good morning. The introduction of peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia has practically been decided. This was reaffirmed by Russian president Boris Yeltsin in a telephone conversation a couple of days ago. The details are being worked out now. Some aspects of this operation were discussed on television by Mr. Jaba Ioseliani [chief Georgian negotiator at the talks with Abkhazia] yesterday. He stressed some very important points. Events will develop according to plan. At least, that is what Mr. Yeltsin confirmed during our conversation. A failure of this peace mission, if it happens, would seriously undermine the CIS's reputation as a major inter-regional organization. I think this would not be acceptable to any state, and, of course, this would be a serious blow to Russia. Peacekeeping, particularly in Abkhazia, is in Russian national interests. I am thinking here of the stability of the expanses of southern Russia. At the same time, this peace mission will reaffirm Russia's international standing. Therefore, while a successful completion of this mission is primarily in the interests of Georgians and the Abkhaz, and in the interests of the state of Georgia, at the same time it serves the interests of all CIS countries, and primarily of Russia. I welcome Mr. Zatulin's comments, which are realistic and well- balanced. [Oniani] The conflict in Abkhazia is only one of the conflicts which have developed on former Soviet territory and which were sparked off by aggressive separatism. These conflicts have long since become a regular matter and their number is, unfortunately, rather large. This has been for some time, and now a conflict has developed in Ukraine in connection with Crimea. [Shevardnadze] I would say the following about this. Since the late 1980's, when the disintegration of the Soviet Union began, and especially in the 1990's, I have spoken publicly on more than one occasion about separatism and about the threat posed by aggressive separatism in post-communist times. One such example is my address to the UN General Assembly in September 1992. Unfortunately, nothing was done in practice by either world or regional organizations to avert the threat of aggressive separatism or to create guarantees for a normal and peaceful life of the planet's citizens as the cold war was drawing to its historic end. The world has failed to recognize this threat and its scale. Those who did recognize it did little to carry out tangible measures. This is very unfortunate. Because of this, we are now dealing with unpleasant events in Europe and elsewhere which may turn into an even bigger threat in the future. This general remark also applies to Crimea. I am sure that the Crimean problem will be solved within the framework of a single and indivisible state of Ukraine and with Russian assistance, which will have crucial importance. I want to stress that the Russian factor in settling the Crimean issue cannot be ignored. Another point I would like to stress is that a confrontation between Russia and Ukraine cannot be allowed to happen. Such a confrontation would be a great disaster not only for the two great states, which are our friends, but also for other countries in Europe and Asia, including Georgia. Such a confrontation would inflict serious and irreparable damage on Georgia, the Caucasus in general, and the whole Black sea region. [Oniani] Last week you hosted a meeting of representatives of law-enforcement bodies. After this meeting, the Interior Ministry carried out a major operation in Rustavi. Will such operations be carried out again in the future, and how successful do you think they are? [Shevardnadze] We cannot be pleased with the present state of public order. However, we must remember what state our country was in a year ago, or even five or six months ago, and we should compare that with the present situation in the capital, in western Georgia, and in several other regions. It is very important to recognize that there have been certain changes and that a tangible improvement has occurred, otherwise we will scare off our foreign partners who have a great desire to come to Georgia and work here, for example, in oil recovery, oil processing, gas recovery, and so on. We have created conditions for these people to come and work in safe surroundings. Such conditions exist in Tbilisi, Rustavi, and regions of western Georgia. Unfortunately, the way we behave often creates the impression among public opinion in Europe and throughout the world that it is impossible to enter Georgia. I would also like to say that public order is the main factor which will enable our country to emerge from the crisis. We should be guided by this factor. As I told you, a lot has changed. It happened primarily because the role of internal affairs bodies has increased and their organization, mobilization, and professionalism have improved. Of course, they are getting assistance from the Defense Ministry, the security forces, and others. However, the main burden should be borne by the police. Despite all this, these are only the first steps, since many very serious crimes and terrorist acts which have plagued the country remain unsolved. The meeting you mentioned agreed that the Security Service has to take on the difficult job of struggling against terrorism. I said that all responsibility for the struggle against terrorism should lie with the Security Service. Of course it needs assistance and all of us should help it, but it should bear the brunt of responsibility itself. In a few days I will submit to parliament draft laws which must be adopted if we want the struggle against crime to be more efficient. Life has changed, and new types of crime have emerged requiring new approaches and new laws. Therefore, parliament should by all means complete this job before going into recess. The draft laws are now being prepared. Finally, I would like to tell our listeners that the struggle against crime will not slow down. On the contrary, it will be stepped up every day, with more levels of society becoming involved in this struggle. [Oniani] Since we have mentioned Rustavi, let me ask you a question about the election which will he held there on 12 June. As you know, there are many rumors about these elections. Do you view these elections with the perspective of head of state or of chairman of the Citizens' Union? In other words, can you express your preference for a particular candidate? [Shevardnadze] I would not like to separate the two, and I want the position of chairman of the Citizens' Union and that of head of state to be compatible. As for the specific issue of Rustavi, my preferences may not mean much. I am just stating facts. Several days ago I met with Rustavi Mayor (Soso Areshidze). The meeting took place at the initiative of (Sergo Doprotsashvili), a candidate for deputy [of the Georgian parliament], who accompanied the mayor. Their first request was that I help the people of Rustavi establish and consolidate public order. The candidate for deputy painted a truly bleak picture. I decided to give instructions to Interior Minister Shota Kviraia, who promptly prepared this operation, which, as you know, was carried out successfully. The people of Rustavi have expressed sincere gratitude for this. I do not think that this operation should be a one-off measure and part of a (?election) campaign. The interior minister has promised me that the Interior Ministry will focus its attention on Rustavi, that such operations will continue, and that order will be established in Rustavi. [passage omitted] If my opinion matters at all, I would say that the candidate for deputy made a very good impression. He is a hard-working, modest, cultured, and competent person. He is also a native of Rustavi and is familiar with all problems of its inhabitants. My impression is that he is not trying to gain popularity by making ostentatious and cheap effects. He is a businesslike person. That is my opinion, but of course it is for the people of Rustavi to decide whom to elect. [Oniani] And the final question. Last week parliament gave a lot of attention to issues relating to the struggle against the mafia and corruption. Political parties and the mafia, officials and the mafia -- unfortunately, these issues are now being discussed among the public. Despite all the talk, there are few tangible results. There are reports that law-enforcement bodies have a lot of evidence concerning the involvement of officials and political leaders with the mafia. Some of this evidence has been published. It would be natural to ask what the authorities are waiting for. Are the situation and events unfolding today the reason for the authorities' delay in taking appropriate measures? [Shevardnadze] When Georgia was in a state of civil war, which lasted in effect for several years, including the last few months of 1993 and the complex beginning of this year, it was difficult to speak about a struggle against corruption and organized crime. You know full well that these negative phenomena accompany wars. This dirty business comes to the surface during wars and sucks in a large proportion of the public. As soon as they were given the slightest chance the authorities emerged in the forefront of this struggle. A lot has been discovered, and there is still much more that remains to be revealed. Everything needs to be done in its own time and in appropriate circumstances. The struggle against the mafia and corrupt groups has to be dealt with by the whole of society and this will be achieved. You may have noticed that in the last month -- or, rather, one and a half months -- a lot of material has been published in the press concerning the mafia, organized crime, and criminals in the economy, finance and so on. This is not the end of the story; on the contrary, even more material will be published in future. However, it will be published at a time when it can be published. As regards parliament's active role in this, naturally, such a role by the supreme legislative body should be welcomed. Without it, there can be no talk of finally overcoming corruption as a phenomenon. However, parliament should work using methods that are appropriate for it. For parliament to take over the functions of the law-enforcement bodies and their operational services could lead to a further disaster. We could end up in a terrible situation of no return. Therefore, I stress that parliament should work and exercise its right to control and check. However, when some deputies want classified information to be ... [pauses] How could that happen if classified information were to be obtained by special means and methods. Only employees serving this cause should have access to such information. If parliament were to look into it, advertise it, and make it public, not a single case would be solved in Georgia. As I told you, I know that there would be very bad results if the functions of legislative bodies and those of law-enforcement bodies were mixed up. As I told you, this would mean disaster. [Oniani] Thank you for the interview.
