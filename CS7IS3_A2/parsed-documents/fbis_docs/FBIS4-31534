The basic controversies are: Is it necessary to watch over the press? Should the press market be protected from foreign capital? Eventually, if the council were to exist, who would set it up--the authorities or the journalists themselves? Someone should watch, "within reasonable limits," over the values or opinions promoted by the press, believes Janusz Dobrosz, deputy chairman of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who accepts the idea of establishing a council for the press. "There is a difference between respecting general values and imposing, offending, and slandering. We have pluralism, and the press is shaping public opinion." Asked about whether the council will not be a form of censorship, Dobrosz replies that it will not, but "the informative proportions are so distorted that not the political opposition but the opposition to our views has a greater share in the media." Dobrosz did not firmly deny the suggestion that the role of the council would be to ensure influence of the governing coalition over the press. He explained that he believes that "the government must have its own press, which is exemplified by the governmental page in RZECZPOSPOLITA, because someone must present" the activities, intentions, and opinions of the government, not only this government "because this one will eventually leave, but every government." "This is a lack of balance, it is absurd and inadmissible." According to M.A. Jerzy Adamowski of the Journalism Institute, it is possible for a press council to function in the Polish reality. It should not deal with disputes between journalists and politicians. This should be handled by courts of law. Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent Poland opposes the idea of setting up the council. He fears that the idea of establishing the press council is "an attempt to recreate the former censorship." "Such a council would soon get the idea of creating types of press `space slots'--that is, calculating who appeared in the press and how many times. It would be a kiss of death for journalism. There is a great difference between a civil servant and a journalist; these two should not be confused." A negative attitude toward the council has also been adopted by Zdobyslaw Milewski of the Freedom Union. He considers the idea of establishing a press council to be misconceived because it aims at regulating the free media from the position of the state authorities. Comparison with the National Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT] is also not a very good one because it deals with the regulation of the affairs concerning radio stations, where there is not enough space for everyone. Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski also is not an advocate of the idea of establishing the council. "I do not think it could be a panacea for the problems that journalists themselves cannot resolve today." The Protection of the Press Market According to the author of the idea, among the fields of activity of the press council should also be the protection of the press market from the influx of foreign capital. There is no agreement over this issue as well. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, of the Center Accord, claims that a lack of inflow of foreign capital would conserve the advantage of the postcommunist forces on the press market. Kaczynski would back the idea of admitting a greater amount of foreign capital to the Polish market, which, he believes, might result in greater pluralism. This, among other reasons, is why he objects to the establishment of the council. He does support the idea of setting up a nonparty body that would be entitled to impose prohibitive taxes, for instance, as a result of which obscene magazines would not be a good source of income. Ignacy Rutkiewicz, president of the Polish Association of Journalists [SDP], says that it is absurd to limit the inflow of foreign capital in a free market economy. The PSL's Janusz Dobrosz is of a different opinion: "The penetration of the Polish press by foreign capital is too great; proportions have been distorted," and some organ should control this issue. Jerzy Adamowski believes that the press council might deal with the protection of the Polish capital on the press market (during a transition period, it would protect periodicals from the dumping prices of competitors). It might also prevent the concentration of capital, and deal with the journalists' ethics and disputes between publishers and journalists. Authorities' Attempts To Gain Influence Over the Press Jerzy Adamowski says that the council should be independent of politicians. It should consist of "persons of public confidence," representatives of publishers, and of journalists, and, if this cannot be avoided, of politicians. However, the latter should not have the greatest say. It would be a threat to the council if politicians wanted to gain influence over the media through it. SDP head Ignacy Rutkiewicz concedes that there are various opinions among journalists on the establishment of the press council. Some of them firmly oppose this idea; others say that the council should be established. However, it cannot be established by the government's decision; nor can it be formed in line with the special party-political system (as it was in the case of KRRiT). It should rather be an expression of the will of the journalist's milieu. It would have to be situated within the press law. It should not be established in a separate law--one drafted in the fast mode, at that--provided that journalists themselves decided that such a council should be established.
