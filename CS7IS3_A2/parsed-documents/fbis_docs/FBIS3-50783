He confirmed that he will pay more personal attention to peasants in our country, and he demanded that government officials get out of their offices and into rural areas, thus joining efforts to solve the problems of the agricultural sector. The president was in Veracruz for the 79th anniversary of the promulgation of the first agrarian law of Mexico. Here in Medellin de Bravo, he awarded 30 land titles to peasants. A total of 6,500 titles will be awarded in the area and nearly 200,000 throughout the entire country. According to the president, these documents declare the land belongs to the peasants according to law. He pointed out that the law provides tranquillity. Let us listen to part of his speech, delivered by the president of the republic at the municipal sports field in Medellin de Bravo, Veracruz. [Begin Salinas recording] In this manner, we can promote more progress in Mexican fields. Let us work so there will be greater well-being for Mexican peasants. In the presence of the peasants of Veracruz and all the peasants of my fatherland, I ratify today, 6 January, that I will continue being very close to the Mexican peasants. I will continue to work for the peasants of my fatherland. [applause] If I am willing to do this, then government officials will have to get out of their offices and out into the fields, get their boots dirty, and join efforts very close to the Mexican peasants. [end recording] Six days after President Venustiano Carranza promulgated the 1915 Agrarian Law -- the first one in Mexico -- the first agrarian committee was created in Medellin de Bravo Municipality in Veracruz State. Today, the leaders of the Permanent Agrarian Congress accompanied the president on the podium prepared for this ceremony. According to President Salinas, this Permanent Agrarian Congress is a pluralist organization that has met common goals, thus demonstrating how plurality can lead to achieving the superior goal of overall national improvement. Host Governor Patricio Chirinos Calero emphasized that the people of Veracruz know very well that their greatest asset is the peace, tranquillity, and stability they enjoy based on more and better opportunities for social justice. That is why he seeks to make the fields a true source of justice and well-being for peasant families. This is President Carlos Salinas de Gortari first domestic tour in 1994.
