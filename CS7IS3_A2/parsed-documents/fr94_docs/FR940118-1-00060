FR940118-1-00060 FR940118-1-00008 * * * * * Table 160.077&hyph;23 B Inspector's Sampling 1␣ ␣ *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* Notes to Table: *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* (2) This test may be omitted if the manufacturer has previously conducted it and the inspector has conducted the test on a previous lot within the past year. (3) One sample of each means of marking on each type of fabric or finish used in PFD construction must be tested. This test is only required when a new lot of materials is used. However, the test must be run at least every six months regardless of whether a new lot of materials is started within the past six months. * * * * * (g) *␣*␣* (2) Calibration. The manufacturer must have the calibration of all test equipment checked at least annually by a weights and measures agency or the equipment manufacturer, distributor, or dealer. (3) *␣*␣* (iii) A Scale that has sufficient capacity to weigh a submerged sample basket. The scale must be sensitive to 14 g (0.5 oz) and must not have an error exceeding +/^ 14 g (0.5 oz). * * * * * (x) Inflation Chamber Materials Test Equipment. If the required tests in paragraph (h)(2) of this section are performed by the PFD manufacturer, test equipment suitable for conducting Grab Breaking Strength, Tear Strength, Permeability, and Seam Strength tests must be available at the PFD manufacturer's facility. * * * * * (h) *␣*␣* (4) Over-pressure. Each sample must be tested according to and meet UL 1517, section 28. Test samples may be prestressed by inflating them to a greater pressure than the required test pressure prior to initiating the test at the specified values. (5) Air Retention. Each sample must be tested according to and meet UL 1517, section 36. Prior to initiating the test at the specified values, test samples may be prestressed by inflating to a pressure greater than the design pressure, but not exceeding 50 percent of the required pressure for the tests in paragraph (h)(4) of this section. Any alternate test method that decreases the length of the test must be accepted by the Commandant and must require a proportionately lower allowable pressure loss and the same percentage sensitivity and accuracy as the standard allowable loss measured with the standard instrumentation. * * * * * (j) *␣*␣* (4) *␣*␣* (iii) If the inspector rejects a lot, the Commandant must be advised immediately. (k) *␣*␣* (1) A rejected PFD lot may be resubmitted for testing, examination, or inspection if the manufacturer first removes and destroys each PFD having the same type of defect or, if authorized by the Commandant or an authorized representative of the Commandant, reworks the lot to correct the defect. (2) Any PFD rejected in a final lot examination or inspection may be resubmitted for examination or inspection if all defects have been corrected and reexamination or reinspection is authorized by the Commandant or an authorized representative of the Commandant. * * * * * 16. In §160.077&hyph;27, paragraph (a) is revised and paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) are added to read as follows: §160.077&hyph;27 Pamphlet. (a) Each recreational hybrid PFD sold or offered for sale must be provided with a pamphlet that a prospective purchaser can read prior to purchase. The required pamphlet text must be printed verbatim and in the sequence set out in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, as applicable. Additional information, instructions, or illustrations must not be included within the required text. The type size shall be no smaller than 8-point. * * * * *
