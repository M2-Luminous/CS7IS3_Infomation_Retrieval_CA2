This is primarily because, despite the Russian side's efforts, Estonia kept to its old positions on the problem of the situation of the Russian-speaking population in the country. This was stated at a news conference by special envoy Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian state delegation at the talks with Estonia. The Estonian side suddenly stated that Russia, to Estonia's surprise, intends to link the withdrawal of troops to the solution of problems of the social protection of military pensioners. Estonia believes that Russia is making "unheard-of demands relating to the social protection of military pensioners." It turns out that by "unheard-of demands" Estonia means the elementary requirements of human rights which are unfailingly observed in any country which presumes to call itself civilized. Russia is insisting that the apartments inhabited by military pensioners have become their private property. In addition, it is the Russian side's opinion that military pensioners must be given a residence permit so as not be outcasts in a country where they have lived for decades. Estonia's demarche is is all the more surprising if you recall that at the 14th round of talks on 15 September 1993 J. Luik, leader of the Estonian Republic delegation, stated that "the articles and provisions of the draft agreement on the social protection of military pensioners and members of their families as agreed at 1 September 1993 remain in force despite divergences with certain provisions of Estonia's law 'On aliens'." Why has there been such a drastic change of direction in Estonian policy? The troop withdrawal treaty is ready for initialing, but Estonia clearly does not want to sign the agreement on the social protection of military pensioners and, I would venture to assert, made the said statement of consent merely to prompt Russia to withdraw the troops as quickly as possible. The Estonian diplomats' "cunning" tactic, more reminiscent of plain deceit, seems to be a continuation of Tallinn's "drift" into confrontation with Moscow, which is confirmed by Estonian President Lennart Meri's 25 February speech in Hamburg, where the Estonian head of state urged the West "not to trust Russia," which, he claimed, is "pursuing an imperial policy." However, at the news conference given by the head of the Russian delegation it was stated that the troops will nevertheless be withdrawn from Estonian territory before 31 August 1994 if the treaty on the withdrawal of the troops and the agreement on the social protection of military pensioners and members of their families are signed. "But unless we come to such an agreement," Vasiliy Svirin said, "Russia will decide the troop withdrawal timetable by itself"....
