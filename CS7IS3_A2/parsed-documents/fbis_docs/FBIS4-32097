But, at the same time, no one has gained a decisive victory, Adam Michnik writes in GAZETA WYBORCZA, adding that almost nowhere will the individual parties be able to manage single-handed. Three large blocs have formed in the cities: the SLD, the Freedom Union [UW], and right-wing coalitions. Who will enter into which setups with whom, the GAZETA WYBORCZA editor wonders, expressing the view that it depends only on the UW whether it can find the best partners in the other blocs because it is only the UW that is in the position to talk to both the SLD and the right-wing parties. Specific issues and pragmatism and, consequently, rational programs and real abilities must outweigh ideological arguments, Michnik writes in his commentary on the results of the local government elections.
