Without naming them, the Haitian bishops invited the protagonists in the crisis to a frank, courageous dialogue in order to save the country. This proposal was included in a message issued at the celebration of Pentecost. Ansy Rose Resignac filed a report: [Begin Resignac recording] A meeting between the Haitian leaders in exile in the United States and the military authorities in Port-au-Prince is, in the eyes of the Haitian bishops, the only gesture that can save the people. They even go so far as to present this approach as an imperative, a divine proposal. The Lord has mandated it, they say in their message. In an effort to invite the leaders of the two camps to stop glaring defiantly at each other, the Episcopal Conference cites as an example the meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, between black and white South Africans who just turned a new page in their country's history through multi-racial, free, democratic elections. A frank, courageous dialogue is what the Haitian bishops suggest. They are calling on the protagonists in the crisis born of the coup d'etat to put their heads together, to mutually accept each other, and to make a gesture to save the country from disaster, destruction, and death. Our people are dying; our country is on the brink of ruin; a foreign armed intervention is threatening to destroy our nation. These are several observations that increase the concerns of the Haitian bishops. They express their pain and reprobation over everything that is bathing the country with blood. In the face of this challenge, can one hesitate about meeting? Can one refuse to make the gesture on which Haiti's survival depends? The Episcopal Conference questions the difficulties of realizing such a meeting. Is it not because of personal interests? Have personal or group interests become the substitute for the common good? Is it not because the will for protecting international interests paralyzes the pursuit of national interests? In the Haitian bishops' opinion, in order to help the country find its stability and dynamism, self-denial, increased soul, and a burst of evangelical love are necessary. The time has come, concludes the Episcopal Conference, to transcend the self and reach out toward others. [end recording]
