FR941012-0-00131 FR941012-0-00011 Paragraph (h)(1)(v) of the final rule requires that no employee approach a mechanical felling operation closer than two tree lengths of the tree being felled until the machine operator has acknowledged that it is safe to do so. The proposed rule required that employees remain clear of any mechanical felling operation. OSHA received many comments recommending that OSHA apply the two tree-length minimum work distance to mechanical felling operations as well (Ex. 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W2 163, 197). These commenters said that such distance was needed, for example, to protect other employees from flying metal fragments from broken mechanical disc saw blades. In addition, the reasoning and explanation supporting the distance requirement for approaching fellers also applies to this provision. For example, a feller-buncher operator who is not expecting an employee to enter the work area may move in reverse and not see the employee in time to prevent an accident. OSHA has therefore added the two tree-length distance requirement to this provision of the final rule. Paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of the final rule requires that each danger tree, including lodged trees and snags, be felled, removed or avoided. When the danger tree is felled or removed, it must be felled or removed using mechanical or other techniques that minimize employee exposure before felling is commenced in the area of the danger tree. When the danger tree is avoided, it must be marked and no work be conducted within two tree lengths of the danger tree, unless the employer demonstrates that a shorter distance will not create a hazard for an employee. As defined in the final rule, a danger tree includes any standing tree that presents a hazard to employees due to conditions such as, but not limited to, deterioration or damage to the tree, and direction or lean of the tree. The proposed rule required that lodged trees be marked and lowered to the ground using mechanical or other safe techniques before any work is continued within two tree lengths of the lodged tree. The proposed rule did not allow any exceptions to the two tree-length distance. Many State logging standards include requirements to fell danger trees or not to commence work within a two tree-length distance of the danger tree (Ex. 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). The record shows that danger trees pose many hazards for employees. According to the WIR survey, 15 percent of those injured said that the dangerous conditions of the tree had contributed to their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report indicated that 23 logging employees were killed by danger trees (Ex. 4&hyph;61). OSHA received several comments on this proposed provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 17; Tr. W1 187, W2 6&hyph;7). Some commenters supported the provision (Ex. 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;34). Some commenters suggested that this provision conflicts with other federal regulations requiring retention of some ``snags'' to preserve wildlife habitats in the area (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;39, Tr. W2 6) and Rep. Jolene Unsoeld commented that OSHA should attempt to harmonize the final rule with various environmental regulations (Ex. 17, 31). Other commenters said that OSHA's provision was excessive in those situations when a tree is securely lodged a few feet above the ground (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 187, W2 6&hyph;7). Another commenter said that prohibiting any felling within two tree-lengths of a danger tree would take a large volume of timber out of production, especially strips of trees on steep slopes (Ex. 5&hyph;43). OSHA has addressed the commenters' concerns in the final rule. First, OSHA is more explicitly stating in the final rule that dangers trees may be avoided, when necessary, rather than being felled or removed. OSHA believes that this requirement harmonizes with and does not conflict with the rules and regulations of other Federal agencies. The U.S. Department of the Interior participated in this rulemaking and did not indicate that this provision was in conflict with their regulations (Ex. 5&hyph;50). The change to the final rule further clarifies OSHA's proposed intent that danger trees do not have to be felled or removed. This provision of the final rule only requires two actions of the employer. One, when the employer wishes to fell a danger tree, it must be removed or felled before other trees in the area are felled. Two, when the employer elects not to fell or remove a danger tree, the employer must not conduct any other felling in that area. Therefore, when other regulations require the preservation of a particular snag, this final standard requires only that fellers be protected from potential injury from the snag. This is accomplished by keeping all other felling activity out of the immediate area of that snag.
