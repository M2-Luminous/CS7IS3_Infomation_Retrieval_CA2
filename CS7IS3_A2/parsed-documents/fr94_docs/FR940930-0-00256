FR940930-0-00256 FR940930-0-00031 Response: HUD is not closing the door regarding the use of BPOs, alone or in conjunction with more formal property appraisals, in the future. However, at this time, appraisals are the only method of establishing property valuation under the PFS procedure. The costs are higher for appraisals, but the reliability may also be greater. The Department also values the fact that the appraisers will be credentialed as well as ``neutral'' parties, otherwise uninvolved with the sale unlike the BPOs, which are frequently provided by real estate brokers that have a relationship with one or more parties to the sale. This reliability and neutrality is especially important during the initial period when mortgagees are becoming acclimated to their central role in facilitating pre-foreclosure sales. The Department may add BPOs to the PFS procedure after evaluating the performance of appraisers, comparing their cost to BPOs, and taking other factors into account. 10. Several commenters criticized the ``70% appraisal of the indebtedness'' criterion and the ``90% net proceeds of the appraised value'' criterion as unworkable in many areas, requiring delays for HUD office intervention to decide whether to waive. Most wanted the formula to change, downward, or at least have the discretion to waive them placed firmly in the hands of the coordinator. [three mortgagees] Response: When preparing the legislation which authorized HUD to engage in pre-foreclosure sales, Congress issued a strong warning that HUD should avoid a ``fire sale'' atmosphere in administering the PFS program. The Department's experience during the Demonstration supports retaining the 70% criterion, which is the ratio of as-is appraised value to outstanding loan indebtedness. In rare instances, it will be possible for the local HUD Office to grant an inquiring mortgagee a variance from the 70% criterion, based on a consideration of the facts of that case. The expectation of netting 90% of appraised value was an internal rule of thumb. That figure has been reduced to 87% as more workable and realistic, given the typical transactional costs of pre-foreclosure sales during the Demonstration. Mortgagees will be able to request a variance from the local HUD Office with jurisdiction over the property, to permit a sale that would net less than 87%. 11. Two commenters [two mortgagees] supported the idea of parallel processing of foreclosure while a participant was enrolled in the PFS program. Two commenters [two mortgagees] were also concerned that the deadline for initiation of foreclosure be explicitly lifted in cases involving participation in the PFS program, or else HUD would run the risk of non-cooperation from mortgagees who would expect to be penalized for missing this deadline. Response: If participation in the PFS procedure is unsuccessful and does not result in a sale, a mortgagee has nine months after default or sixty (60) days after the date of termination of PFS participation, whichever is later, to initiate foreclosure or accept a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The mortgagee must also meet conveyance time requirements. If the pre-foreclosure sale does go to closing, neither foreclosure nor conveyance of the property occur; the mortgagee has 30 days after the sale closing date to file its claim. If these time frames cannot be met, the mortgagee must file Form HUD&hyph;50012, Extension Request, with the Loan Management Branch of the local HUD Office. Apart from the issue of obtaining extensions, and the customary timeframes in which to initiate foreclosure, and submit a claim, it is still possible for mortgagees to opt to continue steps leading to foreclosure while a mortgagor is engaged in marketing the property for sale under the PFS procedure. This decision must be weighed by the mortgagee in light of the cost-effectiveness (i.e., the ``loss mitigation perspective'') of such actions. Proceeding with such steps in the face of a mortgagor's participation in the PFS procedure_which has a high likelihood of ending either in the sale of the property or a deed-in-lieu_is frequently not justified , because of the outlay of time and money required to accomplish them. In the meantime, the experiences of the PFS procedure will be observed and evaluated. HUD may in the future direct mortgagees to desist from concurrently taking foreclosure-related steps unless certain criteria are met. Mortgagees are reminded that they must always explain their concurrent foreclosure-related actions to the mortgagors participating in the PFS procedure, because such actions may be misconstrued by the mortgagor and may jeopardize the pre-foreclosure sale. 12. There was a serious division of opinion as to whether mortgagees should be expected to participate in the mechanics of the program. One commenter [a mortgagee] said that HUD shouldn't ask lenders to, or expect that they would, prepare the PFS sale package for submission to the program coordinator. Two other commenters [two mortgagees] indicated that it was appropriate for HUD to designate the mortgagee as a principal player in the administration of the pre-foreclosure sale, as a means of loss-mitigation and appropriate loan servicing. Response: The difference of opinion over the appropriate level of mortgagee participation in the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure has been resolved by substantially increasing the mortgagees' engagement in the process over what was expected during the Demonstration, and also by significantly increasing the administrative fee payable to mortgagees for facilitating each pre-foreclosure sale. During the course of the Demonstration, many mortgagees did express a willingness to expand the level of their involvement in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure. HUD has decided to implement its nationwide PFS procedure by using the mortgagees in the central role of PFS ``facilitators'' because of the mortgagees' existing loan servicing role; the savings generated by authorizing mortgagees to carry out the PFS procedure under express HUD procedures and criteria; and the Department's evolving policy that mortgagees explore alternatives to foreclosure, whenever appropriate.
