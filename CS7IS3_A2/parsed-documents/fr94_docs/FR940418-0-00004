FR940418-0-00004 FR940418-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;170&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8876; AD 91&hyph;09&hyph;14 R1] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 737&hyph;100, &hyph;200, and &hyph;200C Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Boeing Model 737&hyph;100, &hyph;200, and &hyph;200C series airplanes, that currently requires periodic inspections to detect missing nuts and/or damaged secondary support hardware adjacent to the engine aft mount, and replacement, if necessary. This amendment provides for the optional installation of a new, modified support, which, if accomplished, constitutes terminating action for certain required inspections. This amendment is prompted by the development of a modification that will prevent wearing of the secondary support. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the secondary support to sustain engine loads in the event of failure of the aft engine mount cone bolt, which could result in the separation of the engine from the wing. DATES: Effective May 18, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas Rodriguez, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;120S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2779; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by revising AD 91&hyph;09&hyph;14, Amendment 39&hyph;6972 (56 FR 18696, April 24, 1991), which is applicable to all Boeing Model 737&hyph;100, &hyph;200, and &hyph;200C series airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on December 29, 1993 (58 FR 68787). Among other things, AD 91&hyph;09&hyph;14 currently requires periodic inspections to detect missing nuts and/or damaged secondary support hardware, and replacement, if necessary. The notice proposed to revise AD 91&hyph;09&hyph;14 to provide for the optional replacement of the existing aft engine mount secondary support with a new, modified secondary support. If accomplished, such replacement would constitute terminating action for certain of the currently required inspections. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. All of the commenters support the proposal. One commenter, Boeing, notes that the number of work hours necessary to accomplish the optional modification is closer to 60 work hours rather than 30 work hours, as was indicated in the cost impact information presented in the preamble to the notice. The FAA acknowledges this updated figure and has revised the cost impact information, below, to reflect it. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 1,144 Model 737 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 432 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The actions currently required by AD 91&hyph;09&hyph;14 take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the currently required actions on U.S. operators is estimated to be $71,280, or $165 per airplane, per inspection cycle. This revision of AD 91&hyph;09&hyph;14 adds no new additional costs to operators, since it merely provides for an optional installation that would provide terminating action for certain requirements. Should an operator elect to accomplish the installation, the associated actions will take approximately 60 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $6,818 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost of accomplishing the optional installation is estimated to be $10,118 per airplane. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
