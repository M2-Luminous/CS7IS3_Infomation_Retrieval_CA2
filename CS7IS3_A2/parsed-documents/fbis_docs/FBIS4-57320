The note states that more than 75 percent of the votes have already been counted. Balaguer leads his opponent Jose Francisco Pena Gomez by three points. Reports indicate that the country remains quiet and that military patrols are more frequent in the face of electoral fraud claims, a claim also made in past elections. Pena Gomez, who is the candidate for the Dominican Revolutionary Party, the main opposition in the elections, stated that 200,000 of his followers were not allowed to vote.

The government and the Central Electoral Commission have an obligation to correct the situation. [Balaguer] The elections have been fair. They claim that there has been so-called manipulation through the press, in complicity with foreign (?media). All these allegations must stand against the truth. The truth is stronger than anything.
