Vladimir Shumeyko met with newsmen ahead of an official visit by a Federation Council delegation to Latin America, which is due to start on Sunday. During the tour, the Russian delegation will visit Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and Ecuador. According to the speaker, Russia can profit considerably by using the experience of democratic consolidation in Latin American countries. In particular, he said, has gone through processes in its development very similar to those underway in Russia, namely a transition from early democracy to authoritarian rule, then to renewed democracy and market relations. Shumeyko also believes that Argentina has one of the most perfect civil codes on peace, which proves to mature democracy in this South American country. Apart from this, Argentina has already achieved national accord, which Russia is seeking at the moment. The present-day Russia is not guided by ideological considerations when choosing its partners, the Federation Council speaker noted. The main motivation is just mutually beneficial contacts. The potential foe such contacts with Latin American countries is enormous, and they should be certainly stepped up. Shumeyko confirmed his profound respect for Cuban leader Fidel Castro. "During my visit to Cuba, I had three-hour talks with Fidel, which showed that his assessment of the current political and economic situation, as well as of the global processes, has very little to do with its interpretation by the mass media", the speaker stressed. "Politicians of this level should not be spoken about in passing. Fidel Castro is the world's property, and I will never go back on my words".
