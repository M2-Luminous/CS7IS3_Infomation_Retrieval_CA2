The poll recently conducted by the Center of Empirical Research (STEM) showed that only three of the four right-wing government coalition parties and three of the six opposition parties would gain parliamentary seats in the elections "if held tomorrow", Vladimir Mlynar states in the paper. According to the poll, the coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would fill more than one-third of parliament, while the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) would gain 12 and 7 percent of votes respectively. (At present the ODS has 65 deputies in the 200-seat Czech Parliament, and the ODA and the KDU-CSL each 15.) As to the opposition, the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) and the Left Bloc grouping (LB, including communists) would be given each 13 percent of votes. The extreme-right opposition Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) would follow with 5 percent. "At least from two points of view, the situation in the Czech Republic is the same as that two years ago: The ODS would again absolutely win the elections, and every fifth Czech would again vote for the extreme political forces -- the communists and the Sladek-led republicans," Mlynar comments. "It is interesting that only a little more than one-third of the population claims to support the right-wing parties, while full 40 percent say they back the center policy (the remaining 20 percent are followers of left-wing parties). In simple words: At least two people out of five preferring the parties describing themselves as right-oriented, claim their support for the center. This logically implies that almost a half of the followers of the (right-wing government) coalition policy do not view this policy as a right-wing but as a center one," Mlynar writes. He also focuses on the extent of the support given to Czech political parties by individual population groups. If the elections were attended only by workers, who form the traditionally left-orientated part of the society, the government coalition would win with 40 percent of their votes (out of which 25 percent would be gained by the ODS, and 10 percent and 5 percent by the ODA and the KDU-CSL respectively). Only one-fourth of the workers would prefer the left-wing parties (the CSSD -- 16 percent, the LB -- 8 percent). The coalition's election victory would be sure among entrepreneurs (the ODS, the ODA and the KDU-CSL would gain 49, 15 and 4 percent respectively), Mlynar states. "The forces are less or more balanced with pensioners -- one- third of them wants to vote for the right wing, while only a little less (28 percent) are supporters of the left-leaning opposition," he continues. The unemployed equally split concerning political parties. They would give the 17-percent support to the SPR-RSC, 16 percent of votes to the ODS, while most of the remaining parties each would gain about 10 percent from them. With the other layers of the society, such as clerks, tradesmen and even housewives, the predominance of the coalition parties is more than evident, Mlynar says. The coalition would also clearly win among "specialists", that is intellectuals. However, the poll surprisingly showed that almost seven percent of these people were intending to vote for SPR-RSC leader Miroslav Sladek, Mlynar points out. "With the exception of the ODS, which -- with a certain simplification -- could be viewed as the party backed by entrepreneurs and clerks, our parties have not any firm social backing as yet," Mlynar writes. "Although party preferences have not undergone any significant changes during long months, there still exists a certain space for change. In other words, there still remains a chance for an opposition pursuing a reasonable policy," Mlynar comments. However, a miracle would probably have to occur for, let us say, present social democrats to succeed in addressing the workers. The first pre-requisite would have to be a change of party rhetoric, which is, as permanently proved by CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman, above the party's capability, Mlynar adds.
