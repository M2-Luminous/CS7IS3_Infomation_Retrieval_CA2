On Wednesday President Yeltsin dismissed Yablokov from the post of advisor on environmental and health matters and appointed him the chairman of a mixed environmental safety commission of the Russian Security Council. "That was my request, Yablokov stressed. Lately I could not work effectively enough. I said that to the president, implying that he did not take much interest in environmental matters either." Yablokov said that the decisions of the mixed commission will be compulsory for discussion, unlike the recommendations of a presidential advisor.
