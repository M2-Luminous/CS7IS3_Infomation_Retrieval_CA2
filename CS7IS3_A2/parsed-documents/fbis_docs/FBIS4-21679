The council urged DPRK to allow IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency) inspectors to complete the inspection activities agreed by the two sides last month. IAEA reported to the council earlier this month that because of DPRK's objection, it was unable to draw conclusions as to whether there has been either diversion of nuclear material or reprocessing or other operations. But DPRK argued that the inspections required by IAEA were beyond the line agreed upon by the two sides last month. The council also appealed to those member states engaged in dialogue with DPRK to continue their dialogue in accordance with the agreement. The United States, Britain and France at first insisted on using warning languages in either a resolution or a statement but met strong opposition from China, which said that anything done by the council should be mild and constructive and that any pressure against DPRK would be counterproductive. China's position got support from the 10 non-permanent member countries, which argued that since China was a next-door neighbor of DPRK, its observations should be respected. After several days of heated debate, the council at last reached consensus on the statement which contained most of China's suggestions.
