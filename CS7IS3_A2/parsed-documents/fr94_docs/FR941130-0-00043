FR941130-0-00043 FR941130-0-00003 III. Summary of Revisions to the Conversion Regulations For the reasons set forth in the previous section, the following revisions have been made to the interim final rule. All other provisions of the interim final rule, and the proposed rule on convenience and needs, are adopted without change. _The definition of ``Local Community'' in 12 CFR 563b.2(a)(19) is revised to include the generally used term ``metropolitan statistical area,'' all zip code areas corresponding to an association's delineated CRA service area, and any area(s) or category designated by the savings association and approved by the OTS. _12 CFR 563b.3(c)(2)(i), (4)(i), (5)(i), which required the LDP in the subscription phase of the conversion, are deleted in the final rule and sections (2) (ii) and (iii), (4) (ii)&hyph;(v), and (5) (ii) and (iii) are redesignated as sections (2) (i) and (ii), (4) (i)&hyph;(iv), and (5) (i) and (ii). _12 CFR 563b.3(c)(6)(iv) is revised to delete the phrase ``or within 100 miles of the association's home or branch office(s).'' _12 CFR 563b.3(c)(23) is revised to clarify that eligible account holders have first priority to purchase conversion stock, tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans have second priority, supplemental eligible account holders have third priority, and other voting members who have subscription rights have fourth priority. Also the final rule clarifies that if the actual offering exceeds the proposed maximum offering price, up to ten percent of the total offering of shares may be sold to the tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans; if the ESOP is not able to purchase conversion stock, the ESOP or any other tax-qualified plan may purchase shares in the open market or utilize authorized by unissued shares only with prior OTS approval; and disclosure must be made in the conversion application and related documents as to the effects on the association and subscribers of shares of either open market purchases or use of authorized but unissued shares. _12 CFR 563b.3(d)(12) is redesignated as 12 CFR 563b.3(d)(13) and a new 12 CFR 563b.3(d)(12) is added to give converting associations the authority to include a preference for eligible account holders, supplemental eligible account holders and other voting members residing in the association's local community. _12 CFR 563b.3(g)(3)(i)(B) is revised to clarify that repurchases within year two and year three after conversion must be part of a repurchase program that does not allow for a repurchase of more than 5% of the association's outstanding capital stock during a twelve month period. _12 CFR 563b.3(g)(3)(i)(D) revises the reference from Corporate and Securities Division to Business Transactions Division. _12 CFR 563b.3(g)(3)(ii) is revised to give the OTS discretion to allow limited stock repurchases during the first three years in amounts exceeding those specified in (g)(3)(i), where exceptional circumstances are established. _12 CFR 563b.3(g)(4) (vii) and (viii) are revised to require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a shareholder meeting for the establishment and implementation of management stock benefit plans and stock option plans within one year of conversion. _12 CFR 563b.3(g)(4) (vii) and (viii) also are revised to allow approval of stock option plans and management stock benefit plans at any duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no earlier than six months after completion of the conversion.
