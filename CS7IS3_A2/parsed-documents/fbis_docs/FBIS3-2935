Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Tian Jiyun made the remark when delivering a work report of the NPC Standing Committee here today. He said, as China has instituted this year more reform measures than before, it is necessary to guide, promote and guarantee reforms with law. This calls for accelerating legislation, especially economic legislation. The five-year tenure of the eighth NPC is an important period for China to establish a socialist market economy and realize the second-phase goal of the modernization program. The NPC Standing Committee has worked out its work priorities in accordance with the general situation and tasks of the state: under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the Communist Party, to take the strengthening of a socialist democratic and legal system as its fundamental task, further improve the people's congress system, ensure enforcement of the Constitution and law, and push forward the development of a socialist market economy. In the past year, the NPC Standing Committee formulated, amended and adopted 21 laws and law-related decisions, including 13 relating to a socialist market economy, setting a record in legislative work. In addition, it approved 17 treaties, conventions and agreements signed with foreign countries or acceded to by China. During the year, the NPC Standing Committee and the special committees assigned 37 inspection groups to examine the enforcement of 18 laws. At the same time, the Standing Committee heard and deliberated work reports on finance, foreign trade, education, anti-corruption and civil aviation submitted by the State Council, relevant departments, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate. Tian noted that raising motions and suggestions is an important form for deputies to exercise their right to administer state affairs and help state organs accept people's supervision and improve their work. At the first session of the eighth NPC last year, deputies put forward 611 motions. Ninety-three of the motions have been submitted to special committees for deliberation. Most of them relate to legislation. The remaining 517 motions were handled as suggestions and criticisms, and together with 2,325 pieces of suggestions, have had responses from relevant departments. Development of exchanges with foreign parliaments is a component of state foreign affairs as well as an important task for the Standing Committee. In the past year, delegations headed by the chairman or vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee visited 26 countries, while the Standing Committee received visiting delegations of 37 parliaments or international parliamentarian organizations.
