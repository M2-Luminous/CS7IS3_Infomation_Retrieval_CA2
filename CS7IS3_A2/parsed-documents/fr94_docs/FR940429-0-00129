FR940429-0-00129 FR940429-0-00013 Information on crimes reported to these officials could be included in records classified as protected from non-consensual disclosure under FERPA regulations. However, FERPA does not prohibit the disclosure of statistical, non-personally identifiable information. The Secretary does not interpret FERPA to prevent compliance with the timely warning provision, as in a case of an emergency involving the safety of others_even where the identity of an individual may be disclosed. Changes: The Secretary has revised the definition of campus security authority to include, in addition to those individuals or organizations specified by the institution's statement of campus security policy as those to whom criminal offenses should be reported, other officials of the institution who have significant responsibility for student and campus activities, but only if those officials do not have significant counseling responsibilities. The definition has also been revised expressly to include a campus law enforcement unit. Victim's Rights Comments: A number of commenters said that victims should have the option of consulting with student affairs personnel before deciding whether or not to report the occurrence of a crime. Some commenters said that the victim of a crime on campus should be allowed to report the crime anonymously. Discussion: Under these final regulations, victims of a crime on campus remain free to seek confidential counseling from campus administrators who have significant counseling responsibilities. Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the HEA and these regulations require the statistical reporting of crimes to the campus community, not personally identifiable accounts of crimes. A victim who reports a crime to a campus security authority may, of course, request anonymity to the extent practicable and permitted by local law. Changes: None. Monitoring Crimes On-Campus and Off-Campus Comments: A few commenters requested that the Secretary require institutions to monitor crimes that take place in areas other than those proposed in the NPRM. For example, the commenters believe it is within the spirit of the statute to monitor crime on public and private property that is not owned or controlled by an institution, but that is frequented by the institution's students. This recommendation would include the neighborhood surrounding the campus. One commenter indicated that there are many unidentifiable properties within the institution's area that are controlled by recognized organizations, but that the properties of the organizations are not officially recognized by the institution. Discussion: Neither the HEA nor these regulations require institutions to gather data and report to the campus community about off-campus crime. Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the HEA and these regulations require institutions to disclose statistics about particular crimes that occur on campus. The statute includes in the definition of ``campus'' any building or property owned or controlled by student organizations recognized by the institution. Institutions should note, however, that an institution can be considered to control certain space that may be owned by a third party. For example, some institutions rent space in building owned by a third party; the institution controls the space that it occupies and that space is covered under these provisions of the HEA. Changes: None. Timely Warning to the Campus Community Comments: A few commenters requested a clear definition of ``timely reports'' for the purpose of section 485(f)(3) of the HEA and these regulations, which require an institution to make timely reports to the campus community on crimes that are reported to campus security authorities or local police and that are considered a threat to other students and employees. Some commenters believed that timely warnings made by those who are not enforcement personnel could jeopardize a criminal investigation and allow a suspect to be released. Other commenters believe that the campus community must be informed of these threats and these provisions allow the law enforcement authorities to receive the evidence to build a case. Discussion: The Secretary does not believe that a definition of ``timely reports'' is necessary or warranted. Rather, the Secretary believes that timely reporting to the campus community for this purpose must be decided on a case-by-case basis in light of all the facts surrounding a crime, including factors such as the nature of the crime, the continuing danger to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts. Campus security authorities should consult the local law enforcement agency for guidance on how and when to release ``timely reports'' to the campus community. Changes: None. Coordination With State Requirements Comment: One commenter said that State and Federal requirements pertaining to the disclosure of crime statistics by institutions should be coordinated with respect to both the types of crimes reported and the dates for disclosure. Discussion: The Secretary supports coordinated efforts to disclose all required statistical disclosures to the extent they are consistent with specific requirements of section 485(f) of the HEA and these regulations. Changes: None. Distribution of Annual Security Report Comments: One commenter requested clarification as to the means of distribution of the annual security report. The commenter wondered whether the institution would be required to mail the security report to current students and employees or could simply notify them about how to obtain the security report. Another commenter requested the Secretary to identify those to whom an annual security report is given only upon request. Discussion: These regulations require that the annual security report be distributed to all current students and employees, and to any prospective student and employee upon request. As defined in ยง668.41(b), a prospective student is one who has requested information concerning admission to the institution. However, because of the importance of this information regarding personal safety, the Secretary believes that any person requesting information on admission should be notified of the availability of the report, given a summary of the report, and given an opportunity to request it. A prospective employee requesting an application for employment from the institution or information about employment at the institution should be treated in the same manner as a prospective student. The Secretary agrees that these regulations need to clarify how the report is distributed. Changes: The regulations have been changed to clarify the methods of distribution that are to be used to ensure individual delivery of the security report. An institution may choose to distribute the report by any of the following means: (1) Directly mailing of the report to each individual through the U.S. Postal Service, campus mail, or computer network; or (2) providing the report directly to each individual (by hand-delivery). Institutions may include the security report as a part of an institutional publication that is distributed to each individual, such as a catalog, student handbook, registration materials, or tuition bill. An institution must provide prospective students and employees information about the availability of the report and a summary of the information in it. Reporting Crime Data
