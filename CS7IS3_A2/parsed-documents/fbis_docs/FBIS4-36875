'Arafat had made the offer in a series of letters sent to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last week after a major rumpus over the fate of the city both sides claim as capital. "The PLO leader expressed his intention to smooth over differences and reduce tension," the official told AFP. "He is ready to withdraw the question of Jerusalem from the agenda for the time being." Arafat also urged Israel to respect the written undertaken from Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres last October to allow Palestinian institutions to continue operating in East Jerusalem. [sentence as received] Under the Declaration of Principles for autonomy, the Jerusalem issue would not be raised until the third year of Palestinian self-rule when negotiations on a permanent settlement are set to be begin. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war and has declared the united city its eternal capital. The PLO demands to share Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the HA'ARETZ newspaper reported that the government had decided not to allow 'Arafat to enter East Jerusalem during his visit to the autonomous Palestinian areas which is expected to take place sometime this month. The army had voiced that 'Arafat's arrival in East Jerusalem would lead to clashes between Palestinians and the Israeli right-wing. Some extremists have called for 'Arafat to be murdered. Rabin said last month that the PLO leader would not be allowed into Jerusalem for at least two years.
