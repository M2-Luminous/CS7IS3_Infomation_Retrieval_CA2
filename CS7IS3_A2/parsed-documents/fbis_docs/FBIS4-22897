A list of enzymes with the number of their scored gene loci and commission code number, examples of abnormal heritability products of enzyme gene loci revealed by the electrophoresis study, the frequencies of various types of enzyme gene loci mutations induced by ionizing radiation in Pinus sylvestris L. macrospores after the accident, the genetic efficiency of radiation in the relocation area based on Pinus sylvestris L. data, and the rate of loci mutation which are encoding the enzyme synthesis in Pinus sylvestris L. endosperms in the relocation area are summarized, and the dependence of the viable seed yield and various types of mutations on the dosage rate is plotted. The findings confirm that the pine is a convenient test system which makes it possible to take into account the mutations induced at the hametic level, thus making a certain contribution to developing forecasts of long-term genetic consequences as they apply to other species where observation of mutations is complicated due to biological or ethical considerations.
