Kvantrishvili was a man who personified the attributes of our time. Authoritative in criminal communities and respected by the establishment and high society, he represented solid proof of sociologists' contentions that respectable capital draws its strength from shadow sources. While continuing to generate income of "unidentified origin," he at the same time took pains to create a completely different image for people of this kind: He invested immense sums in reinforcing his image as a public figure, helped the sports movement, and justly criticized the policy of breaking-up the Union. Over a short period of time he was able to achieve great popularity. There is probably no other criminal reporter whose creative paths crossed the "Kvantrishvili topic" as frequently as those of Larisa Kislinskaya. In several published materials she persistently drew the readers' attention to dark spots in his biography. As a result, she earned the honor of the "godfather" referring to her by name... She got several threats over the telephone, and one even delivered on television (!). Truly, we have strange ways of using our scarce air time. It appears that a period of "extraordinary circumstances" has begun for the kingpins of the criminal world. Over the past several months alone the leader of Balashikha group, Sergey Frolov, was killed; Grigoriy Solomatin--the "authority" who shot Frolov--disappeared immediately thereafter. Also shot and killed were Sergey Sokolov, one of the gang leaders of the Pushkino group, and Sultan Daudov, the only Chechen crime boss living in the Moscow suburbs. Andrey Isayev--a crime boss nicknamed Signature [Rospis]--having barely recovered from old wounds, nearly got blown up in a car. This assassination attempt failed, too: Although Signature was seriously wounded, he is alive; two girls were seriously maimed by TNT charges the car was boobytrapped with, and a nearby militiaman was wounded. A second assassination attempt did succeed in the case of Vyacheslav Vanner (nicknamed Bobon)--the right-hand man of the crime boss nicknamed Globe [Globus] (Valeriy Dlugach) shot to death almost a year ago. Yuriy Stupenkov, president of the Russian professional league Kitek and the professional club by the same name, got caught in sniper fire. He had a previous conviction and enjoyed a certain authority in capital city criminal circles--like the previously convicted famous boxer Oleg Karatayev, who was shot to death at Brighton Beach. The Georgian crime boss Dzhamal Mikeladze (nicknamed Arsen), on the other hand, was killed in Tbilisi. Another old Georgian crime boss Givi Beradze (nicknamed Scarface Givi) also disappeared. Small gang leaders of the Pushkino and Koptevo-Dolgoprudnoye criminal groups were pursued and disposed of with enviable persistency. One might think, what else could happen that could shock Muscovites, who are used to everything by now? However, the murder of Otari Kvantrishvili, president of the Lev Yashin Foundation for Social Protection of Sportsmen, former vice president of the 21st Century association, was a real sensation. Not because it was clearly a contract murder, as evidenced by the rifle with optical scope left in the attic of the house where the sniper fire came from, and the fact that the killers and their customers definitely knew that on Tuesdays between 1400 and 1800 Otari Kvantrishvili unfailingly visited Krasnopresnenskiy bathhouse. It was the identity of the slain person. He was known for his charitable activities; he appeared on television almost every evening urging protection of the Russian genetic fund and Russian statehood; he even appeared at militia concerts; at the same time, in the unanimous opinion of enforcement services, he was a major "authority" in the crime world and could easily claim the title of a "godfather" of our mafia. So who was Otari Kvantrishvili in reality, in whose way did he stand, and who is behind his murder? It is practically impossible to give an exhaustive answer to these questions, but we will try to reconstruct some pages from the biography of the man who is now buried next to Vladimir Vysotskiy--in the same place where a little earlier his brother Amiran, shot to death in August of last year in the course of gang score-settling in the office of the Vodoley international enterprise on Bolshaya Yakimanka Street, found his final resting place. Several thousand people gathered at Vagankovskoye cemetery on 8 April--the day of junior Kvantrishvili's funeral. Among them were such famous people as Iosif Kobzon, a friend and cohort of the deceased in many undertakings; the singers Aleksandr Rozenbaum and Anatoliy Dneprov; the comedian Oleg Marusev; and famous athletes and public figures. And this is quite understandable--the deceased had friends among militia generals, marshals, Olympic champions, artistic bohemia, television commentators, and journalists, and had "access" to the very top echelons of authority. But at the same time this funeral was attended by crowds of athletic-looking young men dressed either in cashmere coats or tight leather. All of them were hiding behind dark glasses or turned away from photographers and television cameramen. Some journalists were warned: "Do not take close shots or we will smash your camera." Others were permitted to take only panoramic shots or pictures of famous performers. This is also understandable: All these people are active members of the so-called organized crime groups--Izmaylovo, Solntsevo, Balashikha, Kazan, and Dolgoprudnoye. There was, of course, a large delegation representing the Georgian criminal community operating in Moscow. At this sort of event enmity is put aside--the "Chechen community" also sent its delegates. According to some information, all the well-known crime bosses (there are almost 50 Georgian and 14 Armenian ones alone living in Moscow) bid their farewell to the deceased during the night, after he had been eulogized in the church right here on Vagankovskoye cemetery. It is not yet known whether criminal "authorities"--leaders of aforementioned groups--were among them. All of them clearly did not want to come into view of enforcement services, knowing very well that Otari Vitalyevich's funeral would be shown on television on numerous occasions. There were even rumors that the famous crime boss Vyacheslav Ivankov, nicknamed "the Jap," may arrive from the United States incognito, wearing a wig and makeup. Either he got cold feet, however (after all, he is on the federal wanted list here), or the makeup was exceptionally good... The crowd that gathered at Vagankovskoye cemetery that day and then later at the wake at the Moscow Hotel was as disparate in composition as the opinions about the deceased. Although Otari Kvantrishvili was born in 1948 in the Georgian town of Zestafioni and spent his early childhood there, he considered Krasnaya Presnya his home (it is symbolic that this is where he was killed, and this is where he was buried). Over the past few years, though, he lived in Odintsovskiy Rayon, in a house purchased from Marshal Savitskiy. In the same area he built another mansion--with a pool, steam bath, and a training wrestling gym. He watched his health carefully, engaged in sports, and did not drink or smoke. He did gamble, though. He started card games together with his brother at the Sovetskaya Hotel. In militia jargon, their specialization was called "rollers." It was then that the two young talents were noticed by famous crime bosses of old school--Anatoliy Cherkasov (nicknamed Cherkas), Leonid Korolev (nicknamed the Loafer), and Scarface Givi. It was these crime bosses, whom Otari Vitalyevich worshipped at the time, who entrusted him with "watching over" the racetrack and keeping an eye on the totalizator. The crime bosses placed their bets on the younger brother, since the older one had a reputation as an active gambler and a very unlucky one, despite the fact that this whole team played only in their own digs, specially equipped with imported radio and television systems, optical devices installed by engineers and physicists. This is where they skinned gullible plebeians. Otari Vitalyevich soon realized, however, that it is not a good idea to limit his social circle to just criminal "authorities": He was a professional athlete; later worked as a coach at the Dynamo stadium. This is where he acquired many acquaintances in militia circles. He was very proud of these ties, and imposed his company even on top officials of criminal investigations. Until the last moment he made it clear to criminals of his acquaintance that he could help, that he had it "all covered" over there. I remember how in one telephone conversation with the author of this material (I will tell you the reason for these calls a little further on), Kvantrishvili mentioned that he had raised many athletes who now work in the MVD and KGB system and help him. And that he is like a father to them--and this is not at all because of money... As the conversation went on, the main character of Mario Puzo's "Godfather" unwittingly came to mind. Because Don Corleone, too, demanded only favors and loyalty of the people he helped. Let us go back to the younger years of our hero. In 1966 he had a little mishap--he was sentenced to nine years for participation in a group rape. He got an early release--after four years, somehow a medical report surfaced on his psychological ill-being, which said that the prisoner was suffering from latent schizophrenia. At the time the Moscow criminal world was run by the crime boss Gennadiy Karkov, nicknamed Mongol. As soon as he was put behind bars, the throne went to another kingpin of the criminal world, Mongol's disciple, the Jap. When finally in 1982 Ivankov also was put on ice, Otari Vitalyevich remained free, despite the fact that the criminal file on the Jap's case contains documents showing that the sportsman had some part in the actions of Ivankov and Co. Later, this patron was not forgotten, either. Besides, the old "boss" Cherkasov died, and O. Kvantrishvili buried him, helped his family. While Ivankov "languished" in a Tula camp, Kvantrishvili raised his sons, and got them involved in athletics. A real opportunity to help the Jap opened only in 1989. Such frenetic activities were launched to free him that in the haste this especially dangerous repeat offender--who, while being in the zone, never lifted anything heavier than a glass--almost got amnestied for shock labor and exemplary behavior. Well, he was not exactly amnestied, but he was indeed released early. I told this entire story in March 1992 in an article "Crime Bosses and Their Benefactors." I was warned at 38 Petrovka that Otari Vitalyevich would not overlook this--lately, his greatest concern had been his clean image. And his image was by then indeed quite well shaped: a patron of the arts, a fixture on television, children's and sportsmen's best friend. Having spent some time finding out my unlisted address and telephone number, Otari Vitalyevich called me at the beginning of summer 1992. He was very polite: "As a Christian and a father of four, I feel that a misfortune may befall you. There is plot being hatched, and possibly something will happen to you, but this will not be my fault, and I have already written a statement to this effect to the Krasnopresnenskiy Rayon procurator." He had always been a man of foresight: If he happened to go out carrying arms in his younger years (later on he had almost 150 bodyguards protecting him), he had a gun in one pocket and in the other--a statement to the procuracy: "I was walking down the street when I found this gun, and I am surrendering it to you." He already hated me with a passion by then, as he told mutual acquaintances in militia circles. "Well, you are a Georgian--are you going to fight a woman?" one general asked him. "I do not fight women," my telephone companion soon told me. "But when a juggernaut like me gets moving, you understand..." He himself told me more than once, and it was not hard for me to guess, that his calls were of a tactical-preventive nature. He did not refute anything that I had written, especially considering that in the article on the subject of the Jap's early release, Otari Vitalyevich did not figure very prominently (there were more substantial names mentioned in it). He simply used to call at about 2300, ask why I sounded unhappy, complain that the militia was unfair to him... It so happened that I published part of our conversation--also as a preventive measure--in the next article, in which I described Otari Vitalyevich's role in freeing from prison a certain "authority" nicknamed Plum. A member of Ivankov's gang and his emissary in Moscow, Plum was detained in Solnechnoye Motel with enough drugs to convict two; as time passed, however, the dope "evaporated" to symbolic proportions, and the Jap's best friend was free again. This article did not interfere with our telephone "friendship" either. This ended in August 1993, when the older brother Amiran was shot to death. Strangely, the loving younger brother directed all his wrath not at the cutthroats who had killed the unarmed Amiran when the latter, together with a Samara criminal nicknamed Crazy Fedya, came to sort things out with members of the "Chechen community" in the office of Vodoley company, but again at a journalist who wondered why criminal world "authorities," of which Amiran was one, are buried at the cemetery that is the traditional resting place for those who had been the pride of the nation. By the way, Amiran Vitalyevich had not cared to create for himself an image like his brother's. He had different hobbies: While remaining a card player, and having gone through the school of prison, Amiran Vitalyevich suddenly became a playwright and allegedly wrote a play. Moscow criminal investigations detectives, attempting to follow this amusing story, told me that the newly hatched writer manages to make at least five mistakes even in a three-letter word. Anyway, Otari Vitalyevich told me: "God will punish you. As for me, this is the last time I will call you. My brother was killed, and you call him a gangster." Quite possibly, God did punish me for something--nobody is a saint--but not for this: A gangster is a still a gangster even when he is dead. The calls did indeed stop. But especially after October, when Otari Vitalyevich began to appear on television daily and many of his speeches resembled preaching, I occasionally heard direct hints addressed at me: "All these articles resemble the relations between the Elephant and Moska the Dog. The time will come when the Elephant will grow annoyed and will simply step on Moska." The charitable foundation's president quite frequently used precious air time for personal purposes: He upbraided journalists who got out of line (some of them had dared to joke about the appearance of a champion nominated by O.V. for president of the sportsmen's party he had founded); he wagged his finger at the militia, hinting that the chief of the regional organized crime unit of the Moscow City Administration of Internal Affairs has children. These were amazing broadcasts: Anchormen cowed before him, and call-ins came only from people who said something like "Oh, Otari Vitalyevich is such an amazing person. We are grateful that he exists." One anchorman could not help but draw a comparison: "In the past we said--thank you, Leonid Ilich, for being; now the same is being said to you, Otari Vitalyevich." I do not think I saw this anchorman anymore. The foundation president lectured Aleksey Matveyev, a ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA sports reporter: "You will be knowledgeable about sports when you stop arguing with me. And anyway, you are too caustic, bitter. Think about it. Or you will get whacked." My colleague published this, and a month later was hospitalized with deep lacerations to his face. Such a coincidence. He repeated many things to everyone. His phrase: "I do not take away anything from anyone and do not even ask. They bring everything and give it to me of their own volition" became proverbial. Nevertheless in one of our evening telephone conversations he mentioned one of our millionaires: "I tell him--Artem, give a million to needy children. And he, the rat, does not." I have also heard this opinion: Wherever his money came from, he gave it to the indigent, children, and orphans. Such a modern Robin Hood. But the times of noble robbers are gone--now is the time of noble mafiosi. For instance, John Gotti, the head of the powerful Italian clan of the American Cosa Nostra, built a hospital for the poor in a New York borough with his family's money. But in the United States, money "laundered" this way did not clean up the influential mafioso in the eyes of public opinion or in the eyes of the law. For our vulnerable Criminal Code, people like Kvantrishvili are invulnerable. He began building his fortune by helping to collect debts--something done now partly by racketeering brigades, and partly by private detective companies: one half of the money for the client, one half for yourself. "I do not take anything away from anybody..." In quite a recent criminal case--kidnapping an Australian couple for ransom--there is testimony by one of the suspects, who told how his company Sovavstraltekhnika began to be "visited" by racketeers. One employee suggested to the head of the joint enterprise a meeting with Otari Vitalyevich and remarked that the latter may help to settle the incident. Kvantrishvili--at the time vice president of 21st Century--said that everything could be taken care of provided that the company become a member of his association and pay an initiation fee, and also suggested that they sponsor a boxing association and contribute money to the Uralochka volleyball team. This was not all: Otari Vitalyevich demanded that the joint enterprise hire his people (all of them were later charged with organizing the kidnapping). In turn, "his people" began to dictate their terms to the head of the company. Otari Vitalyevich's name also was mentioned in court in connection with a case of "hooliganism" in the fall of 1988. "Hooliganism" meant a shootout (at the time this was still a sensation) between members of the Lyubertsy and Dolgoprudnenskoye groups. The overzealous lawyer read out the testimony of one of the defendants about to whom the gang, which extorted protection money from cooperative members, prostitutes, and merchants, paid its own "duty." Another arrested businessman described how the foundation president made others hire people to work for their company. First he demanded a million for the needy, and then, on learning that his request had been refused, sent the company a Balashikha brigade led by a major "authority"--the now-deceased Frol. By the way, Sergey Frolov and his gangsters were under Otari Vitalyevich's protection, and so were the Solntsevo, Lyubertsy, Podolsk, Dolgoprudnoye, and Kazan groups. Maintaining good relations with the leaders of these gangs, Otari Vitalyevich implanted "his eagles" from these gangsters into large government organizations, commercial structures, and banks. This in turn enabled the gangsters to launder money obtained through criminal activities, as well as first claim some part of the income of some or other company, and then later take complete control of it. In short, he did not take away anything from anyone and did not even ask. They brought everything to him and gave it to him of their own volition. He was a strong and wealthy man, but had no forgiveness whatsoever for those who went against him. Although rumor has it that he backed off when faced with a more formidable force. One of the versions of his murder is based precisely on this assumption. Everybody expected Otari Vitalyevich to take revenge for the death of his older brother. This did not happen, however. The Georgian "crime bosses" denounced him for this. There are rumors that the "Chechen community" actually declared war on him. Especially considering that he had had a conflict with members of this clan over the privatization of one of the largest hotels located not far from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He set his sights on the hotel, which had already been under the Chechen's "wing" for a long time; Otari Vitalyevich backed off. In April this year Kvantrishvili traveled to St. Petersburg, where he had an altercation with the local "crime bosses." One can judge how serious this conflict was by the fact that he asked the Lubyanka to assign to him a protection group from the special unit "Vympel" (his 150 bodyguards were people in a different line of specialization, to put it mildly). In addition, Otari Vitalyevich acquired for himself a foreign travel passport in a different name so that in case of danger he could quietly slip out of the country (after all his talk of love for the motherland). It is hard to tell what triggered this conflict--division of spheres of influence or claims that the foundation president had distanced himself too far from the people (underworld people, that is). Otari Vitalyevich heard this kind of comment from the Moscow "authorities" as well, who were unhappy with the excessively intense political and social activities of their acquaintance and his close ties to the militia. In the opinion of professionals, this kind of murder is done only over money. And the money involved here is considerable. Take, for instance, one of the sectors "supervised" by Otari Vitalyevich--the gaming business. The profits are gigantic. But lately a well-known "authority" Silvestr began to control an increasingly greater share of this juicy morsel. There is talk in the criminal underworld that a major leader had something to do with the latest events. Besides, a friend and confederate of Silvestr, but at the same time his rival--an "authority" nicknamed Beard--some time ago disappeared under mysterious circumstances. His corpse with a garrote around the neck was recently fished out of the Yauza River. Besides, there are quite a few people in Silvestr's entourage--and he does not hide this fact--who are well-trained marksmen, who handle firearms professionally... Not without the approval of their American patron--the Jap--Moscow mafiosi implement in practice the motto: The worse it gets for the Russian mafiosi (Otari Kvantrishvili did not hide his attitude toward the Slavic clan), the worse it gets for "Chechens." And, as I have already mentioned, the Russian mafiosi have lately encountered quite a few setbacks. When gangsters get rid of gangsters, it is to their benefit to implant in the public mind completely opposite versions. Hence the rumors that the "hunt" on "authorities" is being conducted by the MVD-KGB, and that allegedly a "White Arrow" team had been set up for this purpose. It is not hard to guess that with such rumors circulating, it is much easier to get rid of rivals. Overall, however, the latest events are evidence of complete runaway lawlessness: Not only are major bankers and businessmen, as well as accidental passersby, getting killed--the biggest figures in the underworld are also getting knocked off. In the past this was an extraordinary event in the criminal world. But the current decline in moral standards has affected it, too--there is already a whole new generation for whom there is no authority, including criminal. This decline in morals also is evident from the fact that the car of singer and composer Vladimir Migul was blown up next to a school, on Paliashhvili Street. An eyewitness to the event, the son of a girlfriend of mine, said that the only thing that saved the kids was that it happened in the middle of classes. And added: "When I was in Italy I heard that there--the homeland of the Mafia--it is taboo to settle scores near schools." Well, it may be taboo over there. Here, however, virtual battles unfold in kindergartens, many of which have been leased to commercial dealers. There have already been two such instances in Moscow. In one the gangsters even used the children as cover as they retreated. Neither is it good manners "over there" to openly launder dirty money; here, we say: "Who cares where the money came from; the important thing is that he helped people." Over there, newspaper disclosures may at least tarnish an image. Here this only costs the journalist a cut-up face. Over there one cannot reach the pinnacle of power with a questionable reputation. Here a twice-convicted man may become an adviser to the vice president! (By the way, Kvantrishvili supported a totalitarian state. Although he did not show up on television back then, at least he could live in peace.) Over there, laws work; here, the mafia operates. And although Otari Vitalyevich was by status several orders of magnitude higher than the leaders he knew and who had been killed a little earlier, his life ended the same way--from a bullet meant precisely for him. I have also heard this question: Are we not on the threshold of mafia wars? I think that the latest events, including those that took place in front of the Krasnopresnenskiy bathhouse, tell us that the mafia has declared war, but not on rivals--on statehood.
