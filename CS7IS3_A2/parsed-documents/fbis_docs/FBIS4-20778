The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Sharad Pawar, has stressed the need for the Congress to dispel the impression that it was only chasing after power. Congressmen should work hard to regain the confidence of the people. "The time has come for the party functionaries to volunteer for organisational work." I will be the happiest person to take up any responsibility," he said in an interview to THE HINDU excerpts from which [as published] been published yesterday. The following are more questions and answers. Q: You were once credited with the idea that those in Government give up power..... No, I am not speaking of another Kamaraj Plan. I had definitely suggested that our position has reached such a state in some areas that unless we work very hard, we will not be able to enthuse the party workers and regain the confidence of the public. We should make the people realise that we are serious. There is an impression that we are here only for the sake of power. We have to act to prove that power is only one important instrument to deliver the goods and there are Congressmen who are not chasing power but wish to give a stable government, stability to the country and a proper direction to the Government. If the Congress is weakened, the nation will be weakened. If there is no strong Government in Delhi, the country's economy would be hurt. Without a proper environment, its health would deteriorate, affecting the common man. It is the party's moral duty to keep this country together, keep a stable government at the national and State levels and see that the economic health improves. If this has to be achieved I think the time has come for many important party functionaries to forget other things, including power for some time and concentrate on the party by volunteering themselves for organisational work. I will be the happiest person to take up any responsibility like this. Q: Will persons come forward? There are many who are ready to work, are in a position to deliver the goods. If this kind of suggestion comes from the party leadership, I think there are many leaders who will respond. Q: The economic reforms are in place. You have listed the problems, you have suggested what attitude is required. What is the specific programme to deliver the goods? If the Congress were to discuss and decide some definite programme...but how? To rebuild, go to the masses. There should be more mass contact. Go and listen to the hostile people. Have to go into details to understand why the hostility. Q: In effect, is it like having to almost start a new party? Yes, in some areas, it is like that. In the Hindi belt we have to work like that. Q: You once floated the idea of wider consultations to get the party back to its healthy bounce. What happened to that? It was discussed and decided that there should be a broader meeting, beyond an extended CWC [Congress Working Committee], of 100 to 200 people from all over the country for a Narora-type session, to assess the situation and finalise the programme. Our colleagues in CWC are thinking on those lines. These kind of camps could give a definite direction. Then the question would arise: who will execute the task? Then the question will be about who will give time and not expect anything in return? I think a lot of people will respond within the Congress party. Collective Action Q: A lot of people will have to respond since the party is not the same as it was in its earlier phases, not specifically controlled by an individual... The situation is definitely changing. No individual can do all this. There has to be collective action. There has to be a team and there has to be a leadership like that of Narasimha Rao, who has to give direction to the team. Q: The solution lies in collective action emerging under the direction of the party president? That is right. Q. Has it been missing for some time, maybe one or two years? I don't say missing, but we are not going on those lines. That thinking is there, that feeling is there but no action on those lines. Q: This lack of action cannot be the character of the Congress, which normally sets much store by its own survival regardless of... You see, though Congressmen are generally inclined to work, unfortunately, this time what has happened is that the traditional bases of the party have been wiped out...the minorities, SCs [Scheduled Castes], STs [Scheduled Tribes], backward classes, the middle classes, the brahmins in UP [Uttar Pradesh]. They have deserted us. And we are not ready to pay a serious thought why they have deserted. Karunakaran and Janardhan Reddy Committees have given their report. I read it in the newspapers but have no official copy. I think we have to go into details, repair things, because there is no choice. Q: Do you agree with the tone and content of the report? I have not read it. The tone of the newspapers is motivated. Just to write against me. It is the tone of the person who briefed. His tone was perceptible in the reports. Some of the members of the committee have said we have not discussed this. We discussed poll outcome with 700 persons.....It is not important. Except for one or two persons who may have said something. It is not important, there may be some sentences here and there. They said it was not the committee's contention. Some of the members have told me that. Q: The time and effort needed to build the party in time for the polls would be....? We are not in a position to wait for years. We have to act immediately since we have to face the Lok Sabha elections in 1996 and get people's support. That is an immediate task. The other side is to rebuild the organisation at various levels. It may take two, three years, maybe even five years. Q: When the bottomline has to evolve, some major decisions would have to be taken. Do you think CWC will rise to the occasion? It has to. It is the question of next two, three weeks. Major decisions on organisation have to be taken. What is happening today is that when Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh are taking decisions and there is some acceptance, though it has led -- some rise in prices -- people are suffering they also feel this is a proper direction. But this is what the Government is doing. That is not enough. I have seen in China, where communism has been continuously propagated in the past, that the whole nation is talking about economic reforms, and that is because the party has taken up that challenge. It has created that atmosphere. Take any person, landless labour, factory worker or a jawan of the PLA [People's Liberation Army], everybody discusses restructuring of economy. Because the party has taken the job on hand. Here the Government has done everything and as Congressmen we could not create that kind of favourable atmosphere for the reforms and there is a gap. Who has read Dunkel carefully? Are we to isolate ourselves from the global community? In national interest we have to sit with others in a shrinking world, everyone coming together. We cannot escape from the changes. There is no deliberate gap but there is no effort. We are the people who are responsible for it. All leaders at all levels. We have to go to the people and explain to them. If we talk, people respond, they are happy with the changes. People have to take the party president more seriously.
