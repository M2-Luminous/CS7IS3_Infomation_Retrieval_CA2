In Medellin, capital of Antioquia Department, northwest of here, and Santa Fe de Bogota these actions occurred for the second time in a little less than one week, carried out by members of student and youth organizations, the sources added. The first contingent of U.S. military troops arrived on the Colombian Pacific Coast late in December with the announced purpose of building a school and hospital in that region. There are currently some 259 U.S. troops, who must leave Colombia in three months, although journalistic circles speak of a possible extension of their stay.
