He said one proposal being considered is a plan to inspect ships once they have docked at al-'Aqabah, instead of the current procedure of stopping and searching them before they reach the Port of al-'Aqabah. The U.S. State Department's Michael McCurry said the United States is examining proposals that are supposed to respond to the Jordanian Government's concerns.
