The official radio station reported that the number of taxis participating in the protest could reach 200 vehicles and that police have intervened to guarantee the free movement of vehicles and pedestrians in the area. Meanwhile, Sandinist Deputy William Ramirez told the media that police have stopped transferring 65 of the 225 arrested strikers to the Police Processing Unit out of fear of strikers staging a "rescue attempt." Police have charged the strikers with meeting with criminal intent and disrupting public order. The strikers were arrested after they set up the first barricades and "blockaded" streets with buses and taxis. After reports by relatives of police beatings, Nicaraguan Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta authorized representatives of Human Rights Commissions to visit the prisoners to verify their situation.
