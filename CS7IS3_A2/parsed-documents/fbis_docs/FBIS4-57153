[Granic] We have decided to begin cooperation but we have not specified details. Among other things, we have agreed to recognize diplomas in a cultural agreement. We are waiting for the signing of another five agreements in the economic sector. We believe they will be signed within a month. They pertain to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and matters in the veterinary sector -- the most important agreement being the one pertaining to legal security and the protection of investments -- and we will also sign an agreement to prevent double taxation. We already have exemplary relations with Argentina from the political viewpoint; Argentina was one of the first countries to recognize us. We also have Argentine Blue Helmets in our territory, and we recently received the visit of President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. We are now entering into the economic and trade phases. [Vrljicak-Espain] How will you undertake relations with the rest of Latin America? [Granic] We are interested mainly in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. [Vrljicak-Espain] Argentina does not have an embassy in Croatia. What will be done in this respect? [Granic] For the time being we will manage through Vienna because it is just a budget matter. [Vrljicak-Espain] Regarding your relations with Russia and the conflict with the Serbs, why was the recent cease-fire agreement signed at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb? [Granic] It is true Russia is favorably disposed toward Serbia, but the Russian Federation also recognizes Croatian sovereignty and territorial integrity. They organized these negotiations and as such proposed that the agreement should be signed at their embassy where representatives of the United States and United Nations were present. [Vrljicak-Espain] How would you define Croatian-Russian relations? [Granic] They can be considered as correct relations because Russia recognizes us. It must not be forgotten that Russia wants a role in the geopolitics of Southeast Europe and influence over Serbia. [Vrljicak-Espain] Is Vladimir Zhirinovsky's proposal regarding Pan-Slavism disquieting because it excludes Croatians and because it presumably counts on Russian hegemony, especially if we take into account rumors on Boris Yeltsin's health? [Granic] We are closely following Russian policies. But for the time being, we are managing with official relations and positions. This does not mean current relations with Russia will remain the same if Zhirinovsky comes to power. This matter not only concerns Croatia, it also concerns the United States and the international community. [Vrljical-Espain] What is your evaluation of the international community's attitude during the past 2 years, its current attitude, and what are the prospects? [Granic] I believe it should have been much more active. Croatia said this from the beginning. Today, Croatia considers relations are very good, especially with the United States following the Washington Agreements. For the first time, a four-member contact group has been created that includes the United States, the Russian Federation, the United Nations, and the EU [European Union] seeking solutions to the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and the UN protected zones. [Vrljicak-Espain] Many people ask why is there so much hate between Serbs and Croatians, is it an atavistic conflict or are there other reasons? [Granic] They are different peoples. In the 9th century, Croatia was a kingdom with its own language, culture, and influence. Croatia was part of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy for 500 years, while it has only lived beside the Serbs for a mere 75 years. In 1989, the presidents of Slovenia and Croatia submitted a proposal to transform what had once been Yugoslavia into a modern confederation. Serbia said it wanted a centralized federation, in other words, a Greater Serbia. When it saw that it could not achieve its objective through negotiations, it resorted to arms. [Vrljicak-Espain] What relations does Croatia have with Serbia? [Granic] We do not have diplomatic relations, and there will be no relations until they recognize our sovereignty and territorial integrity. We maintain a contact office which was opened within the framework of the Geneva Conference through intermediaries. We want to normalize relations with them, but only through recognition. [Vrljicak-Espain] We know Croatia had an enormous number of refugees inside and outside its borders. What is the current situation and what measures are being taken? [Granic] Croatia is currently looking after 250,000 of its own people and 280,000 refugees from Bosnia. More than 600,000 people have crossed the territory (from Bosnia) who went to Germany, Switzerland, Slovenia, and Austria. It is estimated that there are still 80,000 to 100,000 displaced persons for which Croatia wishes to care. It is our desire that all these people return. Of those that left, more than half have returned. [Vrljicak-Espain] What can you tell us about relations between Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy, especially over the irredeemable statements of the neo-fascists? [Granic] Regarding Italy, it is a question of individual statements. We are closely following what is happening there. We want good relations with Italy, but we will not accept changes in the current agreements regarding the borders. We have a few minor matters that are still pending with Slovenia that do not affect our good relations. [Vrljicak-Espain] Moving to another topic, we have heard that you are successfully fighting inflation. [Granic] Inflation reached 30 percent per month in 1993 and now we have reduced it to 0.1 percent. [Vrljicak-Espain] How did you achieve this? [Granic] Through a balanced budget and a restriction in public spending. [Vrljicak-Espain] Could it be said that you copied Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo? [Granic] We are closely observing Argentina's economic program.
