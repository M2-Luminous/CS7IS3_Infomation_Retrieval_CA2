The chairman of the teller's commission reported that 68 deputies in the Federation Council voted in favor of releasing him, while 74 voted against. According to the standing orders adopted today by the Federation Council, the procurator general is deemed to be released from his duties if a majority of the total number of deputies in the Federation Council votes in favor of that. The total number of deputies in the chamber is 174. Voting slips were taken by 145 people today. Therefore, over half of the total number of deputies did not vote in favor of releasing Kazannikov, the members of the teller's commission concluded. However, the chamber was unable today to formulate a legally satisfactory decision on the issue. It was decided to do that tomorrow. The sitting ended at that point.
