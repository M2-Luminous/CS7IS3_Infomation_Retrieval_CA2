Will you thus contribute to Weimar-like conditions in Germany? [Brunner] We see Weimar as something positive. Weimar is the town of Goethe and Schiller, the town of humanism. In addition, Weimar is located on the territory of the former GDR. This is important for us. [FOCUS] Weimar is also a synonym for a fragmented party landscape. [Brunner] Of course, as a result of the shock of the Third Reich, one has developed a negative attitude toward the Weimar Republic. It perished because it was a democracy without democrats. In our election law, the danger of a fragmentation of the party landscape is prevented by the 5-percent clause. [FOCUS] What will be the name of your new party? [Brunner] A committee to has been established to find a name. We are thinking of something involving the term "citizen." However, whether it will be called "Federation of Free Citizens" or "Citizens' Ticket" or "Citizens' Movement" will be decided in Weimar. [FOCUS] Where will be the headquarters of your party? [Brunner] It must be in Berlin. I am always in favor of the capital city. [FOCUS] Can your party become a collection pond for failed politicians? [Brunner] No. We do not want people who want to become something, but people who are something. We take a very close look at those who come to us. For instance, on principle, we do not accept any former Republikaner or other former members of parties that are to be counted among the extreme parties. [FOCUS] Which parties are these? [Brunner] Quite certainly the unconstitutional Party of Democratic Socialism. However, whoever was a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany at the time of the GDR without having committed any legal or moral offenses should be able to participate in our party from the viewpoint of national reconciliation. [FOCUS] How far does your identification with Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], whom many consider to be a right-wing extremist, go? [Brunner] We establish a party in Germany. It cannot be our goal to found a subsidiary of other parties. Of course, Haider is not right-wing extremist. His new book has just received very positive reviews from NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, and WELT AM SONNTAG. For me, the issue of Haider is an issue involving a sense of justice and the refusal to submit to the rules of a leftist German taboo society. I have known Haider for many years and I, as a person, vouch for Joerg Haider, the democrat and reformer. He is a sensible man with interesting ideas. [FOCUS] Do you think that Haider's statement about Hitler's employment policy can just be misinterpreted or is it incorrect? [Brunner] The problem with this answer by Haider to instigating interjections is that it is correct and incorrect at the same time. It is correct, as the historians say, including renowned Sebastian Haffner, that the employment policy in the Third Reich was very successful at the beginning. Nevertheless, I think that this statement is incorrect as a political statement. I do not say about a mass murderer that he is a good driver, either. In making an overall judgment of a person or an era there are situations where individual positive aspects become so unimportant compared with the negative aspects that even mentioning them is incorrect -- not only tactically incorrect, but also incorrect in terms of substance. [FOCUS] Do you not fear that you will be pushed into the right corner? [Brunner] The people on our ticket are really above any suspicion. Of course, the keyboard of taboos will be played to exhaustion. Certain circles try to push everybody who is not a leftists into the right corner. From the letters that I receive I do not conclude that the citizens are impressed by that. In Germany, 2,000 politicians are playing Monopoly with 2,000 journalists. And, for a long time, these 4,000 people could believe that they represent public opinion. This is no longer the case. [FOCUS] Is this a motive of your fellow-fighters to join the party? [Brunner] Particular in the current period there are many citizens who no longer see the republic as a service company and are against a social democratization of our society, and citizens who are against the European policy of the established parties and think that there must be a positive counterprogram to that. This is what we have. We are not a party that is against something, we are a positive party, we are for something. [FOCUS] For what? [Brunner] In European policy for a confederation, that is, a federation instead of a federal state, for democratic legitimation instead of a rule by councils, for an all-European approach instead of the West Europe of the Cold War. [FOCUS] You want a Europe without a unified currency and also one without a common foreign, security, and economic policy? [Brunner] Our Europe develops from the idea of competition -- political and economic competition. Everything that goes beyond the single market can be integrated in the community only if everyone agrees. Before making this decision, the national governments must get a binding vote by their parliaments. Let me give you an example: The Yugoslav crisis. The majority of the EC states wanted to support the old Yugoslavia and also give aid to the Serbs. According to the Maastricht Treaty, the majority would have the possibility to enforce this. I think this is completely unacceptable. [FOCUS] Thus, you are in favor of a competition of opinions. What about the competition of the systems? [Brunner] This refers primarily to economic systems. A state-economy approach in the Romance member states can certainly be in competition with a free-trade approach in the German or British-Nordic member states. However, different models of state, constitution, and election law can also compete. By the way, it is not true that I will never accept a unified currency. A unified currency between Germany, Austria, and Switzerland would indeed be conceivable, because economic capacity and order policy coincide. This is our different approach to Maastricht: Communization can only be the result of concurrence in terms of substance, it must not be forced by political acts of power. [FOCUS] You expect to get 35 percent at the European elections. Where do you take this breathtaking optimism from? [Brunner] We talked to opinion researches, who said: You have to get away from your old ideas about the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] and about its percentages. A total of 85 percent of the Germans reject the ECU. All established parties, however, are for the ECU. [FOCUS] Still, there may be a difference between having sympathetic feelings and making a cross on the ballot sheet? [Brunner] The party system, as we know it today, will be just as much a museum piece in a few years as the GDR's party system of 1988 is now. The Christian Democratic Union is just a structure in the wings of the national theater. If you knock it, the whole thing collapses.
