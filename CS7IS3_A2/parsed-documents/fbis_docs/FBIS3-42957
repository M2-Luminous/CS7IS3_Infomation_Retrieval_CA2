Stoyan: "There is No Need to Serve an Overseas Uncle...," with subsequent commentary from O. Sheykin presented by commentator Volodymyr Skachko under the rubric "In Place of Commentary": "It is True--It is Time to Be Concerned About People"] [Text] The editors received copies of letters the other day whose content evoked great astonishment and a desire to comment on them. Which the chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine (FPU), Oleksandr Stoyan, agreed to do. It is not so much a matter of some unusual appeals of the "dear brother" type as it is, first and foremost, the content of the letters. We are talking about the letter of the leader of the Solidarity Trade Unions of Ukraine, O. Sheykin, to the president of the American trade unions, Lane Kirkland, whom the author asks to "organize a boycott and halt all ties of the United States at all levels with the reactionary leadership of Ukraine." The motivation for the letter is a simple one--it is the author's idea that there is no democracy in Ukraine, there are no guarantees of the rights of the workers, and the independent trade-union movement continues to be oppressed. The floor then to O. Stoyan: [O. Stoyan] As you see, the reproaches directed toward Ukraine and its trade unions are quite serious. [O. Husev] Are concrete cases known to you of violence, arrests, murders or attempts at the physical annihilation of the leaders of trade unions? [O. Stoyan] They are not. If they were to happen, then doubtlessly we would come to the aid of representatives of all union groups to fight them at the level of the FPU. I recall in this connection an incident with the president of the Association of Trade Unions of Flight Personnel, V. Bulashov, that arose under unclear circumstances. The FPU allocated funds for the funeral of the trade-union leader. [O. Husev] A few words, if you would, on the relations of the FPU with the newly created trade-union organizations. [O. Stoyan] We are doing everything in principle so that our relations are of a normal, businesslike nature. We feel that the path of confrontation with the new trade unions is not promising. The federation has to reach a general rate agreement with the government for 1994, and draw up a declaration in mutual actions aimed at the building of a sovereign Ukraine, with their participation. These new creations, however, have lately begun to act against us without any restraints--moral or legal. Here is the recent declaration of Oleksandr Mryl regarding the creation of the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine. The professional associations of engineers, aviators, and the Solidarity trade unions, among others, are part of it. Their size is not more than a hundred thousand members. The first thing that the chairman of their executive committee does is to draw up a letter to the FPU with the proposal to allocate in Kiev, at the Trade Union Hall, accommodations with an area of no less than 580 square meters for its commissions and departments. It must be said that there are 40 sector committees at the republic level located in that building, and each of them unites considerably more members than the new created trade unions all together. And, I emphasize, have more rights accordingly, especially since they paid a great deal of funds for the very construction of the union hall. The Independent Trade Union of Miners, by the way, had already been allotted accommodations there. But it has been leased out, which is improper in principle. We know that a citizen of the United States is working in that office, who devotes a great deal of her work time--as can be seen from telephone bills--to conversations with North America and Great Britain. Also surprising is the fact that O. Mryl is demanding the granting of accommodations for the union of miners in the center of Kiev and not in the Donbass, not at the place where most of the mines are located and, by the way, the trade union of workers in the coal industry of Ukraine, uniting over a million members, operates. I cannot fail to mention the tone of ultimatum in the letter of O. Mryl, where he says in particular that "I ask you to address very seriously the question of allocating to the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine the spaces necessary for their work in the Hall of Trade Unions, and not to instigate our member organizations to decisive acts in reply to your possibly poorly thought-out decision." Tell me, is it possible to work with this author in a fruitful and good-hearted manner after such a letter? And more. Reading the appeal of the newly created trade unions to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), I cannot help but be surprised at the very fact of its appearance. The so-called Free Trade Unions of Ukraine, having absolutely no grounds to speak of any pressure or persecution in Ukraine, are however calling on the president and government of the United States for sanctions of a political and economic nature against Ukraine, whose citizens they are, not even stopping short of a boycott of it. I would like to ask whether our own or foreign trade unions permit themselves that? And is that a pluralism of ideas? Hardly. I understand that there could be differing views within the FPU and in the newly created associations on the nature of the actions of the state authorities, but their aim is a common one--to bring benefit to Ukraine. We have something else in practice. While the FPU is conducting systematic negotiations with the government with regard to improving the life of all of Ukraine, the newly created trade associations often are concerned only for concessions for certain categories of workers, winning them for themselves at the expense of others. Recall that the FPU has in recent months proclaimed a pre-strike situation, and posed the question to the next session of the Supreme Soviet of the abrogation of the penalties for enterprises that are operating normally, of a rise in the level of minimum wages and pensions, and other questions of social protections for the population. The newly created trade unions, in their appeals across the ocean, are posing the question of undermining the foundations of our state--our own citizens are appealing to the United States to organize a boycott against Ukraine. That is, to wage political and economic blackmail. [O. Husev] I would like to hear your thoughts regarding the fact, as KYEVSKYYE VEDOMOSTY has reported, that a flag was raised over the Capitol in the United States in honor of the Kiev engineer Semen Karykov, the chairman of the Free Trade Union of Railroad Engineers of Ukraine. [O. Stoyan] I know and will answer thus: what would you journalists have written if a flag was raised over the building where the President of Ukraine works, say, in honor of the chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine? Take your time to answer--I can envisage such reporting to the last detail, and even its key words: "The FPU are trade unions that serve the president!" The question arises, "So just what merits the raising of the national flag of the United States over the Capitol in Washington in honor of Karykov?" I will cite the reasons, for they really do exist; in the summer of 1992, an engineers' strike paralyzed the harvest in southern Ukraine, posing demands of essentially their own--on the whole, small--group of people. The miners were leaving the face with the same demands--raise wages only for them; at the beginning of the summer of 1993, the Independent Trade Union of Miners once again organized a strike. Ukraine once again loses billions of karbovantsi in it. The engineers stop transport once again... Can we really act only in the interests of a comparatively small group of people in the future as well? I am sure that we cannot, since that would be both unfair and costly for the economy of the whole country. Perhaps it is for these services that they raise the American flag in honor of a citizen of Ukraine? Not such a high honor, really. There is another aspect of the problem--I have in my hand material from the new trade union associations, in which it is indicated without the slightest shame that they were printed on equipment that was given to them by the Americans--the AFL-CIO. Is that not real interference by one country in the affairs of another? And can we even talk about any real independence of these "independent trade unions of Ukraine" in that case? The AFL-CIO is the same group of trade unions that has been bought by the American government. They are naturally trying to pursue this policy with us among those who call themselves representatives of the independent trade unions of Ukraine; making use of the latter, the government across the ocean is causing harm to Ukraine, the consequences of which are difficult to overestimate. [O. Husev] It would be interesting, Oleksandr Mykolayovych, to know your thoughts about the copy of another letter by the same author addressed to U.S. President B. Clinton, in which he asks the addressee to stop giving Ukraine assistance until its leaders take "concrete steps in the direction of developing democracy..." [O. Stoyan] I will not elucidate once again the level of veracity, but I will gladly talk about the last paragraph. Does it really become patriots--among which O. Sheykin, I think, counts himself--to appeal to the leader of another country to exert influence "on the government and President of Ukraine," demanding a halt to assistance that is being allotted to Ukraine today? That is the same as trying to throw the noose around the neck of one's own mother. It is True--It is Time to Be Concerned About People Insofar as the interview with O. Stoyan is very similar to a "critique" within the trade unions, with accusations that opponents are trying to "throw the noose around the neck of one's own mother," I asked for comments from the chairman of the Solidarity Trade Unions of Ukraine, O. Sheykin. And here is what I heard from him. "Yes, we wrote the letters cited, but I have to say that we were forced to do so by the overall situation in Ukraine, cases of repressions against the free trade unions, against other democratic movements and the mass media. The convicted Kharkiv journalist and member of the Solidarity Trade Unions Oleksandr Volosov, who has been stripped of the right to engage in journalism for a certain time, in particular. Vasyl Fedorenko, the chairman of the Kiev organization of the Solidarity Trade Unions, and Serhiy Klymenko, the chairman of the trade union of taxi fleet workers, were arrested. Klymenko has been subjected to reprisals in general for his attempt to post a trade-union announcement. There are also other instances, more than 20, while the employees of the law-enforcement bodies have been displaying passivity. "I can say with regard to the letters that the comments by O. Stoyan have shifted their focus somewhat. I did not demand that assistance be halted overall, but asked only that assistance not be given to a non-democratic Ukraine. I wrote in the letter to President Clinton, "I earnestly request that you exert influence on the government of Ukraine and the President of Ukraine so that only the democratic development of Ukraine, guarantees of the rights and freedoms of citizens, and economic reforms can become the foundation for the development of ties between the United States and Ukraine, and that the assistance that the United States is giving to Ukraine today not go to strengthen a totalitarian regime, but is rather temporarily halted until concrete steps by Ukraine in the direction of the development of democracy." The shift in focus seems to me somewhat reminiscent of the dishonorable practices of 1937--they were looking for "enemies of the people" then, too. "I would also like to add that the Solidarity Trade Unions are in favor of seeing that no political or public organization makes use of the law-enforcement or state bodies to settle accounts with political rivals." So we have letters to America and comments on them. There is something else that has escaped the attention of both trade-union leaders, namely that there is no unity in the trade-union movement in Ukraine today. And this is important for our country--not only because the trade unions, protecting the economic interests of the workers, are each doing this at their own discretion, are pulling the blankets on themselves at the expense of others, but also because the trade unions in Ukraine today are a real political force, and not an instrument for the protection of the socio-economic interests of people. This is a continuation of Soviet times, when the trade unions were the "school of communism" and had to serve as the instrument of a certain ideological blunting of the workers, a political means of turning them away from an organized workers' movement. This feature of the Soviet trade unions was also manifested because in Ukraine they were decisively in favor of the parliament granting them the right of legislative initiative and were part of various political acts. The situation in Ukraine, to put it mildly, is of course uncertain with respect to the productivity of the economic changes and the effectiveness of democracy. Whatever the politicians may say, the people are slipping into poverty, and this is not the best background for democratic reformation and for spiritual and cultural resurrection. And yet in O. Sheykin's place I would not have appealed to those "high" Americans not to assist today's Ukraine, and in O. Stoyan's place I would have said as little as possible about nooses. And not because I am some kind of Ukrainian jingoist-patriot who wants to get fat off American assistance. It will not help us, neither large nor small. First of all, there are very many of us, and second, we, not pursuing economic reforms owing to a lack of political will for it on the part of our leadership, will devour it in short order. But the trade unions still have a way out of this situation. It seems to me that it consists of the fact that since our trade unions already frequently come forward as a kind of political parties formed along professional lines, since they are able to organize the people, they have to unite and, relying on the support of the people, jointly demand of the authorities that they display political will and finally begin reforms. This pertains to the President, who is obligated to propose to parliament a government of reformers, and to parliament, which should confirm that government, and to the government, which not only has to propose a program of reforms, but also be able to fulfill it. If everyone gets to work himself, if the economy is revived, then the trade unions can fight not for a place in parliament, but rather fulfill their traditional function of protecting the people. As much as they write to Clinton, as much as they talk about social protections, a barefoot person will not rescue a naked person from cold and hunger...
