Seoul's top representative Song Yong-tae compared the break to winter hibernation, hoping that inter-Korean relations would wake up from winter sleep. Song's North Korean counterpart Pak Yong-su chided they wasted one whole season and called for successful conclusion of their negotiations within the day. -- Spiked words were exchanged even before the two sides sat down for the negotiations. Pak make the first strike after pointing to Song's big briefcase. "I only brought a small envelope containing a draft agreement because I am intent on reaching an agreement today," said Pak, "But I see that you brought a big briefcase and obviously have a lot to say about this and that." Song laughed it off, saying he brought the briefcase to take home the presents since it's Pak's turn to give the gifts. -- A remark on how Seoul is celebrating its 600th birthday immediately met retaliation from Pyongyang who recognizes Koryo Dynasty as the first unified Korea. Song explained how Seoul was trying to restore Kyongbuk Palace by 1997 to celebrate the 600th anniversary and is preparing for the visit Korea year. He went on to say how he wants to see foreign tourists travel back and forth between the two sides. Pak immediately retaliated Song's historical perspective. He described how his country completed reconstructing the tomb of King Wangkon, the founder of Koryo Dynasty last January to mark his 1,117th birthday. He named Wangkon as the first king of a unified nation as he emphasized the historical surroundings linking Koryo to North Korea. -- Song changed the subject to just-ended Lillehammer Winter Olympics, reminding how the Seoul team won a record-breaking number of medals and saying he was sorry to hear North Korea could not field its athletes due to injury. He indirectly hinted how an inter-Korean unified team would do so much better at international games and urged North Korea to open to various exchanges. Song replied everything will go well once the two sides exchange presidential envoys. -- Top interest among North Korean journalists was apparently who Seoul will pick as its envoy. Many asked if the Southern side already decided who is to be sent as the envoy while hinting that Pyongyang may choose between Kim Yong-sun, party secretary for South Korean Affairs, and Vice President Kim Yong-chu.
