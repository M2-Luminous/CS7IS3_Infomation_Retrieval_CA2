An accountant always estimates what is positive and what negative in a project and then comes up with a balance. I do not see anything positive about this experiment. Suppose a federalization had taken place and Ukraine's Donbass had been left to develop its own economy, either federal or state-controlled. Then the question would arise in Kiev, or in the state: Where to purchase coal? In Russia, where it is dozens of times cheaper, or in Donbass. You would, of course, say in Russia. Let us imagine that Donbass had joined Russia, as the separatists want. Let us imagine for a moment that this had taken place, although this cannot happen without bloodshed. Have you imagined it? In Russia, coal is dozens of times cheaper than that extracted in Donbass, and the difference is even greater now -- even today, dozens of Russian coal mines are going bankrupt, because there are no markets. Tell me, whose coal would Russia buy? Donbass coal, which is dozens of times more expensive than Russia's? You cannot tell businessmen what to purchase -- they choose the coal and foodstuffs that are cheaper. Who can now say what would happen to Donbass in such a case? Today, Ukraine purchases Donetsk coal, because Donbass is our region, and we must support its existence, no matter what prices they set; we even allow them to be monopolists. If Donbass joins the Russian Federation economically or even administratively, Russia will not buy its coal, because it is too expensive. Ukraine will not purchase it, as it will prefer Russian or Polish coal. What will happen to the people? Between 5 and 7 million people will be left without means for subsistence. Is this an advantage? Second. No single state gives away territories voluntarily; and Ukraine will not give away Donbass. There are examples. It is already the seventh year that the war has been going on in Karabakh. Have the warring sides made any breakthroughs? No. How many human lives have been lost?! The same here. If somebody in Donbass tries, on the quiet of the experiment, to separate and draw a new border between Ukraine and Russia, this border will be washed with blood, and much blood. In this connection, I would like to appeal to normal people, residents of Donbass: Restrain those who are firing up your territory. It does not matter who does this; the same applies to the Crimea. Either pro-Russian or pro-Ukrainian forces, chauvinists, or nationalists -- one spark would suffice to set this territory on fire. You must come to your senses and stop those who are looking for trouble.
