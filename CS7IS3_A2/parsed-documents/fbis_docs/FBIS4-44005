A survey performed by the Forsa Institute last week on a representative sample of 2,523 German citizens in the East and West revealed that only 26 percent of the population would vote for Scharping to be chancellor. On the other hand, 42 percent said they would vote for Helmut Kohl. Thus, Scharping's popularity has taken a 180-degree turn since his election to the chairmanship of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] almost 12 months ago. Kohl lies ahead of his challenger in the popularity table both in the East and in the West, among the young and the old, and among all professional groups, including workers. Eighty-seven percent of Christian-Democratic Union [CDU] supporters would vote for Kohl, and 55 percent of SPD supporters would vote for Scharping. Thirty-one percent of the population, 8 percent more than last week, thinks that the CDU is the most capable of solving the country's problems. Only 11 percent think the SPD is the most capable of doing so, 3 percent less than last week. If the current voting forecasts survive until October, there need be no fear of a grand coalition: The CDU and Free Democratic Party could then continue to govern. Within the SPD there is increasing doubt whether a turnabout can be achieved. The dispute over a red-green coalition is dividing the party. The appointment of a shadow cabinet centered on Scharping is expected to provide fresh vigor. However, the party leadership is beset with despondency and mistrust, brought on by a provoking interview with Scharping's rival, Gerhard Schroeder. In an interview for DIE WOCHE, Hesse's environment minister Joschka Fischer, the leading man of the Greens, tries to rouse the SPD to battle against Kohl. He criticizes Schroeder thus: "I consider the things the quasicandidate is doing with the candidate distasteful."
