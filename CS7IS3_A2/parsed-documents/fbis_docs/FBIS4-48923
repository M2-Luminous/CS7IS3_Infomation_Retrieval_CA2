Although he raises more than 2,000 pigs every year, Zeng Jinqi, a bright young farmer in Shunde City, has eliminated the worries of seeking marketing channels and buying forage and vaccines. Whenever he needs a particular service, a phone call to the local social service network will soon bring about satisfactory assistance. Multi-level and comprehensive social service systems have come into being in recent years along with the rapid burgeoning of modernized agriculture in this comparatively prosperous region of China. Services provided include supply of funds, seeds, and forage to farmers, purchase of agricultural products from farmers, technological consultation and assistance in taking out various kinds of insurance. Among the 15,100 social service institutes dotted throughout the towns and villages in Guangdong, a kind of "hospital for crops" has received the most praise from local farmers. Numbering more than 630, the hospitals for crops have effectively solved technological problems peasants face in farming, guided them to grow crops benefiting from more scientific know-how and combined technological consultation with prompt supply of high-quality seeds and fertilizers. The fruitful work of local social service systems has greatly increased the economic benefits of agriculture, and local farmers' interest in agricultural activities has been redoubled accordingly.
