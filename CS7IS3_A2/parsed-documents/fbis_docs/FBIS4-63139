According to the procuracy, one of the servicemen learnt that some of the things stored at the dump contained precious metals and decided, with his friends, to remove them. They found the munition they were seeking and began to dig into it with a bayonet. When the munition unexpectedly burst into flames the soldiers could think of nothing better to do than to run away. As a result of the subsequent fire and explosion about 200 wagon-loads of munitions went up into the air and great material damage was caused to the neighboring villages.
