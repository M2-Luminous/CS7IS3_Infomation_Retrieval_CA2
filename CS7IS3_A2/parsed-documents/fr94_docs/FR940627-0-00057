FR940627-0-00057 FR940627-0-00011 Commentators requested that this guidance be incorporated into the final regulations. The IRS and the Treasury believe these issues are appropriately addressed in Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;13. The guidance under section 411(d)(6) in Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;13 is provided pursuant to the specific delegation of authority in ยง1.411(d)&hyph;4, Q&A&hyph;2(b) to the Commissioner to provide, through the publication of revenue rulings, notices, and other documents of general applicability, for the elimination or reduction of section 411(d)(6) protected benefits to the extent that the reduction is necessary to permit compliance with the other requirements of section 401(a). The guidance under section 204(h) of ERISA is provided pursuant to the delegation of authority to the IRS under section 101(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (1979&hyph;1 C.B. 480) to issue regulations, rulings, opinions, variances, and waivers under section 204 of ERISA. c. Application of $150,000 Limit to Accruals or Allocations in Plan Years for Which OBRA '93 is Effective One commentator suggested that the reduced limit should not apply to compensation for years beginning before the OBRA '93 effective date that is used in determining post-effective date benefit accruals. The regulations, however, continue to provide that benefits accruing, or allocations made, for plan years beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date may not take into account compensation for any year in excess of the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit applicable to that year (generally $150,000 for years beginning before the OBRA '93 effective date). Thus, compensation for any plan year before OBRA '93 applies to the plan that is used to determine benefits accruing in plan years beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date is generally limited to $150,000. In the absence of this rule, post-effective date accruals under many defined benefit plans would be determined taking into account compensation in excess of $150,000. For example, this happens when a defined benefit plan determines annual accruals as a percentage of each employee's highest average annual compensation for a specified number of years (including years prior to the effective date of OBRA '93). d. Collectively Bargained Plans TRA '86 and OBRA '93 provide a deferred effective date for collectively bargained plans. In response to comments, these regulations clarify that the rules of ยง1.410(b)&hyph;10(a)(2) apply for purposes of determining whether a plan is a collectively bargained plan. Thus, if a plan is a collectively bargained plan (within the meaning of ยง1.410(b)&hyph;10(a)(2)(iii)), the deferred effective date applies in determining the plan allocations or benefit accruals of both collectively bargained and noncollectively bargained employees. e. Governmental Plans These final regulations retain the special effective date for governmental plans (within the meaning of section 414(d)) in order to provide governmental employers with adequate time to amend their plans to comply with section 401(a)(17). Thus, the regulations provide that these governmental plans will automatically satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(17) for plan years beginning before the later of January 1, 1996, or 90 days after the opening of the first legislative session beginning on or after January 1, 1996, of the governing body with authority to amend the plan, if that body does not meet continuously. The final regulations continue to implement the grandfather rule in OBRA '93 for individuals who first became participants in governmental plans before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995 or, if earlier, the first plan year for which the plan is amended to comply with OBRA '93. Under the grandfather rule, the annual compensation limit will not apply for those individuals to the extent that the limit would reduce the amount of compensation taken into account under the plan below the amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the plan as in effect on July 1, 1993. However, in order for this grandfather rule to apply to a plan, the plan must be amended, effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 1995, to incorporate by reference the annual compensation limits of section 401(a)(17) for those participants who are not grandfathered under OBRA '93. f. Good Faith Compliance Prior to the Regulatory Effective Date For plan years beginning on or after the date that section 401(a)(17) first applies to a plan, but before these regulations apply to the plan, the plan must be operated in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of the requirements of section 401(a)(17). Whether compliance is reasonable and in good faith will be determined on the basis of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, including the extent to which the employer has resolved unclear issues in its favor. Reasonable, good faith interpretation will be deemed to exist, however, if a plan is operated in accordance with the 1990 regulations, the September 1991 regulations, the December 1993 regulations, or these regulations. However, for any plan with a regulatory effective date that is later than the OBRA '93 effective date for the plan (e.g., a plan maintained by a tax-exempt organization), a reasonable, good faith interpretation must reflect the OBRA '93 amendments to section 401(a)(17). Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these final regulations is Marjorie Hoffman of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.
