The demonstration, which followed the Zapatist National Liberation Army's [EZLN] refusal to sign a peace agreement, took place in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas. The demonstration came four days after the EZLN announced that it will not accept the government's response to its demands and that it will not sign a peace agreement in Chiapas. Most of the demonstrators wore white clothes, which, according to them, symbolize their hope for restoring peace in the state, and they asked that war be avoided because it will only engender more misery. Jose Perez, leader of the Tzotzil, one of three major Indian groups in the area, indicated that his people want to live in peace and that they plan to respect the law, as long as it is fair and equitable. Perez stressed that peace begins with respect for the law, adding: "We, Indians, have our own customs, which do not contradict the laws of the nation and which also deserve to be respected by the authorities."
