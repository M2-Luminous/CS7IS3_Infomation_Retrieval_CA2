Barjaktarevic report: "More Than 250 Children Contracted Meningitis"] [Text] Seven persons with serious symptoms of typhoid fever were brought to Pristina University Hospital. The number of persons who contracted this dangerous disease, which was believed to have been eradicated, has risen to 77 during the last month. The epicenter is Stimlje, but typhoid fever might break out in almost all Kosovo towns. The doctors of Pristina University Hospital, including Professor Stevan Baljosevic, the head of hospital, have recommended all Kosovo inhabitants to boil water. Children's meningitis, a disease that affects the brain, also appeared in Kosovo. More than 250 children have contracted the disease so far. After having visited Stimlje, the epicenter of the serious infectious disease, Stevan Baljosevic gave the following answer to BORBA's question about the causes and possible consequences of the disease: "The water-supply system of the Institute for Mentally Retarded Persons has been completely destroyed, the water is not chlorinated, and the water level in the basin from which it is taken is below the stream so that fresh water is mixed with sewage." The symptoms of typhoid are unendurable stomachache, high fever, sweating, vomiting and general weakness.
