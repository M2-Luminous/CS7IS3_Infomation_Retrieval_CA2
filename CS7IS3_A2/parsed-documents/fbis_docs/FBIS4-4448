An official meeting between the LPDR NA delegation and the HRM delegation was held at the National Assembly Hall to exchange views and discuss the situation with each other under an atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding. At the meeting, the two sides informed each other of certain prominent developments in their respective countries and exchanged a common direction for strengthening the relations and cooperation between the legislative organizations of Laos and Malaysia for their common and unilateral interests in the immediate and long-term future. The two sides were proud of the development of the fine relations and cooperation and multifaceted mutual assistance between Laos and Malaysia and were unanimous to continue multiplying and enhancing the said relations and cooperation on the basis of the five-point principle of peaceful coexistence. They regarded the agreement on economic, scientific, and technical cooperation, the agreement on air transportation, and the agreement on the promotion and protection of investment signed between the Governments of Laos and Malaysia in early December 1992 as a symbol of utmost significance in the Lao-Malaysian cooperation in the new period. The two sides unanimously agreed to exchange visits by delegations at various levels to draw lessons from one another and to organize technical training programs and study tours beneficial to both sides. Regarding international relations, the two sides unanimously agreed to further promote an atmosphere of peace, friendship, and cooperation in Southeast Asia and the world. The success of the visit to the LPDR by the speaker of the HRM and the delegation constitutes a new glorious milestone in the relations between the legislative institutions of Laos and Malaysia and, at the same time, an important contribution to the building of peace, stability as well as relations and cooperation in Southeast Asia and the world. The multiethnic Lao people wholeheartedly hail this event of great significance to Lao-Malaysian relations and pledge to do to the best of our abilities to contribute to making the exisiting relations of friendship and good cooperation between the two countries and peoples of Laos and Malaysia more fruitful so as to bring benefits to our two peoples.
