National Mainland Cracks False Invoices Mainland authorities have cracked a number of serious cases of false invoices. Some unlawful elements changed the amounts of money on invoices to swindle money from companies, and some printed false invoices to evade taxes. For example, a 29-yuan invoice for a piece of cloth was changed to 115,000 yuan, and some people have bought false invoices to claim reimbursement from the accounting departments. Beijing police recently cracked a gang who printed and sold false invoices, crushed three dens, arrested 22 suspects, and seized 295 copies of invoices which certify payment of state value-added taxes. Shenzhen police also cracked a similar case, arrested 35 persons, and seized 600 such invoices. Law courts, procuratorates, public security organs, and taxation departments made joint arrangements to crack down on false invoices throughout the whole country. They decided that a fraud-proof value-added tax invoice, which can be used across the country, will be printed solely by a certain department and used beginning 1 July.
