ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, PL 92463, EPA gives notice of a two-day meeting of the Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee of the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT). NACEPT provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues, and this meeting is being held to discuss the Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee agenda for the coming year. The Administrator has asked NACEPT to concentrate on ecosystem management and how long-term ecological, economic, and social needs can be integrated to achieve a place-driven approach to environmental management. The Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee will concentrate on specific information and assessment issues required to support a successful place-based approach to ecosystem management. These issues will include discussion of the role of EPA in information access and dissemination to support place-based ecosystems management; discussion of information technologies available to support place-based ecosystems management; and discussion of assessments in support of place-based ecosystems management. The Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee, as does NACEPT, comprises a representative cross-section of EPA's partners and constituents. However, in order to gain additional insights and perspectives from all interested parties as this committee begins its work, time has been allotted during the meeting for oral comments from the public. Any member of the public wishing to present oral comments on any of these issues can schedule an appointment by contacting Joe Sierra at the address and telephone numbers below. Due to time constraints, oral presentations will be strictly held to five minutes, and slots are limited. Available time slots will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis to those scheduling a presentation in advance. Written comments will be accepted at any time prior to, or at, the meeting.
