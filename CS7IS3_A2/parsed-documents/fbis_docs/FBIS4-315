The most important topic in his interview were revelations of attempts by the regime against the rearguard of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], particularly here in Jamba, using the Namibian territory as its launching pad. According to Brig. Chitombe, Namibia and Eduardo dos Santos' regime are evidently determined to destroy UNITA, particularly in Jamba. The governor draws a clear picture of the situation on the field. [Begin Chitombe recording] At 2245 on 24 March, agents from the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA- PT] were detected near the Vorgan antenna installations. Surprised by our security forces, they fled in disarray. Our forces were however able to capture one of the group. We also captured engineering material that the group carried, as well as explosives, detonators, wirecutters and so on. We know that with regard to Jamba, the enemy has a two-phase program. The first phase would be to mine parts of Cacuchi-Jamba road because it thinks that that we obtain supplies through this road. Officially, we do not obtain any supplies from Namibia because of the economic blockade. The enemy also wanted to mine parts of (Buabuata)-Jamba road. If they were able to infiltrate and deploy their forces in Jamba, they would perhaps mine a number of roads and even destroy Vorgan antennas, so as to silence the only genuine opposition voice in Angola. This would be the first phase. According to our intelligence sources, the second phase would be a large-scale phase supported by mercenaries coming from Cabo Ledo. These mercenaries are presently in Nambia, in the last phase of preparations. The South-West African People's Organization [SWAPO] gave the MPLA a piece of land, from the bridge over Cubango River in (Bagani) to 2 km before (Chetu). The MPLA has deployed its temporary bases on this piece of land, from which it would carry out actions in Jamba. On this same piece of land that SWAPO gave to the MPLA-PT, there is a base called Omega, with a hospital to give first aid to wounded troops during the period of action. What is more, at a given period of operations, these troops would be supported by an air cover, MI-8 and MI-35 helicopters, equipped with cannons. These helicopters would also be deployed on the same base, Omega. We have also been informed that the MPLA deployed 2,000 riot policemen in Namibia. One thousand of them have already left for South Africa to support the African National Congress in the elections due on 27 April this year. Of the one thousand policemen who remained in Namibia, 400 are in Rundu. These riot policemen are led by the following chieftains: Colonel Joaquim Mbundu, Colonel Alberto Simao, and Lieutenant Colonel Angelo, who is also in charge of border control and physical elimination of UNITA cadres and leaders here in our region. Other chieftains are Captain Alberto Sitani, Capt. Jacinto Manuel, and Chituwawa Mapa. We are also aware that some of these chieftains have already left for (Bucussu) on a reconnaissance mission to watch our movements. We also know that SWAPO has included MPLA agents in its border-guard troops, police, secret services, and communications services, and so on. Thus, when SWAPO carry out border patrols, it is just doing it to allow the MPLA forces to reconnoitre our positions along the border. As in the past, we would like to once again today alert the national and international communities that in the event of any attack on Jamba from Namibia, we shall retaliate and pursue the attackers to where they are based. If this happens, the provokers and those assisting the provokers will be exclusively and solely to blame. We have decided to reveal this information to the national and international communities to enable them to know exactly who is not interested in peace. When we are negotiating in Lusaka, when it is possible to sign a general cease-fire accord, and the MPLA is using mercenaries to attack the free territory controlled by UNITA, we call this an act of provocation. It is not only an act of provocation, the MPLA is sabotaging the efforts being carried out by the entire peace-loving international community so that war ends in Angola and the Angolan people can begin to enjoy peace. [end recording] Meanwhile, in view of this evidence, a source from the General Staff of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA], gave assurances that all military measures were in place to repulse any attempt by joint FAPLA [People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]-SWAPO forces. The source said the FALA will not accept any responsibility for the consequences resulting from the MPLA adventure. If the Namibian regime wants to maintain good neighborly relations with UNITA, it should then cease to support the diabolic and treacherous actions by the Luanda Communist regime, the source said in conclusion. Here in Jamba, a senior officer of the FALA military command said today that in view of threats of aggression from the Republic of Namibia, all FALA units have been placed in a maximum state of alert. According to the source, in case of provocation, FALA forces have instructions to react with the greatest violence possible and pursue the attackers to their base. The source said UNITA will not accept any responsibility for the consequences that could result from this adventure. It said in case of attack, the Namibian Government will be solely to blame. We want to maintain good neighborly relations with all neighboring countries, but this is only possible when there is mutual respect, the FALA officer said. He said the United Nations must warn Namibia not to internationalize the conflict.
