He said he would keep by all means the promise to make South Korea a country most ideal for industrial activities. "The government in its part will assure industries their free business activities to the most possible extent," Kim said. Calling on industries to invest now, the president said that only those industries that make bold investment now braving a little uncertainty can survive. He said the Korean economy has visibly improved since the third quarter of 1993 and is now in the stage of recovery, adding that trade has recorded a surplus for the first time in four years.
