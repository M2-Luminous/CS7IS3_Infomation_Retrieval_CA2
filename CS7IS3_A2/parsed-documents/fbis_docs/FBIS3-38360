Thus, a further step will be implemented within the framework of the structural reform of air traffic control, which was initiated in 1993 to privatize its legal organization. On Tuesday [1 February], the Defense Ministry announced that 340 air traffic control officers and air data processors will be given leave from the Bundeswehr to start work as employees of the state-run Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (DFS) [German Air Control]. In the long term, it is intended to provide some 500 soldiers. The Bundeswehr members are to cooperate as one working team. According to the Defense Ministry, their work will focus on the control and support of military operational air transport to do justice to the defense assignment of the armed forces. Outside the responsibility of the DFS, Bundeswehr personnel will control the airspace beyond an altitude of 7,500 meters at the Eurocontrol headquarters in Maastricht. The merger of the German air control services is intended to improve the organization, flexibility, and efficiency to keep up with the future development of air transport in Europe.
