[passage omitted] Criticizing those organizations that advocate human rights, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said: Those who burned alive dozens of people last year and followed an overt racist policy in their countries do not have the right to utter the words human rights from their filthy mouths and expect the observance of human rights from others. The leader of the Islamic revolution admonished the world forums and committees that advocate human rights for their silence regarding one of the greatest terrorist tragedies. He said: Those so-called human rights committees and forums, which have brought politics into everything, have turned a blind eye to that great terrorist tragedy at the shrine of Imam Reza--peace be upon him--and have not said a word about it. Those who are constantly saying that the greatest threat to the world today is terrorism have kept silent about the 'Ashura tragedy in Mashhad. Therefore, what right do they have to meddle in matters relating to the observance of human rights in other countries. [passage omitted]
