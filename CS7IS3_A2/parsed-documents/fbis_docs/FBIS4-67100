By formally denying the charge--two days after it was publicized and became a scandal worldwide, Thanong has displayed his sense of responsibility. Yet, Thanong's denial was simply aimed at self-protection and cannot clear up the damage done to the Thai parliament, which represents the entire Thai people. His denial at the news conference does not prove that the U.S. charge was unfounded. In other words, there is no proof that Thanong's denial was the truth. A scandal involving a member of parliament naturally affects the image of the whole nation, and, if it is not immediately clarified, the charge would leave a scar on the nation--the way it used to be in the past when our leaders never bothered to correct the image of the country and let the world look at the Thai as untrustworthy people when it came to the question of narcotics. As Thais who must share the blame, we therefore call on Mr. Thanong, the Chat Thai Party, and the Thai parliament to jointly take responsibility in solving this problem. Mr. Thanong, the accused, especially must show his spirit and accept U.S. inquiries to prove his innocence. In fact, nobody can charge him guilty, neither the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration nor the Office of the Narcotics Control Board, since there is not enough evidence against him. But as a parliamentarian and public figure, Mr. Thanong should make a sacrifice by answering the U.S. charge to prove his innocence and thus to restore the honor to the entire nation. At this stage, we think most of the Thai people still hold Mr. Thanong 100 percent innocent. However, when U.S. authorities were seriously seeking cooperation from the Thai Government to deal with the case, we cannot help having doubts about him. Therefore, it is not enough for Mr. Thanong just to deny the charge. Also, it will not improve the image of the country if we treat it as a political game and use a delaying tactic to buy time until the scandal dies down by itself. We think that, under the present situation, Mr. Thanong should challenge the U.S. justice and prove his innocence with courage and dignity. Mr. Thanong should accept a full investigation, instead of pursuing the case against the media through his lawyer, since that would not help in clearing up Thailand's image.
