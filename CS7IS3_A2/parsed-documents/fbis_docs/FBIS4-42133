In a predeparture statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin said that the proposal concerning the European Stability Pact was submitted by the new French Government and was then transformed into a joint European Union [EU] initiative. Cetin explained that the guiding idea behind this initiative consists of resolving the minority and border problems lying at the basis of the instabilities in Europe through negotiations. He stressed that some of the Central and East European countries are still afflicted with minority and border problems. [Begin Cetin recording] One cannot say that the initiative was welcomed by the relevant countries. Although this was not explicitly stated, these countries are being told the following: You have a European perspective, but we do not want you to bring your problems into the EU. You must first try to solve these problems among yourselves. We are willing to assist you to this end, establish a security system, and support you. First and foremost, however, you must discuss the minority and border problems. Conduct bilateral negotiations and reach agreements, or establish regional and multilateral platforms of negotiation. [end recording] The foreign minister explained that an opening document will be adopted in Paris in connection with this issue. The document will outline the initiative's philosophy and its principal parameters, Cetin reported. He added that Turkey is ready to make every possible constructive contribution to the initiative.
