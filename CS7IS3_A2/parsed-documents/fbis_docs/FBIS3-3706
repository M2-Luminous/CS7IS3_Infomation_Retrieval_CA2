The company will carry out a project to reclaim a 130-ha site from the sea, with work to start this year and to be completed in 24 months. The parties agreed to set up Fangcheng-Zhuhai-Shenzhen-Macao and Macao-Fangcheng-Vietnam tourist routes. Sources from Magran said the company has purchased 66 ha of land at the resort and plans to invest as much as one billion Hong Kong dollars to build hotel, villa, and public facilities and other development projects at the resort. The Jiangshan Peninsula, 17 km from downtown Fangcheng, a major deep-water port in south-west China, was chosen as the site of a tourist resort for its unpolluted landscape, crystal blue water, wide beaches and many places of human interest. Up to the end of 1993, the local government had invested 150 million yuan on road, power and water supplies and other constructions at the resort. The future resort has also attracted investment worth of 139 million yuan by some 150 businesses from China and abroad, according to local sources.
