FBIS4-52902 "dreas094_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 South Korea No DPRK-U.S. Talks If North Crosses Line on Rods No DPRK-U.S. Talks If North Crosses Line on Rods SK1405051594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0455 GMT 14 May 94 SK1405051594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- There will be no next North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue if Pyongyang is found to have crossed "the line" in unloading from its nuclear reactor, a high-level Foreign Ministry official said Saturday. This "line" is crossed if North Korea conducted any activity with the nuclear fuel rods that makes it impossible for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to randomly select and secure them for measurements later, this official said on condition of anonymity. He suggested, however, that the immediate worry over North Korea's nuclear program is separate from this rod unloading process. "We have to remember that the most important thing right now is preventing North Korea from taking the rods out, using them for reprocessing to make materials that can be used for making weapons," he said. But the point in securing and measuring the rods is in tracing back the history and thus is separate from preventing nuclear weapons program, he said. Pyongyang notified the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Friday that it began the rod discharging process, no longer able to defer it for technical reasons. Seoul, Washington, and the IAEA had repeatedly said unloading of the rods without monitoring by the agency means an end to dialogue on the nuclear row. The official was optimistic that Pyongyang hasn't yet crossed the line since it has told the IAEA there is still an opportunity for the agency to select and secure the rods. "If North Korea had already passed the line, this would be impossible," said the official. If the line has been crossed, there will be no next round of North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue, this official emphasized. There will be no high-level dialogue while the IAEA inspection team is in Pyongyang next week, despite North Korea's demand that the they discuss the rod unloading agenda at the high-level meeting, he said.
