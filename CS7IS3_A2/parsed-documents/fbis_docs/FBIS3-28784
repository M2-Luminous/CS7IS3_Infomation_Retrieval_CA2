FBIS3-28784 "dreas028_a_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-028 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Feb 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Finance Ministry Announces FY `94 Draft Budget OW1002073794 Tokyo KYODO in English 0726 GMT 10 Feb 94 OW1002073794 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced Thursday [10 February] its belt-tightening draft fiscal 1994 budget totaling 73,081.7 billion yen, up 1.0 percent from the initial fiscal 1993 budget. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii presented the draft at an evening cabinet meeting. The Finance Ministry will immediately begin negotiations with other ministries and agencies on their allocation requests to complete a government budget bill next Tuesday. The growth rate is higher than the 0.2 percent rise in the fiscal 1993 initial budget, but technical accounting methods such as suspending transfers and moving up redemptions have been used to inflate revenues and squeeze outlays. Without these measures, the draft budget would have posted a year-to-year contraction, officials said. The general operating expenditures -- public works, defense and other core outlays -- totaled 40,854.8 billion yen, up 2.3 percent to post the lowest growth since a 1.2 percent rise in the initial fiscal 1988 budget. Of the core spending, public works-related outlays come to 8,984.6 billion yen, up 4.0 percent, maintaining a relatively high growth rate. Defense spending is up 0.8 percent to 4,678.8 billion yen and official development assistance (ODA) is about 4 percent higher at 1,055 billion yen. As for other outlays, the ministry earmarked 14,360.2 billion yen for debt-servicing costs, down 7.0 percent, 12,757.8 billion yen for tax allocations to local governments, down 18.3 percent, and an unchanged 1,300 billion yen for various purposes using accumulated revenues from sales of shares of the privatized Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). The ministry also wants to return 1,544.8 billion yen borrowed from the national debt consolidation fund in fiscal 1992 to cover a revenue shortfall. On the revenue side, the draft budget estimates 53,665.0 billion yen in tax revenues, down 12.5 percent, due largely to cuts of some 4,377.0 billion yen in income tax and other taxes. Nontax revenues are expected to rise 104.8 percent to 5,601.2 billion yen, stemming from advanced loan redemptions, and income from sales of NTT shares is estimated at 172.5 billion yen, down 7.5 percent. The ministry is to issue a record 13,643.0 billion yen in government bonds, up 67.8 percent, comprising 10,509.2 billion yen in construction bonds to be used primarily for public works and 3,133.8 billion yen in deficit-covering bonds for financing the tax cuts. As a result, the dependence on public borrowings comes to 18.7 percent of the budget, up from 11.2 percent in fiscal 1993, and the outstanding balance of bonds tops 200 trillion yen for the first time to reach about 201 trillion yen, up from an estimated 182 trillion for the current year.
