Despite the opinion of economists that the crisis has yet to reach bottom, the value of the dollar on the New York market was under the psychological barrier of 100 yen, one of its lowest levels since the end of World War II, the result of one of the most serious crises in Japanese politics. Specialists believe that the problems in Japan and the recovery of the German economy are the main causes for this continual drop in the dollar, placing Bill Clinton's administration in an embarrassing situation. EFE comments that in spite of the drop in the dollar's value in recent years, the commercial trade deficit with Japan has continued to increase. In addition, it is believed that the dollar's decline deters foreign investments on the New York Stock Market and casts doubt on the economic recovery on which President Clinton prides himself.
