FR940720-1-00003 FR940720-1-00001 Research recently conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Imported Fire Ant Methods Development Station in Gulfport, MS, has shown that the insecticide tefluthrin, in granular form, is effective at a dosage rate of 25 parts per million (ppm) in treating soil or potting media to prevent the spread of the imported fire ant. Based on this research, APHIS has determined that containerized nursery stock could be certified for interstate movement after treatment with granular tefluthrin at a dosage rate of 25 ppm. The insecticide tefluthrin is registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In May 1993, EPA approved a label, providing for a dosage rate of 25 ppm, for the use of granular tefluthrin in treating soil or potting media for the imported fire ant. We are proposing to revise the Appendix by adding granular tefluthrin to the list of authorized chemicals for the treatment of regulated articles under the regulations. We are also proposing to: (1) Amend paragraph III.C.3. of the Appendix by adding provisions regarding the material to be treated, the dosage rate, and the exposure period, and by adding a new ``Method E_Granular Incorporation (Tefluthrin);'' (2) amend paragraph III.C.4., under the ``Exclusion'' heading, to allow tefluthrin to be used as an alternative to bifenthrin in treating soil or potting media for plants grown on the premises to prevent infestation with or spread of the imported fire ant; and (3) amend paragraph III.C.4., under the ``Enforcement'' heading, by adding ``tefluthrin'' to a reference to chemical treatments that are described in paragraph III.C.3. of the Appendix. We are not proposing that tefluthrin be used as an alternative to bifenthrin for treating plants received from outside sources (under the ``Exclusion'' heading). Drench applications are used to treat plants received from outside sources, and tefluthrin is only approved for granular incorporation. Drench application is more thorough than topical application or granular incorporation, and is therefore the most effective treatment for plants received from outside sources which may not have already been treated for the imported fire ant. In addition, we are proposing to make two miscellaneous changes in paragraph III.C.4. The first, under the ``Exclusion'' heading, would add the word ``drench'' immediately after the word ``bifenthrin'' in paragraph (b), to make it clear that only drench applications are to be used in treating plants received from outside sources. The second miscellaneous change, under the ``Enforcement'' heading, would remove the word ``liquid'' before the phrase ``liquid chlorpyrifos and bifenthrin'' to make it clear that the bifenthrin can be in either liquid or granular form. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This proposed rule would amend the Appendix to the imported fire ant regulations to allow the use of the insecticide tefluthrin (FORCE Â® ), in granular form, for the treatment of containerized nursery stock that is to be certified for interstate movement from areas quarantined for imported fire ant. Approximately 2,645 nurseries move containerized nursery stock interstate from quarantined areas each year. Twelve of these nurseries would be considered large; 2,633 would be considered small, with annual sales below $500,000. Current regulations allow for the incorporation of granular bifenthrin for the treatment of containerized nursery stock that is to be certified for interstate movement from quarantined areas. A 50-pound bag of granular bifenthrin currently retails for about $38.50. The expected retail price for tefluthrin is not available, but should be comparable to that of bifenthrin. For this reason, APHIS anticipates that the economic impact to nurseries that use these products would not be significant. The addition of tefluthrin to the list of authorized chemicals would give nurseries another choice of insecticides so they could choose whichever product best suits their needs, and would provide a backup in case one of the insecticides is taken off the market or is unavailable for any reason. The addition of tefluthrin could also stimulate competition for imported fire ant insecticides, which could drive down prices for all chemicals authorized under the IFA program. If this were to happen, nurseries would benefit by lower treatment costs. We do not anticipate that there would be a noticeable impact on small entities that distribute agricultural chemicals. Distributors of agricultural chemicals are diversified businesses that sell a wide variety of chemicals, fertilizers, and other farm and nursery supplies. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
