The islands spread out about 400 nautical miles from east to west and 500 nautical miles from south to north in the waters, and cover numerous coral reefs and beaches as well as an enormous area totaling 820,000 square km, about the size of eight Jiangsu Provinces. They form an important passage linking the Indian Ocean with the Pacific Ocean, and serve as China's largest tropical fishing ground as well as treasure islands of petroleum and natural gas resources. The Zengmuansha basin is reputed to be a second Persian Gulf. As the Nanshas are close to the equator, fresh water is extremely scarce on the islands. Not a single blade of grass grows on the reefs; and the year-round scorching sun makes life unbearable. There, officers and men of the Navy's South Sea Fleet have overcome extraordinary obstacles and created the Nansha spirit, an epitome of patriotism. Recently, a group of station reporters went to Nansha on a news-gathering assignment. They visited pillboxes where naval officers and men were stationed and wrote a serial report in the form of travel notes. Today, we will broadcast the first part, which is entitled "The Pillboxes Are Linked With the Motherland" and is prepared by station reporters (An Jinglin) and (Xiong Zengyan). [End introduction] Where are the Nansha Islands, and how far are they from the mainland? The big transport ship that took us from Zhanjiang Port on the Leizhou peninsula to the Nanshas sailed nonstop for more than 50 hours. The South China Sea in April and May was the honeymoon season of the year. The sea was as smooth as a mirror. Only school after school of flying fish occasionally jumping out of the water alongside the ship broke the monotony of the vast expanse of water and sea. According to a naval comrade who accompanied us, it was a rare good time of the year because, in a few days, the South Sea could become stormy and turbulent. As we landed on the first island, the (Zhudi) reef, we saw a Chinese map circled with six big characters reading "Motherland in My Heart," in addition to rotating radar antennas atop white pillboxes. A Chinese couplet written with red paint on the two sides of the gate to pillboxes said: "Fulfill one's aspiration in the remotest corner of the earth by safeguarding the (Zhudi) reef; link one's heart to the motherland by forever defending the national gate." The island, a terraced reef, did not have a single inch of land above ground. Even at low tide, the terrace is still partially submerged. Naval officers and men, who are stationed year-round in the lone pillboxes surrounded by the immense sea, can neither watch TV nor listen to radio; and even a letter back home cannot be delivered smoothly. However, all fighters were full of patriotic enthusiasm. The wall papers and couplets put up in the pillboxes and flowers meticulously planted by fighters revealed their sentiment of affection for the reef, the sea, and the motherland. Each and every reef stationed with officers and men had its own couplet. One of the entries to a couplet contest sponsored by the Fiery Cross Reef officers and men said: "The small reefs should not be taken lightly as their safeguarding concerns 3 million square km of water; without the reefs, 200 million households will (?become defenseless)." In this way, the couplet revealed the lofty aspiration of officers and men in safeguarding the motherland's territorial rights and interests over the 3 million square km waters for the security of 200 million households throughout the country. To officers and men guarding the reefs, the motherland is of paramount importance. The (Chihua) reef officers and men nicknamed their daily workout of running around the pillboxes the Nansha-Beijing 10,000-li run. Officers and men stationed on other reefs responded by pledging to complete the distance of the run before the 45th founding anniversary of the PRC. Although what officers and men saw from the pillboxes were a vast perennial expanse of sea, they never missed the solemn flag-raising ceremony even for a single day. They raised their hands in front of the flag and pledged to link the reefs with the motherland and defend the flag on the reefs. Wall and board papers put up inside the pillboxes were full poems written by fighters describing their noble sentiments. [passage omitted] On the Fiery Cross Reef, political commissar (Zhang Wanhua) told us about martyr and first-class merit citation recipient (He Zhenghui): On the eve of the Spring Festival in 1993, when a squad was performing duty on the reef, the weather changed suddenly. The wind was blowing hard and the wave surging up the reef. Fighter (Zhang Yangmin), who was walking at the front, tripped and was swept off by a giant wave, falling into a trench. As (He) witnessed the scene, he bravely jumped into the trench and dragged his comrade-in-arms out of danger. (Zhang) was saved, but (He) was swept away by a strong wave into the ocean. He died at the tender age of 20. While sorting out the martyr's belongings, his comrades-in-arms discovered an unfinished letter. The letter said: Father, if your son would become a martyr for the motherland, you should use the pension to seek treatment for your bronchitis and Mother's rheumatic headache. The remaining money will definitely be not enough to help Elder Brother find a bride, but can be used to repair the roof. As we listened to the soul-stirring story and saw the white pillboxes standing erect above the sea, we searched for the true meaning of patriotism in the Nansha Islands. The answer is found in the pillboxes and the sea.
