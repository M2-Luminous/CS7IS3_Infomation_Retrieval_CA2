To build a market economic structure, a labor market is indispensable. It is a great breakthrough that the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee set out the issue of a labor market. However, it does not mean that all issues concerning the labor market are solved. I should like to air my views on several issues that I have come across. A Complete, Perfect Market Structure Is the Condition for the Building and Normal Operation of the Market Economy It has been 15 years since we conducted reform in the economic structure. In 1984 we set out the need to develop the commodity economy on the basis of public ownership. In 1992 we set out the building of the socialist market economy as the goal of China's reform of the economic structure. Both the planned commodity economy and the socialist market economy calls for a complete and perfect market system. Without a complete, perfect market structure, the development of the commodity economy or the market economy would be out of the question. Today, China's market system remains incomplete and imperfect. The product market is comparatively mature, and the goods and equipment market is gradually opening up. However, the money and labor market have not yet taken shape. Over the past two years or so the money market has begun to bud, with exchange and securities companies founded. However, because of the lack of legislation and macroeconomic regulation and control, confusion surfaced in banking. The grave stagnation of the labor market has already become a bottleneck and a hurdle to completing and perfecting the market system and promoting the building of the socialist market economic structure. Deepening Reform Calls For a Labor Market Presently, the hot spot in deepening reform is to implement the modern enterprise system, convert the operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises, streamline government organizations, and to readjust the industrial setup. All these are directly related to the labor market. 1. The modern enterprise system is the direction of reform of state-owned enterprises. Under the modern enterprise system, the enterprise property right relations are transparent, and with all its properties as a legal person, the enterprise operates on its own, and assumes sole responsibility for its profits and losses. This precisely calls for enterprises to organize production and operation based on market demand, and improve labor productivity and economic returns. That being the case, the enterprise must use personnel according to the needs of its own production and operation, and surplus personnel must be dispensed with. Enterprises suffering deficits over a long period must go bankrupt according to the law, and employment arrangements must be made for the workers of bankrupt enterprises. Under such circumstances, the labor market will play the role of a "reservoir," which will supply manpower resources when enterprises have such a demand, and when there are surplus hands in the enterprise, they can be put on the labor market to seek new jobs. When an enterprise converts its operational mechanism, it will experience autonomy in 14 aspects, of which autonomy in personnel and labor employment are closely connected with the labor market. When an enterprise has autonomy in matters concerning labor and personnel, it will hire help and employ cadres on its own, and dismiss workers or cadres when it is overstaffed. Without a labor market, where would the enterprise hire the help it needs? If it continues to ask labor departments for workers, would it not be returning to the way of administrative allocation? Without a labor market, where would the enterprise's surplus workers go when they are let go? Should overstaffed personnel stay on at their posts, when the enterprise should continue to carry the burden of some 20-30 percent of overstaffed personnel, how could it improve its labor productivity and economic returns? 2. Streamlining government organizations is an important step in the reform of the political structure. The NPC [National People's Congress] has already made a decision that personnel should be reduced in implementing the civil service system, whereas institutions must also reduce their personnel while improving efficiency. It will be impossible to rely on internal absorption of all workers thus let go, so it is imperative to reorganize employment through the labor market. Without a labor market, the government reform in streamlining organizations would also be difficult. 3. The adjustment of industrial setup is closely connected with the labor market. Some state-owned enterprises continue their production even when their products are unmarketable and overstocked. Whereas some products the market demands are in short supply; for example, the raw materials industry. To readjust this irrational arrangement, the greatest difficulty lies in the arrangements for workers. The approach is to allow the flow of workers from production departments that need be readjusted to those departments that need to be developed through the labor market. Without a labor market, the flow of labor force and readjustment in the employment structure would be out of the question, and it would be impossible to reallocate the fixed assets and circulation funds employed for this segment of workers. To readjust the employment structure and promote readjustment of the industrial setup, it is necessary to develop a unified national labor market with control. The aforesaid shows that the labor market is the need of socialist economic development as well as in-depth reform, and is independent of people's subjective will. The Inevitability of Labor Turning Into a Commodity Under the Socialist Condition The theory of labor being commodity is a prerequisite set out by the labor market. The labor market is the sum of the trading relations of labor. If labor is not commodity, where does the labor market come in? This truth is very simple and clear. However, some of our comrades do not think so. They are afraid that, should they acknowledge that labor is commodity, they would negate workers' status as masters under socialist conditions, thus obliterating the difference between capitalism and socialism. Those comrades fail to see that there is objective inevitability for labor to become commodity under the socialist condition. One of the characteristics of the socialist market economy is that all essentials must be allocated by the market, and will enter the production process only through market exchange. There is no exception to labor; otherwise, the normal operation of the socialist market economy would be out of the question. That is one side of the issue. From the worker's angle, proceeding from the individual's interest to obtain greater income, he would sell his labor on the market, thus labor is converted into a commodity. Then, would it be as traditional theory put it that the worker had to sell his labor because he was divorced from production materials, and "had absolutely nothing to his name"? But historical facts are nothing like that. It was not because the worker had lost his production materials that determined the sale of his labor. In a slave society, the laborer and production materials were separated; nevertheless, the slave did not enjoy personal freedom, and independence in personality. His very body and labor belonged to the slave owner, and it was entirely impossible for him to sell his labor as a commodity, but he could be sold along with his labor by his owner. Under the feudal system, the laborer (serf or peasant) might own a small plot of land, but he could not get rid of his personal attachment to the feudal landlord, nor could they enjoy complete personal freedom, and independence in personality. It was also impossible for the worker to sell his own labor as a commodity. That being the case, in feudal society the inevitability of the conversion of labor to commodity did not exist. The capitalist system is a developed market economy, and its operation is possible only when there is a complete and perfect market system, and calls for a mature labor market, with labor being a commodity. That is on the one hand. On the other hand, the reason the worker is now able to sell his own labor, and labor can be turned into a commodity, is that the worker has now gotten rid of the relationship of personal attachment, and enjoys his personal freedom and independence in personality. The worker is now the owner of his own labor, and is able to freely dispose of his own labor. Facts have shown that if the worker does not enjoy personal freedom and independence in personality, even if he and production materials are separated, and "has absolutely nothing to his name," it is impossible for him to sell his own labor as a commodity. Under different conditions, the laborer is not in the category of "having absolutely nothing to his name," but possesses some land and production tools; to pursue greater income, he will go out to sell his labor. In developed Western countries, many peasants farm on their land, while serving as workers at the same time. Quite a few of them are employed in industrial and commercial enterprises in cities and towns, making use of their leisure (weekends and after work) or with their dependents pursuing agricultural production at home, thus becoming the so-called people holding concurrent posts. There is a world of difference between such condition and that of the early stage of the capitalist society when the peasants and craftsmen were forced to enter factories to work after they had gone bankrupt. Labor turning into commodity in contemporary China is the objective demand of socialist market economic development. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee toward the end of 1978, earth-shaking changes have taken place in China's economic life. In a nutshell, China's economy has changed from the former basically unitary socialist public ownership to a socialist economy characterized by the dominant public ownership with the coexistence of multiple economic factors, and from the past noncommodity economy to the socialist commodity economy. Like all developed commodity economies, in the course of transiting toward the market economy, the pressing demand for turning labor into a commodity has already been set out objectively in present-day China. If we put it that private ownership of labor by the worker creates a realistic possibility for labor to turn into a commodity, then it follows that the development of China's commodity economy or the market economy possesses the realistic possibility for labor to change into a commodity. We might as well conclude that this is the inevitable trend of socialist market economic development. China's practice has evidenced the fact that the conversion of labor to a commodity is determined by the demand of the social productive forces in China. Labor is the most active and dynamic factor in productive forces, which will become very active as soon as they get rid of all sorts of personal bondage. When the development of the market economy increases demand for labor and raises the prices for labor, workers who pursues maximum individual income will increasingly enter the labor market from the relatively backward areas, countryside, and small towns to developed regions to work or do business. There, their income is higher than those who are engaged in farming exclusively, and they have learned production skills and accumulated production and operational experiences as well as information and means in becoming rich. At the same time, they have accumulated funds and would return to their home village to develop production. They would become rich themselves, and bring along the whole village to become well-to-do, thus promoting relatively backward areas to develop the productive force. Such a condition has often taken place in China in recent years. Labor Tuning Into a Commodity Does No Harm to Workers' Status as Masters As mentioned above, the conversion of labor to a commodity is not determined by the separation of the worker and production materials, but the need of the socialist economic development as well as the worker's comparative interest. Under the condition of the worker possessing production materials, labor can be converted to a commodity, too. Under socialist conditions, the worker is the master of production materials of public ownership on the one hand; on the other, he is the one who sells his labor. Such double status is acceptable. Under socialist condition, production materials are owned by the workers in entirety, but not by any individual worker, who as an individual is just one of the owners production materials of public ownership, and does not equate the entirety of workers, the union of all workers. That being the case, when every single worker sells his labor as a commodity to the state or enterprise that represents the entirety of workers, it does not mean that he is selling his labor to himself. If we put it that they have become employees on the grounds that they have sold their labor, it does not mean that they have become employees to their selves, but that they have become the employees of the state or enterprise that represents the entirety of workers. This being the case, the worker is one who shares production materials in their ownership, hence his status as one of the masters of the state or enterprise or one of the owners. At the same time, the employees are the ones who sell their labor to his own enterprise and state. That is not contradictory. One idea believes that "reform the labor system, while gradually shaping a labor market" aims only at nonstate-owned enterprises. As to state-owned enterprises, its workers are the masters, and the issue of a labor market does not exist. This is a great misunderstanding. The labor market referred to in the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee decision is a unified labor market that includes economic factors of all sorts and categories across China. Especially in the state-owned economy, it is imperative for them to allocate manpower rationally from now on, genuinely implement two-direction selection, encourage the rational flow of personnel, and implement the best combination of labor and production materials. As to the nonstate-owned economy developed in recent decades, they have been the main body in the labor market from the very start, and have hired their employees through the market. The commodity quality of labor in the nonstate-owned economy is beyond doubt. Now it is time to change concept, have a clear picture that labor is commodity, and that it is state-owned enterprises that must change administrative to market allocation. Another concept is that, should labor be a commodity, would it not be regarding workers themselves as commodities? We should know that the worker and labor are two different but interrelated concepts. The worker may sell his labor as a commodity, or may consume it himself, or let it lay idle. When a worker sells his labor, his labor becomes commodity. What the worker sells is his labor, not himself. This being the case, it is clear that workers will not become commodities.
