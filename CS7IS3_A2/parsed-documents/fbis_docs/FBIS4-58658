Dozens of right-wing supporters gathered in the early morning hours in the Ashdod junction and blocked traffic. The demonstrators carried placards denouncing the peace process, set tires on fire, and some stoned cars driven by territories residents on their way to work in Israel. Massive police troops were summoned to the junction, and three demonstrators were taken in for questioning. [passage omitted] Terror victims' relatives staged a demonstration opposite the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem yesterday afternoon. The police made sure that the demonstrators stayed on the sidewalk near the prime minister's residence, and the protest ended in relative quiet. Another demonstration was held near the Hebrew University on Giv'at Ram last night. Several dozen demonstrators carried torches and placards denouncing the agreement; two tires were burned. One of the demonstrators, who had probably set the tires on fire, was detained by policemen. No unusual events were reported yesterday in East Jerusalem, with the exception of a partially observed commercial strike. Beefed up police deployed throughout East and West Jerusalem all day yesterday to deal with disturbances. About 1,000 inhabitants of Qiryat Mal'akhi and the adjoining towns yesterday rallied in the Qastina junction at the approach to Qiryat Mal'akhi protesting the government plan to permit Palestinian traffic from Gaza to Jericho to cross through Qiryat Mal'akhi. [passage omitted] Other rallies protesting the agreement were yesterday held in the Golani, Tzemah, Bet She'an, and Habiq'a junctions. The rallies were organized by Golan Heights settlers. Some 50 people gathered in the Golani junction and attempted to set tires on fire and block traffic. The police prevented the demonstrators from blocking traffic in all the junctions. [Reporting on page A6 of the same issue of HA'ARETZ, Amnon Yosef adds: "Hundreds of settlers from the Qatif Bloc and northern Gaza Strip settlements yesterday participated in a rally at the Neve Deqalim settlement, protesting the agreement with the PLO. In all the Qatif Bloc settlements, schools remained closed and settlers did not go out to work."]
