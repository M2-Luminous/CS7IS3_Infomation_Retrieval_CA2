In an urgent cable to Der Stoel, the Tehran based center said that the number of families who have arrived at the Hemet and Um Ni'aj border areas has reached 264 families, totalling 1,315 persons according to the latest census. The center indicates that the current exodus started three months ago, but has witnessed a large increase in the number of immigrants during the last month. The cable says that the reasons of the exodus are caused by the stepping up of oppressive measures by the Iraqi regime, such as arrests, executions, and because of the deteriorating life and health conditions of the immigrants, such as the outbreak of skin diseases and dysentery. The cable says that the new wave of immigrants are from Baghdad, al-Hillah, Karbala', al-Basrah, al-Qurnah, al-Madinah, Misan, al- Mijar, al-Nasiriyah, al-Chebaich, and the marshes of Suk al-Shuyukh, al-Hammar, and al-Fuhud. In another development, a communique issued here today by the supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] says that the engineers corps of the Iraqi regime's Army have completed the preliminary works in a new destructive project, which could be considered as the final phase in the so-called al-Anfal Project III, which was carried out early last year and which caused the draining of vast areas of southern Iraq's marshes. The communique quotes sources in southern Iraq as saying that the new project consists of a canal starting at al-Maymunah district, southwest of al-'Amarah, toward the al-Islah region in the al- Nasiriyah governorate in southern Iraq, then west alongside the al-Nasiriyah marshes to meet the Euphrates, and then into the Shatt al-Arab. The engineers corps of the Iraqi regime's Army are carrying out the new project, which is costing about 65 million Iraqi dinars, in cooperation with the Irrigation Ministry. [passage omitted]
