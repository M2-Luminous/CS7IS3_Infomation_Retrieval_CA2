[Fujii] I have read a newspapers' serial interviews with party officials in charge of tax affairs, and realized most of us stand on common ground. In the aging society, we cannot excessively depend on certain social levels. Although each party has its own opinion on methodology of tax reform, all parties have the same goal. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] is calling for tax increase according to an estimate mechanically calculated, and many people are criticizing such a businesslike way. [Fujii] Frankly speaking, I wanted to carefully deal with the subject. However, it is hard to promote tax reform debates without some quantitative guidelines. We have no specific intention in the policy. We have to constantly work on administrative reform. The MOF plans to comprehensively review structure and manpower needs of 92 subsidiary organizations. Regarding unfair taxation, it is about time to reconsider consumption tax exemption for smaller businesses. Taxes on interest should be imposed on all bank accounts held by individuals, and we think the taxpayer number system may be introduced when the reformed pension system gives a number to each individual. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your opinion of proposals for consumption tax reduction for certain commodities? [Fujii] Some foreign countries indeed have lightened sales taxes on foodstuff, but most of them do so because the regular sales tax rates are over 10 percent. Also, I think it is difficult to determine the realm of tax reduction items. I think (the introduction of a lightened tax) is questionable. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think a tax increase for welfare expenditures should be determined now in package with an income tax cut? [Fujii] While the combination of the income tax cut and the consumption tax hike is called a net tax hike, I am not sure if that is an appropriate expression. But, that is the government's position. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your stance on local government bodies' requests to share an increased consumption tax? [Fujii] Many welfare policies are carried on at the local level, and local government bodies need stable revenue resources for that. But that can be widely covered by various existing systems. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Could you give some examples? [Fujii] Reinforcement of local allocation taxes and transfer taxes may be a possible measure. Those systems probably do not look fresh, but can be effective. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Does the government intend to indicate the rate of the consumption tax increase in its tax reform plan to be announced in the end of June? [Fujii] As a minority government, we must carefully listen to opinions of coalition members, the opposition, and the public. But the MOF itself wants to incorporate the tax rate in the plan. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Some say all the tax reform plan should have is a decision to continue income tax cut. [Fujii] In that case, we would have to issue deficit-covering bonds with no brake. We must have a permanent revenue and fundamental tax system reform to secure the income tax cut.
