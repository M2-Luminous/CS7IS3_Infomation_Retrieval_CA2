(Amphetamine is a chemically produced synthetic material). This has been the greatest catch in Hungarian drug history, the Budapest daily NEPSZAVA reported today. The search followed a warning from the Swedish police of good-quality amphetamine being distributed near Malmo, presumably transported to Scandinavia from or via Hungary. The drug quantity produced and distributed in Europe is still unknown. A Swedish-resident Hungarian man and a Greek citizen, who rented the house in Biatorbagy, were taken into custody.
