It is probably a good thing that Lenya Golubkov had the idea of making money on shares from the MMM Joint Stock Company. Otherwise, this extraordinarily henpecked proletarian, in his search for money to buy boots for his wife and other joys of family life, might also have been drawn into a venture somewhat more hazardous to those around him than trading in wallpaper. The newspapers nowadays are simply bursting with articles explaining, in the greatest of detail and from the lips of prosperous people, how best to deceive the state (to obtain fake licenses, to evade customs duties, or to avoid tax inspections), and how to pocket a fair sum of money from doing so. So it is, for instance, that one particular butcher, living until recently in the city of Pushkin in Leningrad Oblast, after closely studying the headlines in the central press, decided that there was no better way to improve his lot than through uranium. It has to be said that, to an experienced businessman, the transaction would not have appeared particularly complex -- to judge from the newspapers, it is possible to sell uranium on virtually any street, while actually getting hold of it is even simpler. Not for nothing has that distant relative been working for so many years at that Ministry of Atomic Energy closed enterprise near Moscow (in the interests of the investigation, we were asked to name neither the city nor the surnames), and he is all but treading this actual uranium underfoot.... The month was February. The Moscow region was covered with snow. Security, it seemed, had also gone into hibernation for the winter (given, of course, that we proceed on the assumption that in summertime the vigilance of the courageous armed guards actually increases). It was on one such frosty evening that the Moscow relative, without any spying aids (such as a suitcase with a false bottom, a secret pocket in his clothing, or, if the worst should come to the worst, simply a pocket) calmly marched through the entrance to his beloved enterprise, calmly giving a little wave with a bulging mitten (it was there that, a few minutes earlier, he had poured a little of the uranium-235, 90-percent enriched). Of course, no chase ensued: The plant managers only learned of the loss several months later, at the same time as the world public. However, there is nothing to be surprised about here -- it is most probable that the manager placed too much trust in the words of Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov, who declared at roughly the very same moment that all fissionable materials at Atomic Energy Ministry enterprises were monitored in the strictest possible manner and that, personally, he did not know of a single documented incidence of "radioactive larceny." At home, using scales normally employed for weighing potatoes, our hero weighed up his spoils -- the arrow on the scales stopped at 3 kg (the primitive instrument ignored the 50-gram makeweight). Then the precious brown powder was concealed in an ordinary closet prior to the arrival of the "businessmen" from the northern capital. You have to agree that the technique for handling radioactive materials typical of some workers at Atomic Energy Ministry enterprises arouses at the very least respect for the heroic profession of the "nuclear scientists" -- for people such as these, even 10 Chernobyls are nothing to fear! The butcher and his St. Petersburg friends -- a plumber and a man temporarily out of work -- did not delay but came for the goods on the very next train. They proved themselves somewhat more skilled: They asked their host for packaging to ensure safe transportation. However, not all the powder would fit into the small metal tube proffered (which, if we are honest, is also a doubtful defense against irradiation), and the remaining grams were put into an ordinary half-liter can. The commodity was transported in a regular passenger car on a Moscow-St. Petersburg train, and the totally unsuspecting passengers would have been highly surprised, had somebody happened to have a dosimeter to hand. When, on arrival in Pushkin, the "merchants" put the uranium in a refrigerator (so as not to let it spoil?) and set off around the city markets in search of purchasers, their every move was already being monitored by the St. Petersburg secret service (it was impossible to ascertain at what stage precisely which respectable citizen "grassed" to the Federal Counterintelligence Service). The counterintelligence agents did not intent to pounce on them immediately -- it was essential to establish how many people were mixed up in the uranium deals. However, the quest for purchasers dragged on without success -- in many ways because, out of ignorance, the butcher and the plumber were asking exorbitant prices, some five or six times over the real value per gram of strategic raw material. The counterintelligence agents could no longer allow these guys to continue freely roaming the streets of St. Petersburg with samples of uranium -- this was dangerous, and the time had finally come to think about the health of the people living next door to the ill-fated Pushkin apartment with the uranium lying on a shelf in the refrigerator. Following the operation to intercept the men carried out by officers from the "Grad" operative-combat group, the apartment had to be decontaminated. Despite the fact that the counterintelligence agents have not succeeded in identifying the channels through which radioactive materials are flowing out from Russia to the West, this operation can be considered a success -- after all, the entire quantity of uranium, down to the last gram, was returned to the state. Admittedly, nobody will undertake to guarantee that it will not "disappear" without trace at another Atomic Energy Ministry plant -- except, perhaps, a few top officials from the Ministry for Atomic Energy itself, who according to our information our preparing another denial for disingenuous critics. We will report on this at another time.
