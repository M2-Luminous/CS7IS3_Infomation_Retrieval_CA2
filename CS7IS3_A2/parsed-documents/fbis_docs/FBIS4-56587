To the Mexican people: To the peoples and governments of the world: To the national and international media: Brethren: The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee General Command of the EZLN addresses the following message to you: Today, 1 May 1994, we once again commemorate Labor Day. Throughout the world, rural and urban workers celebrate their rebellion against exploitation and reaffirm their hope for a more just world. In Mexico, Labor Day is a day of struggle. Since that day, when the bad government which now oppresses us from the Zocalo in Mexico City deprived the Flores Magons of their just aspirations, chains have been dragging down the best Mexican workers. False and corrupt leaders, some more than nine decades old, traffic with the Mexican workers' pain. They are the mainstay of the supreme government that is now peddling our history and our land for foreign currency. The workers struggle for organizational independence has exposed the triple alliance of bad government, corrupt leaders, and the rich and powerful. The enjoyment of ill-gotten gains now has a new name tag. Another mask hides our pain from our own eyes, and a new name unites injustice, slavery, and usurpation -- neoliberalism. The workers who build our country are bleeding from three wounds: they are bled by the powerful through unfair salaries, humiliations, and threats. They are bled by the traitors who run the government's large central unions through extortions, beatings, and death. They are bled by the turncoats who, in the offices they have usurped, draft the laws that their treachery dictates. Thrice the worker dies in the mill of our nation's history: he dies of poverty because he is not justly paid for his new tasks. He dies of humiliation because his defiant words are silenced by the treachery of those who claim to be like him. He dies of slavery because the bad government ignores his will and his determination. Thrice the Mexican worker fights on dirt and asphalt: he fights for justice to have bread and truth in his house and on his table. He also fights for the freedom of his words and deeds so his children will not inherit his shame. He fights for democracy because in his power to change matters lies his power to govern and uphold self-government. The future we all want for our entire nation has three lives: The life of its own strength derived from those brothers whose work is recognized. The life of its hand in the hand of a peasant worker. The life of its embrace that encircles our entire people so that we can march together down a new and better path. Thrice the faceless worker lives and dies. Faceless, uncleansed by the hunger that stains him. Faceless, prey to the treason that destroys him. And faceless because his will is unfulfilled. Thrice he dies, thrice he fights, and thrice he lives. Thrice walks the faceless worker who creates the nation's wealth and makes it tangible, measurable, and changeable. Brothers: From a similar but different history, another faceless being looks on this day with hope: from the mountains in the farthest corner of Mexico, a faceless hope, whose step is merely a tender voice and fire, salutes the workers. The false masks that are plundering us today must fall three times, the unjust labor and pay must fall. The treason that leaves us speechless must fall. And the government that breaks our resolve must fall. Justice! Liberty! Democracy! These are the three keys to the three chains. Justice in the right to a dignified and well-paid job. Freedom in the right to organize ourselves independently of powerful men and their spokesmen. Democracy in the right to demand that the government must obey its mandate. This is what we, the meekest people in these lands, are asking for. We want only this: three rights; three struggles; three suns. And one tomorrow: that of a new Mexico. Mexican workers of the cities and the countryside, Let your voices be heard next to ours. Let your shouts be heard loud and strong throughout this land. Take this hand that your meekest brother offers you. Three forces should walk as one: the workers' force, the peasants' force, and the peoples' force. With these three forces nothing can stop us. Already our blood is being lost in history. The brother of the industrial world cannot let his peasant brother die of shame. Let all people unite as one. May the curse that divides us never again darken our skies. Listen to our voice although it comes from afar. Hail! You toilers of the sea and tillers of the land! The Zapatists join you in your struggle! With you, there will someday be a homeland and a future for us all. Without you, darkness will continue to rule these lands! Liberty! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully: [Signed] The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee General Command of the EZLN. General Headquarters; the mountains of southeastern Mexico; Chiapas, Mexico. [Issued] 1 May 1994.
