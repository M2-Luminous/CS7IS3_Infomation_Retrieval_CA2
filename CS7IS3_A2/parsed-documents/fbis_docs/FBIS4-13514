Progress was also made in the Security Committee on three issues which had already been noted down in the draft agreement of the two delegations. Dr. Sha'th also expressed his belief that next week may be the last week of the talks. He told our correspondent in Cairo, Moti Amir that the answers brought by Major General Shahaq from Jerusalem today enable the sides to make rapid progress in the negotiations. Another meeting will take place between Sha'th and Shahaq tonight, in which Sha'th will receive a written document containing the Israeli proposals. Sha'th says that these proposals are very close to the formulation of the Declaration of Principles with regard to the jurisdiction powers of the autonomy authorities, but he refused to elaborate.
