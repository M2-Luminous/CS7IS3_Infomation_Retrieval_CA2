Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mahmud, staff member of the House Speaker's Office, and several House deputies attended. At the outset of the meeting, the brother House speaker welcomed brother Lakhdar Brahimi in his second home, the Republic of Yemen. He added: We thank you for bothering to make this trip to achieve the mission assigned to you--a humanitarian Arab mission. It is a duty that must be performed by a well-known Arab figure, like you. This is because you are a fraternal Arab who believes in Arab unity and bringing the peoples of various countries together. God willing, your mission will be a success. We will support you. Shaykh al-Ahmar affirmed that what is taking place in the Republic of Yemen is a domestic affair. Brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar discussed Yemeni unity, saying: Yemeni unity has been blessed by all fraternal Arabs, who have deemed it a step along the road of the desired Arab unity, which has long been the dream of the Arabs. The Arabs have deemed unity the Arab nation's (?sublime) objective. Brother al-Ahmar reiterated that any laxity toward Yemeni unity would be a departure from this objective, which we all seek to achieve. During this meeting, the brother House speaker also explained the joint unity-orientated action from the outset until it was crowned by the proclamation of the Republic of Yemen in 1990. Unity was achieved through democratic methods, dialogue, and peaceful means. It enjoyed the broad support of all sectors of the people, al-Ahmar said. The House speaker indicated that Yemen--territory and people--has always been united. But, apparently, there were two distinct regimes. Shaykh al-Ahmar elaborated on the crisis since its eruption, noting that certain elements within the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] fabricated it, until these elements caused a flare-up in the military situation on 27 April 1994--the first anniversary of the parliamentary elections held in united Yemen. The House speaker concluded by saying: The most important issues are Yemeni unity, democracy, and legitimacy. He affirmed that unity is the most important thing that concerns the people and their representatives. The choice they are facing is between either safeguarding unity or death, he contended. For his part, brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, spoke, saying: Yesterday and the day before yesterday, I had the honor of meeting several officials, headed by the brother Presidential Council chairman. I have also met with representatives of the political parties. Today, I am meeting with you. The mission I am conducting at the instructions of the UN secretary general is aimed at enabling me to find the facts pertaining to the situation of the brothers in this country, and informing them that the international community is concerned over what is taking place in this country, and that the brothers are required to overcome their difficulties by themselves. Brahimi added: I feel that I am in my own country, and among my brothers. We are agreed that Yemen is an important country, with and age-old history, and that it is only natural for difficulties to emerge in all countries and societies. God willing, we will overcome these difficulties. The brothers reiterated to me at previous meetings that dialogue is an approach acceptable to Yemenis. God willing, dialogue will help create a strong Yemen that contributes to the well-being of its people and its neighbors. Afterward, brother Lakhdar Brahimi listened to the views of the House members who attended the meeting, who represent various parliamentary blocs at the House of Representatives. These deputies represent parties, political organizations, and various Yemeni governorates. Some of them are independents. The House members asserted that Yemeni unity has been established through peaceful and democratic means, that this unity has been grounded in dialogue, and that Yemeni unity has been achieved through a popular and democratic will, without any pressures. They added that secession is meant to be forced on us. They hoped that fraternal Arabs will support Yemeni unity, because it is the first cornerstone in the edifice of Arab unity. They went on to say that bias in favor of anything other than Yemeni unity is tantamount to supporting fighting. Besides, the entire Yemeni people are unified. They adhere to unity, and can in no way accept secession. The House members noted that those who declared secession constitute a small minority that rebelled against legitimacy, one that does not represent the YSP. This is because it is an established fact that the YSP has supported and backed unity. The deputies affirmed that dialogue must have bases. One of these bases is that any political solution to the crisis must safeguard Yemeni unity. Any such solutions should not result in tearing Yemen apart after it has been united, the deputies argued. The parliamentarians affirmed the need for the United Nations to protect legitimacy and consecrate Yemeni unity, because unity came as a response to the will and demands of the people, who supported the Constitution in a public referendum and backed constitutional legitimacy at the polling stations on 27 April 1993, when they elected their representatives to the first parliament of unified Yemen. Consequently, the people unanimously support unity and legitimacy. They will not abandon unity, regardless of the sacrifices entailed.
