Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, has indicated he will publish proposals within the next fortnight to devolve power to the province and set up cross-border policy bodies. But Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionists, said any new arrangements based on the principles of the Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland were unacceptable. In the Commons, Mr Major said progress on a political settlement would not wait upon Sinn Fein which has yet to respond to the invitation to join talks. He confirmed that ideas designed to give "focus and direction" to the talks process would be brought forward soon, despite signs of a rift with Dublin over the timing of the initiative. Mr Major took his first public opportunity to denounce the propaganda campaign waged by Mr Adams on his trip to America. "I don't believe people in Britain or in Ireland have been deceived by Adams's performance," he said. The way to peace in Northern Ireland was "in Gerry Adams's hands and I believe he could and should do it," Mr Majo added . On his return to Dublin, Mr Adams again declined the opportunity to announce a permanent cessation of violence. However, he said "we are now in the final phase of this conflict" -- a message which observers took to be directed at the IRA rather than the Government. Following Mr Adams's visit to New York, the Government has decided to try to wrest the initiative from Sinn Fein. But the initial response from the Democratic Unionists was hostile, if predictable. Mr Robinson said on BBC radio: "The whole constitutional position of Northern Ireland has been transformed. "The self-determination of the people of Northern Ireland has been handed away from it being vested entirely with the people of Northern Ireland to the whole of the people of the island of Ireland." The DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] response demonstrates how difficult it will be to make any progress in the foreseeable future and there were indications that Dublin is not convinced that the time is right for Sir Patrick to table his proposals. Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's Foreign Minister, said he trusted that the initiative would be directed towards the achievement of the objectives the governments had jointly set themselves. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party], maintained it was clear from what Mr Adams had said in America that Sinn Fein "does not accept the principle of self-determination based on consent."
