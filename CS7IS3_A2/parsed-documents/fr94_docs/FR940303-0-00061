ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for aggregate species in the rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category by vessels using trawl gear in Bycatch Limitation Zone 1 (Zone 1) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the prohibited species bycatch allowance of red king crab to the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category in Zone 1. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), February 28, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Fishery Biologist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, (907) 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The 1994 prohibited species bycatch allowance of red king crab in Zone 1 for the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category, which is defined at ยง675.21(b)(1)(iii)(B)(2), was established as 110,000 crabs by the final 1994 initial specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง675.21(c)(1)(i), that the prohibited species bycatch allowance of red king crab for the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery in Zone 1 has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for aggregate species in the rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category by vessels using trawl gear in Zone 1 of the BSAI from 12 noon, A.l.t., February 28, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20.
