Ilyukhin explained this view in a letter to Secretary Oleg Lobov of the National Security Council. According to Ilyukhin, the decision to transform the Federal Counterintelligence Service from a government body into an agency under the direct supervision of President Yeltsin, contradicts the state Constitution. It takes the service, as well as the president's personal protection troops, out of the prosecutor's reach and makes it uncontrollable from the point of view of court and other authorities; and this, says Ilyukhin, may do great damage to the nation, as it already did in the 30s. On the other hand, the division of what used to be the service's closely-knit system of regional administrations and the move to curtail the administrations' legal rights will reduce the service's effectiveness and hinder efforts to protect the Russian interests now that special services of other countries have stepped up action both along the whole length of the Russian borders and inside this country, believes Ilyukhin. Ilyukhin opposes the decision to deprive the service of the right to conduct legal inquiries and have investigation cells. That decision is sure to make the service helpless and incapable of exposing spies and turncoats, he believes. Ilyukhin says that until very recently the security services and the Ministry of Internal Affairs had been balancing or counterweighing each other's efforts. Now, says the chairman of the Duma's Security Committee, moves have been made to upset that balance. The excessive authority buildup on the part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as well as the repeated moves to increase the numerical strength of the internal troops and riot police units with the adoption, by these, of weapons under army tables of organization, creates dangerous preconditions for the emergence of a powerful monster capable of defying the mechanisms of government control and carrying out any kind of anti- constitutional action. Unfortunately, something of the kind already happened in Russia. Ilyukhin hopes the Secretary of the National Security Council understands the problem and will take, together with the parliamentary committee, appropriate concrete actions.
