FR941011-2-00136 FR941011-2-00088 [Release No. 34&hyph;34781; File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;94&hyph;28] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Quote Spread Parameters for National Over-the-Counter Index (``XOC'') Options October 3, 1994. On June 13, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend PHLX Rule 1014, ``Obligations and Restrictions Applicable to Specialists and Registered Options Traders,'' and PHLX Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') F&hyph;6, ``Option Quote Spread Parameters,'' to establish the following maximum quote spreads for National Over-the-Counter Index (``XOC'') options: $2.00 for XOC options with bids of $20.00 to less than $40.00; and $3.00 for XOC options with bids of $40.00 or more. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). Notice of the proposed appeared in the Federal Register on July 25, 1994. 3 Prior to the filing of the proposal with the Commission, the PHLX received one comment letter. 4 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34401 (July 19, 1994), 59 FR 37801. 4 See Letter from Barry J. Weisberg, Certified Financial Planner, Vice President, Financial Consultant, Smith Barney Shearson, to Gerald O'Connell, Vice President, Market Surveillance, PHLX, dated March 24, 1994 (``March 24 Letter''). The commenter argues that the PHLX's widening of the quote spread parameters for XOC options will disadvantage public customers and may discourage public customer interest in trading index options on the PHLX. In response to the March 24 Letter, the PHLX indicated that the Exchange's Committee on Options considered the quote spread parameters established by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'') for its Nasdaq 100 Index (``NDX''). In addition, the PHLX noted that the XOC trading crowd has increased its minimum volume guarantee to 20 contracts for public customer orders in series with previous-close bid values of $10.00 or less. See Letter from Gerald O'Connell, Vice President, Market Surveillance, PHLX, to Barry J. Weisberg, Certified Financial Consultant, Smith Barney Shearson, dated April 29, 1994 (``April 29 Letter''). On September 22, 1994, the PHLX submitted a letter providing additional information about the proposal. Specifically, the PHLX states that the proposed quote spread parameters reflect the greater uncertainty of pricing higher-priced options, which are generally deep in-the-money and may be far-term or long-term options. In addition, the PHLX states that the combination of high volatility and high index price produces many XOC series which trade on a delta basis of at or near 100, so that an index change of one point results in an option price change of one point. The PHLX believes that the wider quote spread parameters will help XOC specialists maintain their affirmative market making obligations for high-delta XOC options.
