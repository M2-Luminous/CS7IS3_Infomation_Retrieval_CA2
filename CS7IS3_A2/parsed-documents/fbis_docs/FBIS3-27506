Sung in Beijing] [Text] Britain yesterday accused China of leaking the contents of the Sino-British talks on electoral arrangements. The British said the Chinese leak had led to the decision to reveal the contents of the 17 rounds of talks. British Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren said Britain was aware that much of the talks' contents had been leaked by the Chinese side. Governor Chris Patten is to release a White Paper today, setting out the British side's account of the failed negotiations. "This is, of course, against the background of a great deal of leaking of the contents of talks from the other side," Sir Robin said. "It was necessary to make the contents of the talks available before the second stage of Mr Patten's reform bill was tabled," he said. He refused to confirm whether a copy of the White Paper had been sent to China, but he said he was in regular touch with the Chinese side. He did not agree that the disclosure would lead to a total termination of Sino-British cooperation. "For our part, we are very concerned cooperation should be maintained to the maximum extent possible. Concerning the new airport, all details and technical matters being discussed in the JLG (Joint Liaison Group) need cooperation." Meanwhile, members of a Chinese think-tank expected that China would reveal its own version of the contents of the talks. Member of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) Tsang Yok-sing said the Chinese side would have no obligation to keep the promise of confidentiality if the British side unilaterally revealed the contents of the talks. He believed the Chinese side would also soon reveal their view of the talks as it now made no sense to withhold the facts. Former senior Executive Councillor, Sir Sze-yuen Chung opposed unilateral disclosure. He said there should be joint disclosure, as it was likely the two sides would give two different versions. "I do not agree that Britain and China should each separately reveal their own version," Sir Sze-yuen said. A new battle between the two sides could arise if there were two different versions. The people of Hong Kong would be puzzled about which version was true, he said. Former Basic Law drafter Simon Li said a unilateral disclosure could be misleading. It could polarise the views of the Hong Kong public. "Some people will take the British side's version if they have more confidence in the British, while other people will take the Chinese side," Mr Li said. "But this is the way politics is."
