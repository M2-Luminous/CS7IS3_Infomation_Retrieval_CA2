FR940607-0-00049 FR940607-0-00016 System changes and actual testing must be coordinated with product-supply operations to minimize the impact on refineries, distributors, and users of the transported products. Also, operators need time to assure that testing is done safely, with the least environmental risk, and in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations. However, RSPA weighed these time demands in deciding upon the compliance deadlines proposed in the NPRM. None of the commenters who addressed the compliance-time issue substantiated their opinions that more time should be allowed. Although it is admittedly difficult to predict how much time is appropriate, the comments do not convince us that there are too many pre-1970 ERW pipelines to test in 4.5 years or that a decade is needed to complete testing of all other pipelines. Therefore, the final rule adopts the testing deadlines as proposed. RSPA has not adopted API's suggestion to allow 10 years for all older pipelines, with priorities based on risk, because the unique problems of pre-1970 ERW pipelines demand correction sooner. Also, considering the mileage involved, the potential savings from reusing test water, and the need to minimize market impacts, API's suggestion would further complicate the development of test schedules. Still, the final rule does provide operators flexibility in planning and scheduling tests. When feasible, operators could use this flexibility to select pipelines for testing according to leak history or other risk factors. RSPA encourages such testing priorities provided all required testing is completed within the periods allowed. Charts or Logs Two operators commenting on proposed §195.406(a)(5) asked us not to limit allowable documentation of prior tests or operating pressures to recording charts or logs. They said the industry has never had to keep these charts and logs for older pipelines, and many have been lost. They suggested that the final rule allow alternative documentation, such as construction specifications, pipeline completion reports, and affidavits from responsible people. Considering the importance of a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety to the integrity of pipelines, public safety cannot tolerate doubts about whether a pipeline has been adequately tested. Only recording charts or logs made at the time of prior testing or operations show with certainty that the minimum margin exists for the pipeline concerned. Alternative documentation, including specifications, reports, or affidavits, is less probative. Such evidence leaves some room for doubt because it does not result directly from pipeline testing or operation. Although recording charts and logs may no longer be available for some older pipelines, RSPA does not believe a lack of proper records justifies allowing a lesser level of proof for a matter so serious as pipeline integrity. Therefore, the final rule allows only recording charts or logs to document a prior test or operating pressure. Another operator was concerned that the documentation available for use under the proposed revision of §195.406(a)(5) may not meet existing §195.310. For example, the operator said calibration data may not be available. Section 195.310 specifies the records operators must keep for each pressure test required by subpart E of part 195. Section 195.310 does not affect the documentation required by existing §195.406(a)(5), and would not affect documentation under the proposed revision of §195.406(a)(5). Thus, operators need not have documentation under final §195.406(a)(5) in the same detail as §195.310 requires. Permits for Disposal of Test Water When existing petroleum pipelines are pressure tested hydrostatically, the testing process introduces hydrocarbons into the test water. If test water picks up unacceptable quantities of hydrocarbons, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) governs its discharge into the environment. (See 40 CFR parts 122&hyph;124.) The NPDES is a regulatory program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in cooperation with qualified State agencies under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ).
