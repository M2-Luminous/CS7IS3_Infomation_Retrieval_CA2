[Costales] How do you think the Cuban issue will be treated? [Morales] Well, we must say that the fundamental characteristics of U.S. foreign policy concerning Cuba essentially reflect the continuation of Bush Administration policy. However, I do not believe that the current Administration's political language is as aggressive as that of the Bush Administration. Only superficial changes have been made. These changes relate to talks that are not negotiations as such, but discussion of issues. Basically, I think the Bush policy is being maintained because this policy on Cuba has much to do with the U.S. attitude of waiting for the development of internal processes in Cuba and how the Cuban economic reinstatement will be established within the new international relations process.
