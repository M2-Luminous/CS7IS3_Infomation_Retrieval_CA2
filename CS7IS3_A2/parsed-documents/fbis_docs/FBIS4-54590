Opportunities to intensify bilateral relations in different sectors are opening up," Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said on his return from Prague today. His talks there focused on economic issues and the two countries' adjustment to the new environment. Mr. Daskalov said work was in progress on the agreements on the avoidance of double taxation and on investment promotion. Bulgaria and the Czech Republic expressed willingness to hold talks on setting up a free trade zone which would allow businessmen to step up two-way trade. "Our problems are identical: Both countries want to become integrated into Europe," Mr. Daskalov said. The Czech officials showed an interest in Bulgaria's position on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, he said. "I had an interesting meeting with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. Being one of the greatest experts in reforms, he was interested in their progress in Bulgaria, as well as in the political situation," Mr. Daskalov said. On commission of President Zhelyu Zhelev, he handed over to Czech President Vaclav Havel archive records on the 1968 events and Bulgaria's participation in them. This act was highly praised. "By the way, Bulgaria is the last country to deliver these documents and Czech journalists asked me why we had not done so earlier," Mr. Daskalov said. The agreement on visa-free entry clearance signed in Prague allows Bulgarians to spend up to a month in Prague and return home quite pleased, Mr. Daskalov said. While in Prague, the Bulgarian foreign minister was also received by Chairman of the Czech parliament Milan Uhde.
