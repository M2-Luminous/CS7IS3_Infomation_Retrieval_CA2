India is standing there dumbfounded by these problems such as increasing population; reemergence of ethnic and caste-related prejudices in human relations; control over government, communication, education, and economic structure by one-fourth of the population; arrival of the American dragons--the multi-national companies--to devour our culture and national identity; the society stuck in the quicksand of myopia caused by the lose of self-confidence while battling the standards of consumerism; loss of selfhood because of self-doubts, indecisiveness; and helplessness of major leaders engrossed in power and divided among themselves. The spineless people hiding behind their seats of power are giving very weak reasons in support of the GATT proposals. Even a scholarly member of the Parliament Manishanker Ayyer has gone to extremes and supported the signing of this agreement. He said, "Since India had signed the original GATT proposals in 1948, it should sign those now." Mr. Ayyer and such ineffectual thinkers should see why France, European nations, Australia, and Japan are so interested in forwarding their interests in pacts signed in Brussels to Geneva. Many of these countries had sang the songs of praise when GATT was born in 1948. What special place did India get at the international platform? GATT is a sacrificial alter and the Dunkel is the sword. Geneva is the place where they sacrifice developing countries to satisfy the U.S. thirst for riches and for other developed nations, and Peter Southerland is Shiva. The only way to establish Ramrajya [ideal government] is to stop Meghnath's yagna. The various varieties of carnivorous plants representing the U.S. ambitions born out of the rubble of communist regimes are dazzling us and pulling at us. The U.S. President, the secretary of state, and groups of senators and officials are roaming the world. The U.S. hunger for power has used the rungs of APAC, ASEAN, and NAFTA to reach the treasure of GATT. From among 116 countries only 20 or 22 countries are involved in the nominal tug-of-war of vested interests against the United States. Mickey Cantor, the U.S. representative, and Sir Leo Briton, who is representing the 12 European nations, are moving the pawns of their interests very carefully. The United States is forced to make changes in the agreement for the European interests. Even a country like Belgium is proudly announcing that it can boot the American proposals and GATT out in the context of issues related to television and films, because protecting culture is more important than the business interests. The Cannes Trade Group, a group of 14 nations under the leadership of Australia, can create new problems. South Korea may be forced to open doors to import rice, but the Japanese Prime Minister Hata is keeping Geneva at bay from Tokyo. Japan is in the process of taking a plebiscite over the GATT proposals. Dr. Mahatir, prime minster of Malaysia, has boycotted APAC and shown the courage to call it a vehicle to protect U.S. interests. France has got its stand on giving subsidy to the farmers approved, and still is arguing about the issues related to film and airplane industries. Some African nations have started to make noise about their products--coffee and cocoa--becoming cheaper. President Clinton himself sat on the negotiation table to show respect for China and with great respect offered the gift of supercomputers to China. Only then APAC could be formed. The central theme of the NAFTA is exploiting cheap Mexican labor. The strategy to tie down India with the same fate as Argentina, Brazil, Latin American countries, and the Philippines has been very important. India is an untapped market. The warmth of over 100,000 [rupees] per annum income earned by 200 million upper middle class people is pushing us towards consumerism and luxuries. The remaining 700 million people have no alternative but to carry these 200 million wealthy people on their shoulders. The Indian government has neither a vision nor the ability to unite and nor the life-giving source of popular support. We should have our share in GATT based on our need to survive. The fate of every citizen is tied to signing the GATT proposals. Very fine points of the Trips (Trade Related intellectual rights and biotechnology], Trims [trade related investment measures]), questions over MFN [most favored nation], and patents laws should have been discussed at the levels of universities and vidhan sabhas [state aeemblies]. The government should have received a mandate from the people and kept the nation's philosophy in its mind. If the United States is stubbornly trying to keep the restrictions on garment imports for 15 years instead of for 10 years, then our government should kick that stubbornness away. Make these Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola and Colgate people scram from here. The 900 million Indian people have tolerated a lot. The multi-national companies are showing up here to exploit India's cheap labor, ample energy sources, and abundant raw materials and efforts are being made to bind India into the GATT trap. The pitcher is fraught with the sins of conspiracies of foreigners, particularly Americans such as the trick of not organizing the G-7 nations meeting along with the G-15 nations meeting, Mallot, Clinton, and Robin Raphael's tactics over Kashmir, interference in the cryogenic engine deal, spewing poison over the humans rights issue, improper pressure to sign the "shylock-type" NPT, intrusion into the kitchens of the people to sell their products, and first offering the tent of economic incentives and then putting on a military umbrella to protect their interests. Vodka and wine from Russia is obtained and sold here, and the Russian companies are minting money by sending food and even pumpkins to Russia in exchange. Many foreign companies are processing mushrooms and making sea food for export. Pepsi has taken the lead in making profit by increasing the production of tomatoes. A company called Coopen Ritgeld is making agreements with farmers to grow cucumbers. The ITC has made an agreement with Geneva about developing seeds. It is the major export hordes, in whose laps these politicians born of the poor peoples' votes prosper, who are in a hurry to have the GATT agreement signed. Where can an average man stand in this equation of political leaders, stock brokers, black marketeers, corrupt officials, intellectuals who are the slaves of multi-national companies, the CIA, journalists, and experts? Unemployment and prices of necessary items, illiteracy, and poverty are on the rise, and the value of humans is decreasing. In this situation, stop and think about what GATT will give you! What will it take back in return? What is this open market? These are the efforts to steal our literature, tradition, sciences, herbs, living organisms, knowledge, and trying to loot us by making the patent laws. We have been using the neem tree for thousands of years before America was discovered. Now, in the name of patents and intellectual properties, the neem in our backyard will become a U.S. property. What worse form of slavery is there?
