Below we publish Arpad Goncz's replies to questions asked of him by the Budapest correspondent for our newspaper. [Lubczyk] The political and economic transformations which the countries of East and Central Europe are going through are a remarkable process. According to you, Mr. President, what have we done with the freedom and democracy which have been reinstated? [Goncz] The most important matter is that we continue to exist. That is a big accomplishment, both for the new Poland and the new Hungary; it is a real achievement by both our societies, especially when we consider the kind of devastation the Cold War inflicted on people. Despite that, we established democratic systems. In Hungary, we are getting ready for the second free parliamentary elections. Regardless of many reservations, deficiencies, and inadequacies in different walks of life, it is my view that it is not just us -- Poles and Hungarians -- that managed to adapt ourselves to the changes by gradually getting rid of the mentality which was in effect for decades. In my view, that process of adaptation to the new situation, and also of replacing the old way of thinking with a completely new one, is the essence of democracy. Of course, the process has not been completed yet and it continues to be very difficult; it requires constant sacrifices by people even though they are already very tired of the reforms and of modernization. Despite that, I think that our two societies have a more optimistic vision of the future than Western societies; this is a result of complicated and often tragic history and national experiences. Perhaps this will sound a bit presumptuous, but there is nobody that has been -- and still is -- affected more by every tick of the clock both in the West and in the East than Poles and Hungarians. That is one of the justifications for why we should stick together. [Lubczyk] According to what you are saying, Mr. President, our two countries continue to go their ways. The elections in Poland changed the political configuration there, and new forces have taken over power in the Slovak Republic. How do you explain this turn to the left? [Goncz] I would rather not answer this question before the elections in my country since some political parties could immediately accuse me of making suggestions. As president, I cannot deal with fortune telling. I will gladly address the issue at the end of May. [Lubczyk] So I will ask you at that point for additional explanations and supplementary information, but right now I suggest we just skip Hungary in our discussion. [Goncz] The turn to the left can be explained relatively easily. The phenomenon is also visible in the West, although in slightly different proportions. After the euphoria and some achievements, there occurred a crisis linked to the recession, and societies simply hold it against the governing parties that they are not capable of handling these problems. After all, new authorities in postcommunist countries started off under tragic conditions in many cases. What the first democratic governments attempted to do, can even be compared to ... an attempt to commit suicide. Often we are waging battles with the impossible. While being extremely determined, we expect outright miracles to happen! Of course, there is always a chance to do something. I am not saying miracles do not happen, but possibilities and chances must be evaluated realistically. Under this very complicated social and economic situation of individual countries, those who are in power right now must continue to keep in mind that they are the last persons in the world who could afford to ignore any principle of democracy and that they must always take the people's will into account, and to regard what society wants -- and not the authorities -- as the most important thing. Every government can be replaced, but societies and people cannot. [passage omitted] [Lubczyk] After a few years of experience, what is your evaluation of the president's place and role in establishing democracy in Hungary? [Goncz] Hungary's president has very limited powers. Personally, I often find myself in awkward situations since people tend to generally believe me and rely on me, whereas in actual fact there is not a lot I can really do. So I think very carefully about every word I say. It is a paradox that you are hearing this from a writer, but only now have I come to really appreciate the power of words. [Lubczyk] Do you think that the powers of the "head of state" should be amended? [Goncz] I think I have no right to discuss the issue. Let the political parties and society speak about this if they think that is the right thing to do. I think that if a debate like this were to take place, I should not participate in it. [passage omitted] [Lubczyk] Mr. President, how do you intend to utilize the meetings with representatives of Polish authorities? [Goncz] If I were going to Portugal or to Latin America, then I could say that I am going there to make a "breakthrough" with regard to this or that. But when it comes to Poland and its people, that is a completely different story. I think that being on the outside, as it were -- and also, I think, having quite a good knowledge of Poland's historical and contemporary winding roads -- I view your current problems in a slightly different way than yourselves. And vice versa. I expect to find answers to many questions during my talks with President Walesa and with many other Polish politicians -- and also with other kinds of people, by the way. Among others, my meeting with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will be significant to me since I think that we view some issues differently. I am sure the current visit will also be helpful to President Lech Walesa and myself so as to better prepare ourselves for the April meeting of the "heads" of seven countries. [Lubczyk] What are politics to you? [Goncz] Politics is not an isolated term to me. I always view politics from the perspective of society and through people's behaviors and responses, among others to reforms being introduced. Politics is a way to make life better.
