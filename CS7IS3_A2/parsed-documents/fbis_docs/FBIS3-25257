This has been stated in Cape Town at the International Conference on Nuclear Policy by the president of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, Mr. David Albright. The chief executive of the Atomic Energy Corporation, Dr. Stumpf, told delegates that even the most sophisticated instruments had not been able to detect a nuclear explosion, and that it was clear that South Africa had not been involved. Mr. Roger Jardin of the ANC [African National Congress] said information would probably emerge soon to show that South Africa had collaborated with Israel in the alleged nuclear test.
