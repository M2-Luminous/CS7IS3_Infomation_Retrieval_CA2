FR940208-0-00021 FR940208-0-00016 UNITED STATES INFORMATION AGENCY 22 CFR Part 503 Freedom of Information Act Regulations AGENCY: United States Information Agency. ACTION: Notice of final rule. SUMMARY: This regulation revises the Agency's current regulation implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Other regulatory provisions regarding law enforcement records, fees for processing requests, and Executive Order No. 12600, concerning predisclosure notification for business records, were already printed and are unaffected by this rule as they already conform to the amendments enacted by the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986 (Final Rule published June 26, 1989). EFFECTIVE DATE: February 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Freedom of Information Office, United States Information Agency, room M&hyph;29, 301 4th Street SW., Washington, DC 20547, telephone (202) 619&hyph;5499. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Lola L. Secora, Freedom of Information Officer (202) 619&hyph;5499. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The United States Information Agency published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise its FOIA regulations on November 16, 1993 (FR/Vol. 58, No. 219). Pursuant to that notice, USIA received only one comment from the public, and it was commendatory. The final rule is based on the proposed rule.

Sections 503.1 through 503.6 are revised to read as follows: ยง503.1 Introduction and definitions. (a) Introduction. The FOIA and this part apply to all records of the United States Information Agency, including all of its foreign posts. As a general policy, USIA follows a balanced approach in administering the FOIA. We recognize the right of public access to information in the possession of the Agency, but we also protect the integrity of the Agency's internal processes. This policy calls for the fullest possible disclosure of records consistent with those requirements of administrative necessity and confidentiality which are recognized by the Freedom of Information Act. (b) Definitions_ Access Appeal Committee or Committee , means the Committee delegated by the Agency Director for making final Agency determinations regarding appeals from the initial denial of records under the FOIA. This Committee also reviews final appeal denials of documents made by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) for its records. Agency or USIA means the United States Information Agency. It includes all components of USIA in the U.S. and all foreign posts abroad (known as the U.S. Information Service or USIS). (See 22 CFR part 504, chapter V_Organization.) Commercial use , when referring to a request, means that the request is from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or of a person on whose behalf the request is made. Whether a request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and the use to which the records will be put. The identity of the requester (individual, non-profit corporation, for-profit corporation), or the nature of the records, while in some cases indicative of that purpose or use, is not necessarily determinative. When a request is from a representative of the news media, the request shall be deemed not to be for commercial use. Department means any executive department, military department, government corporation, government controlled corporation, any independent regulatory agency, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Federal Government. A private organization is not a department even if it is performing work under contract with the Government or is receiving Federal financial assistance. Grantee and contractor records are not subject to the FOIA unless they are in the possession and control of USIA.
