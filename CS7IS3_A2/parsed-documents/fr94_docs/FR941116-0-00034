FR941116-0-00034 FR941116-0-00006 Additionally, the FAA has revised the repetitive leak check interval for the Kaiser Electroprecision valves subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i). That paragraph has been revised to provide for conducting the applicable repetitive leak checks at intervals of ``5,000 flight hours or 24 months, whichever occurs later.'' (The supplemental NPRM proposed a repetitive leak check interval of 5,000 flight hours only.) This provision has been made in acknowledgment of those operators who may have related maintenance procedures that are conducted on a schedule based on calendar time rather than on flight hours. Kaiser Expander Valve One commenter has concerns about the requirements of proposed paragraph (b)(2)(i) of the supplemental NPRM, which is applicable to forward lavatory drain systems modified in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021. This commenter indicates that the proposed paragraph does not require that a Kaiser Electroprecision Expander Valve or a lever-lock cap be installed in accordance with that Boeing service bulletin, even though the service bulletin does refer to such installations in certain of its modification procedures. This commenter questions whether those installations are required to be installed and, if so, suggests that the FAA re-issue this AD action as a proposal to clearly indicate the intent of that paragraph. The FAA acknowledges this commenter's concerns and agrees that different interpretations are possible from the wording of paragraph (b)(2)(i) as it appeared in the supplemental NPRM. The FAA has revised the final rule to delete reference to Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, and to merely call out the applicable Kaiser Electroprecision part number series valves. This revision should make clear that there is no requirement for installation of a Kaiser Electroprecision Expander Valve to qualify for the repetitive 5,000 flight hour leak checks. The requirement for installing a lever lock cap is contained in paragraph (d) of the supplemental NPRM and this final rule. Kaiser Expander Valve/In-Line Drain Valve Combination One commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to establish a 6,000-flight hour leak check interval for installations of an in-line drain valve in combination with a Kaiser Electroprecision Expander Valve. As proposed, the leak check interval for this combination of valves is 5,000 flight hours. The commenter provided no justification for this request, however. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Available data have demonstrated that the seal life and reliability of the Expander Valve are significantly less than that of the in-line drain valve. In light of this, an extension of the 5,000-flight hour interval to a 6,000-flight hour interval is not justified for the in-line drain valve in combination with the Expander Valve. However, under the provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of the final rule, if an in-line drain valve is found to have abnormal operation of the handle, the system may continue in operation, provided a service panel drain valve that is in the 1,000-flight hour leak check interval category is installed in the system and has passed a leak check within the preceding 1,000 flight hours. Shaw Aero Valves Part Numbers Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to include Shaw Aero Devices valves in the part number 1010100B and 1010100C series in the requirements for 1,000-flight hour leak check intervals. One of these commenters indicates that these part-numbered valves are merely later generations of the Shaw Aero Devices part number 1010100C&hyph;N (or higher dash number) valve, which was called out in the supplemental NPRM and for which a 1,000-flight hour leak check interval was proposed. The FAA agrees that these Shaw Aero Devices valves should be addressed in the AD, and that some increase in the leak check interval, above the basic 200-flight hour interval, is justified for these valves. However, the FAA does not concur with the commenters' request to provide for a 1,000-flight hour leak check interval for them in all circumstances. The FAA has obtained data on certain design improvements, such as an ``ice breaker'' feature, that have been made to certain Shaw Aero Devices valves to correct previously identified deficiencies. Evidence indicates that Shaw Aero Devices valves having part number 1010100B&hyph;A&hyph;1, and having serial numbers 0115 through 0121 (inclusive), 0146 through 0164 (inclusive), and 0180 and higher, incorporate these design improvements. Therefore, the FAA has revised paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule to include these specific valves in the requirements for the 1,000-flight hour leak check interval. These data also indicate that, while some Shaw Aero Devices valves in the part number series 1010100C incorporate the ``ice breaker'' feature and have a configuration that corrects known design deficiencies, other valves in this same series do not incorporate these features. Therefore, not all Shaw Aero Devices part number series 1010100 are included in the 1,000-flight hour interval leak check category. Accordingly, the FAA has revised the final rule to include a new paragraph (a)(3), applicable to certain part number series 1010100C valves (those without the ice breaker feature and other improvements), which provides for a 600-flight hour leak check interval for them. Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of the final rule has been revised to address these valves and provides for a 1,000-flight hour leak check interval for them. [As explained previously, justification for the extended interval under paragraph (b) is that the maintenance program provisions of paragraph (b) should detect any leakage caused by service damage inflicted due to lack of an icebreaker feature or other improvement on the valve.] This is considered interim action, however. The FAA plans further review of the valves in this part number series to determine if these leak check intervals are appropriate, or whether they should be extended or shortened. For these same reasons, the FAA also is reviewing the valves included in the part number 1010100C&hyph;N (and higher dash number) group, which was called out in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2)(ii) of the supplemental NPRM. Currently, this final rule provides for a 1,000-fight hour leak check interval for these valves. However, as more data become available, the FAA may consider further rulemaking to address the leak check interval for this particular valve group. ``Donut'' Valves One commenter contends that ``donut'' valves, which are addressed in proposed paragraph (b)(2)(iii), are unsafe and should be banned immediately. This commenter states that these valves are of design that has resulted in significant leakage and ``blue ice'' incidents. In discussions with airline personnel, this commenter has found that it is commonplace to find these valves leaking, or to find that the ``donuts'' are missing when an aircraft reaches its destination. It is common to have the ``donut'' installed at the start of the day and find it to be missing only one to two flights into the day. This is clearly a dangerous situation. The FAA acknowledges this commenter's remarks. During the past year the FAA has received two additional reports of engine damage caused by ``blue ice'' formation from lavatory drain systems using ``donut'' valves. The FAA is continuing to review this service history of these valves and may consider further rulemaking to require their removal from service.
