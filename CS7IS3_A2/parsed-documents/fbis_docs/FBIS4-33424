Arrogant and an interventionist, the Democratic Party representative from New Jersey, chairman of the Western Hemisphere Affairs subcommittee in the U.S. House of Representatives, menacingly waves the banners of democracy and human rights. His true objective is to make gains to further his career in the U.S. Congress by profiting -- via lobbies that amount to millions -- from other people's misfortunes. The distinguished visitor has a unique history. He has obtained notoriety in the past years from the so-called Torricelli Law that bears his name and which was signed by then President George Bush on 23 October 1992. The amendment prohibits U.S. based firms to conduct business with Cuba through their business subsidiaries in third countries. It also considers penalties for countries that have economic ties with Havana with the illegal extraterritorial implementation of U.S. laws. According to the WALL STREET JOURNAL, Torricelli's old activities were unknown until the funds of Jorge Mas Canosa's National Cuban-American Foundation started to augment Torricelli's bank account. In those days, a publication of the Cuban Studies Center reported: "Everybody in Miami knows that Mas Canosa is the moral author of the Torricelli bill." There is no doubt that Torricelli is clever. His amendment, also known as the "Democracy in Cuba Act," was approved with bipartisan consensus and Bill Clinton, then the Democratic Party presidential candidate, gave it his endorsement. Among his other initiatives, this modern redeemer, who now attempts to supervise the elections in Mexico and to tell the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) what it must do, promotes destabilization actions of "individuals and organizations" against Cuba. He favors an armed strife of the negative kind -- the kind used by the death squads financed by the Pentagon and the CIA and groups organized by the United States, such as the anti-Sandinists in Nicaragua. Two years ago, Wayne Smith, former chief of the U.S. Interest Section in Havana and a man who cannot be accused of being pro-Cuban, wrote in the LOS ANGELES TIMES that the Torricelli Law was "one of the most despicable and injurious legislative proposals" forged in 1992. In the Cuban case, Torricelli took advantage of the circumstances of an electoral year in the United States. Many legislators wanted to be reelected and were afraid they would be accused of being "soft" on communism. In reality, the law shows Washington's double standards: Bush proclaims his Initiative of the Americas and free trade (later ratified by President Clinton) with great fanfare but, due to ideological reasons, Cuba is cut off by Adam Smith's "invisible hand." Robert Torricelli does not play alone. On 20 February 1990, Connie Mack, the Republican Party senator from Florida, announced in Washington the formation of a caucus in both houses of Congress to reinforce hostilities against the island. The so-called "Caucus for Cuba's Freedom" was formed by eight legislators with known anti-Cuban positions, six of the legislators were from Florida, as well as the Heritage Foundation, the National Cuban-American Foundation of Jorge Mas Canosa, and other conservative organizations. Obviously, Torricelli was a part of this monster. When President Bush signed the Torricelli Law in a campaign act in Miami on 23 October 1992, he sanctioned the United States' contempt for the international community, including its main NATO allies and its two NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] partners: Canada and Mexico. The bipartisan consensus showed that it was a strategic bill with covert military objectives and could constitute the preamble to a direct aggression against the island, including an armed intervention "for humanitarian purposes." The international community repudiated the initiative. It meant the United States could illegally exercise its economic power to mar other nations with political objectives, which is explicitly condemned by the United Nations. The initiative also was an attempt to implement U.S. laws and extraterritorially, on third countries.
