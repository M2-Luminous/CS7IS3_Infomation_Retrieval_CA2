The Slovene and Croatian delegations had talks this afternoon and discussed open questions on their bilateral relations. The borders, the Ljubljana bank, and the Krsko nuclear power station are significant problems, and no sensational results should be expected, it was said before the talks. Were any results or progress achieved during the talks? [Unidentified correspondent] Although, judging by the statements [before the talks] by the Croatian and Slovene side, no concrete results were expected at the talks today in Ljubljana -- the general opinion is that the talks, which ended just before the news broadcast, were still an important, qualitative step forward in resolving existing problems in the relations of the two countries. [Valentic] I think that I can agree with Mr. Drnovsek [Slovene premier] that a significant step forward was achieved today in resolving objective existing problems. In my opinion it is primarily important that both governments desire as good and as friendly relations between our two countries as possible. I can say now that I think that the problems are of an objective nature [as heard], they are normal occurrences in processes of disassociation, such as was in the case of our countries. Our states and our economies are complementary to such an extent that there is virtually no reason why we should not resolve all issues in the interest of both states and peoples. We are talking here about 10 or so agreements that we have agreed on to a considerable extent, where we achieved significant steps forward, but with some nuances still unresolved, but I believe that we shall agree on them as well by 7 February in Zagreb. It is important to sign all significant agreements, those in connection with property belonging to Slovene citizens and Slovene companies in Croatia, which we have never called into question, and those referring to the settlement of our debt, which is not a contentious issue. What is contentious are our overall relations when it comes to the Krsko [nuclear power plant], because our interests are absolutely mutual, from the technological point of view to the security of the plant. We have to a considerable extent, almost completely, resolved the issue of a trade treaty, because we have to increase our trade cooperation because it is in the interest of both states. Regardless of the situation in which Croatia has found itself, we have been taking significant steps to revive our economy, hoping that we shall very soon be able to take a step further -- to completely open our borders for trade, as these are principles of an open market. Finally, we have agreed that our state commissions should begin examining borders at once, because we believe that this is something that cannot be postponed. Once again, I would like to express my personal conviction, and that of the Croatian Government, that we wish normalization when it comes not only to these open issues, but we also wish better relations as this is what I really deem as being very important for both states.
