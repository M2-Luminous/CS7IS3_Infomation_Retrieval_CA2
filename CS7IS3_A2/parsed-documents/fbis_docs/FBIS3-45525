This was made public by chairman of the board of directors of the bank, Mr. Wang Qiren, at a meeting of heads of branches of the bank across the country. Mr. Wang gave details of the reform including first, the establishment of an internal management mechanism for capital in renminbi featuring unified regulation and control as well as clear classification of responsibility. The aim is to set up a sound capital management mechanism. Second, the practice of ratio of assets to liabilities and risk management of assets will be carried out within a specific scope of loan volume. Application of capital will be subject to capital source which will also govern the time limit for assets and liabilities, a sound interest rate structure, the bettering of assets, and diversification of risk. An auditing system will be worked out and improved, thereby formulating an effective self-discipline mechanism. Third, policy-oriented finance must be separated from commerce-oriented finance while attention will be paid to the good coordination of business operation in the course of the change in the system as well as when a policy-oriented bank is set up. This is aimed at avoiding any adverse effects on economic development resulting from some operations deviating from the reform process. Economic results and risk must be given serious consideration when policy-oriented credit business is undertaken. Fourth, a certain amount of credit allocated from within the system will be used for the purchase of national treasury bonds and for financial debt held by the policy-oriented bank while at the same time it will also be put into the money market.
