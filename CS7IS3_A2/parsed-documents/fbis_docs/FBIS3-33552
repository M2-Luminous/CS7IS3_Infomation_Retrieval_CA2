So far two people are reported dead and two injured. We shall now hear from Gabriel Abraham Paniagua, president of the political committee of Armed Forces prisoners, who was wounded in his left arm. [Begin recording] [Paniagua] Our people began to arm themselves with pieces of sharp steel. [Flores] What do the inmates want? [Panigua] The problem is that the people up front saw the soldiers fighting so the rest joined in. The other inmates joined in, although they normally do not bother anyone, but they were wounded so they joined in the fight against those from Gotera. They want to kill them because the problem is that if these people are left alive and we are transferred, then they will kill us in the other jail. Do you understand? That is why the inmates do not want to leave these types alive. Regrettably, the National Guard troops only have to knock the doors down. We are a disciplined group who obey prison regulations. You understand? When I get back, if things have calmed down, just as we promised, those who have armed themselves will turn over their pocket knives at the front door. As you can see, we do not bother anyone. We live for our work and our families. We would have preferred some warning because... [pauses] [words indistinct] thefts and stabbings have increased these past few days. Recently, seven inmates were wounded. [end recording] [passage omitted]
