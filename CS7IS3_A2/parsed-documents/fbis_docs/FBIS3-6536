"I suspect the coalition government is already virtually divided," LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told a news conference. "As our President (Yohei) Kono says, the coalition government's role is finished." He said the LDP, ousted from government last summer after 38 years of unbroken rule, will take a get-tough stance against the coalition in order to win back power. Mori said the LDP is setting up a special panel within the party on Friday to probe the premier's receipt of money from a scandal- tainted parcel delivery firm, which Hosokawa called a loan he has since repaid. As a condition for opening Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget, the LDP has demanded that Hosokawa produce proof to support his claim that he returned the 100 million yen he received from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. in 1982. The premier has said he has already released all documents in connection with his loan from the now-defunct company that was at the center of the 1992-1993 money, mob and politics scandal. Earlier Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference that the government hopes Diet discussion on the budget will start as early as possible.
