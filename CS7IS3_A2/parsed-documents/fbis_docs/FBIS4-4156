FBIS4-4156 "drchi083_b_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 United States & Canada Paper Reports U.S. Refuses Asylum to Dissident Wang Jiaqi Paper Reports U.S. Refuses Asylum to Dissident Wang Jiaqi HK2904052494 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 29 Apr 94 p 1 HK2904052494 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [Text] The United States has refused to grant political asylum to the prominent dissident Wang Jiaqi, forcing the British government to bundle him off to London, according to sources in the U.S. in direct contact with the case. After escaping from public security detention in Tangshan in March, Wang secretly travelled to Hong Kong earlier this month. He is believed to have sought political asylum in the U.S. But eager to avoid becoming the exclusive destination for mainland dissidents, Washington has apparently rejected the request. News of Wang's arrival in the territory broke last Saturday while the Hong Kong-funded underground railway that helped him escape was still seeking third countries to accept the former Beijing University student. This prompted the Hong Kong British government to order him to leave the territory in order to avoid political embarrassment with China at a sensitive time in Sino-British relations. It remained unclear last night whether Wang had already arrived in Britain, but London is "his final destination", one source said. British Foreign Office officials said last night they had no information about the case. The source said that if the U.S. government had been willing to grant Wang political asylum, it would have been announced shortly after his arrival in Hong Kong, reportedly on April 15. "The U.S. has been trying hard to get other countries to admit political refugees from China and this is another case," the source said. They want to spread it around." Earlier this year, the U.S. rejected requests for political asylum from four mainland refugees in Taiwan who were eventually resettled in Sweden. There has been no public statement from Wang or the organisations assisting him because "the case is still in process", the source said, adding: "He won't remain silent for long. He has things to say." While the U.S. would have been Wang's preferred destination, he will have to wait for "some time" before he can travel to the U.S. on a visa. "Only then could he re-apply for U.S. political asylum," the source said. Wang, a postgraduate law student at Beijing University and former public security officer, escaped from police detention in Tangshan, Hebei province, on March 27. He is believed to have arrived in Hong Kong on April 15 and been sheltered in a remote part of the territory while negotiations commenced to find a third country to accept him. Wang and a Beijing University law professor, Yuan Hongbing, were detained in Beijing on March 2, apparently for being leading figures behind a petition in support of workers' rights. China's national Public Security Ministry said the two were being held on suspicion of "being involved in unlawful acts inciting turmoil and disrupting social order" as well as other unspecified "criminal acts". The use of Hong Kong as a sanctuary and transit point for mainland dissidents could cause Sino-British relations to deteriorate further. This is not the first time that the territory's underground railway for mainland dissidents -- which became known as "Operation Yellow Bird" after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1989 -- has been derailed by a U.S. refusal to proffer political asylum to refugees who managed to reach Hong Kong. A group of political refugees from Hunan province living in Hong Kong with government knowledge were packed off to London after being discovered in 1992.
