The delegation includes seven senators. While they were in Hanoi, six senators of the delegation met with Vietnamese and foreign press men. Following is the report about this press conference, held in Hanoi on Sunday: At the press conference, all American senators welcomed the Vietnamese Government and people's goodwill in cooperation with the United States side to settle the MIA issue. They called on the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, to lift the economic sanctions against Vietnam and set up diplomatic relations with Vietnam. Senator Bennett Johnston, a Democrat from Louisiana who is chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commission, said: [Begin Johnston recording] It is very clear that the Vietnamese have been cooperative -- most of the way if not all the way -- and the way to reward cooperation is not by punishment. An embargo is punishment -- it is a sanction -- and the punishment ought to stop, and start a new chapter. [end recording] Senator Johnston noted that as Vietnam has been very cooperative in the settlement of the MIA issue, the U.S. Administration should respond to this goodwill. The embargo should be lifted. He added that Washington should close the past and reconcile with Vietnam. It was in the interests of the families whose sons were reported missing during the war in Vietnam. He noted that there was no obstacle for President Clinton to lift the embargo. For his part, Senator Mark Hatfield, a Republican from Oregon, noted that the lifting of the embargo and trading with Vietnam would promote a true sense of the settlement of the MIA issue, which is the most concerned issue of Americans. On impressions of his visit to Vietnam, Senator Bennett Johnston said: [Begin Johnston recording] There is tremendous vitality and energy in this country. That is the first thing you notice -- activity everywhere; entrepreneurship everywhere. It's the kind of thing you saw in China a few years ago, and of course China is now an economic miracle of Asia. I would expect that economic miracle to take place here. The second impression is the friendliness of the Vietnamese people toward us -- toward Americans; toward the United States. You can't hide that sort of thing and you can't fake it. And that came through very clear. [end recording]
