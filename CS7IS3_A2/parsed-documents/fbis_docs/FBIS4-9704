In a note sent yesterday and disseminated today, 24 March, Amorim reiterated his government's willingness to maintain regular contacts with Argentine officials to follow up developments on wheat imports. Amorim added that the Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat is investigating Brazilian wheat purchases from Canada and Germany in terms of GATT provisions concerning "dumping" and subsidies. Amorim described the imports of Argentine wheat as "strategic" for the implementation of the Program for Integration and Cooperation developed by the two countries since 1986. Amorim said that Brazilian mills "were the first to acknowledge that the purchase of Argentine wheat is more advantageous in light of tariff reductions provided under the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the exemption of other duties, and lower freight costs stemming from the fact that Argentina and Brazil are neighbors." Amorim noted that the estimated amount of wheat Brazil will have to import this harvest year to meet domestic needs stands at 5.6 million tonnes.
