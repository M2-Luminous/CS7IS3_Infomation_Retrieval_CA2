According to Mack, the office will also help Chinese companies issue shares in the United States and Europe; help Chinese securities institutions enter the international market; become involved in issuing shares in China's securities markets; offer advice on how to raise money for large industrial and infrastructural projects in China; and seek opportunities for cooperation with Chinese financial institutions.
