[passage omitted] Al-Iryani said that the UN secretary general will establish a special fund to which some member states will contribute to finance the observers whose number is not expected to exceed 150. Al-Iryani added that his government will try to reach a temporary emergency cease-fire for two days as a test of good intentions and to give the International Committee of the Red Cross an opportunity to bring a ship from Djibouti to Aden and to send a land convoy to evacuate the wounded and extend humanitarian and medical assistance. He also said that if the cease-fire continues, the U.S., Russian, and French military attaches in Sanaa will monitor the cease-fire before the international observers are deployed. Al-Iryani said that after the cease-fire has been consolidated, Lakhdar Brahimi will ask the two sides to resume the political dialogue adding that the dialogue may be held either in Jeddah, Cairo, or in Paris, which is Brahimi's headquarters.
