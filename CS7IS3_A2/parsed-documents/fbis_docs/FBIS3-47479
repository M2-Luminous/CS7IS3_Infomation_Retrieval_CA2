Japan will either shoulder 15 percent from 1995, or 13.5 percent in 1995 and raise it to 15 percent by 1997, the sources said. The new rates for the U.N. members' contribution for 1995 through 1997 will be decided at the U.N. General Assembly next fall after a working group on the financial contribution compiles a report by around August, they said. It has already been decided that a new method of calculating the new rates will be adopted, they said. The U.N. members' contribution rates to the world body's budget are revised every three years based on each country's economic indicators such as gross domestic product, per capita national income and foreign debt. The U.N. budget, compiled for two-year periods, stands at 2.58 billion dollars for fiscal 1994 and 1995. Japan's U.N. budget share of 12.45 percent currently ranks second after the United States, which provides 25 percent. The U.N. is in serious financial difficulties because many member countries are in arrears with their contributions and due to expanded peacekeeping activities.
