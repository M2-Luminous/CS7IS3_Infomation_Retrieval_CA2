FBIS3-28027 "dreas023_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 North Korea South's Response to 31 Jan Statement Denounced SK0302002094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1500 GMT 2 Feb 94 SK0302002094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1500 GMT 2 Feb 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, Yi Yong-tok, the South Korean puppet minister of the National Unification Board, on 1 February made groundless, malicious gibberish on the threat to the United States, intimidation against the South, and so forth, pertaining to the 31 January statement of a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman. We cannot but say this is indeed a brigandish sophism completely reversing black and white and is a brazen-faced act, same as a thief yelling, "Stop thief!" As has already been known, the United States has completely reversed [wanjonhi twijibo opko] its promise made to us during the DPRK-U.S. contact and has urged acceptance of the demand for full-scope inspections put forward by International Atomic Energy Agency Secretariat. Moreover, by designating even the time limit, the United States made a final notice-like threat and menace [choehu tongchopchogin wihyopkwa hyoppak], stating that if the demand is not met, the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks will not be held and the road to sanctions will be advanced. The United States and the South Korean puppet clique are scheming to stage by all means large-scale nuclear war exercises, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise, against our Republic, and are accelerating on a full scale the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea. This clearly illustrates that the United States has no intent to resolve peacefully the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, but is pursuing its aim to crush our Republic with strength.
