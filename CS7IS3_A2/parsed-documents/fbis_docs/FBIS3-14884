It is expected that on Monday, the chairman of the Warsaw Military District Court, Colonel Kasparczak, will announce the sentence. The finale will be sad, but not for Anatoliy Lysenko, because even the procurator demanded a minimal punishment -- five years imprisonment, whereas the Criminal Code article on espionage envisages between eight and 15 years imprisonment or capital punishment.

This means that the spying case has burst like a soap-bubble.

Anatoliy Lysenko's health is steadily deteriorating, and the few days that remain until Monday may be tragic for him. Even the court chairman emphasized that. Let us wait and see what happens on Monday....
