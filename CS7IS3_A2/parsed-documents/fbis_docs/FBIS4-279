FBIS4-279 "drafr067_c_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA NP: Fair Elections in Orange Free State Not Possible NP: Fair Elections in Orange Free State Not Possible MB0604162594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1609 GMT 6 Apr 94 MB0604162594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Jonathon Rees] [Text] Welkom April 6 SAPA -- There could be no free and fair elections in the Orange Free State [OFS], the National Party [NP] said on Wednesday [6 April], citing alleged intimidation by supporters of the African National Congress as the reason. The NP further accused the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) of siding with the ANC and not being interested in levelling the political playing field. "They are absolutely useless and their operation access means nothing," said Mr Flip Nel, former NP MP for Welkom and number three on the party's Free State election list. "The ANC is making sure the voice of the NP is not being heard," he said at the end of the first day of an election sweep through the northern Free State goldfields. A complaint would be laid with the IEC on Thursday charging that the ANC was preventing the NP from entering townships to canvass for votes and support, Mr Nel said. An NP campaign truck toured several townships on Wednesday, handing out pamphlets and badges but choosing to skirt the edges of each rather than risk going in too deep. Organisers said this was a security measure as many townships were considered too dangerous, and that too much time spent in them gave the NP's opponents a chance to organise resistance to the party's presence. In Henneman's Phomolong township on Wednesday, groups of children and a few adults ran alongside the NP truck, gathering and destroying party pamphlets as they were distributed. By the time the NP left the area after a 20-minute visit, about 20 adults had gathererd at the township entrance chanting "Viva ANC, down with NP". Similar scenes were witnessed in other black townships, though a more favourable response was seen in Welkom's coloured Bronville township. Mr Nel described international observers travelling with the NP roadshow as "a nuisance" because the NP had to take their safety into account when deciding whether or not to enter a township. Recent weeks have seen a number of incidents of harassment of National Party roadshows in the Free State, particularly on or near the goldfields. The NP last week was granted an interdict stopping ANC supporters from threatening or assaulting NP members in Parys.
