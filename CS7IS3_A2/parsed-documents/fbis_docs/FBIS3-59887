Deputy Premier Valeriy Shmarov also confirmed that Ukraine had already removed 17 of the 46 modern SS-24 missiles it possesses from their silos and had disconnected their nuclear warheads. Each has 10 warheads. Shmarov, the government's point man on nuclear disarmament, told AFP the United States had proposed that Ukraine receive free fuel for its nuclear power stations for the next five years as compensation for giving up the 176 strategic missiles it possesses. "This is a big step by all sides towards reaching a compromise," Shmarov said. He stated that the United States had also proposed that Ukraine's estimated two billion-dollar debt to Russia for energy supplies be erased to compensate for the smaller tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn from Ukrainian territory by May 1992. Shmarov said Russia had agreed to the scheme. Russian officials declined to comment. He said that within 10 days another three SS-24s will have been deactivated as a "goodwill gesture" by Ukraine. Shmarov stated that Kiev may consider the deactivated SS-24s as among the missiles it agreed to get rid of under its qualified ratification of the 1991 START treaty. "We retain the view that the missiles representing the biggest ecological danger must be destroyed first," Shmarov said, referring to 130 older SS-19 long-range missiles. Ukraine signed agreements last year in which it pledged to respect the START treaty, accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and get rid of all the nuclear weapons on its soil. The Ukrainian parliament however ratified START earlier this year with the stipulation that it only applied to 42 percent of the 176 strategic nuclear missiles from the former Soviet arsenal based in the country.
