The area was recaptured by the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] a few days ago. UNITA has been shelling the area from Zairian territory. On the situation in Cabinda FAA's Colonel Manuel Paiva said: [Begin Paiva recording] UNITA has been carrying out offensive movements, particularly in northern Cabinda Province. This has caused certain instability at (Candozinsi) and (Chombo). UNITA troops, coming from Zaire, have been shelling areas and carrying out terrorist actions, ambushes, and attacks on government positions in those areas. In response, our forces expelled the enemy in certain areas, notably Chimbuande and Choco. In brief, we can say that the political and military situation is relatively calm, since our forces were able to put the enemy on the defensive and establish greater tranquility and security in northern Cabinda.
