FBIS4-14993 "drsov066_t_94011" FBIS-SOV-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 BALTIC STATES Estonia Bank Predicts Higher Than Expected Revenues Bank Predicts Higher Than Expected Revenues WS0504152894 Tallinn BNS in English 1316 GMT 5 Apr 94 WS0504152894 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Tallinn, Apr 05, BNS -- The Bank of Estonia predicts that earnings into the state budget for the first half of this year may well exceed the original estimates by as much as 160-180 million kroons. The more-than-predicted income may even exceed 200 million kroons if earnings from the corporate income tax and profits from state-owned companies reach the original estimates, the macroeconomics department at the Estonian central bank says. The central bank says, however, that the total balance depends on the discipline of taxpayers and on the work of the tax department. The report says a higher than predicted earnings level in all sections of the state budget will become a reality only if taxpayers attach equal importance to all their obligations. It cannot be ruled out that money will be lacking in some regions because of big regional differences in the payroll fund. The higher than expected budgetary income is expected to have a big positive effect so that Estonia could be able to start paying higher pensions without the introduction of additional taxes. The government departments directly involved in distributing budget funds have called increasing the pensions at the current tax burden level a too risky step.
