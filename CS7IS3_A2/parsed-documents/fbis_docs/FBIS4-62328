He told TANJUG in Moscow that Duma's move was emotional, and as such was no different from Thursday's proposal of the U.S. Senate to exempt the Bosnian Moslems from the arms embargo for the territory of the Former Yugoslavia. `Both Russian and U.S. parliamentarians were hasty,' the Russian diplomat said, adding that both Duma and the U.S. Senate should have waited for the outcome of the ministerial meeting on Bosnia- Herzegovina currently underway in Geneva which gathers representatives of Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. The diplomat said that both Russia and the United States were civilized countries and that they should act accordingly, that is to consider international law above the national. This practically means that the sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and the arms embargo including the Moslems should remain in force until the U.N. Security Council decides differently. The ministry representative said that Moscow's stand towards the sanctions against Yugoslavia remains unchanged. The sanctions should be lifted totally, depending on the peace settlement in Bosnia, he said. The U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 introduced comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against Yugoslavia due to its alleged involvement in the war in Bosnia among the local Serbs, Moslems and Croats. The Duma on Thursday passed a bill to unilaterally lift the sanctions against Yugoslavia, and the U.S. Senate adopted a resolution which recommends the exemption of Moslems from the arms embargo for the former Yugoslavia, which has been in force since spring 1991. In order to become valid, both documents need to pass two more steps, including obtaining the signatures of presidents of Russia and the United States.
