FR940426-1-00043 FR940426-1-00006 The proposed regulations identify promotional conduct by an industry member that involves the payment of money or another premium to an employee or representative of a trade buyer without the knowledge of the trade buyer as practices under the Act that place retailer independence at risk. The Fedway court noted that previous case law upheld as actionable these types of payments. These payments were viewed as anti-competitive because one competitor gained a competitive advantage over another competitor by reason of a ``secret and corrupt dealing with employees or agents of prospective purchasers.'' See, American Distilling Co. v Wisconsin Liquor Co., 104 F.2d 582 (7th Cir. 1939). Even where such practices exist, ATF would still be required to demonstrate that they affect the trade buyer's purchases in order to establish exclusion. With respect to those practices not mentioned herein, ATF would be required to demonstrate the existence of both of the elements of exclusion set forth above. Criteria for Determining Retailer Independence ATF is proposing criteria by which to evaluate whether or not a particular practice places retailer independence at risk. Elements which have repeatedly been mentioned in court cases are degree of control exercised over trade buyers' purchasing decisions, duration of the practice, indiscriminateness, contractual or other enforceable requirements. The goal of regulating trade practices in the alcoholic beverage industry has been identified as healthy competition in order to insure the best possible price, quality and selection for the consumer and to prevent formation of a corrupt black market. The proposed criteria are indications that a particular practice, other than those in §§6.152, 8.52, and 10.52, places retailer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria specified in order to place retailer independence at risk. (a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a retailer to decide which products to purchase and the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to consumers. (b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product. (c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product. (d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry member's products. (e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the retailer. For example, the industry member controls the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be displayed on the retailer's premises. (f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all retailers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment. Other Proposed Changes In 1988, ATF designated an agency task force to review the trade practice regulations and ATF's enforcement experience, since 1980, and determine whether revisions were needed. ATF determined that certain regulations may need to be modified or clarified to provide guidance to the industry on ATF's interpretations of the trade practice statute. Such guidance has been provided by rulings and industry circulars. This notice proposes incorporating these rulings and industry circulars into the regulations. In addition to changes identified in the Bureau's own review, this notice responds to changes suggested in a February, 1992, petition filed by representatives of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Inc. (DISCUS), the National Association of Beverage Importers, Inc. (NABI), Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, Inc. (WSWA), the National Licensed Beverage Association (NLBA), and the National Liquor Stores Association, Inc. (NLSA). This petition superseded an earlier petition filed by DISCUS and NABI with ATF. ATF requested that DISCUS and NABI work with all segments of the alcohol beverage industry to reach a consensus concerning the various proposals to revise the trade practice regulations. The 1992 petition reflects a culmination of that effort by the supplier, wholesaler, and retailer organizations noted above.
