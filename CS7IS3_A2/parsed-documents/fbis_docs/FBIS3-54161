To this list should be added a large number of political analysts from various countries of the world acting on behalf of many leaders and especially regional statesmen. When the two heads of state appeared in front of the cameras for their news conference, many thought that they would utter explicit and frank words about the future of the peace process the United States has in mind. But neither of them did. Al-Asad, as the leader of a country that sometimes acts hastily, stressed his country's former stances but in new terms, and promised that by next week he would send his foreign minister to Washington for a serious study of views. Meanwhile, Clinton expressed satisfaction over his discussions with the Syrian leader. Reports from Geneva explicitly show that, contrary to their press communique, the two sides held frank discussions; and al-Asad's explicit statement that a partial peace in the Middle East is doomed to fail was an especially overt reference to the Camp David pact and to the Gaza-Jericho accord. Thus, it is clear that Syria envisages its role as going beyond solely speaking for itself, so that the United States and Israel will not discuss the issue of the Golan Height alone. The Syrians realize that if they discuss only the return of the Golan Heights, they can regain just a part of it and they will have to recognize Israel's existence. Thus, they have gathered together the various Palestinian groups and have taken the banner of struggle in their hands so that they can force the Americans to put pressure on Israel to withdraw from Golan. Clinton, who has a trump card in his hands with the Gaza-Jericho accord, is hopeful about his future foreign policy in the Middle East, especially since he has full political accord with political leaders there. The factor that hindered Carter was that he had to cooperate with the extremist Likkudists, who traditionally incline toward the Republicans in the United States, while Clinton is dealing with Laborites. Therefore, the current leaders in Israel trust the Democratic President of the United States. In view of this understanding between the two sides, Clinton hopes that he will be able to create a viable axis for Syria's entry into the Middle East compromise talks. While al-Asad has specifically put forth his country's conditions for participating in these talks, he prefers to continue the Washington talks in order to stabilize and at the same time strengthen his political situation. What can be gleaned from the views expressed by the Syrian, American, and Israeli officials is that if al-Asad is prepared to accept peace, he will get the price he wants--and this is nothing less than the Golan Heights. But the conclusion that Clinton drew from his meeting with al-Asad in Geneva was that the Syrian leader is a shrewd diplomat who is aware of his weak and strong points more than any other person. And probably the young U.S. President has expressed hopes that al-Asad will help him to succeed, hence the Syrian leader's remark that having hope is not a sin for the young, even if he is a president.
