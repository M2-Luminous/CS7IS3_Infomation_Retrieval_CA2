FBIS4-28845 "dreas114_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 South Korea Han Dismisses Threat Han Dismisses Threat SK1406111394 Seoul YONHAP in English 1056 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1406111394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday that North Korea is still subjected to all the obligations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) because there has been no official notification by North Korea to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents Club, Minister Han also said "IAEA inspectors are still in North Korea and they should continue to be there to do their job." Han said that the doors are still open to dialogues, although "the possibility seems much less now than several weeks ago." "We still hope that North Korea would come to talks with South Korea, the IAEA and the United States. At the moment, North Koreans alone can ask that," said Han. "But North Korea should provide due grounds to have such dialogues." On the question of possible military strike against the North being mentioned by U.S. medias, Han said that "nobody is discussing military strikes at this time." Asked about the reports of the imminency of war or military confrontation, Han said, "We are making sure destruction does not take place. We take necessary measures. Despite war talks, there is no reason to worry about the outbreak of hostilities." Han dismissed the North's words of threat, saying "That's just a scare tactics. We cannot base our response on the very irresponsible threat the very irresponsible country is making." Minister Han said, however, that the resolution to be adopted by the U.N. Security Council should be more than symbolic one, adding "stronger resolution is needed" to make the North to comply with the international demands for complete inspection. On the role of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in the nuclear standoff, Han hoped Carter would let the North Koreans know how seriously does the international community regard the situation. "He did not tell me what he would tell the North Koreans. But I think he would tell the North how the world would react to the nuclear issue. I expect him to have very serious discussions with North Korean leaders," he said. The very existence of any nuclear weapons in the North could be a threat in itself because of the possibility of their use and also because it may start proliferation in this region, said Han, adding "it would be a clear danger to us." On the report that China would support the North in the event of war, Han said that he could not give credibility to such report. Stressing that China has been playing a constructive role in the nuclear issue, Han said "Obviously, we do not know what the Chinese attitude will be," adding that he believes it would depend on how the North Koreans would respond to the whole process. Rejecting any attempt to justify the North's possession of nuclear arms as an equalizer, Han said "You cannot disregard the danger of nuclear weapons and the cost of holding on to it will continue to rise." Minister Han also said that his government would continue to honor the denuclearization declaration which he said the North has already violated, adding "We have no intention to give up the declaration."
