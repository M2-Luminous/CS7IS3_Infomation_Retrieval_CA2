Lapresse said that Khmer Rouge [KR] forces delivered logs to Thailand for sale to earn money for use in their fight against the Cambodian Government and they also use Thai territory as a base for their operations. Lt.Col. Somkhuan said such a statement is groundless and affects the image of Thailand. If one considers the issue thoughtfully, it is obvious that the present Thai Government has a clear policy to maintain good relations with Cambodia. One indication is the visit to Cambodia and Phnom Penh by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in January this year. Another indication is that the Thai Government has provided Cambodia with assistance for rehabilitating the country in various fields. These are factors that assure very well the sincerity of Thailand. All this is because the Thai Government wishes to see peace established as soon as poosible in this region and if fighting continues in Cambodia, Thailand will suffer also.
