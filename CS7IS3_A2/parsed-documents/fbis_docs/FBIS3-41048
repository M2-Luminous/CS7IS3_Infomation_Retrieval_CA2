This is the result of the first stage of reductions completed by the Ukrainian Army in accordance with the agreement on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Over this period of time, more than 50 inspectors' groups from countries that are signatories to the treaty visited Ukraine. Since the beginning of 1994, four international inspectors' groups have already been here. They visited the Lvov, Nikolayev, Kiev, and Zhytomyr armor plants, at which 100 tanks and 60 armored combat vehicles will be eliminated in the very near future. Altogether, during this new stage of reductions, more than 600 tanks and more than 300 armored combat vehicles will have to be destroyed.
