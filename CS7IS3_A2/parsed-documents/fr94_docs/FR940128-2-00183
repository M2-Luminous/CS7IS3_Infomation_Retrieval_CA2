FR940128-2-00183 FR940128-2-00118 The grantee shall establish a methodology for collecting, analyzing and distributing information concerning crop planting and harvesting and attendant employment opportunities; shall establish linkages with farmworker organizations and farm labor entities and the agricultural recruitment system within the geographic area to be covered; shall collect and communicate pertinent information on a timely basis; shall develop internal monitoring and evaluation instruments to gauge the effectiveness of the distribution system and the information collected. *Model # 2. The development of a training model that would establish a new approach to retraining farmworkers. A proposal submitted under this model, should involve the structuring of worksite learning (that would include innovative approaches in combining classroom and skill training) which would be effectuated to meet the specific learning needs of farmworkers. This would include the geographic location in which the model would be conducted and the rationale for its selection; the technology and methodology to be employed; a listing of participating employers where worksite learning would occur; an identification of the specific learning needs to be focused upon which may be unique to farmworkers; and a description of how coordination will take place with farmworker organizations within the proposed service area and a listing of those organizations. The grantee shall, after establishing a timeframe for initiating the proposed project, commence operations within the first four months; shall select or develop alternative and innovative approaches to instruction and the uses of teaching techniques and instructional materials, work relevant curricula and motivational resources designed for participants who read at the eighth grade level; shall conduct and provide the Department with an assessment of both current and future local service area labor market needs with concomitant entry-level requirements; shall structure worksite learning (in concert with the participating employers) for participating section 402 eligible farmworkers; shall establish cooperative agreements between selected employers (for worksite learning activities) and service area farmworker program operators and the grantee; shall evaluate, assess and provide the Department with a report concerning the outcomes of the methodology employed through this effort and its effect on the participants. *Model # 3. The development of a training model that would incorporate new methodologies in transitioning farmworkers with limited English-speaking ability and skills into the newly emerging and technically demanding workplace. The applicant should include the geographic area in which this demonstration project will be tested along with the rationale for its selection; the methodology to be employed; a description of the industry(ies) selected with a focus on those aspects which now require higher skilled entry-level workers and the manner in which farmworkers from rural areas with limited English will be trained for these new jobs; a description regarding how the project will coordinate with local organizations serving farmworkers_and how this would benefit the participants. The grantee shall develop a methodology for transitioning participating farmworkers from agricultural employment in rural areas into employment training opportunities where new technology has produced more demanding entry-level jobs and where long-term job opportunities now exist; shall develop linkages with farmworker organizations within and serving the designated project area for the purpose of recruitment, selection and the provision of supportive services to the participants; shall provide rationale for selection of participating industries; shall provide analysis and rationale for selection of training methods to be used and a timeframe projection for success of project; shall provide an approach to easing the transition process for the farmworker participants whose native language is not English.
