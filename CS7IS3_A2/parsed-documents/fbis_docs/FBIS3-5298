The bank's survey of 800 companies produced an index reading of 43.9, up a tiny 0.4 point from January but staying below 50, the dividing line between an improvement or a decline in confidence. Although it was the second month of modest improvement in still-depressed sentiment, the survey shows that the pace toward recovery continues to drag, said the bank, a quasigovernmental institution geared toward smaller firms. Sales fell 4.3 percent last month from a year earlier, widening from the previous February's 2.5 percent year-on-year sales slump, according to the survey, taken in mid-February. More companies continued to say sales prices were falling and to predict another fall in March. As a result, companies reporting worsening profitability and financing continued to predominate. The survey's profitability index, measuring the percentage citing improvement minus that saying things are worsening, was a minus 12.1, slightly better than the minus 12.5 percent of January, with a minus 9.3 forecast for March. The financing index was minus 5.9, slipping from January's minus 5.8, with a March forecast of minus 5.0. Companies continued to report stock and employment excesses. The product inventory index, in which a minus reading indicates a surplus, worsened to minus 13.6 from minus 12.2, with a March forecast of minus 10.0. The employment index improved to minus 4.0 from minus 5.9, with a March forecast of minus 3.9.
