FR940705-2-00239 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(8). A double barrier shall be provided to separate male and female animals unless reproductive studies are part of the experiment or other measures are taken to avoid reproductive transmission. Reproductive incapacitation may be used. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(9). The containment area shall be in accordance with state and Federal laws and animal care requirements. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(10). All animals shall be euthanized at the end of their experimental usefulness and the carcasses decontaminated before disposal in an approved manner. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(11). Personnel shall be required to shower before exiting the BL3&hyph;N area and wearing personal clothing. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(12). Animals of the same or different species, which are not involved in the work being performed, shall not be permitted in the animal area. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(13). Needles and syringes shall be used only for parenteral injection and aspiration of fluids from laboratory animals and diaphragm bottles. Only needle-locking syringes or disposable syringe-needle units (i.e., needle is integral to the syringe) shall be used for the injection or aspiration of fluids containing organisms that contain recombinant DNA. Extreme caution shall be used when handling needles and syringes to avoid autoinoculation and the generation of aerosols during use and disposal. Following use, needles shall not be bent, sheared, replaced in the needle sheath or guard or removed from the syringe. The needles and syringes shall be promptly placed in a puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving, before discard or reuse. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(14). A biosafety manual shall be prepared or adopted. Personnel shall be advised of special hazards and required to read and follow instructions on practices and procedures. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2. Animal Facilities (BL3&hyph;N) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;a. Animals shall be contained within an enclosed structure (animal room or equivalent) to minimize the possibility of theft or unintentional release and avoid arthropod access. The special provision to avoid the entry or escape of arthropods from the animal areas may be waived if the agent in use is not known to be transmitted by arthropods. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b. The interior walls, floors, and ceilings shall be impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat, to facilitate cleaning. Penetrations in these structures and surfaces (e.g., plumbing and utilities) shall be sealed. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;c. Windows in the animal facility shall be closed, sealed, and breakage resistant (e.g., double-pane tempered glass or equivalent). The need to maintain negative pressure should be considered when constructing or renovating the animal facility. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;d. An autoclave, incinerator, or other effective means to decontaminate animals and waste shall be available, preferably within the containment area. If feasible, a double-door autoclave is preferred and should be positioned to allow removal of material from the containment area. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;e. If arthropods are used in the experiment or the agent under study can be transmitted by an arthropod, the interior work area shall be appropriately screened (52 mesh). All perimeter joints and openings shall be sealed, and additional arthropod control mechanisms used to minimize arthropod entry and propagation, including appropriate screening, or the equivalent of access doors. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;f. Access doors to the containment area shall be self-closing. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;g. The animal area shall be separated from all other areas.
