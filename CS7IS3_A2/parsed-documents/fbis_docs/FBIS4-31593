It is the only unit of all the so-called special forces at the beginning of the war which has survived to this day and has good results. All the rest have fallen apart. We do not live on memories like some people. Our performance results are almost the same in 1991 and 1993," says Colonel Miljenko Filipovic, commander of the Zrinski Regiment, a special unit of the Defense Ministry, which celebrated its third anniversary the other day. A resident of Zagreb who was born in Tomislavgrad, a soldier in the Foreign Legion since 1984, his career is typical for legionnaires. On the wall of the Zrinski Regiment Command in Rakitje, there are several certificates of a parachutist, a diver, a commando leader, an instructor in hand-to-hand combat.... He has waged war throughout Africa from Djibouti, Chad, and Zaire to Rwanda as a member of an elite platoon of paratroops in the Legion. Motivated by events in Croatia, after arriving from the field in Africa in late 1990, he decided to leave the Foreign Legion. Although he still had two years of service to go under his contract in the Legion, working out cancellation of the contract through regular procedure was out of the question. [Filipovic] I could no longer wait. At that time, there was a crisis in the Gulf between Iraq and Kuwait and I knew that I would be sent there, and that would have meant at least a year of warfare. Through my brother, I managed to obtain a passport and returned after seven years of being out of Croatia, and I left the Legion once and for all. Fine Lads [Dukic] At the beginning of the homeland war you trained members of the Antiterrorist Unit [ATJ] in Lucko. You passed on to them some of the knowledge and military skills from the Legion? [Filipovic] Yes, I was an instructor in Lucko, but that was the police, and I am a professional soldier. There are big differences between the army and the police, and I was bothered most by the poor organization. To be sure, there were fine lads there, but they were unaccustomed to waging war and to the rigorous discipline that we had in the Legion. You do not become a professional soldier overnight. It takes at least five years for a soldier to go through training, to learn terrains, to learn tactics, to become resourceful, to get a taste of war. It takes more than pluck and bravery to wage war. You need equipment, good weapons, which at that time we did not have, and we were up against a well-equipped aggressor. We got our bearings and acquired weapons however we could. In actuality, the police were smuggling weapons in their own state. It sounds very funny, but at the time that is how it was. The Lucko ATJ was in those early days the unit principally responsible for all actions. Those boys were ready for anything, and as soon as they got a rifle in their hands they thought that they had everything and could do everything. They would say: "Man, what can tanks do to us...," and if tanks had come upon us at that moment they would have run over us all. Now the Croatian Army is slowly coming into its own. There will still be a great deal of work on its structure, but now we have both weapons and materiel, and the situation is no longer what it was in 1990. [Dukic] When you transferred from the Lucko ATJ to the Defense Ministry, you and Colonel General Ante Rosa were given the task of forming the Zrinski Regiment. What did that look like at the beginning? [Filipovic] The regiment was formed on 18 May 1991 by order of Gojko Susak, who at that time was deputy defense minister. On the actual day it was created, we had 27 volunteers who had been picked from among the 300 members of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] at the training center in Kumrovec. They were enrolled through a strict selection procedure and subject to certain criteria, and that meant that they could not be over age 25, they had to have good psychophysical stability and conditioning, they had to be without family obligations, young men ready for anything.... From Battle to Battle [Dukic] After General Rosa left for his new post in the Defense Ministry in the summer of 1991, you took over the place of regimental commander. What were your first actions? [Filipovic] As early as mid-June 1991, we went to our first deployment in Vukovar, where our main task was to help in organizing and training the Vukovar volunteers, and we assisted Gen. Blago Zadra in a successful action to mop up Borovo Naselje. Then came Hrvatska Kostajnica, which we took back with one section of the 1st Guard Brigade. After that, the entire unit went to Gospic, where in a lightning action on 5 September we captured a convoy of armored vehicles of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] with 30 crew members, led by Gen. Krstevski. I received an order from Zagreb to let them all go home, but the "armor" remained in our hands. Then we took the Kaniza military warehouse, which we literally emptied in a single night. That meant a turning point in Gospic. The men were armed, and other garrisons in the vicinity were also falling. Toward the end of October, the regiment went to Metkovic with the task of helping in military operations in the liberation of Slano. In those actions, we took the most important elevation above Slano--Timor hill. In Operation Maslenica, the Zrinski Regiment played one of the more significant roles. Twice we conquered Skabrnja, we liberated the area from Smokovici to Murvica, we broke out onto the main highway, and we also rescued Novigrad from a new breakthrough of the chetnik forces. Had we been 10 minutes later that time, Novigrad would have fallen. We took part in the liberation of Dubrovnik. We were the first to take Golubov Kamen, but we had to withdraw because of poor coordination with our other units. Held Back by Politics [Dukic] So far, you have mainly talked about the more important actions. However, the Zrinski Regiment did much more than that, and some of your members even took part in battles on the territory of Herceg-Bosna. [Filipovic] Yes, toward the end of 1991 we were training soldiers in Tomislavgrad. We took part in the battles on Kupres, which I commanded personally. The regiment liberated three-fourths of Kupres, but in the end it fell nevertheless, through no fault of ours. [Dukic] Whose fault was it that Kupres fell, and how did you come to be a soldier of the Croatian Army in Bosnia and Herzegovina anyway? [Filipovic] I know whose fault it was, but I do not want to talk about that now. Nevertheless, this was the beginning of the war in Herceg-Bosna, the army was not organized, the people were not ready. We had no one to rely on, and we were not able to carry all the burden ourselves. This is where we had our first men killed, and I myself was wounded. After it fell, we remained for a time in Herzegovina, helping to build the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. You see, I was born in Tomislavgrad, and I was fighting in Herceg-Bosna as a volunteer. I cannot leave the graves of my ancestors to anyone. Absolutely not! Incidentally, when war broke out in Croatia, most of the volunteers came from Herzegovina, and they only went back to defend their own. [Dukic] To what extent did political decisions and the signing of cease-fire agreements make the situation more difficult in the field? [Filipovic] I am not interested in changes of policy, because I am above all a professional soldier. I am here to defend my homeland, my people, to respect its will. Few people in the world recognized Croatia in 1990 and 1991. It did not suit anyone for the former Yugoslavia to fall apart, and it is natural that it should have been extremely difficult for our politicians. But it must also be clear that politics was always holding us, the army, back. The Croatian Army is now sufficiently strong and well enough armed to take back all its borders. Let our politicians continue to go on solving everything by peaceful means, but if that is not possible, we are available. A Great Deal of Experience [Dukic] What in your opinion is the key factor in building the Croatian Army? [Filipovic] The Croatian Army will be among the best so long as the command positions are held by those who went through the entire homeland war waging war, who will be able to contribute thanks to their experience. We may also graduate from military schools at the university level and academies, but there is no substitute for practical experience.... The homeland war represents a great deal of experience of life and military experience, an important school. This cannot be learned anywhere, but only in war, out in the field! [Dukic] What lies ahead for the Zrinski Regiment? [Filipovic] In the new structure of the Croatian Army, the Zrinski Regiment will be part of the 1st Croatian Guard Corps, but we will continue to be a combat unit with special importance. The training of our members is being conducted from sunup to sundown. The requirements include conditioning drills, martial arts, parachute jumps, diver training, exercises in military tactics, and the recognition and handling of all types of weapons. There is not a moment's pause in all this. We are constantly learning, drilling, improving ourselves to be as good, strong, and ready as we can to protect Croatia and the Croatian people.
