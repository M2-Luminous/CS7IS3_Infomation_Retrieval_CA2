Angry EU governments fear the British government has decided to bow to the Conservative Euro-sceptics and will kick the problem into touch until after the European Parliament elections in June. The last flickering chance of an agreement now rests on a Greek presidency proposal under which the blocking minority vote in the Council of Ministers would be set at 27 -- as the majority want -- not 23 as the British insist. But countries in a minority with only 23 votes could seek a delay of a few months to try and to reach a compromise -- well short of the British demand for an indefinite delay of such sensitive issues to at least 1996. If the weekend meeting of foreign ministers in the northern Greek town on Yannina breaks up, as so many others have in recent weeks, without an agreement, the other EU governments will seek to ensure that the British government carries the full blame. It is felt that the collapse of the hoped for accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden next January would deal a fearsome blow to the credibility of the European Union just when it was recovering from the Maastricht controversy and the disintegration two years ago of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The most likely result of renewed deadlock at Yannina is that the problem would be referred to the Corfu heads o government summit in June -- after the European elections. However, even if an agreement is then reached by the 12, the European Parliament would not begin to discuss the treaties of accession until the autumn. That would rule out the four newcomers joining as planed in January next year. Some optimists in the Nordic countries hope that the entry date might be put back to July next year, but most fear accession to the EU will have to be delayed until 1996. "Do the British realise what a powerful weapon they have given to the anti-Europeans and do they care?" one Scandinavian diplomat asked yesterday. The language being used even by some governments normally more sympathetic to London about the tactics of the British government was unusually robust. "I can tell you that British relations with the Netherlands will not be the same again after the way in which Mr Major spoke about us and the Belgians in the House of Commons this week," one senior Dutch official said yesterday. Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission said in a French press interview yesterday that a full blooded crisis was preferable to a bad compromise in the dispute about voting rights. "Although I prefer consensus to conflict, I am not scared by the consequences of a crisis, which would be better -- experience proves -- than a bad compromise." Conservative MEP's [members of European Parliament] are pleading with John Major to find a quick compromise to settle the European Union voting crisis and avert what they fear will be an electoral disaster at the Euro-elections in June. After a panic-stricken group meeting in Brussels on Wednesday evening [23 March], they instructed Sir Christopher Prout, their leader, to write to the Prime Minister about the dangers of what they see as his increasingly negative stance.
