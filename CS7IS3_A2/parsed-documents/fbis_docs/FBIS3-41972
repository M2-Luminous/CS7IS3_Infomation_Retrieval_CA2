This is precisely a case of "looking at the tree but losing sight of the forest," a uniquely Japanese way of perception. If we look at the position of North Korea in the world; that is, the "forest" as a whole, a different vision opens before us. Around North Korea, there is the towering presence of the United States with its enormous military power. Russia and China, with their impressive military power, and Japan, with its enormous economic power, are all keeping a close watch over North Korea. Cruisers and frigates of the U.S. Seventh Fleet based in Yokosuka carry a total of more than 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles (with conventional warheads), which have 450-kg warheads with a range of 1,300 km. They can reach the entire North Korean territory any time. If North Korea succeeds in attaching nuclear or chemical warheads to Nodong-1, and decides to use them, it must be ready to sustain total destruction. North Korea has its reasons for developing missiles under such circumstances. Karl Von Clausewitz, in his book "On War," said: "War is merely a continuation of policy implemented by other means." North Korea follows his teaching to the letter. A political objective is always present behind any military action. North Korea's objective is "soft landing"; that is, the continuation of the Kim Il-song regime. It wants the world to guarantee democratization and economic development for North Korea at its own pace. Thus, it is reasonable to think that North Korea actually wants the world to stop it from developing nuclear missiles. It calculates that economic aid will be offered to discourage it from missile development. This tug-of-war is expected to continue. It is true that the Nodong-1 and the development of nuclear weapons pose a serious threat to Japan. However, TMD [theater missile defense] will not help at all to stop this. How far has North Korea gone in its efforts to develop missiles and warheads? The Nodong-1 is an improved version of the very old short range ballistic missile "Scud," which the former USSR started to manufacture in the 1950s. If North Korea had no other choice but to improve on this outdated model, that means it does not have the capability to develop modern missiles. Nuclear Warheads Not Probable Since the Nodong-1 is an improved version of the Scud, its performance is bound by the limitations of the Scud. Inferring from Iraq's "Al Abbas," warheads of Nodong-1, with a range of 1,000 km, are probably around 150 kg in weight. Since the amount of fuel Nodong-1 carries is also increased, at the point liquid fuel undergoes explosive combustion, the fuel tank becomes empty, resulting in the missile losing its balance. It is very difficult to control this. Such is the limitation of Nodong-1's performance. As to warheads, even assuming that North Korea has succeeded in developing a nuclear device, this is probably neither a bomb nor a warhead, but something in the vicinity of a "nuclear explosion device" about three to five tons in weight. Two to four years is required to downsize this. North Korea hopes that it will be stopped during this period. A similar amount of time is necessary to acquire the technology to control chemical warheads or to spread poisonous gas. Thus, both nuclear and chemical warheads are quite improbable. When a conventional warhead weighing 150 kg hits the target, its shrapnel scatters over an area of 120 square meters at most. In terms of cost and effect, the whole exercise is quite meaningless. The U.S. economic system is termed a war economic system. The mainstays of this system, the oil and arms industries, all rely on defense appropriations. The fatal weakness of this economic system is that for the system to function normally, a strategic weapons system, which has limitless possibilities for development, has to be introduced. Since the TMD involves high technology, it embodies limitless potentials for research and development. The U.S. defense research budget is around 5 trillion yen, which is even larger than the entire Japanese defense budget. The TMD has to be viewed in such a context. This is more an economic issue between Japan and the United States than a military question. Japan has to deal with the United States with such a understanding. Japan Lacks a Strategic Viewpoint It is important to stop North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and missiles. The United States and the ROK declare that they will always keep the door open while they apply pressure on North Korea with economic sanctions and military options. The United States also professes that if North Korea compromises it is ready any time to send in big business to work on improving the DPRK infrastructure, and help in economic development. It is also preparing to help North Korea convert its nuclear power plants to light-water reactors. Japan does not possess such a strategic viewpoint. I believe Japan's involvement with the TMD should not go beyond the limits of the Japan-U.S. security setup. This should be the natural conclusion considering the TMD is an economic issue by its very nature.
