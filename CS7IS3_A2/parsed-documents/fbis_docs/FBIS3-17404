He called for political and economic support for the former Soviet republic on the border of Afghanistan, where Russian troops are engaged in regular battles against Tajik fundamentalists who fled to Afghanistan after being forced from power during a confused civil war. "Tajikistan has always been a crossroads," Mr Samadov said. "The West should follow closely what is happening, because all the contradictions and challenges of Central Asia after Communist rule are concentrated there. Unfortunately the world no longer seems to care what is going on in Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands have been killed and the country ruined. Doesn't it matter that this shouldn't spread to the whole region?" Russian-backed secularists, including many former Communists, are now in power in Dushanbe, but political stability is not yet assured. In May a referendum will decide whether the country opts for a presidential system or gives greater power to parliament. Mr Samadov said tension was rising as terrorists and extremists were trying to destabilise the country before the election, with the help of Afghan fighters. He defended the role of Russian troops who, he said, had established firm control over the border. "Russia is a force for stability in all Central Asia. Tajik-Russian relations are good but they could be even better." In January the country became the first former Soviet republic to abandon its shaky currency, the Soviet rouble, and switch to new Russian roubles. Its economy is now wholly under the control of Russia's central bank, and Tajikistan, ruined by three years of bloodshed and anarchy, is once again an outpost of Russian influence. Ironically, the pro-Moscow government now has the full support of Washington and the West, although the authoritarian regime and autocratic tendencies of President Rakhmonov are seen as disturbing. The spread of Muslim fundamentalism, backed by Afghan Mujahidin, is regarded as the greater danger. Baroness Thatcher is among the Western politicians urging strong support for the Dushanbe government backed by Western investment. "Her political influence is big and her words are authoritative," Mr Samadov said appreciatively. Mr Samadov himself knows that only the West, rather than the bankrupt Commonwealth of Independent States, can rescue his economy. After four days in Britain and a quick trip to Germany, he left for America yesterday. In each country he is assuring businessmen that their investments would be protected and that the government is committed to market reform. The voting in May will be observed by delegations from Russia and the United Nations. Dushanbe is now trying to woo back refugees from Afghanistan, having been warned by Washington that the longer they stay in exile the more likely they are to return as guerrillas. But fear still grips the valleys, where killings during the civil war took up to 100,000 lives.
