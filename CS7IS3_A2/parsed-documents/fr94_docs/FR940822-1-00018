FR940822-1-00018 FR940822-1-00005 Sanderson, G.C., S.G. Wood, G.L. Foley and J.D. Brawn. 1992. Toxicity of bismuth shot compared with lead and steel shot in game-farm mallards. Trans. 57th. N. A. Wildl. Nat. Res. Conf., 57:526&hyph;540. In summary, this rule proposes to conditionally approve the use of bismuth-tin shot for waterfowl and coot hunting for the 1994&hyph;95 season. The applicants, who wish to obtain final approval for their shot as nontoxic, would be required to obtain season-by-season approval until they have successfully completed all of the tests in the testing procedures required by 50 CFR, section 20.134. NEPA Consideration Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)), and the Council on Environmental Quality's regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the Service will comply with NEPA prior to implementation of the final rule. Endangered Species Act Considerations Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out .␣.␣. is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat .␣.␣.'' Consequently, the Service will initiate Section 7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act for this proposed rulemaking to legalize, on an interim and conditional basis, the use of bismuth-tin shot for hunting waterfowl and coots during the 1994- 95 seasons. When completed, the results of the Service's consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act may be inspected by the public in, and will be available to the public from, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation or the Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. Copies of these documents are available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption ADDRESSES . Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12866, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the preparation of flexibility analyses for rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which includes small businesses, organizations and/or governmental jurisdictions. However, the Service has determined that this rule will have no effect on small entities since the shot to be approved will merely supplement nontoxic shot already in commerce and available throughout the retail and wholesale distribution systems. No dislocation or other local effects, with regard to hunters and others, are apt to be evidenced. This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. This rule does not contain any information collection efforts requiring approval by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3504. Authorship The primary author of this final rule is Dr. Keith A. Morehouse, Office of Migratory Bird Management. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20 Exports, Hunting, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife.
