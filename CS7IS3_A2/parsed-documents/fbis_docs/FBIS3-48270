The Taiwan-based (Minda) Association, which adminsiters Taiwanese vessels fishing in Vanuatu, called for the review in protest against the Vanuatu's Supreme Court finding a Taiwanese fisherman guilty of breaching Vanuatu fishing laws. In its letter to Vanuatu's Fisheries Department, the (Minda) Association complained that Vanuatu is much stricter than other South Pacific nations in policing its laws. The director of National Surveillance Center, John Toleo, says fishing management in Vanuatu's exclusive economics zone is very important and Vanuatu will continue to police its laws. But Capt. Toleo says he will advice (Minda) that Vanuatu will set up a committee to review and consider amendments of the 1989 Agreement.
