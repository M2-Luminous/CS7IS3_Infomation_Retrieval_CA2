With the guarantee agreement, we have drawn up a solution that allows us to make joint decisions, to govern jointly, and to share responsibility, Imre Szekeres said among other things. [Szombathy] At the coalition talks on 20 June, agreements were reached that were characterized by both sides as progress. What are your views on these coalition agreements? [Szekeres] In my view, the agreement on the governmental structure is a conditional agreement. Some questions on the governmental positions and structure have remained open, and it depends on these questions whether the agreement of 20 June will remain in force. We have achieved agreements on certain points but the final agreement can only be interpreted within the complete package. The open issues will be decided at the meeting on 22 June. We suggest that we agree on the members of the new government, their tasks, and what kind of ministries we will have, and we should also settle the issue of national authorities, bodies, and offices. In my view, the governmental structure and the issue of positions is the less important, organizational side of the whole coalition agreement. The government program itself is much more important and it will be discussed today for the first time. I think it is a mistake that the government program has not been at the forefront of talks up to now. Society is more interested in the government's goals and ideas than in the bargaining mechanism of the partners. Therefore, the essence of the coalition talks will come on the agenda on 22 June, in other words, this is the decisive day in my view. [Szombathy] The full government structure was revealed on 20 June. What else can be open issues? [Szekeres] Although we have only left two or three points open, the whole agreement will only be valid when these are also settled. The fate and operation of the offices dealing with the country's internal security have not yet been clarified. We have not yet decided, either, what role the county-level governments should have in the regional governmental structure, which is another important issue of power sharing. These issues have a serious effect on the agreement on the Interior Ministry's operation. [Szombathy] Observers appreciated the SZDSZ's success in the guarantee agreement and that the MSZP gained positions in the government structure. What is your view on this agreement? [Szekeres] I do not agree with either statements because the observers were not able to look into the process of negotiations. No one has won and no one has been defeated. With the guarantee agreement, we formed a solution on the basis of which we will make joint decisions, govern jointly, and share responsibility. Other models would also have been possible, but we decided on this one. We have lifted the coalition coordination council out of the governmental structure because it does not legally fit into the government's work. Time will tell whether this model of operation is correct. No one has won in the allocation of governmental positions, either, because it is obvious that the various ministries have different effect on the country's life. The distribution of positions is not a purely quantitative, mathematical issue. The SZDSZ has acquired reasonable positions in areas that have significant influence on the country's life. However, the obligation of coordination also applies to the SZDSZ's ministries. [Szombathy] Yesterday, both the SZDSZ and the MSZP were preparing for the talks on 22 June. What did the Socialist delegation agree on? [Szekeres] We reviewed the materials of the special committees and tried to harmonize the differences. I met the MSZP's county chairmen and we drew up the schedule to follow the completion of the coalition agreement. On 24 June, we will look at the coalition agreement at the meeting of the national board of directors, and a proposal will be made on the parliamentary group's leadership. At the 25 June meeting of the national committee, the parliamentary group will also express its preliminary opinion on the agreement. We will choose the parliamentary group's leadership and delegate members to the parliamentary committees at this meeting. We will hold a ratifying congress on 26 June. [Szombathy] Can debates be expected on the coalition agreement? [Szekeres] I expect a clarifying congress, and we will definitely have debates. The only question that we can ask is whether the congress will accept or reject the agreement. In the MSZP and among our electors, many people have been expressing their reservations regarding the coalition agreement. The worries can be dispelled when they learn about the details of the talks. [Szombathy] Your name has also been mentioned as parliamentary group leader for the MSZP. If you are elected, would you resign as executive chairman? [Szekeres] No. If I am nominated to head the parliamentary group then I will occupy both positions until our congress in October. We wish to renew the party's entire leadership in October but, until then, we have to concentrate the parliamentary and party forces and tasks.
