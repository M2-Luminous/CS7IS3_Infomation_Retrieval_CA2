FR941206-2-00084 FR941206-2-00057 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Docket No. AB&hyph;12 (Sub-No. 155X)] Southern Pacific Transportation Company_Abandonment Exemption_San Joaquin and Calaveras Counties, CA Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SPT) has filed a verified notice under 49 CFR Part 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments to abandon the 39.30-mile segment of the Kentucky House Branch between milepost 103.54, at or near the Lodi rail station, and milepost 142.84, at or near the Kentucky House rail station, in San Joaquin and Calaveras Counties, CA. 1 1 By decision in Southern Pacific Transportation Company_Discontinuance of Service Exemption_In San Joaquin and Calaveras Counties, CA, Finance Docket No. 30395 (ICC served Mar. 14, 1984), the Commission exempted SPT's discontinuance of service over that portion of the involved line segment between milepost 111.00, at or near Lockeford, and milepost 142.84, which had been damaged by a land slide and embargoed since June 21, 1983. SPT has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line can be rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in complainant's favor within the last 2 years; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 and 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies), and 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) have been met. As a condition to this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether employees are adequately protected, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. This exemption will be effective January 5, 1995, 2 unless stayed or a statement of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) is filed. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 3 statements of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 4 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29ยง 5 must be filed by December 15, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by December 27, 1994. 6 An original and 10 copies of any such filing must be sent to the Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In addition, one copy must be served on Gary A. Laakso, Southern Pacific Transportation Company, Southern Pacific Building, One Market Plaza, Room 846, San Francisco, CA 94105. 2 The Office of Proceedings did not receive the results of the initial analysis of SPT's environmental report from the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis until November 29, 1994. Because of this delay, the publication date (and all of the dates based thereon appearing in this notice of exemption) had to be adjusted accordingly. 3 The Commission will grant a stay if an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission in its independent investigation) cannot be made before the exemption's effective date. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any request for a stay should be filed as soon as possible so that the Commission may take appropriate action before the exemption's effective date. 4 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 5 The Commission will accept late-filed trail use requests so long as the abandonment has not been consummated and the abandoning railroad is willing to negotiate an agreement. 6 A premature request for a public use condition filed by Pacific Gas and Electric Company on November 21, 1994, will be addressed in a subsequent decision. If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. SPT has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by December 9, 1994. A copy of the EA may be obtained by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA becomes available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: November 30, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29955 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
