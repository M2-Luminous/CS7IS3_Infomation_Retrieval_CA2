The prepared information, signed by acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, points out that 80-90 percent of the total requirement for oil and gas, 80 percent of raw materials for light industry and 70 percent of component parts for the machine-building industry come from CIS countries. Ukraine is also one of the main suppliers of agricultural products, cast iron, steel, etc to markets in the CIS, but the competitiveness of a significant part of the exportable goods is low. The document draws the conclusion that at present "the basis for economic integration is very weak," and because of this it is difficult to foresee an equal coordination of reform processes." However, "in the event of Ukraine not joining the economic union a possibility exists that discriminatory measures on the part of members of the CIS economic union, in the first instance of Russia, will be adopted against it:" a tougher customs regime; a search for and the creation of alternative transportation routes and ports for trade with the West (negotiations are already being held on designing a new gas pipeline through Belarus and Poland, a new port is being designed in St. Petersburg, and the port in Novorossiysk is being enlarged); restricting supplies of weapons to Ukraine, a search for alternative suppliers for traditional Ukrainian goods entering CIS markets; tougher competition with Ukrainian goods in markets of third countries, and a refusal to support Ukraine in international and financial organizations. There is also a "considerable dependency on Russian for storing and processing used nuclear fuel." In the opinion of the authors of the document, total losses in the event of Ukraine not joining the economic union and discriminatory measures being adopted against it are estimated at approximately $4.6 billion annually. The document's conclusion is that, "in this situation the most reasonable and well-considered approach is Ukraine's cooperation with the economic union as an associate member."
