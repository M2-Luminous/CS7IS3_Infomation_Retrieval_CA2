Keri on 10 January; place not given: "Fur Has a Chance To Become Party Chairman"] [Text] In the last week's issue of MAGYAR FORUM, Istvan Csurka strongly attacked the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and one of its spiritual leader, Janos Kis. Among other things, Csurka wrote the following: "With the death of Jozsef Antall, with the fall of the silent partner, the Hungarian political life became unipolar and the boss is now called Janos Kis." According to Csurka, Kis played a decisive role in forcing the national trend and the national radicalism out of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. The present MDF, one that "calms" Kis and his followers, "is small, broken, without principles, far from its original power, namely its Hungarianness, and from taking on the representation of the vital issues of Hungarians; a party that has hidden itself in illusions and frequent substitute actions; a toothless lion" -- Csurka wrote. Ferenc Kulin said last week that the MDF could not envisage any coalition or cooperation with an SZDSZ controlled by Janos Kis. My position regarding Janos Kis and the SZDSZ is totally independent from Istvan Csurka's article -- Ferenc Kulin told our correspondent. From 1989, the SZDSZ has been the anti-pole of the political space in which the MDF is the other determining factor. This distance only increased, instead of decreasing, in the last four years. According to Kulin, this distance became even more clear by the fact that the SZDSZ seems to initiate cooperation with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the other rival of the MDF. Kulin mentioned Janos Kis because it is Kis who has been formulating and dictating the political strategy of the SZDSZ from the very beginning. Kulin added that if anyone had any doubts about this, these doubts would be dissipated by Janos Kis's article published in the Christman issue of MAGYAR HIRLAP. "This is the simple explanation to the question of whether there is a chance of MDF-SZDSZ cooperation. I can say that there is no such chance" -- Kulin declared. According to Ferenc Kulin, the fact that there are no chances whatsoever of any contact or cooperation between the two parties can be explained with pragmatic causes. Kulin pointed out that the MDF is a center party that is polished and formed in the daily political practice, a party that learns from every conflict and corrects them; Janos Kis's SZDSZ is a party "created at a desk, a party adjusting itself to doctrines and following a strategy." Therefore, it is questionable politically whether these two markedly different political forces can get closer to each other -- Kulin pointed out. In connection with Csurka's writing, Ferenc Kulin said that he did not agree with a single sentence of the essay published in MAGYAR FORUM. His judgment differs from his opinions on previous Csurka-writings because, in the past, he could accept a lot of elements of Csurka's diagnoses. However, this latest writing is the spiritual flight of a man who lost his sense of political reality -- Kulin said. He added that Csurka's words on his role and "danger" are among statements that no longer contain anything surprising and, therefore, they need no defense. Kulin also finds it unfortunate that the "objectionable attack" on Jozsef Antall's activity definitely discredited everything that Csurka ever did in Hungarian politics. In connection with the future, Kulin pointed out that he agreed with Sandor Lezsak, who declared that the corridors that were still open between the MDF and the Hungarian Way Circles closed definitely in the wake of Csurka's attitude following Jozsef Antall's death. These contradictions will only become stronger in the election campaign. Speaking about the election prospects of the MDF, Kulin said that he was even more optimistic than Lajos Fur, who predicted 20 percent of votes for the MDF. "We still have all the chances to achieve a decisive victory in the individual electoral districts" -- Kulin said. In conclusion, Kulin pointed out that he would not accept even the nomination for the position of party chairman at the national conference to be held in February. He did not know how many people were running for this position, but he said that Lajos Fur had a good chance to win the position.
