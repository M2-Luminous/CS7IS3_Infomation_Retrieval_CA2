"There are no violations of human rights of the sort which was alleged to", the Latvian president stressed at the briefing devoted to a regular meeting of the Council of National Security of the republic. The results of the meeting of the U.S. and Russian presidents and the Partnership for Peace program in the NATO framework were discussed at the meeting. "I cannot believe that the two superpowers have finally decided the fate of small countries" said G. Ulmanis answering the questions about the attitude to the references of B. Clinton and B. Yeltsin to the Baltic states, in particular to the dependence of the schedule of withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia on the solution of the human rights problem. The president thinks that "a law on citizenship must be passed as soon as possible in Latvia which would exclude any speculations on the subject of human rights". Ulmanis said that he was expecting information from the Russian and American sides on the final deadline of withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia and on the conditions of keeping a Russian radar station on the territory of Latvia. In the nearest future, said Ulmanis, Latvia will send a letter to the NATO leadership with agreement to participate in the Partnership for Progress [as received] in accordance with a decision taken at the Council of National Security meeting. The president emphasized that in view of joining the Partnership for Progress, where Russia will also participate, Latvia must "carefully review its relations with Russia". G. Ulmanis also said that the Latvia's joining of NATO is "a remote prospect".
