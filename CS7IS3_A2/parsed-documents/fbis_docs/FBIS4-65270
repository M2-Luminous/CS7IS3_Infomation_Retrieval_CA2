He was welcomed by Alexis Galanos, acting president and House of Representatives president; Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis; and Deputy Minister to the President Pandlis Kouros. [passage omitted] The president rejected the view that the British and the Americans are mocking the Cypriot people with their continuous interventions to delay the UN Secretary General's report from being submitted and explained the reason why. [Kliridhis] It is a fact that both the United States and Britain believed that there was still a possibility that Mr. Rauf Denktas would accept the Secretary General's document on the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Their policy was that we should not hurry, since there were some indications -- not from Mr. Denktas, but from Mrs. Tansu Ciller -- that there was still room to negotiate. Therefore, let us not talk about mockery; this was the situation as they saw it. The question was clarified during the Vienna meeting. [Menelaou] President Kliridhis also referred to the role that Russia can play in the Cyprus issue. [Kliridhis] It can play a serious role. It appears that there are new developments in Russian foreign policy. While for some time Russia was prepared merely to follow the policy of others, it has returned to the forefront and wants to show that it has its own policy. This is a new development that we are very interested in seeing.
