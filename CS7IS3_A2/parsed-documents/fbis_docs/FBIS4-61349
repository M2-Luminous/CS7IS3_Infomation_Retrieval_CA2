"The military tendency is now looming quite distinctly due to irresponsible activities of Serbian commandos, but, let us hope, they won't go so far as to realise their plans," said Kozyrev. In his words, the Security Council is busy reviewing all the apsects of likely military measures on the part of NATO. "We have succeeded in preventing nato from having a free hand in any such action, it is the Security Council which is now to follow it very intently". Kozyrev expressed the hope that the Serbs will continue performing their obligations before the UN and, correspondingly, the UN will not be confronted with the need to decide on NATO strikes. "But all will depend on the Bosnian Serbs' conduct," stressed Kozyrev, noting that, despite the possibility of military measures, the right decision should be sought on the political plane. The minister reported that he was in touch with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and received from him today an answer to his message, in which Milosevic expresses the desire to sustain constructive cooperation with Russia, he showed understanding of the Russian position. In the words of Kozyrev, he was going in the next two-three days to meet French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and, perhaps, foreign ministers of a number of other Western states to discuss the same problems. "The next two-three days will see intensive diplomatic arrangements, which, as I think, should open a way toward the closing stage--a summit for rounding off all this tragic episode," said Kozyrev.
