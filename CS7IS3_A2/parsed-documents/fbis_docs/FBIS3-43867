The pardon was granted shortly after the supreme court dismissed an appeal by the two men, one of whom was a senior intelligence officer. Zimbabwe's leading human rights organization said the pardon suggested that the shooting in which Mr. Kumbai was badly wounded had been authorized at a high level. It said there would also be grave implications for the relationship between the government and judiciary. Mr. Mugabe has not explained his decision.
