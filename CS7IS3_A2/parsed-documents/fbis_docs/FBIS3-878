What I can say right away -- with the permission of the head of state -- is that exceptional ailments call for exceptional remedies. The government is prepared to handsomely reward anyone who helps it to uncover where these arms and ammunition are being hidden. A 2.5-million-CFA-franc award is promised to any person who helps us retrieve these arms and ammunition. This is not an undemocratic deviation or aberration. It is done in countries all over the world. So we are not inventing something or doing anything abnormal. Where the safety of our peaceloving citizenry is threatened, the government must do all it can to reassure them. This is exactly what we mean to do now.
