"This is nothing more than a pre-election political game," he stressed. But the essence of this "game" is as follows. Parliament did not recognize the powers of people's deputy of Vladimir Grinev, co-chairman of the interregional reforms bloc. Straightaway some of the media reported that the former deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet, entering into an alliance with Leonid Kuchma, had allegedly stated: "If Leonid Kuchma is elected president, he will dissolve this parliament." "The Supreme Soviet doesn't have to be dissolved, but re-elected. Otherwise we will not be able to adopt a new constitution and solve many other vitally important problems," the presidential candidate stressed.
