[Hwang Kwang-chol] Approximately 1,200 were working in the coal mine. My life at the coal mine can be characterized by hard labor and poverty. We were supposed to work three eight-hour shifts. However, in reality, we often did hard labor for 12 to 13 hours a day. All we did was pick coal. Members of a family are assigned to different pits so that they cannot meet during work. They also work different shifts. Therefore, they cannot see each other often even at home. We were supplied with a pair of working clothes a year. Therefore, I had to wear my brother's when mine was being washed. Most coal miners cannot bring meals to work. [SEOUL SINMUN] Then, the efficiency of coal mining must not be good, is it not? [Hwang Kwang-chol] Kungsim Coal Mine miners worked in inclined shafts 2,400 meters below the surface. Pit props were installed every two meters even though they must be installed every 70 cm because there are not enough pit props. As a result, accidents were common. Electricity was 170 volts and not 220 volts because of electric power shortages. As a result, machines operated at one-third of their capacity. Work efficiency plummeted, and a coal miner dug a mere one to 1.2 tonnes a day, less than his daily assigned goal of 3.5 tonnes. When a shaft collapsed in 1991, four coal miners were killed and tens of others injured. I lost the use of the small finger of my left hand after a blind end collapsed in June 1992. When I was working as a blaster, a faulty detonator exploded, and shards hit my right eye. Fortunately, I did not lose my eyesight. [passage omitted] [SEOUL SINMUN] How serious were food shortages? [Hwang Kwang-chol] No food rations had been given for two months before I fled North Korea. Even before that, they had given us a mere 650 grams a day, after taking out conservation rice or patriotic rice (they were sarcastically called coercion rice) from our daily ration of 900 grams. Therefore, we had to pick wormwood in the fields or go out to catch field mice in the fall. [Hwang Kwang-il] I suffered much starvation in North Korea. Therefore, while living in China for 11 months after fleeing North Korea, I gained 7 cm and 11 kg. Back in North Korea I usually gained 5 cm and 3-4 kg a year. It was common to skip three to four meals in a row. As a result, 40 to 50 percent of children suffered from rickets before entering the people's school. [passage omitted] [SEOUL SINMUN] There were rumors that food riots erupted in areas close to the border with China. [Hwang Kwang-chol] People in these areas know very well that Koreans in China are leading abundant lives. Therefore, when food supply is bad, there are often protests and outcries. Nevertheless, Public Security Ministry agents carefully contain such incidents because they are afraid that if they recklessly suppress such disturbances, riots may erupt. [SEOUL SINMUN] How about other daily necessities? [Hwang Kwang-chol] Only water is abundant. Still, it is difficult to get water during rainy seasons because of floating cow dung. People brush their teeth with salt because there is no tooth paste. There is no toilet paper or paper, so people use corn leaves in toilets. I know the supply of soybean paste and soy sauce stopped since 1984. [passage omitted]
