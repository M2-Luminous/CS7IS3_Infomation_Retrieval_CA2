The reasons given vary greatly: From the negative stance of certain State Duma deputies to foreign policy reasons -- the recent bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions by NATO aircraft. The latter reason is clearly the most important, after all, what were the Russian and U.S. servicemen intending to rehearse at the Totskiy military training area. The joint bombing of Serbs? But since the diplomats are not agreed on our countries' approaches to peacemaking in Bosnia, the military have nothing to coordinate at the exercises. Although, in fact, there was nothing sinister about the "deceased" Russian-American exercises: No more than 250 servicemen were to have participated on either side. Servicemen from the 27th Motorized Rifle Division were to have been Russia's representatives (the division is registered in that capacity at the United Nations and is actually billeted in Totsk). The units of the Russian peacemaking forces in the Dniester region, North Ossetia, and so on are formed from this division's units. The plan was for servicemen from the U.S. 3d Infantry Division to represent the U.S. Army at the exercises (it is stationed in West Germany and is the backbone of the U.S. peacemaking force in Europe). There would not have been any armored formations at the exercises since the main purpose of them was to elaborate common approaches to the planning and conduct of peacemaking actions connected with operations to maintain peace in trouble spots. The only military hardware the Americans were planning to take to Russia was 50 jeeps and 10 or so trucks to transport people and baggage. The actual command staff exercises were intended to be held 6-14 July 1994 at the Totsk training area, the very place where tests of the first Soviet atom bomb were carried out in 1953. Do U.S. defenders of the environment know about this? After all, the dashing U.S. soldiers nearly marched onto radioactive soil. Is it not a danger to their priceless health? I won't ask about the danger to Russian servicemen's health -- a futile question. But let us get back to our exercises. Apparently, these maneuvers will indeed not take place in Russia in the immediate future, despite the fact that the Americans had been through all the details of their stay in Totsk. The latest visit by the U.S. delegation led by U.S. Colonel Deyton Kit [name as transliterated] was 18-22 April 1994. The Americans were intending to bring everything with them (perhaps including drinking water and toilet paper). For the hire of barracks and Russian equipment and communications facilities the U.S. side was expecting to pay the Russian Defense Ministry $2 million! But, alas, we will not be seeing any of this money now, it will stay in the United States. In fact, initially the intention was to conduct the joint exercises in the United States, but, obviously, the Russian side could not find the $2 million to transport baggage and personnel. Then the Russian side suggested Duisburg (Germany) as the venue for the joint exercises. But the German leadership was not enthusiastic about Moscow's initiative, so the interested sides decided on Totsk as the venue for the joint exercises, since this would cost the Russian side practically nothing in hard currency. But, as it happens, the price was a quiet scandal in parliament, demands from the stubborn opposition, and, as a result, no joint exercises on Russian territory. It is not worth the trouble, as they say. [passage omitted]
