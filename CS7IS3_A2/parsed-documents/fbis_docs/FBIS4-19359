Norway already has a field hospital and helicopter wing stationed in Tuzla as part of the joint Nordic force in the region. The Norwegian parliament must formally decide the matter, although no date has been set yet. But it will take at least several months before the troops are on site, a Defense Ministry official said. "We hope that the force can be assembled as quickly as possible. Beyond that, it is impossible to provide a timeframe for when the force will be on site," Norwegian Deputy Defense Minister Sigve Brekke said. The Defense Department does not consider it a major risk to send new forces to Tuzla. "There is no immediate danger to the safety of the Norwegian contingent. That the Serbs are harassing the UN personnel cannot prevent us from taking responsibility through participation," Defense Minister Joergen Kosmo said. "Unless something unexpected happens, the Norwegians are pretty safe," Kosmo added. Norway also intends to reduce the size of its peacekeeping contigent in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], where U.S. forces will be taking over, Defense Ministry spokesman Chris Tredesen said. There are currently 227 Norwegian soldiers in Macedonia as part of the joint Nordic battalion.
