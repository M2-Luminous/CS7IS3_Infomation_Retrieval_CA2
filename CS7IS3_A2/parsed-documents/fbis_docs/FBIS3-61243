It is well known that any transformations do not come easily. But it is even more difficult given the significant influence of subjective factors. And it is a pity if the paths of social changes are not chosen entirely correctly and the existing opportunities are used irrationally. However, even in the most difficult times, it is not necessary to lose faith and reference points--so thinks Dmytro Pavlychko, the chairman of the commission of the Ukrainian parliament for foreign affairs, with whom our correspondent met--but it is necessary to search for mechanisms of resolution for both foreign and domestic problems. [Petriv] Dmitriy Vasilyevich, first of all, let us dwell on the relations of Ukraine and Russia--after all, clouds have gathered over them in the course of recent years, and they have not yet dispersed. Every time the leaders and the ministers of foreign affairs of the two states meet, it seems that finally common sense will prevail, and that a compromise will be found. But everything remains as it was: Russia "presses," and Ukraine distrusts its northern ambitious neighbor more and more.... [Pavlychko] At one moment these clouds get thicker and at another they scatter. But it is a pity: They are not disappearing, and we should not expect that there will be a sunny day soon. However, I believe: Everything is in motion; therefore, normal relations will be established between Ukraine and Russia. For example, the Odessa negotiations of A. Zlenko and A. Kozyrev were very positive. At this consultative meeting, the parties explained that about which they are guessing, but which they are not formulating clearly. The Russian side, for example, was always emphasizing: The Black Sea Fleet is an integral structure. But today, as it turned out, it can perceive the idea of a divisible fleet, and that it is necessary just to find the mechanism for this division. And this is understandable, for all previous agreements, as in part the last one, the Massandra agreement, are unacceptable to both countries. Although the Russian leadership is further insisting that it is necessary to rely precisely on it. But when it comes to the fact that Russia would have to pay more than $15 billion for half the Black Sea Fleet, the Russian representatives throw up their hands. It is necessary to note that misunderstandings keep coming up relative to the nuclear legacy as well. Russia does not in any way want to recognize Ukraine as the owner of nuclear weapons. [Petriv] After the ratification of the START-1 treaty, Moscow accused our state of violating agreements. Russian diplomats headed a campaign of bringing pressure on Ukraine. A. Zlenko, the head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department, was also compelled even to declare that there is not a particle of truth in Russia's accusations.... [Pavlychko] Ukraine has already given up tactical nuclear weapons and did not receive any kind of compensation for them. Therefore, we cannot once again agree to the same thing. We also think that now the nuclear weapons deployed on our territory play a definite deterrent role. And therefore, we insist that joining the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons be carried over into the future. And, at the same time, we are going toward a nuclear-free status. But this road can be determined only by us, and no one should dictate his own will to us. We should transform the nuclear weapons on our territory into political guarantees of independence. For as a people and as a nation, we are under a threat. [Petriv] Could not the quick signing of an interstate treaty at least somehow stabilize Ukrainian-Russian relations? [Pavlychko] Such a document is already half prepared. Work is continuing on points that deal with border questions. In our view, the existing borders between Ukraine and Russia should be guaranteed with this treaty. And it is again strange: The Russian side is trying to get by in this case with some general phrases, but we are proposing the exact wording that was recorded in the Ukrainian-Russian treaty of 1990. Unfortunately, this also indicates that the Russian side intends in the future to return to the territorial issue. [Petriv] The question arises: Why does Ukraine not come out more actively for military cooperation with Western countries, and first of all with its neighbors--Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic? [Pavlychko] Russia is trying in every possible way to restore the empire: At one time by means of the CIS structure, and at another, by means of an economic union. In my opinion, I think that it is necessary at any price to develop the closest ties with our close neighbors. If we will be able to arrange political, cultural, and economic contacts with them, then this will gradually free us from an excessive Eastern orientation. After all, the newest technologies and social democracy can come to us from Europe. However, our strategic path, after uniting with our Western neighbors, is not to create an anti-Russian alliance, but, on the contrary, to establish good relations with Western Europe in the Russian Eurasian space through a Black Sea-Baltic system. Through a unique Europeanization of Ukraine, Russia would be closer to Europe. Let us recall history. Europe and Russia have always adjoined on Ukrainian land, and here European civilization was victorious at one time and Russo-Mongolian at another time. And, therefore, it is necessary that these two planes not destroy each other, but harmonize. We must compel the silence of the Moscow imperialists. And it is necessary to do this not only with the help of a compromising policy, but also through a firm will. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize: If Russia is democratic, Europe will be calm, and if it strives to dominate, this will serve as a reason for fear among the new independent states and a pull toward NATO. [Petriv] Dmitriy Vasilyevich, the election campaign for seats in the new parliament is now proceeding at full speed. Is this not the reason why the work of your commission has abated? [Pavlychko] Actually, we are not working as intensively as formerly. It must be said that over these years the activity of the commission has been quite intense. Although its staff is rather polarized, and it is very difficult to work. It frequently could not reach an agreement. At the same time, in critical moments, such as, for example, a decision of the Russian parliament regarding Sevastopol, it was able to come together. And therefore, I want to note that the commission did a lot in its field. [Petriv] In your opinion, what will the new Supreme Council of Ukraine be like? [Pavlychko] The first trouble with the old parliament is that it was not structured. And now the parties have still not grown numerically. The fact that the Supreme Council did not go for a mixed system, but voted for a majority system, reflects the position of the parliamentary majority and, in particular, of those who want to speak in their own name, for they are brilliant individualities. In their opinion, people will vote for them. Therefore, I fear most of all that we will once again represent ourselves in the new parliament, when every deputy will represent only his personal program, and not a specific political force. Then we will again pull each other by the forelock ad infinitum, instead of parliamentary groups gathering and deciding what should be done. [Petriv] In this case, neither the president nor the chairman of the Supreme Council insisted on a mixed electoral system.... [Pavlychko] Leonid Kravchuk and Ivan Plyushch, as well as the representatives of the president in the localities, remain indifferent to political parties. But our leaders do not want to think of themselves within the framework of any kind of party. We say that now there is a so-called party of power. Then let these people gather and say that we are organizing into some kind of structure, and there is no clarity, but there is vacillation. Ukraine is going into the elections when the voters are in absolute perplexity. However, despite all of this, I believe that the next Supreme Council will be better. [Petriv] Will the democratic forces, given the disunity of ideas and leaders, unite in one centrist-reformation bloc that would not let either the extreme left wing or the extreme right wing win a majority in parliament? [Pavlychko] I think that if we do not go into the elections as a united democratic bloc, then we will lose. And it is important not only for the parties to unite, but also for individuals. Going into the elections, we understand that it is necessary for the democrats to establish some kind of coordination council so that we would not fight each other, because, for example, the situation will be entirely different in Western Ukraine than in the East. Is a variant possible where democratic forces will come out in the elections as a unified political force, and afterwards structure themselves in parliament? It is better if we unite in a single political party. And it is necessary to conduct a congress even before the elections. Then we would easily be able to win seats in parliament and be victorious in it. [Petriv] Dmitriy Vasilyevich, have you already decided to put forward your candidacy for the new parliament? Since it is rumored that allegedly you will head the Ukrainian diplomatic mission to one of the countries of the West.... [Pavlychko] I will not go as ambassador to any country. For I would not feel very good. The people are in trouble, and if I agreed to a position that, possibly, I have even earned, then I would look like a deserter. Therefore, I decided to go into the parliament. [Petriv] Are you prepared to put forward your candidacy for the post of president of Ukraine in June 1994, if the elections are held? [Pavlychko] It is necessary to consider the situation realistically. I am convinced that the leader of the state must not yet be very old, he must possess economic knowledge, and he must have a number of good qualities. I am already 65; therefore, I am convinced it is too late to talk about this. I think that the elections will be held. Because Leonid Makarovych, probably, will not do what was done by the Russian leader who at first announced the elections, but afterwards went back on his word.
