The program has been developed by workers of the Institute of State and Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Boris Yeltsin has also sanctioned the main directions of this research. They include six sections, of which the priority one is the development of the legal system of the Russian Federation after the adoption of the new constitution. In particular, an idea has been advanced concerning the setting up of a unified humanitarian space over the territory of the former Soviet Union, which will guarantee protection of the rights of the Russophone population in the former Soviet republics and will help settle the issue of forced emigration.
