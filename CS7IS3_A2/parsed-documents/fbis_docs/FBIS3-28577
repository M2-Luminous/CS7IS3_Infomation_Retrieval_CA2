The decision by the largest party in the ruling coalition paves the way for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to announce a fresh tax reform plan, ending a nearly weeklong dispute over a new indirect tax that almost caused the breakup of his six-month coalition cabinet. Five coalition leaders resumed talks at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday in a bid to settle the tax dispute. Hosokawa vowed late Monday night to settle the rift in the governing coalition over funding details for the tax cut. On Monday, representatives of the coalition parties agreed to implement the 6 trillion yen tax cut independently and establish a consultative body among coalition parties to decide funding details within a year, coalition officials said. Coalition leaders agreed to scrap Hosokawa's original plan to replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax" in April 1997. Officials said the Hosokawa cabinet will unveil the economic stimulus package Tuesday evening after settling the tax dispute. The five coalition leaders who resumed the talks were Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, Democratic Socialist Party Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa, and Hiroyuki Sonoda, who represents an alliance of Hosokawa's Japan New Party and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger). At an early morning news conference on February 3, Hosokawa announced the 6 trillion yen tax cut retroactive to January 1 and also proposed imposing the 7 percent welfare tax to offset resultant revenue shortfalls. But the plan drew strong criticism from the SDP, which threatened to quit the coalition unless the new tax was dropped.
