As you can see on the map, here is Beirut, here is Damascus, here is the Damascus-Beirut highway and Zahlah, (Rayyaq), and Qasr Naba to the north of it. This mountain range is called Mount Lebanon. Its altitude is the same as Mount Hermon, and it has steep cliffs at the bottom of which lie a number of villages. The force brought Mustafa al-Dirani, the leader of the Believers Resistance, on whose deeds Chief of Intelligence Uri Sagi will later elaborate, back from there. The operation was conducted on very rough and steep terrain. The village is located at the bottom of a cliff, and the area is difficult for vehicles of any kind to traverse and for aircraft to land. The unit achieved absolute surprise, and within a few minutes, the operation in the building itself was over. A considerable number of weapons were found in the building, including a loaded gun at Mustafa al-Dirani's bedside, which he had no time to use, just as others had no such opportunity as a result of the element of surprise. Numerous documents of all kinds -- not just written ones -- were found. The unit, which was instructed to avoid hurting any other members of the family or other civilians in the village to the extent possible, even if they opened fire, succeeded in fulfilling this mission. During the operation and while the unit was making its retreat, fire was opened from the adjacent apartment, inhabited by al-Dirani's brother. The fact that the village was awakened by the operation called for certain changes in the unit's exit from the village. They made their exit while shooting for the most part without taking aim. One of the officers was slightly injured in the thigh, apparently by a bullet or shrapnel. During the evacuation flight, a few rounds of antiaircraft fire may have been directed at the helicopters or at the roar of the helicopters near the Lebanese coast, north of Beirut. The objectives of the operation were fully attained. Al-Dirani is in our hands, and we believe his interrogation will contribute to shedding light on the situation with regard to Ron Arad's whereabouts and perhaps to understanding what must be done to deal with Ron Arad's case in the future. No human lives were lost. The operation and its outcome contribute to some extent to the IDF's deterrent power and are an expression of our moral debt to Ron and to the principle of the IDF's modus operandi, whereby everything that can be done to bring back every POW and ascertain the fate of every MIA will be done, even at the expense of risky operations. The operation was planned for many weeks, in fact months, and it relied on operational and intelligence abilities -- not just in the field -- which we have accumulated over the years. It was executed with the highest level of professional acumen and precision and while adapting to what materialized in the field. In such operations, a thin thread separates success from failure and its cost. I am glad that it ended the way it did. I can only express my appreciation to the executing unit, a very select IDF unit; to the Air Force squadrons, particularly the Saar gunship helicopter squadrons, the cargo and other aircraft; to the intelligence community: to the Intelligence Branch and to its chief, Uri Sagi, whose unique contribution to this operation and its outcome goes beyond the formal duties of a chief of intelligence; and, of course, to the decisionmakers: to the inner cabinet, which decided on the operation based on our recommendation, and first and foremost to the prime minister and defense minister, who supported the planning of the operation and backed it all the way through. I will now leave the floor to Uri. Later, if you want to pose some questions, we will be willing to answer a few of them. [Sagi] Mustafa al-Dirani is the head of the Believers Resistance, a splinter group of the Amal organization. He headed Amal's terrorist apparatus until 1988 and, as part of his duties, was responsible for a large number of attacks on IDF soldiers, from the time of the Peace for Galilee Operation and until he retired from Amal in 1988. He is the founder of the Believers Resistance, an independent faction which has now merged with Hizballah. While it was an independent body, however, it carried out numerous attacks against IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] soldiers in south Lebanon. His involvement in holding Ron Arad hostage has long been known, at least to the intelligence community. We possess reliable information -- which applied prior to the operation and has been largely confirmed with al-Dirani's transfer to Israel -- to the effect that Ron Arad was taken prisoner and held by Mustafa al-Dirani for a period of over two years and that he even conducted negotiations about him which may give us a lead as to the future and perhaps even the fate of Ron Arad. Undoubtedly, the investigation is at its height. Both the investigation and the findings brought back by the unit will apparently provide us with some answers -- I hope soon -- to questions we could not answer prior to the operation. As said, the operation did not lead to any exceptional reactions that were not foreseen or predicted. Like the chief of staff, I can also tell you that no civilians or other people who were not meant to be hurt or be brought to Israeli territory were hurt. The repercussions of the operation will yet be examined, but there is no doubt that the fact that Mustafa al-Dirani is here may shed a great deal of light on the main question: Will we have more detailed intelligence about Ron Arad's fate? [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1's Alon Ben-David] Mr. Chief of Staff, the prime minister said a few minutes ago that al-Dirani's abduction was not meant to provide us with a bargaining chip for Ron Arad's release. Before we set out on this operation, did we have any information to the effect that this abduction will bring Ron Arad's return to Israel somewhat closer? [Baraq] In my opinion, the main thing to be obtained is a better understanding on our part -- as a result of what will emerge from the investigation and of a thorough analysis of the papers and other documents we seized there -- as to what exactly happened to Ron Arad. It is the confirmed end of a thread leading to somebody who held him in his hands and apparently handed him over to the Iranians. Information and a better understanding may surface later as to how to act in the future in order to secure Ron Arad's return to Israel. [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Roni Daniyel] Mr. Chief of Staff, could you be more specific about the method of operation in the village last night? [Baraq] I think it would not be right to detail the methods of operation on television. I cannot swear to you that this will be the last time we will have to use these operational tools, which are very important and sensitive and contribute a great deal to the IDF's abilities. I cannot tell you that this is the last time we will use them. Therefore, the better we manage to conceal and cloud the details of the operation, the better it will be. [Daniyel] Mr. Chief of Intelligence, could you elaborate on what we learned about Ron Arad that we did not know before? Lebanese reports say that cassettes and documents were seized from his home. [Sagi] I would consider it rash and perhaps even wrong to elaborate at this point on the additional findings, coming as they do on the heels of quite a considerable amount of information we had before we carried out the operation. I believe it would be correct to say that in addition to our assessment prior to the operation, we are certain about the responsibility for Ron Arad's fate during his captivity with Amal and later on when he was under the charge of Mustafa al-Dirani and the Believers Resistance. We apparently have and we will yet attain additional information about the ensuing period. In other words, in my opinion, in 1989 Ron Arad was handed over to other organizations. I believe it would not be right to elaborate on this point because of the intelligence sensitivity of the matter and the need to investigate further and confirm the findings in our possession. As noted, the nature of the operation shows that the information obtained through al-Dirani's capture and from other findings can really and considerably improve our knowledge. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el's Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe] Mustafa al-Dirani held Ron Arad as far back as six years ago. Did the operation not come too late? [Sagi] I, of course, do not define the timing of operations. On this issue, I am subject to the chief of staff's decision and, to the best of my knowledge, he is subject to the decision of the defense minister and the government. Whenever the operational opportunity and intelligence need arise, I think there is a proper way to make our recommendation to the authoritative levels. If and when conditions enable it, the needs justify it, and the operation is approved, then it is carried out. I must say -- fortunately, these are secret matters -- this is not the first such operation and, I believe, neither will it be the last. [Baraq] I would like to add that this operation had been prepared once before and was quite close to execution, but as a result of considerations related to the covert efforts for the release of Ron Arad, we decided not to execute it and to put it off for several months. Now the time looked right for its execution, and the operation was carried out. [Unidentified Tel Aviv IDF Radio correspondent] Mr. Chief of Staff, did you take into consideration the possibility of a confrontation with the Syrians in the course of the operation? [Baraq] The area in which the operation was carried out is controlled by the Syrian Army. Syrian troops are deployed in this area, which lies within the range of Syrian antiaircraft and ground missiles. Nevertheless, we built the operation in such a way as to reduce these risks to a minimum. I am glad that no such confrontation occurred and believe there is no reason for this issue -- fighting for information and for ways to secure the release of an Israeli POW -- to lead to any substantial friction with the Syrians.
