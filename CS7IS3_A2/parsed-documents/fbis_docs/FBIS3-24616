A total of 260,000 children suffer from serious chronic pathology, which means that about every sixth child is affected. Statistics show that the physical condition of children worsens in school. Thus, less than 1 percent of the children have postural disturbances in nursery schools, and by the time they are in second grade, the figure rises to 4 percent. In the lowest grades, visual impairment is observed in almost 6 percent of the schoolchildren, and by the eighth grade, this applies to 21 percent.''
