FBIS3-46010 "drchi016_n_94024" FBIS-CHI-94-016 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 Economic & Agricultural Poverty Relief Program's Progress Noted OW2401085694 Beijing XINHUA in English 0830 GMT 24 Jan 94 OW2401085694 Beijing XINHUA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Guiyang, January 24 (XINHUA) -- The carrying out of a poverty-relief program over the past decade has resulted in 40 million people in China's impoverished mountainous regions emerging from poverty and much improved local public facilities. A report by the State Planning Commission says that under the program some 6,800 km of roads and 7,855 bridges have been built, and 82,000 km of roads upgraded in nearly 10,000 villages in 18 impoverished regions in Shanxi, Shaanxi and other provinces. The program also supplied pure water to 27.72 million people and 18 million heads of cattle, and increased the area of irrigated farmland by 2.23 million ha [hectares] and hydropower generating capacity by 330,000 kw, the report says. The program, called "relief in exchange for work", differs from the traditional poverty-relief programs in that the help does not come in form of money, but in form of material input by the state or consumer goods in exchange for farmers' labor. In this way, the report says, the government can save the cash it badly needs for construction while overstocked industrial products can find consumers. Since 1984 the Chinese Government has put into the program 20 billion yuan-worth of grain, textiles, consumer electric products and household hardware. In return, farmers have put in hundreds of millions of labor/days. The report says the program marks a change in the government's policy. Rather than providing aids in cash, the new policy aims to improve the infrastructure of the impoverished regions and implant the possibility of self-development. In Guizhou Province in southwest China the past few years have witnessed the building of 7,200 km of roads and 525 bridges under the program. The report says Guizhou is the greatest benefiter of the program. The province also gets one fifth of the one million tons of grain provided annually by the government to the ethnic-minority areas in the central and western parts of China. The grain is used to pay farmers working to make new terraced farmlands or to upgrade hilly land. The report says some 76,000 ha of high-yield farmland has been created in the province over the past two years. It predicts that by the end of the century the province, now suffering from a serious grain shortage, will be able to produce enough grain to feed itself. Since 1991, when massive floods caused tremendous losses to east China, the government has launched a program to repair and build water-conservancy projects on seven rivers and five lakes in the region. The projects, involving 10 billion yuan-worth of industrial products in exchange for farmers' labor, will be completed by 1995. The report says that the construction materials and tools are usually provided by local governments. The report says China's poverty-relief program is highly appreciated by international organizations including the World Bank, which depicts the program in a report as good way to create job opportunities in impoverished areas and to build rural infrastructure facilities. The report disclosed that, starting this year, the government will launch a new program codenamed the "87 Poverty Relief Project", so-called as it will strive to pull 80 million people from the poverty line over seven years. The project will require the input of two billion yuan-worth of industrial products a year.
