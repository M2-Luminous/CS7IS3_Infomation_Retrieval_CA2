FR940228-0-00028 FR940228-0-00002 (c) Accept our appraisal of the crop on the damaged acreage as production to count against the production guarantee for the damaged acreage, destroy the remaining crop on such acreage, and be eligible for any indemnity due under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (§457.8) and the Small Grains Crop Provisions (§457.101). The appraisal will be considered production to count in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in the provisions of section 11. (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§457.101). You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop. If you elect to utilize such acreage for the production of spring wheat, you must: (1) Plant the spring wheat in a manner which results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundary between it and any remaining winter wheat; and (2) Store or market the production from such acreage in a manner which permits us to verify the amount of spring wheat production separately from any winter wheat production. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring wheat acreage will be considered to be a part of the original winter wheat unit. If you elected to insure the spring wheat acreage as a separate optional unit, any premium amount for such acreage will be considered earned and payable to us. §457.103 Malting barley option. The Malting Barley Option Provisions for the 1995 and succeeding crop years are as follows: United States Department of Agriculture Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Small Grains Crop Insurance Malting Barley Endorsement (This is a continuous Endorsement.
