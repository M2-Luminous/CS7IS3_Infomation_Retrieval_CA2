Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is the first to meet the U.S. President during a brief stop-over in Kiev's Borispol airport on Wednesday. The brief exchange between the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents in Kiev is expected to set the tone for the tripartite summit in Moscow on January 14, in which Clinton, Yeltsin and Kravchuk hope to discuss and sign documents which will ease relations between these three countries complicated by Ukraine's stance on the nuclear weapons deployed on its territory. Incidentally, Yeltsin had to issue a formal invitation to Kravchuk to arrive in the Russian capital, whereas a short time ago a telephone message was sufficient to bring former leaders of any of the Soviet republic to the USSR capital. Meanwhile, Belarusian Leader Stanislav Shushkevich has already arrived in Moscow for talks with President Yeltsin. Although a report from Minsk says the visit is mainly due to concentrate on bilateral relations between Russia and Belarus, the two leaders will pay no less attention to comparing their strategic notes and coordinating positions with a view to the U.S. President's visit to Moscow which is due to begin later on Wednesday. Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were the first to sign an agreement in December 1990 which put an effective end to the Soviet Union and initiated the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which most of the other former Soviet republics, except for the Baltic countries, joined thereafter. However, frictions continued to exist between the three Slav countries, the former Soviet nuclear weapons being one of the points of contention. Another debatable point is these countries' differing attitudes to NATO's proposed extension to the east. It can be surmised with a considerable degree of certainty that these issues will feature prominently both in bilateral talks between Yeltsin and Clinton and particularly in the tripartite summit in which Yeltsin, Clinton and Kravchuk will seek to come to terms on these pressing questions.
