For gas water heaters, standard level 2 satisfies the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year; for electric water heaters standard levels 1 through 5 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test.

Significance of Energy Savings To estimate the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new water heaters under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings would result for all classes of the product: Level 1_0.09 Quad Level 2_0.73 Quad Level 3_32.10 Quads Level 4_34.89 Quads Level 5_34.99 Quads Level 6_44.39 Quads Level 7_45.85 Quads Level 8_54.45 Quads The Department finds that each of the increased standards Levels considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy. 4. Economic Justification A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers . The per unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for gas water heaters is zero since it is the same as the baseline; to meet level 2 the manufacturers' cost increase is $5.47, levels 3 and 4 are $18.19, levels 5 and 6 are $28.57, level 7 is $72.14, and level 8 is $358.23. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for electric water heaters is $5.32; to meet level 2 the manufacturers' cost increase is $14.33, level 3 is $201.82, levels 4 and 5 are $210.83, and levels 6 through 8 are $585.06.
