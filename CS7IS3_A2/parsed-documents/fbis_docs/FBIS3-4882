This will be the first ODA given to the country since 1988. The Japanese Government recently exchanged correspondence with the Burmese Government. As a first step, Japan will provide the country with approximately 15 million yen in March in the form of financial grant. Financial cooperation will center on humanitarian aid such as medical equipment via nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). The government has not yet decided to start full-scale aid such as yen loans, but will make a decision after watching the progress of the country's democratization efforts. Japan's action is in contrast to that of American and European nations, which are being cautious about resuming aid to Burma.
