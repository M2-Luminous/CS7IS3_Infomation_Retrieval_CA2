According to Meshkov, his conference with the Ukrainian president passed in a "frank atmosphere" and gave "a new impetus" to relations between the Crimea and Ukraine. Nevertheless he noted that the problems faced by his republic remain the same: The lack of social security, rising crime, the Black Sea Fleet. For its part, the press service of the Crimean president told INTERFAX that Meshkov had returned from Kiev "satisfied with his talks there". Right after his visit to Kiev Meshkov went on vacation, the press service added. Earlier the leader of the domestic politics service of Ukraine's president, Nikolay Mikhalchenko, said that the meeting was "open and constructive, and the two sides reached agreement easily".

In the meantime the journalists who saw the two presidents have said that after his meeting with Kravchuk Meshkov looked "depressed".
