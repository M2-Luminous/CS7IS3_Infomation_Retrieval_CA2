Ambassador Rabinovich told our correspondent in Washington Arye Golan, however, that the fact that over the last year the Syrian regime has permitted some of its citizens to meet Israelis for the purpose of discussing the peace process is another sign pointing at a change in Syria's attitude. Ambassador Rabinovich said that this can be seen as a sign of the seriousness with which Syria regards the negotiations with Israel.
