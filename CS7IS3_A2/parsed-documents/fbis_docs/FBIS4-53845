At the press conference Deputy Chief of the Mission Kim Chang-su said that the Kwangju popular uprising was a heroic resistance in which more than one million people fought, controlling Kwangju city for ten days, and which developed the anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle to a higher stage. "Through the struggle the South Korean people clearly saw the true color of U.S. imperialism and began to direct the sharp edge of their struggle to it," he noted, and said: "U.S. imperialism is the very one trying to destroy our nation with a nuclear war." "The United States is driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by continuously shipping Patriot and other war equipment into South Korea and staging `Rimpac' exercises. This is a challenge to our nation which loves peace," he stated. He said that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is keeping the "National Security Law" the abolition of which is demanded even by the United States, is expanding the "Security Planning Board" and getting frantic in suppression in order to block the road of independence, democracy and reunification, and is defending the traitors Chon Tu- hwan and No Tae-u, the real criminals in the Kwangju massacre, thus making it plain that he is of the same clan with the preceding military dictators. "The entire people should unite as one, rise up in the second Kwangju resistance and build an independent, democratic new society free from foreign forces and fascism and accelerate the reunification of the country on all accounts," he said.
