"All conditions are met. Negotiations on an overall ceasefire will proceed this morning," he told reporters. The mostly Moslem Bosnian government had earlier rejected a resumption of talks because of the failure by armed Serbs to withdraw from a three-kilometer (two-mile) radius area around the east Bosnian town of Gorazde, in defiance of UN demands.
