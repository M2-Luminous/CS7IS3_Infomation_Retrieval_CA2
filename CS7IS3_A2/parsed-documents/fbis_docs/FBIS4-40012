Hennadiy Masakov, head of the inspectorate of the state committee for nuclear and radiation safety at Chernobyl nuclear power station, told a UNIAN correspondent that 480 nuclear assemblies from the reactor, which was stopped in October 1991 following the fire in the turbine room, had been placed in the cooling pond. The collection of the leaked water has been organized at the unit. In addition to the basic scheme of the water supply in the cooling pond, another three reserve ones have been prepared. The nuclear assemblies are not threatened with being without water. According to an elaborated program, the search for the location of the water leak is being carried out. It has been reported at Ukraine's state committee for the use of nuclear power that such incidents have occurred before, but on 7 June it became more noticeable. The level of radioactivity has not changed and remains lower than normative restrictions. The document on this event, which Viktor Vasylchenko, chief engineer at Chernobyl nuclear power station, signed, contains this conclusion: "There is no uncontrolled emergence of radioactive substances in accordance with restrictions established by conditions of normal operation, no increase in the dose of the irradiation of personnel, nor additional contamination of the environment due to the leakage of water from the cooling pond."
