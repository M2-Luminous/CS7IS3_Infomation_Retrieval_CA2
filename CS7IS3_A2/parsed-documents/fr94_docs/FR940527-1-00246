The survey conducted by MACRO International Inc., defined a PHO as a joint venture between a hospital and physicians to own and operate ambulatory or ancillary care projects or act as an agent for managed care contracts. A subcategory of a PHO, and MSO is a separate entity; is owned by physicians, the hospital or both; and contracts with solo and group practice physicians to provide administrative services, purchase physician practice assets, and act as the agent of the hospital and physicians in managed care contracts. A foundation is a corporation, usually a hospital affiliate of subsidiary, which acquires all assets of medical group practices. It negotiates and executes managed care contracts on behalf of both the hospital and physicians.
