On behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, he extended greetings to the award winners and extended cordial regards to the broad masses of press workers who have made efforts to promote the construction of the material and spiritual civilizations. He also set forth four opinions on further achieving news propaganda. First, we should grasp an accurate orientation of mass media, bring into full play the news propaganda front's instructive and educational functions. We should mobilize the broad masses of the cadres and the masses to dedicate themselves in reform. Second, closely in line with the central work of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, we should increase the contents of propaganda on economic work and promote a sustained, fast, and sound development of the economy. Third, we should conscientiously select subjects, strengthen the depth of reports, and strive to upgrade the quality and level of news propaganda. Fourth, we should strengthen external propaganda and further expand Liaoning's influential power at home and abroad. Gu Jinchi said: The news propaganda work is of extreme importance. The provincial party committee and the provincial government have paid high attention to it. The year 1994 is a key year to promote the package economic reform with breakthroughs in key areas as well as a year when the number of major reform measures is more than any other years and the setup of the socialist market economic system is accelerated. Therefore, strengthening the news propaganda work is of peculiar importance. Gu Jinchi said: The propaganda on the promulgation of major reform measures is an important content of the news propaganda work. We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress, particularly the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee; and also pay attention to grasping the central guidelines by handling the relationship between the promulgation of major reform measures and the setup of the socialist market economic system. The problems that the masses pay attention to should accurately be explained and positively be guided. We should propagate the contents of various reform measures among the cadres and the people; clearly explain the relationship between reform and development, between reform and the work in other aspects, and between reform and the lives of the people; enhance the people's understanding about reform and their psychological bearing ability; and form a social environment and a mass media environment that are conducive to reform. It is not easy to achieve the work in these aspects. Therefore, the press workers should not only arm their brains with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party congress but also deeply engage themselves in the practice of reform and go deep to the grass roots to catch the news of guidance importance and high value to promote the work of the overall situation and to deepen the reform work of the province. Gu Jinchi said: Concentrating energy to achieve the economic construction is a central task of the province. We should fully apply various means to conscientiously propagate economic construction and concentrate the people's attention to achieve modernization and realize the province's second pioneering work. The propaganda on economic work should be carried out closely in line with the reality of the province. In line with the province's economic development strategies and ideas, we should prominently increase the dynamics of propaganda. The propaganda on economic work should be carried out closely in line with the reality of economic construction, reform, and opening up. We should be good at abstracting some essential things from large amounts of complicated economic phenomena, sum up those successful experiences in economic work and gained from the practice of production and management activities, and propagate them. By so doing will our news reports be compiled vividly and profoundly. Gu Jinchi said: News can directly and actively reflect political, economic, cultural, and social activities. The principle of party spirit of news decides that press propaganda prominently has main melody and fully displays the spirit of the times. We should reflect the profound changes in the society as a whole brought about by reform and opening up; the party and government's major measures for leading the construction of socialist modernization, particularly the ideas and measures for implementing the major policy decisions of the central authorities according to Liaoning's reality; the fruitful achievements in building material and material civilizations; and the mental outlook of the people. We should pay attention to the research on the thinking of reports. It is necessary to grasp the selection of major subjects. Not only editors in chief and radio and television station directors but also editorial staff members should make researches on it. So long as we often make researches and deliberations will we be able to grasp key news points and major subjects and improve the quality and efficiency of news propaganda. We should pay attention to strengthening the depth of reports, concentrate on disseminating major subjects and key typical examples, and bring into full play the mass media's guidance role. We should persist in the principle of propaganda by giving positive examples, grasp hot-debated issues, have the daring to touch the hot-debated problems in society, and also give accurate explanations and guidance. We should increase reports and commentaries on public opinions and increase the ideological contents of reports. It is necessary to vigorously encourage press workers to change their work style and to go deep to the grass roots to conduct investigation and study. Gu Jinchi said: External propaganda is an important component part of the propaganda work. The fundamental tasks for external propaganda are to foster Liaoning's image at home and abroad and to create a good mass media environment for the province's reform, opening up, and modernization. Over the past years, the external propaganda work has ceaselessly been enhanced and played a key role. Besides the concerted efforts made by all fronts of the province, the central and overseas press units stationed in Liaoning and the key press units of the province have made lots of fruitful achievements and made key contributions to expanding Liaoning's influential power at home and abroad. The purpose to launch the activity of "giving outstanding news reports on propagating Liaoning" is to strengthen external propaganda and news propaganda and to encourage the broad masses of press workers to make more introductions of Liaoning to the places at home and abroad. Now, many countries in the world are carrying out the strategy of opening up. There are frequent international economic and cultural contacts. We must make more and faster introductions of Liaoning to the outside world. We should be good at using the current favorable opportunities, positively improve and realistically strengthen external propaganda, bring into full play the external propaganda work's functions for guiding the mass media in the course of expanding the scale of opening up, and have Liaoning enjoy high prestige in the world. Gu Jinchi hoped that in the new year, the broad masses of press workers should work harder, create increasingly more outstanding works, and make greater contributions to promoting the construction of the two civilizations. Wang Chonglu, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and director of the propaganda department, chaired the meeting. Gao Dongxiao, deputy director of the propaganda department, introduced the situation relating to the selection of news and commentaries. Responsible persons of the central press organizations stationed in Shenyang and the provincial-level press units and representatives of award winners held talks and set forth many good opinions and suggestions on how to achieve the news propaganda work.
