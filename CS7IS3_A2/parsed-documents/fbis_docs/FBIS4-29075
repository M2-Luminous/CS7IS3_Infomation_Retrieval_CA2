The official said, "Japan had demanded that the UNSC adopt a warning resolution first before monitoring the situation and passing a sanctions resolution against North Korea. But now that North Korea has withdrawn from the IAEA, Japan does not have any ground for proposing milder and gradual steps by the international community." At a recent meeting with South Korea and the United States, Japan had proposed that the Security Council adopt a warning resolution first before taking the second step of imposing relatively mild economic sanctions. Under this proposal, if North Korea did not accept IAEA inspections despite the U.N. measures, the council would take strong action including suspension of trade and remittances from Koreans residing in Japan. But with the Stalinist state's withdrawal from the IAEA, the Security Council may adopt a strong sanctions resolution from the outset that includes suspension of remittances by pro-Pyongyang Koreans in Japan to North Korea, the official said. Meanwhile, the Japanese Government may send Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa to the United States late this month to discuss future measures after a U.N. resolution is adopted, as the tension on the Korean peninsula continues to rise. Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata talked with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the telephone Tuesday, promising that Japan will cooperate with the Security Council within the limits of its Constitution if sanctions are slapped on North Korea.
