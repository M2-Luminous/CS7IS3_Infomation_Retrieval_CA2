Skandalidhis was speaking this evening at Famagusta Gate in Nicosia. He stressed that the so-called Greek-Turkish differences are no longer being dealt with in a framework in which the balances are negative. He added that although Cyprus has been at the center of attention for 20 years and the tragedy of the Cypriot people seems endless, there can be no final division in which there are hostages and occupation in the name of despair or fatigue. Skandalidhis agreed with President Glavkos Kliridhis' view that the final solution does not seem close. But, he said, this does not mean we should refrain from using every international framework for dialogue or from searching for secondary solutions when these do not hurt the final goal. Let us be aware, he said, of time as a strategy. The Greek Aegean minister said the Cyprus issue was, is, and will be a problem of invasion and occupation and change in demographic norms by force. He added that having as firm goals a united and independent Republic of Cyprus and the withdrawal of the occupation troops, we are promoting a pannational effort for a productive, just, and viable solution. Skandalidhis added that when it comes to the structural choices-- the pannational conference, the amendment of the Butrus-Ghali set of ideas, and Cyprus' accession to the European Union--Greece backs the common will of the Cypriot leadership. The Greek minister said he thought Turkey would not succeed with its final goals. Time works against Turkey, its alliances lose strength, and its position is getting weaker all the time. Skandalidhis said that Hellenism has two major strategic directions. One is the national defense line that unites Thrace with the Aegean and Cyprus. The other is the Balkan and Mediterranean axis, that is, the offensive line connecting the eastern and northern borders and that has as a front, the Balkan peninsula, Central and East Europe, and the southeast Mediterranean.
