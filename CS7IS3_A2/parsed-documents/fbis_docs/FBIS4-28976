The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Our party has firmly adhered to the principles of revolutionary party building and thoroughly embodied them in party building and party activities, thereby pioneering a new road of party building and strengthening and developing our party to be the chuche revolutionary party that we have today. The wisdom of the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with which he has strengthened and developed the WPK into the chuche revolutionary party of invincible might lies in his putting forth the policy of modeling the entire party membership on the chuche idea in conformity with the inevitable demand of the party's development and energetically leading the struggle for its realization. Modeling the entire party membership on the chuche idea is the revolutionary party building program that makes all the party members who compose the party enthusiastic chuche-type revolutionaries, firmly builds the party ranks, and conducts the party work and party activities thoroughly as required by the chuche ideology, theory, and method, thus strengthening and developing our party forever to be the chuche revolutionary party.

The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the sacred struggle to model the entire party membership on the chuche idea and made great achievements in the cause of party building. The achievement the dear comrade leader has made in strengthening our party is, more than anything else, his bringing up all the party members to be the core elements of the revolution and firmly building the party ranks into the militant ranks of the chuche-type revolutionaries. The dear comrade leader firmly established the party's monolithic ideological system by defining the basic line of party building and saw to it that all the party organizations persistently keep up and continuously deepen the work. As the party's monolithic ideological system has been established under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, all the party members have been armed more firmly with the chuche idea, and the chuche ideological system has been firmly established in the party. The dear comrade leader originally defined the basic duties, contents, and method of the party's ideological work in conformity with the prevailing development of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, and energetically led the work, thus bringing up all party members to be the core elements of the revolution. Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, a new change has been brought forth in the party's ideological work, and the party is filled with the revolutionary ethos of cherishing loyalty as one's revolutionary faith and fidelity, protecting and defending the party and the leader politically, ideologically, and at the cost of one's life, and implementing the party's line and policy unconditionally to the end, prepared to face any hardship.
