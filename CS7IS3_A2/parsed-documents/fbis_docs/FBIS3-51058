Alarcon acknowledged France's position during a gathering with 138 members of a French solidarity airlift to the Caribbean nation. The French brought a donation of six tons of medicine and other supplies to this capital. Alarcon expressed that within French society there are forces that favor friendly ties between the two countries, regardless of the fact that there is no political or ideological concurrence. He noted, however, common French and Cuban positions on different issues such as the U.S. blockade against Cuba, which France has voted against twice at the United Nations. He added that what is taking place in the island, which is now experiencing its most difficult and complex moment, must be a cause of interest for those who hope for a better world, no matter where they live. Alarcon stressed that the economic difficulties facing the country -- mainly the internal financial imbalance, high fiscal deficit and excess currency -- will be resolved through measures that preserve the social justice system developed 35 years ago. Jacques Coubard, assistant chief editor of the daily L'HUMANITE; Julien Garavito and Helene Duberos, vice president and secretary general respectively of the France-Cuba Society; and Communist Senator Jean Garcia from the region of Seine-St. Denis are among the visitors. The tour, which began on 30 December and which will conclude tomorrow, was organized by the daily L'HUMANITE, mouthpiece of the French Communist Party, and the France-Cuba Society, so that its members could learn about the Cuban reality first-hand.
