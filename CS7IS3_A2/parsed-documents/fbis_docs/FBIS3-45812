The State Council will single out 100 state-owned enterprises of medium and large size for trial practice in setting up a modern enterprise system which is considered important to China. The management mechanism of these enterprises will see a change while state-owned small-sized enterprises will be renovated by means of leasing, contracting and sale. Those having long-term loss will be declared bankrupt. Key to the reform of taxation will lay in the setting up of systems for central and local taxation. The relationship between the central authorities and localities, the state and enterprises and individuals must be made clear in terms of taxation. As for monetary reform, the functions of the central bank have to be improved and strengthened. The central bank must keep control over the supply of money in order to maintain stability of the currency. A banking system for the policy-oriented banks must be set up in a bid to turn the professional banks into state-owned commercial banks. The planned system will also come under reform, putting an emphasis on simplification and reducing the number of planned indicators but increasing to a little extent the indicators for macroeconomic general volume. The mandatory plans for production, circulation and distribution will be shrunken. The system for order-taking will be developed and improved. Reform of the investment pattern will put an emphasis on the strengthening of the status held by enterprises as the main investment bodies and the scope of investment by the government must be made clear. The responsibility of taking risks in investment by legal persons and in credit by banks will be established. Mr. Hong pointed out that price reform had not yet been completed. He added that a grain and food system in line with the socialist market economy system had to be set up as soon as possible this year while at the same time a unified price system for production means had to be carried out. Prices for coal would continue to open to the market and those for crude oil, finished oil and electricity were to be adjusted.
