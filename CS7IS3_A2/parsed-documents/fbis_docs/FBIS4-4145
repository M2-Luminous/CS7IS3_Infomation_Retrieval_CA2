Government Spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said in his daily briefing that the Greek Cypriot side had accepted the March 21 paper regarding the U.N.-proposed measures. The document provides only for the unmanning of the area south of the fenced part of the Turkish-held town of Varosha (Famagusta) to allow access from the government-controlled area to this part of the coastal town. According to the document, the Turkish troops should withdraw from this particular area although the area would remain under Turkish control. The road linking the government-controlled area with the fenced part of Famagusta would be under U.N. control. According to the spokesman, in a speech Saturday [16 April] in Washington, the U.N. envoy said this area could be used for civilian purposes, something which is not provided for by the March 21 document. Clark was quoted as saying that because of the lack of confidence between the two communities on the island, "We have proposed that access to Varosha be under United Nations protection. "This would imply that the Turkish Cypriot side would not station military or police personnel on the access route to Varosha or in the immediately adjacent area, even though it would retain formal control of the area and obviously could go on using it for civilian purposes," the U.N. envoy reportedly said. Clark added, "in fact, the access route stays Turkish. There is no surrender of land. The United Nations would have an obligation to protect passage, and, in effect, to guarantee the safety of those using the road, but there is no transfer of land." The CBM, put forward by the U.N. chief last May, provides for the transfer of the Turkish-held fenced area of Varosha to the U.N. administration to allow some 16,000 Greek Cypriot refugees to reclaim their properties, and the reopening of the now defunct Nicosia International Airport, again under U.N. control. The island's two communities, the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, have been engaged in proximity talks aimed at implementing the CBM since February 17. On March 21, the U.N. representatives presented to the two sides a document regarding the implementation of the peace plan, which was accepted by the Greek Cypriot side, but rejected by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, thus leading to the failure of the U.N. efforts to reach an agreement by the end of March, the deadline set by the U.N. Security Council. In order to save the U.N. peace package, the U.N. chief decided earlier this month to extend the deadline to allow the parties concerned to conclude an agreement before the end of April. Joe Clark and his deputy representative Gustave Feissel are currently visiting Ankara in an effort to persuade the Turkish side to accept the U.N. document of March 21. The Greek Cypriot has repeatedly declared it would not accept a revised version of the document. Clark and Feissel are expected in Cyprus Wednesday to discuss the CBM with President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash. The Cyprus problem started in 1974 when Turkey sent troops to seize one third of its territory following a Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece. Repeated U.N.-sponsored peace talks, aimed at reuniting the island under a bizonal and bicommunal federal system, have so far failed to yield any results.
