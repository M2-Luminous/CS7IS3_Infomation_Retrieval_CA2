"The Army, as result of its professional performance, with the lives of its members, has allowed us to progress in accomplishing something which is the desire of the entire population: a definite end to the violence, as well as peace and tranquility for Chiapas," the president's message indicated. Salinas de Gortari's address was read by General Arturo Cardona Marino, chief of the presidential high command, during an event commemorating Army Day that took place on Military Field No. 1 located north of Mexico City. The president highlighted the government's decision to search for a peaceful solution from the onset of the "unpredictable" Chiapas events, which represents "a test for all Mexicans. This willingness for peace has been possible because the Mexican Army performed, and performed well, during the conflict's contention and population protection phases," Salinas indicated.

Camacho Solis was appointed as peace commissioner on 10 January as a result of an initiative by President Salinas de Gortari. "By providing protection to the Chiapas civilian population, the Mexican Army and Air Force have carried out their constitutional responsibilities," the president stated. Salinas de Gortari emphasized that these two military institutions "have given evidence throughout the conflict of their discipline, unalterable commitment to the state of law, support for peace, and loyalty to Mexico." The address also stressed the Mexican Army's contributions to the health sector, national natural disaster relief, drug trafficking, and public order threats. "On this Army Day, please receive from the president of the Republic, as commander in chief, a most extensive congratulations and, along with this, the acknowledgement, respect, and affection of the Mexican people," Salinas de Gortari stated. The president headed the ceremony accompanied by National Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello Bazan and Navy Secretary Admiral Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo, as well as other cabinet officials. During the ceremony, Riviello Bazan indicated that the Armed Forces "never remember their actions, but rather the spirit and mission for which they were created," which is to serve "in order for the nation to live in peace." He highlighted that "this is the Mexican nation's Army, proud of its origins, an Army of men who are loyal, capable, honest, and convinced of the postulates ingrained in the Constitution."
