Within this new framework, the foreign minister made headway in settling integration and complementation problems on the border with Brazil, including the serious pollution problem affecting common rivers, sanitation, and pasteurization of Brazilian milk at Conaprole [National Cooperative of Milk Producers] factories. With regard to Argentina, progress was made regarding the navigation of the upper reaches of the Uruguay River and the construction of sluice gates. The intense tour that Abreu and his main aides made included meetings with experts from the Salto Grande Joint Commission, Rio Grande do Sul Governor Alceu Collares, Rubens Ricupero, the Brazilian minister of environment and legal Amazon Region, and mayors from the main border areas. At the international press headquarters, the CTM [Argentine-Uruguayan Joint Technical Commission of Salto Grande] presented Abreu with the final plan to build a sluice gate -- which started some years ago -- to raise the Uruguay River's water level to the reservoir's level and thus enable upstream navigation. This work will facilitate the transportation of more than 45 million metric tons of cargo up to Argentine and Uruguayan ports at a considerably lower price. CTM members and Abreu himself were of one mind about the importance of this project since it will be instrumental in transforming the Uruguay River in the great cargo waterway of the subregion -- including Brazil -- and in fostering the comprehensive development of a vast area of the three countries with the resultant improvement of its inhabitants' quality of life. [passage omitted] The most salient aspects of the foreign minister's tour of the interior were perhaps his agenda in Melo, Rio Branco, and [the Brazilian city of] Jaguarao together with his meeting with Collares and Ricupero. Both countries' official delegations shared the same views as the mayors, aldermen from [the Uruguayan cities of] Rivera, Artigas, Cerro Largo, Tacuarembo, [and the Brazilian cities of] Jaguarao, Bage, and Santa Vitoria. During an official ceremony in Rio Branco, two devices for "monitoring the environment" were presented to Uruguay, which will have them on loan for a year. These machines are to be used to "measure air particles, rain elements, and atmospheric changes" to reliably determine whether the acid rain that affects crops and vegetation in border departments is caused by the Candiota power plant [in Brazil]. Brazilian and Uruguayan authorities were in total agreement about the urgent need to deepen integration along the entire border in order to "improve citizens' standard of living." They also noted that the objective that will characterize the "new joint policy" is to situate development centers in border areas, where people have always lived in brotherhood striving to overcome shortages caused by the centralization of power." [quotation marks as published] Collares took pains to underscore that the governments have adopted a new personal and political attitude. The open and sincere talks, at which LA MANANA was present, serve to overcome some longstanding diplomatic problems and bureaucratic hurdles. Abreu said: "The way was paved for sincere understanding through direct dialogue between rulers." Collares shared Abreu's views and openly expressed his intention of encouraging the development of border areas to improve the standard of living and overcome "red tape" problems. The delegations decided to hold a meeting in Canela during the second fortnight of May to finalize arrangements for common projects in the border areas. These include: Sanitation for sister cities like Artigas- Quarahi, Rivera-Santa Ana do Livramento, Bella-Union, and Chuy-Chuy; and the cleaning up of common rivers and streams. With regard to the latter, both countries agreed to expedite the drafting of concrete projects since the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] suspended the financing planned some time ago due to the fact that the systems in both banks do not have the same technical or maintenance levels. A project to be implemented by Rivera and Livramento provides for the pasteurization of Brazilian milk at Conaprole's No. 14 factory and its subsequent transportation to Brazil for local consumption. Both countries are making efforts so border towns will have common transportation and health care services. [passage omitted] Another important subject in which both countries' delegations were of one mind pertains to the old bridge across the Jaguarao River -- a crucial point in the freeway to link Sao Pablo, Montevideo, and Buenos Aires -- and the development of the Laguna Merin basin. Collares stated: "It will be impossible to foster the area's comprehensive development unless we have a modern bridge that joins both countries." A binational commission made up by authorities from Jaguarao and Rio Branco raised this issue and submitted a project for building a new bridge. This is one of the central issues to be thoroughly analyzed at the Canela meeting since, in the words of the Rio Grande do Sul governor, "we are determined to promote the building of a road network."
