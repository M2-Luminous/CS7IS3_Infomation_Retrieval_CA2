It is one of the four major goals of China's national industrial policy in the 1990's to adjust the foreign trade structure properly, accelerate the upgrading of the industrial structure, and enhance its international competitiveness. Since reform went under way and the open policy began, foreign trade has played an increasingly important strategic role in promoting economic growth, optimizing the industrial structure, and raising the quality of the economy. During the 1990's, as the Chinese economy accelerates its integration into the world economy and as China continues to take big strides toward a socialist open market economy, foreign trade will play an even more prominent strategic part in modernization. In the 1990's there will be a series of changes, including opportunities and challenges, in both the internal and external conditions in which economic development and foreign trade take place. Thus further adjusting the foreign trade structure and creating even more favorable conditions for economic development in order to meet the requirements of the new situation has become a major topic facing us. We believe that depending on the needs and possibilities, the adjustment of the foreign trade structure in the 1990's will involve three major strategic tasks. First, to take advantage of our "latecomer" status and speed up the transition of the mode of economic development from extensive to intensive, we must continue to ensure that foreign trade, particularly exports, expands at a fast pace and contributes even more to economic growth and the adjustment of the industrial structure. Second, we must speed up the upgrading of the export industries and the optimization of the export mix in light of the evolving trends in the global industrial structure and China's own capabilities. The goal is an export mix dominated by multiple-processed products and articles with high added value. Third, by accelerating the reform of the import system, we must set up an import regulating system that is in line with China's national conditions, satisfies the requirements of GATT, spurs the optimization of the import mix, and raises the proportion of imports consisting of advanced technology and equipment in order to bring about technological advances in China. At the same time, the domestic market should be opened systematically and selectively, an appropriate measure of international competition should be introduced, and the adjustment of the industrial structure and pattern of regional distribution should be brought under greater pressure so as to further the well-being of the people and improve the overall efficiency of the national economy. Below we discuss the goals and means of the three major strategic tasks of adjusting the foreign trade structure: I. Increase Contribution of Foreign Trade to Economic Growth, Industrial Structure Adjustment Since reform went under way and the open policy was introduced, foreign trade has contributed progressively more and more to economic development as it experienced rapid growth, a trend that has been particularly striking since 1988. Dependency on imports and exports has increased substantially. Foreign demand as indicated by exports also showed signs of rising relative to gross social demand, as did the increase in exports relative to the increase in gross demand. The expansion of foreign demand is becoming an increasingly important force fueling economic growth. Rising exports contribute to economic growth immensely. The significant change in the standing of imports and exports in national economic processes symbolize the historic changes in the way the Chinese economy operates. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

First, the increase in exports has accelerated the adjustment of the product mix and the upgrading of products. Second, the increase in exports had set the stage for the realization of economies of scale by some enterprises, which helps widen their margin of profit. Third, exporting and taking part in international competition have pushed many enterprises at home to improve the quality of their products, introduce more variety in their product design and lineup, and lower costs, which all help improve the quality of Chinese enterprises and enhance their international competitiveness. Fourth, the growth in exports has put to use China's comparative advantage in capital goods such as manpower through participation in international division of labor, which helps improve our macroeconomic efficiency. Fifth, the multiplier effects of foreign trade have powerfully fueled the development of related sectors. Sixth, the importing of raw materials, goods, and consumer products in short supply in China has met the requirements of industrial and agricultural production as well as the daily needs of the people and helped ease the constraints of the bottleneck sector on economic development. Seventh, the importation of advanced technology and equipment and intermediate inputs has helped accelerate technological advances in China, improve the input-output ratio, enhance economic efficiency, speed up industrial upgrading, and strengthen the momentum for lasting economic growth. Eighth, competing imports have demonstrative effects and exert pressure on domestic enterprises to speed up their "learning, absorption, assimilation, and improvement" process and become more adaptable. All in all, the rapid development of foreign trade makes it possible for China to better utilize foreign markets, resources, funds, technology, and qualified personnel. As the supply-demand conditions in the national economy evolve and following the resumption of China's status as a signatory to GATT, foreign trade will play an even more important role in balancing the total volume and the structure of the economy in the 1990's. On the one hand, when the demand structure goes upscale and the demand for newer and better consumer goods swells, the demand for capital goods and intermediate goods with a high technical content would intensify by the day. On the other hand, there are signs of deterioration in supply conditions, particularly the availability of resources. There is also extensive plant duplication in light industry, processing industry, and durable consumer goods industry. In these industries the scale is not economical and there is a good deal of production overcapacity, which makes it hard to improve product quality and raise profitability, which, in turn, would lead to diminished international competitiveness. Moreover, since the resumption of China's membership in GATT is irreversible, many domestic industries would be affected to varying extents. These factors make it even more imperative that China use foreign trade in the 1990's to close the gap between supply and demand at home and speed up industrial upgrading. And economic structural reform, particularly the deepening of foreign trade reform, will pave the way for foreign trade to play an important strategic role in the national economy. Moreover, international conditions in the 1990's more and more favor the drive to increase the contribution of foreign trade to the national economy. First of all, with the global economy and world trade gradually recovering in the near and medium term, China may face a more favorable international market in the late 1990's. Second, the world-wide industrial structure is in the midst of readjustment right now, with developed nations and the newly industrialized countries [NIC's] hiving off traditional industries at an accelerated pace, which provides a favorable external environment for China's move to accelerate industrial upgrading and gradually replace light and textile industries with heavy industry, chemical industry, and new durable consumer goods industry as the leading export-oriented industries. Based on the universal laws of industrialization and modernization worldwide and the requirements and possibilities of the development of foreign trade in the 1990's, we should set the following goals for the first strategic task of the adjustment of foreign trade structure in the 1990's. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.

A widespread trend among industrializing nations as they take off economically as well as a major characteristic of global economic development today is for foreign trade to grow reasonably faster than the economy. Since reform began and the open policy was introduced, the development of China's foreign trade has basically been consistent with this principle. As the Chinese economy takes off in the 1990's, it is entirely necessary and possible to keep foreign trade expanding 3 to 5 percentage points ahead of GNP. 2) Imports should roughly equal or slightly exceed exports. Most NIC's ran some sort of a trade deficit during their economic take-off so that they had considerable foreign resources and technology at their disposal to accelerate economic development. China's medium- and long-term foreign trade policy in the 1990's is to achieve a rough balance between imports and exports, but considering the needs of modernization and the fact that we have a net surplus of capital projects, it would also be normal to run a small deficit in some years. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4. A Comparison of Foreign Trade and GNP Growth Rates of Some Newly In-| |dustrialized Countries (Regions) During Economic Take-Off () | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Exports |GNP | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |South Korea |27.2 |9.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hong Kong |9.1 |8.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Brazil |9.3 |9.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Indonesia |9.6 |7.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3) The extent of participation in international division of labor will increase further, gradually creating an open resource-balancing mechanism. The fast growth of foreign trade inevitably implies greater involvement by China in international division of labor and exchange based on the principle of comparative advantage and opening up China economically even further to the outside world. As foreign trade dependency increases in the 1990's, the integration of the Chinese economy into the world economy will quicken and an open optimal resource-allocation and balancing mechanism will gradually come into existence.

A high savings rate and a rising foreign trade contribution rate are preconditions a developing nation must meet to achieve fast economic growth and improve the quality of its economic development. As a developing nation, China too must work to keep savings rate and foreign trade contribution at a high rate if it is to accelerate economic take-off. Accordingly, it is imperative that macroeconomic regulation and control be tightened and improved and the appropriate monetary and fiscal policies be adopted in order to hold down gross domestic demand as appropriate and check inflation. To do all that is to set the stage for raising the accumulation level in the national economy and ensuring the steady long-term expansion of exports, basically reversing a longstanding phenomenon in which export growth is hampered by the boom-and-bust cycle in the domestic economy. 2) Deepen reform and gradually allow the market to play a basic role in resource allocation. This is an institutional guarantee of putting comparative advantage to the utmost use and obtaining the optimal comparative advantage through foreign trade. 3) Establish a foreign trade system featuring fair competition and deregulation that conforms with the norms of international trade. Instead of making the earning of foreign exchange their principal objective, foreign trade enterprises must now be profit-driven, a transition that must be effected as soon as possible. Over time they should be operated exclusively in accordance with the principle of profitability. Property rights relations should be sorted out and a modern enterprise system should be put widely in place. 4) Gradually create a new body of policies consistent with international practices that will encourage exporting and give the export drive all necessary support. II. Accelerate Upgrading of Export Industries; Optimize Export Mix Accelerating the upgrading of the mix of export industries and optimizing the export mix are major conditions for improving the terms of trade, enhancing China's international competitiveness, and heightening its staying power as an exporter. It is also an important driving force behind better utilizing the changing mechanism of the international market to facilitate the adjustment of China's industrial structure. It is the second major strategic task facing China in the 1990's as it seeks to adjust its foreign trade structure. 1) The need to accelerate the upgrading of export industries and optimize the export mix Since reform began and the open policy went under way, China's mix of export commodities has improved enormously. According to customs statistics, industrial manufactured goods accounted for 80 percent of all Chinese exports in 1992. At $19.55 billion, electrical machinery products made up 23 percent of all exports. The mix of countries (regions) to which Chinese exports are destined has been improved. There has been stable development in export growth using a variety of trading methods. The optimization of the export mix has been instrumental in promoting the adjustment of the mix of industries. However, we should also see that China's leading export industries remain resource-and labor-intensive industries with little multiple processing and limited added value. We are still a long long way from fully exploiting our economic and technical edge and our strength in elements of production. There are little differences between the export mix of one locality compared to the next. Production of export commodities takes place on a small scale and is fragmented, which militates against the effort to make exporting more profitable, diminishes the staying power of export growth, and encourages panic purchasing at home even at inflated prices and cut-throat price-slashing overseas. The optimization of the export mix and the adjustment of the industrial structure should have a mutual stimulating effect, but because of the above-mentioned factors, such a relationship has not been fully operational. The optimization of the export mix has done little to further the adjustment of the industrial structure, which it should. Although China's current export mix, dominated by labor-intensive products, is favored in some ways, it also faces grim challenges given the international climate today. To begin with, competition among the nations world-wide will become more ferocious in the 1990's even as global economic interdependency increases. As the new-tech and high-tech revolution accelerates, high tech and new tech will be the principal theatre where nations vie for supremacy in overall national power. As the internationalization and industrialization of high-tech and new technology quicken their pace, the global industrial structure will undergo dizzying changes, with technology- and knowledge-intensive industries increasingly gain the upper hand in international competition, while the terms of trade for resource- and labor-intensive industries will worsen in contrast. External conditions do exist for the further participation by China's labor-intensive industries, which enjoy an edge, in international division of labor. At the same time, however, China's export mix, heavily dependent on labor-intensive products, also faces grim challenges. Another important trend in world economic development in the 1990's is that regional economic blocs have been taking shape at an accelerating pace, profoundly impacting the movement of commodities, capital, technology, and qualified personnel among nations. In Europe, a huge unified market became operative starting in early 1993. The United States, Canada, and Mexico have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement. In the Asian and Pacific region, economic cooperation is moving in the direction of institutionalization and sub-regional groups have proliferated. Elsewhere, too, economic cooperation associations of all forms and shapes are being planned or put together enthusiastically. To a certain extent, economic regionalization will stimulate economic growth and trade around the world, thus creating some opportunities for China. But such opportunities will be accompanied by protectionism and an expanded flow of commodities, capital, technology, and personnel among developed nations and developing nations within a particular regional bloc, which will adversely affect the development of China's foreign economic relations and trade. Third, the adjustment of the global industrial structure will continue and international division of labor will intensify in the 1990's. The outward transfer of labor-intensive industries from developed nations and the NIC's will pick up steam. Meanwhile, however, member-nations of ASEAN and countries in South Asia, Latin America, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and East Europe are also in a hurry to reform and open up themselves to the outside world. As their international competitiveness improves over time, they will become tough competitors for China. Summing up the preceding paragraphs analytically, traditionally it is the labor- and resource-intensive industries, including light industry and the textile industry, that have sustained the scale of China's exports. However, any major expansion in exports will be hard to come by if we fail to upgrade our industries technologically and continue to compete essentially on price. We can no longer afford to delay giving special support to and developing on a priority basis such technology-intensive industries as heavy industry, chemical industry, and instrument-making industry in which China already has a foundation in place and where it enjoys a dynamic comparative advantage. 2) Developing technology-intensive industries for export: strengths and practical feasibility More than 40 years after the PRC was founded, China has basically put together a coherent industrial system and a complete scientific research system. It boasts a full line-up of industries, a large number of technical personnel, and a massive army of scientific researchers. Right now about 2 million scientific research personnel are engaged in research and development, more than anywhere else in the world, generating scientific research achievements in the tens of thousands each year. In such S&T fields as aviation and space technology, biotechnology, genetic engineering, fiber optical communications, shipbuilding, iron and steel, domestic electrical appliance industry, and petrochemical industry, China matches the best in the world or is closing in on it. China is also heavily favored to develop technology-intensive industries for export in that it can compete on the costs of elements of production. Vast in territory, China abounds with strategic resources like non-ferrous metals and ferrous metals, coal, and petroleum. It has an ample supply of inexpensive labor. Infrastructural facilities like water supply, communications, and transportation have also reached a substantial scale. Even more important, after more than 40 years of construction, particularly after reform began and the open policy was introduced, China has greatly enhanced its production capability and level of technology by attracting foreign capital, importing advanced technology and whole plants, and developing industries using high and new technology. No doubt this has laid a solid foundation for the drive by China to push its exports to a higher level of technology. In light of the characteristics of China's economic development and the trends in the development of international economic relations and trade, we should firmly commit ourselves to achieving the following as objectives of the adjustment of the mix of export commodities and the establishment of strategic industries. In the short haul, rely on the agricultural byproducts industry, light industry, and textile industry as the mainstay export industries, while concentrating on increasing the technical content of export commodities, improving product quality, and moving to the upper end of the market, forming a host of products with international brand-name recognition. In the medium term, take the electrical machinery, food, and chemical industries as the leading export industries and concentrate on developing mature technologies and whole plants for export in order to increase China's international competitiveness and elevate them to the nation's leading exports after five to seven years of hard work. In the long run, make high-tech industries and the next generation of chemical, heavy, and instrument-making industries our strategic export industries, treating them preferentially on a policy level and giving them all-out support to ensure that new export growth targets are met one after another. Everything must be done to make sure these industries are exporting a substantial amount of their output by the late 1990's, joining the ranks of China's key export industries. 3) Policies and measures to strategically adjust the mix of China's export commodities a) The government must conduct scientific planning and formulate the appropriate laws. The adjustment of the export mix embraces a range of fields, including those in production--industry, scientific research, foreign trade, and agriculture--and circulation. No unit acting alone can draw up a comprehensive plan. It is proposed that comprehensive agencies under the State Council take the lead in initiating systems research in conjunction with the functional departments involved and drawing up an export industry strategy for each of the three industry clusters as presently conceived--current mainstay industry cluster, near-term leading industry cluster, and future strategic industry cluster--setting goals and outlining the steps to be taken at each stage and introducing them as soon as possible. Moreover, when the conditions exist, we should consider drawing up the corresponding legislation such as a technology import-export law, a high-tech and new technology industry law, and a strategic industry vitalization law, among others. Enlist the help of the law to spur the upgrading of export industries. b) Expedite economic structural reform and S&T reform vigorously and establish a mechanism that promotes the effective integration of trade, industry, agriculture, and technology. In the short run, there are two ways to integrate industry, agriculture, technology, and trade. One approach is to go all out to develop large-scale enterprise groups in the form of comprehensive conglomerates that combine trade, industry, and technology under one roof with foreign trade playing the dominant role. In matters of technology, these enterprises should go in for self-absorption, self-improvement, and self-development with one helping the other in an endless cycle. The other approach is to vigorously develop multinational corporations that combine industry, S&T, and foreign trade under one roof, with leading industries playing the dominant role. The industrialization and internationalization of high-tech will be completed within the industrial corporations themselves. In the medium and long term, the problem of dissociation between industry and trade must be solved at its root by deepening economic structural reform and S&T reform. c) Formulate policies to single out certain industries for preferential treatment, thereby bolstering the optimization of the mix of export commodities. In preparing its industrial policy for the 1990's, the state must consider the overall industrial adjustment strategy and guide the optimization of the mix of export commodities. Among the major policies and measures are the following: 1) Fund credit support system; 2) import-export policy; 3) a sound tariff policy; 4) export drawback and other tax policies; 5) technology and qualified personnel development policy. d) Strengthen export industrial organizations. In the transitional period of economic structural reform, the government should take administrative, legal, and, if necessary, administrative measures to step up intervention in export industrial organizations. Not only should it guide the rationalization of the structure of the increase in properties, but it must work harder to adjust the structure of existing properties. Enterprises in export production commonly operate on a small scale, which prevents them from benefiting from economies of scale. This and other problems must be overcome. On the other hand, the government must promote the rationalization of the distribution of export production, gradually putting together an export production system that takes advantage of each region's resource, economic, and technical strengths and marries specialization with cooperation. At the same time, the government should further the trend toward the formation of foreign trade enterprise groups to enhance China's competitiveness, forming an intelligent operational pattern where the regions practice division of labor even as they cooperate. III. Decontrol Importation, Optimize Import Mix, and Intensify Pressure To Adjust Structure The irrationality of China's import mix manifests itself primarily in the following ways: First, advanced technology and equipment, particularly software technology, account for only a limited share of total Chinese imports. According to statistics, technology imports constitute a mere 8.5 percent of all imports during the Seventh Five-Year Plan and only 8.2 percent in 1992. Second, the importing of luxury consumer goods has not been reined in successfully. Consumer goods and capital goods imported through a variety of illegal channels have been battering the domestic market. Third, unplanned importation and duplicate importation are commonplace, severely hampering industrial production and the adjustment of the industrial structure at home. Even more serious, they complicate the drive to increase the staying power of economic development and raise profitability. The irrationality of the import commodity mix has its roots in the existing import management system, which also has given rise to excessive import protection, hindering the full exploitation of China's comparative advantage and its more extensive participation in international division of labor. Moreover, it takes away a major incentive to upgrade the country's industries and undermines the effort to enhance international competitiveness and profitability. The move to gradually decontrol importation and optimize the import mix in the 1990's has enormous strategic significance for upgrading the industrial structure and would help solve some of the deep-seated problems in China's industrial organizations: low standard, small-scale operations, inefficiency, overlapping industrial distribution and fragmentation. First of all, by reforming the import management system, we can create the conditions for extensively importing advanced foreign technology that is applicable in China and increasing the efficacy of technological application, which would spur technological advances in export industries and leading industries, speed up the upgrading of export products, and build future industries with a dynamic comparative advantage that are oriented to both the domestic and international markets. Second, introducing into China an appropriate measure of international competitive pressure would help put an end to a pattern common to industrial development in China; namely, small as well as large enterprises seeking to have a full lineup of products; eliminate inefficient and backward enterprises; hasten the adjustment of the existing volume of assets; and maximize comparative advantage by furthering participation in international division of labor. The end result would be to optimize resource allocation and steer China onto the road of intensive operations, which is the way to high-efficiency development. Third, introducing into China an appropriate degree of foreign competition would also help dismantle local barriers within the Chinese market, weaken local protectionism, and advance the rationalization of the pattern of regional distribution and the formation of a large nationwide, unified market, greatly checking project overlapping, import overlapping, and other unsound phenomena in economic construction. Fourth, although basic changes in the mechanism for forming and adjusting the industrial structure ultimately depend on the creation of a new market economy, a gradual effort to steer China's leading industries onto the road of open development is also a necessary requirement for the creation of a highly efficient mechanism for forming and adjusting the industrial structure as well as an efficient way to remove "existing structural pitfalls" in the near term. ("Existing structural pitfalls" refers to the phenomenon in which the structure of the existing volume of properties determines the structure of any additional properties, making the industrial structure even more irrational.) It can also further comprehensive reform relating to the direction of the domestic market. China has now adopted a policy of speeding up the creation of a socialist market economy. A new round of reform centered on public finance, banking, investment, and the management of public properties will lead to major changes in China's resource allocation mechanism. If import reform and the opening up of the market can be coordinated with and integrated into the new round of reform, we may possibly be able to eliminate the old industrial structure formation and adjustment mechanism and tentatively create a new one. If that should come to pass, deep-seated structural contradictions that have long plagued the national economy and their accompany problem of low profitability will largely be solved. Economic cyclical fluctuations, essentially a byproduct of those contradictions, and the resulting enormous waste of resources, will also correspondingly be held in check. When that happens, the upgrading of China's industries and the enhancement of its international competitiveness will be basically ensured. These are the objectives to strive for as we optimize the import mix and admit international competition into China in the 1990's. First, increase the proportion of advanced technology and equipment imports significantly to over 40 percent. Between 1978 and 1988 machinery and equipment imports accounted for 25.68 percent of all imports on the average. Corresponding figures for 1989 and 1990 were 30.8 percent and 33.0 percent, respectively, far below the 40 percent recorded between 1950 and 1965. Second, take measures consistent with GATT to check the importing of luxury consumer goods properly. Also, take effective steps to firmly prohibit imports through a variety of illicit channels, particularly smuggling in all shapes and forms. Third, decontrol importation in conjunction with import reform. Introduce into China a proper measure of foreign competition. Create an open resource allocation and industrial structure adjustment mechanism in most of the maturing light industries and textile industry and a few of the chemical and heavy industries. With such a mechanism, these industries will more fully participate in international division of labor and exchange in accordance with the principle of comparative advantage, thereby becoming the first in the nation to achieve the goal of internationalization. Fourth, by regularizing import management tools, we should gradually move toward the use of tariffs, general exceptions, and security exceptions authorized under GATT to regulate imports. A new import management system where the national industrial policy guides importation is the basic solution to the problems of duplicate importation and unplanned importation and other irrationalities in the import mix and will help reconcile competition with protection and hasten the development of national industries. The idea is to create a situation in which the import mix an industrial structure foster each other with good results, bringing an early end to the low standard of industrial organizations and the structural inefficiency in the national economy. To ensure the realization of the above objectives, we should pay attention to the following as we go about regularizing the import system and opening up the market: First, accelerate import reform. Replace without delay the existing import control measures which have not worked too well with a new set of practices that are effective and consistent with GATT rules. The technical adjustment of import control methods should be completed before the conclusion of the negotiations on China's accession to GATT, thus paving the way for the resumption of China's membership in GATT and further improving import management. Second, regularize economic tools such as tariffs and exchange rates. Lower the overall tariff level as appropriate to coincide with negotiations on the resumption of China's membership in GATT and the Uruguay round of talks. Moreover, adjust the tariff system with despatch and gradually abolish all sorts of illegal tariff waivers and cuts to set the stage for the elevation of tariffs into the principal tool of import regulation. Grasp the favorable opportunity to accelerate exchange rate reform and foreign exchange reform so that the current two tracks in the exchange system are merged into one as soon as possible and a regularized managed floating rate system is created. Third, create a mechanism that uses the industrial policy to guide importation. Under the new industrial policy, the intelligent adjustment of the foreign trade structure (including the import mix) has become a major objective. The key issue now is organization and implementation. The industrial policy must be coordinated with fiscal, financial, tax, investment, and foreign exchange policies and carried all the way through so that it truly guides the optimal allocation of resources and ensures the rationalization of the import mix. Fourth, immediately set up a security system to mitigate the negative effects of opening up the market. China should waste no time in creating an import security system in accordance with the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy provisions of GATT and its rules on dealing with a sharp increase in imports. To create such a system, we need to draw up anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations and safeguard provisions with despatch, set up a special agency to implement them, and reform and improve related social security policies at home. Only thus can we ensure a smooth transition to the adjustment of the industrial structure and reduce to a minimum the negative effects of opening up the market. Fifth, turning to the strategy of opening up the market, we must take pains to organically combine China-initiated market opening with negotiated market opening, incremental opening with wholesale opening, and opening with protection. First open up those industries that are already mature and are fairly competitive internationally while giving fledgling industries a transitional period. This is the only way to avoid the excessive social costs that may be incurred when the market is opened improperly and to ensure that some potential industries will not be deprived of a chance to survive and develop because the external impact has been too strong, even as we admit foreign competition into China and effectively accelerate the upgrading of the industries and the adjustment of the industrial structure. It needs to be emphasized that it is an extremely complex task to stimulate the adjustment of the industrial structure by decontrolling importation as appropriate and introducing foreign competition. There is a need to incorporate it into the overall planning for reform, opening, and modernization in the interest of design cohesiveness and push ahead with it in tandem with others. To sum up, the three strategic tasks central to the intelligent adjustment of the foreign trade structure are one major issue that must be tackled as part of the national industrial policy and national economic development. They can be realized over time only through the efforts of every sector under the centralized direction of the state. In conjunction with other comprehensive agencies concerned, agencies in charge of foreign economic relations and trade should waste no time in formulating a foreign trade policy for each particular industry to serve as a basis for solving the major issue. Cooperating actively with other departments, they should also aggressively ensure the implementation of the national industrial policy, particularly the foreign trade policy for each specific industry, so that foreign trade develops faster and better and contributes even more to modernization.
