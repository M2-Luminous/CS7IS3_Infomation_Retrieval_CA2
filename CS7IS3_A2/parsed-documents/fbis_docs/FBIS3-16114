Commenting on the outcome of his trip, the high-ranking Russian diplomat stated today in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent that at these meetings there was discussion of questions of a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We are now working on the idea of extending the experience of disengagement of forces on the lines of confrontation of Croats and Muslims to the Serbian-Muslim front. Disengagement of Serbian and Muslim units could be started with Maglaj, where the situation is the most complex. If this can be achieved on the whole line of combat operations, the war in Bosnia will be practically ended," Vitaliy Churkin said. [passage omitted]
