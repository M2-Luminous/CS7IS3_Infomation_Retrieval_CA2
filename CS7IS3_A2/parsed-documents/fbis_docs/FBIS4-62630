Argentina is a key Latin American state, and Russia is working to expand and establish contacts with regional political organizations and economic groups. Although no economic cooperation documents have been signed, it is not accidental Guido di Tella is accompanied by a large group of Argentinean businessmen. In the words of Secretary for Foreign Economic Relations of the Argentinean Foreign Ministry Jorge Campbell, the visit opens up broad prospects for the expansion of bilateral trade and economic cooperation in various spheres. When in St. Petersburg and Moscow the Argentinean businessmen met local entrepreneurs and were received by Deputy Russian Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Vladimir Karastin. Upon his return from St. Petersburg, Guido di Tella said that his ministry will render comprehensive political support to all new forms of bilateral trade and economic cooperation if the business community initiates the expansion of bilateral relations. The Russian-Argentinean diplomatic relations were established in 1885. Now that Argentina is a major member of the South American common market, Russian interest in this state has considerably increased. Argentina also has a large Russian diaspora. The Moscow documents is the basis and the upper part of the "bilateral cooperation iceberg", said Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev upon the completion of negotiations with his Argentinean colleague. Argentina is a member of the United Nations Security Council, and the Russian-Argentinean cooperation has both bilateral and global dimensions, he stressed. The Moscow visit of Guido di Tella is a landmark in bilateral and Russian-Latin American relations, he said. In his turn, the Argentinean foreign minister believes in the Russian future and considers the Russian Federation to be a great world power. The only thing necessary is to put the country in order and abstain from inventing new social systems, he said.
