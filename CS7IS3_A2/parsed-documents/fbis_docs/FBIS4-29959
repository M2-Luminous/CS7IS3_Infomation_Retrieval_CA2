The report recommends assignment of the highest priority to the building of "research and development infrastructure" projects such as data networks and data bases. It also lists as future development issues nine sectors such as data communications and energy and environmental technology. The guide identifies as important construction of technical infrastructure for MITI-sponsored national projects and Industrial Technology Institute-sponsored research and development project-related data networks and data bases and standards. Additionally, it recommends priority implementation of work in three sectors: 1) reinforcement of basic and creative research; 2) response to global and international issues such as the environment; and 3) research and development that aims at the enhancement of the public living standards and welfare. In the way of research and development organizations, the report recommends that the 15 national research agencies supervised by the Industrial Technology Institute be treated as the core organizations for experimentation (COE). It also points to the need to expand programs such as tax systems and fiscal investment and loan programs to assist in research and development work of the private sector.
