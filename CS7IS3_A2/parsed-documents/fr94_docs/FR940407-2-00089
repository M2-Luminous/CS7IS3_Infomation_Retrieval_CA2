FR940407-2-00089 FR940407-2-00049 (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.'' In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Administrator is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, the Administrator has the discretion to give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See David E. Trawick, D.D.S., 53 FR 5326 (1988). In this proceeding factors two, four and five apply. Factors two and four apply because Respondent prescribed numerous anorectic controlled substances to patients for weight reduction in violation of state law. Furthermore, Respondent issued these prescriptions under false pretenses by indicating on the prescriptions that they were issued for medical treatment other than weight reduction. Factor five is established based upon Respondent's material falsification of his application for a DEA Certificate of Registration, dated July 20, 1992. No evidence of explanation or mitigating circumstances has been offered by Respondent. Therefore, the Administrator concludes that Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration must be denied. Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that the application executed by Joseph Paul Mikalonis, M.D., on July 20, 1992, for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a practitioner, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective April 7, 1994. Dated: March 31, 1994. Thomas A. Constantine, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8287 Filed 4&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
