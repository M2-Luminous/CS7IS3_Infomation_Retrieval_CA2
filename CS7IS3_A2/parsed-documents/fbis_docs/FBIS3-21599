The agreement, intended to take effect from May, was sealed at talks in the Kremlin between Mr. Yeltsin, the Russian president, and John Major. Mr. Major hailed the move as a "remarkable and courageous" step which would have been inconceivable a few years ago. In immediate operational terms the declaration means little. But aside from its intended impact on Russian domestic opinion it is a powerful symbol of political change, marking the end of the nuclear confrontation that for the past 40 years has been used by successive British governments to justify spending billions of pounds on maintaining first V bombers, then submarines, on constant strategic alert. The Russians signed a similar deal with the Americans after President Clinton's visit to Moscow in January. British officials said yesterday that the momentum provided by the Anglo-Russian deal could help to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Britain and the former Red Army have also agreed, for the first time since the second world war, to hold joint military exercises in Russia and Britain next year. Whether they will include the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force has yet to be decided, but Mr. Major told Mr. Yeltsin that he would be happy to hold the first exercise, at battalion strength, in Britain. "This degree of military co-operation at this particular level is unprecedented," Mr. Major said at a glittering signing ceremony in the Red Room at the Kremlin. British Embassy officials said that the proposed de-targeting would cover both countries' entire stocks of strategic nuclear weapons. Long range ballistic missiles are aimed at programming their guidance computers with the geographical co-ordinates of the target, whether an enemy missile silo, a military command bunker or a city. However, the process probably takes only minutes -- perhaps seconds -- and it could be reversed in an equally short time. Britain's present nuclear force -- soon to be replaced by Trident -- consists of four Polaris missile submarines, one of which is always on patrol in the Atlantic. Each submarine carries 16 ballistic missiles, each with a range of 2,900 miles and a multiple Chevaline warhead designed to penetrate the former Soviet missile defences. Chevaline replaced a simpler warhead in the 1980's. Because the technical difficulties were underestimated, it cost far more than forecast. But it was pushed through because of a presumed need to meet the so-called "Moscow criterion" -- convincing the former Soviet leaders that if they attacked Britain they would not remain safe in their Moscow bunkers. A Polaris missile, with its new multiple warhead, including radar decoys, would always get through the anti-missile defences, however much they were improved. For some time now, threatening Moscow has ceased to be the decisive criterion of Britain's strategic deterrent policy. The Â£10 billion Trident submarine programme is being justified as insurance against deliberately unspecified threats, and perhaps even to deter Third World dictators who acquire nuclear weapons in the way that Saddam Hussein nearly did. However, with Nato officials increasingly worried that Russia may yet revert to an imperialist stance against neighbouring countries, Britain hopes that the move on missiles will have some symbolic significance within Russia. One British official said: "It sends a powerful signal that neither side considers the other adversaries." The British clearly hope that it will also help to undercut popular support for Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Liberal Democrat party, whose far-right expansionist doctrine has been based on the premise that the West is a sworn enemy of Russia. In an attempt to head off his internal critics, Mr. Yeltsin yesterday praised the "dynamics" of his own visit to Britain last year and this week's return trip by Mr. Major. He said de-targeting had been seen as "a hypothetical question for generations, possibly even centuries ahead. But now it is reality." He repeatedly assured Mr. Major in their talks that he was committed to moving ahead with the economic reform programme and he would not be put off by opposition from his parliament. The de-targeting follows Nato's decision in January to back a "partnership for peace" agreement giving the new eastern European democracies associated Nato status. Paradoxically, Moscow may never have been on the active target list, because although the Polaris force could in extremis be used independently by Britain, it has long been assigned to Nato. Its targets were chosen in the context of Nato's Nuclear Operations Plan, prepared by the Supreme Allied Commander's staff at Mons, Belgium, and as an adjunct to the U.S. Single Integrated Operational Plan drawn up in Omaha, Nebraska. Institutionally, removing Russia from the list does therefore make a considerable difference. The most fascinating question raised by yesterday's agreement is: what other targets, if any, will now be chosen as more appropriate? And will the computers' previous programmes be wiped out, or merely stored? Guardian Newspapers Limited, February 16, 1994
