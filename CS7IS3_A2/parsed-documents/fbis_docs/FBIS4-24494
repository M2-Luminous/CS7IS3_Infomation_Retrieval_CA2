FBIS4-24494 "drchi104_v_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 TAIWAN Cross-Strait Travel Security Negotiations Proposed Cross-Strait Travel Security Negotiations Proposed OW2805141994 Taipei CNA in English 1328 GMT 28 May 94 OW2805141994 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Flor Wang] [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- The Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on Saturday [28 May] sent a written message to Mainland China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) proposing negotiations be held in early June between the two sides on cross-strait travel security. SEF, the quasi-official organization in charge of civilian affairs between Taiwan and Mainland China, said in the message that the March 31 Qiandao Lake disaster and its mishandling by mainland authorities underscored the lack of an effective and immediate communication channel between the two sides when an accident occurs. Amid public outrage and criticism over the incident in Taiwan, SEF said the two sides should hold talks to devise a formula for Taiwan-Mainland China travel security, and to build a safer environment for cross-strait travel. In addition to the travel security issue, SEF, on May 25, proposed to hold negotiations with ARATS in early June on compensation for the 24 Taiwan tourists killed in the Qiandao Lake incident, but ARATS has yet to respond to the request.
