God willing, may it be a year full of success. Could you tell our listening friends what important projects were implemented by the Petroleum Ministry in 1372 [year beginning 21 March 1993]? [Aqazadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. I reciprocate new year's greetings to all our dear people and I hope that it will be a wonderful and constructive year for our country and people, God willing. Regarding the last (?two) years, we attained considerable success in 1372, which can be presented in the form of a list: --The exploration of the Darkhovin reserves, which has approximately 9 billion barrels of very superior quality light oil. --The discovery of a new gas reserve with 20 trillion cubic feet [as heard] of gas with very rich deposits. --Regarding drilling, fortunately we have attained a wonderful drilling record since the Revolution: 300,000 meters on the nationally. --In the field of crude oil production, we have raised Iran's production capacity to over 4 million barrels. The war caused extensive damage to the crude oil production industry. Fortunately, we were able to carry out repairs and reconstruction and raise our production from 2.5 million barrels at that time to 4 million. --Regarding infrastructural projects, one of our most remarkable achievements was the inauguration -- in the presence of the esteemed president -- of the Arak Refinery with a capacity of 150,000 barrels and of one of the greatest petrochemical units of the country, namely the Arak petrochemical complex with a capacity of approximately 250,000 petrochemicals, including light and heavy polyethylene, and propylene. --In the field of gas piping, in 1372 we were able to install 250,000 gauges in the houses of the people, and by activating a new phase of the Kangan Refinery we were able to raise its output to more than 55 million cubic meters. --Fortunately, we were successful in expanding our gas piping activities in various cities, and in 1372 200 cities had been covered by piped gas or activities for expanding the gas piping network had been initiated, which was a massive and valuable project performed by the National Gas company. --With all the deficiencies and shortcomings, it was an appropriate performance compared to other years for the National Distribution Company [NDC]. Fortunately, we did not experience any fuel shortages in the colder areas of the country, such as in East and West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Kermanshah, and Kordestan Provinces. The situation was most satisfactory throughout the country, compared to all the years since the Revolution. This made it possible to have a very rare situation countrywide, and except for some temporary shortages in some cities, the situation was most satisfactory. Fortunately, with the signatures of most of the deputies and their appreciation of its services, the NDC was able to plan its activities for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994] in such a manner that we can resolve the problem of transporting fuel permanently, God willing. These activities are a brief account of our projects in 1372. Regarding the sale of crude oil and our presence in international markets, the situation in the first six months of this year regarding prices and sales were favorable and in accordance with what had been envisaged in the budget. However, in the second half of the year, with a slump in oil prices, our income decreased. In general, we had an oil income of $13.5 billion, which was $3 billion less than the forecasts. In view of the situation in the international market, this level of income was quite appropriate and we were able to adhere to the production ceilings stipulated by OPEC, as well as to organize our exports within that framework in an excellent manner without any retail problems. [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, could you tell us what programs you envision for 1373? If, God willing, you have any glad tidings for our compatriots, do let us know. [Aqazadeh] I may state that since the development and distribution of oil and gas, the expansion of the petrochemical complexes is the priority of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We are optimistic that new oil derricks that have been set up for exploration in the Caspian Sea will become operational next year. In addition, we will begin drilling wells in the eastern Mazandaran Sea region, which is one of the most suitable sites in the country, even though it has not been explored in the past years. Our prospecting activities will continue in the Persian Gulf and [words indistinct] fortunately, we have decided that the planning and construction of this refinery will be done completely by Iranians. This work will begin in 1373 and it is hoped it will be operational in 1375 [year beginning 21 March 1996]. A very important piece of news for our people is the value-added [arzesh-afzudeh] importance of this unit, as well as the magnitude of the production of the vast Bandar-e Imam complex. The glad tidings I have for the people are that this massive complex, which is the largest petrochemical production unit in our country and covers all branches, such as light and heavy polyethylene, propylene, EDC, PVC [preceding acronyms in English], as well as all other petrochemical products, is expected to begin full operation in Khordad [22 May-21 June] this year. With these complexes going into operation, we will not only be able to attain self-sufficiency in most petrochemical departments but will also be able to export $300 million worth of these products this year. This is also good news for the factories that provide the raw materials for the petrochemical complexes, and they should not have any doubts regarding the sale of their products because we will ensure high-quality production at an international standard and will thus permanently eliminate the problems that they have experienced for so many years regarding petrochemical imports and fluctuations in foreign exchange income. On the gas piping situation, as in the past years, we will expand these activities in various cities of the country, which is our priority. We hope that this year more cities in the colder areas of our country will join the gas piping network. With the functioning of the Sarkhun Refinery in Bandar-e 'Abbas, which has a capacity of approximately 15 million cubic meters of gas per day, we will be able to cater to the needs of the Hormozgan, especially of the Kerman Province, its power station, the peripheral copper industries, the Sarcheshmeh copper complex, and the cities on this route right up to Kerman. This will open a new chapter in the piping of gas. With the development of the refinery and its operation, especially of the (Karkehraker) unit in Abadan that distills furnace oil and its products such as gasoline, gas oil, and kerosene, we are extremely optimistic that 1373 will be a wonderful year for our people regarding the provision of their fuel product requirements. I predict that in the oil industry 1373 will be a grand year for production, foreign exchange earnings, and the increase in the efficiency of this great industry of the country. Once again, I wish to convey my greetings for this new year to the people, especially to my colleagues in the petroleum industry who have behind them a successful year, and I hope that this year they will make the same sublime efforts so that the country is steered toward economic and political self-sufficiency. [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, I am extremely grateful that you have given some of your time for us, despite your engagements. We hope you will be successful and that in the course of the year 1373 we will be able to be at your service again. [Aqazadeh] Likewise, I am grateful for your efforts and those of your colleagues at the radio [station] for preparing and presenting such joyful, wonderful, and useful programs. [Correspondent] May you be successful, God willing.
