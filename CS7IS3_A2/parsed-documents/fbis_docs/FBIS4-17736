According to Stanislav Kramarenko, FITUR political leaders find themselves "in a difficult situation" because they are getting numerous cables and letters from primary trade union organizations in which the signing of the memorandum "is hedged" with the most varied demands. In a number of trade union organizations, the adviser thinks, the "civic accord" notion is interpreted as "accord in the area of a single approach to economic reforms," although it implies a treaty of principles between public and political organizations on the existence together with power structures without a rigid standoff and upheavals. In this situation, according to the adviser, the FITUR political leadership proceeds from the fact that trade unions are supposed to state their readiness to conduct with the current president, government, Federal Assembly, the State Duma, as well as with the other participants in the agreement, a constructive dialogue on a platform of civic accord. The FITUR leadership also believes that "the most important interests of working people can be protected only within the framework of a powerful state," the adviser stated. At the same time, Stanislav Kramarenko underscored that the agreement "should not be signed at the expense of working people's interests." For his part, FITUR Chairman Mikhail Shmakov passed on the main remarks and proposals to Boris Topornin, chairman of the public chamber under the president, and, during a recent meeting with Boris Yeltsin confirmed, the need for their inclusion in the text of the memorandum. Among these proposals, perhaps the main ones are to ensure the implementation of the principles of social partnership detailed in the General Agreement between the trade unions, employers, and the government; to follow an active social policy aimed at "stabilization and subsequent raising of people's living standards; adapting the able-bodied population to new economic conditions..." If these proposals go through, Stanislav Kramarenko thinks, FITUR-member trade unions would fundamentally have no special remarks to make about the other sections of the memorandum. Besides, "in a bid to strike off many existing trade union demands" the federation leaders insist on the inclusion in the text of the agreement, in the item on pledges by trade unions and their amalgamations, "not to hold and not to participate in organizing strikes aimed at redistributing budget funds," an amendment -- "after the budget has been approved." Virtually all Federation trade unions now vigorously uphold this amendment because in this case they reserve the right to collective actions, including strikes, before the budget has been approved. According to a FITUR information and analysis center report, the Federation General Council's executive committee made a decision late last night "to form a delegation for the signing of the memorandum."
