Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he had held good and constructive talks with Syrian and Israeli officials. He said that during the talks he discussed with them several proposals for making headway on the Syrian-Israeli track of the Middle East peace negotiations. He voiced optimism despite some difficult points which have to be discussed further between the two parties. He explained that the two sides have divergent views as well as convergent ones, saying, "we will continue talks for making progress on all tracks for a settlement." Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa of Egypt, who was on hand to welcome his U.S. counterpart, said that Egyptian President Husni Mubarak will later tonight meet Christopher on the outcome of his shuttle between Syria and Israel. The U.S. official has been touring the Middle East region in the past two days, bringing into sharper focus the need to bridge the difference of the viewpoints between Syria and Israel in a bid to get the peace drive off the ground again, and making new offers to both countries. During Christopher's last trip to the region for peace between Syria and Israel, Israel offered Syria a withdrawal plan to be completed within eight years without committing to a full withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights. However, Syria has insisted on a full Israeli withdrawal to be completed within a period of three years. Israel has been criticizing Syria for not clearly expounding the concept of peace it demands.
