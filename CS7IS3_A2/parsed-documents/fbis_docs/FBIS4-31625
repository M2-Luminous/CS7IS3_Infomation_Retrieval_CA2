Bogdanovic said this during talks with representatives of the "Min" mechanical engineering factory in Nis (Serbia). The United Nations in May 1992 imposed comprehensive sanctions against Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in the civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. President Clinton was actually threatening the Bosnian Moslems when he spoke of the lifting of the sanctions against Yugoslavia, according to Slobodan Rakitic, opposition Depos [Democratic Movement of Serbia] bloc deputy in the Yugoslav Parliament. "The sanctions against Yugoslavia will be softened if a Moslem-Croat federation rejects a peace plan," a statement signed by Rakitic on behalf of a group of Depos MPs said. Clinton's statement could be understood as a kind of confession that neither the introduction of sanctions had depended on Serbia, Montenegro and the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.), the statement also said. "If the lifting of the sanctions is announced now as punishing the Moslems for disobedience, then the introduction was a reward to a Moslem-Croat coalition for their war option," the announcement said. Delegations of the Moslem-Croat Federation and of the Bosnian Serb republic signed on Wednesday in Geneva a one-month ceasefire accord, althouth the Serb side was for a one-year cessation of hostilities, estimating that a one-month ceasefire is too short for finding a political settlement to end the Bosnian war.
