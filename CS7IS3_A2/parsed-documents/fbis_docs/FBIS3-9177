Kostic report: "Farmers' Apprehensions"] [Excerpts] The second springtime sowing under the international sanctions has started, with much apprehension being felt among the farmers. It seems that the primeval fear of heaven's (dis)favor is the least present among them, because other hardships accompanying their work are as just difficult and dangerous. According to the adopted balance of energy supplies, it is necessary to provide around 120,000 metric tons of oil for the farming work that should be carried out in the first half of the year. In happy times that amount would be no problem. Now, because of the unprecedented embargo imposed on Yugoslavia, the importation of oil derivatives, except meager amounts through the black market, has been made totally impossible, while the home manufacturers are hardly capable of meeting one fourth of the needs.

There is no second chance for those who miss the best time for sowing, provided that the weather is favorable as well. Last fall over 300,000 hectares were sown with wheat. Thanks to the mild "poor people's winter," as farmers put it, crops have welcomed the first warm days in quite a good condition, but now mineral fertilizers are needed to boost nutrition. However, it is well-known that there is a shortage of fertilizers. The importance of reinforced nutrition is shown by the fact that one kilogram of fertilizer quintuples the wheat yield. [passage omitted] The sowing of sugar beet is in full swing, but few people believe that the 100,000 hectares that farmers are hoping for will be sowed with that plant. [passage omitted]
