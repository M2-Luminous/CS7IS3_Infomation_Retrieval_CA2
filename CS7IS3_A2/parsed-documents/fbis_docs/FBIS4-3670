Yi Hoe-chang, chosen as the prime minister last December, suddenly tendered his resignation Friday to the president who immediately appointed Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and National Unification Board (NUB) minister, to fill the vacant. The new appointment is subject to approval by the national assembly which is expected to endorse it next Monday. Yi Hoe-chang's resignation came just one day after he lashed out the decision-making process of President Kim's administration. Yi Hoe-chang, who is called "Mr. Bamboo" for his uncompromising character, reportedly became furious when he was left in the dark about a major change in the government policy on the nuclear issue of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) at a recent strategy meeting. The meeting, named the policy coordinating conference, opened under instruction from the president in response to the media and public criticism of the government's "inconsistency" in security policies. The meeting, which was held on April 15, decided that South Korea would withdraw unconditionally its demand on an inter-Korean envoy exchange as a pre-condition for the DPRK to hold further talks with the United States at high level. Yi Hoe-chang also complained, apparently targeting the presidential staff, that a policy decision on the acceptance of all the DPRK's "escapees in Pyongyang-run logging camps" in Russia, who wish to settle in South Korea, was leaked to the press even before it was formally adopted by the cabinet. On the other hand, Yi himself initiated steps to control the so- called "safe houses," which are owned by police and other investigating authorities, without consulting the presidential office, which was reportedly annoyed by the presidential office. A presidential official said the president's swift acceptance of Yi's resignation could be seen as a "dismissal." Kim said on several occasions that under the presidential government system, only the president is responsible for major state affairs. The replacement of Yi, however, is expected to arouse strong criticisms on what the opposition calls Kim's "one-man rule," political analysts here said. The democratic party, South Korea's major opposition, said that it regretted Yi's resignation after having been held in checks by his rivals. The dismissal of Yi, who had served as chairman of the board of audit and inspection until last December, spearheaded the non-military president's campaign to tighten his control of political power, the analysts noted.
