The Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] had also successfully carried out its missions and closed earlier. The two annual sessions are an important matter in the political life of the Chinese people and important meetings for promoting economic development and social progress in China. This year's two sessions were convened under the favorable conditions of sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and China's efforts to push forward the reform of economic structure. The two sessions held high the grand banner of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, upheld the party's basic line, conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress, and proposed valuable opinions and made important decisions on reform and development for 1994. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the overall situation in the work of the entire party and state. The sessions thoroughly discussed and spoke highly of this overall situation proposed by the central authorities. All localities, units, and sectors around the country should serve and be subject to this overall situation in their work. Economic construction is the center of all work. Reform and opening up are the driving forces for development; development and reform are the basis for social stability and the state's long-term peace and stability; stability is the prerequisite for developing the economy and promoting reform. As long as we correctly recognize and handle the relations between reform, development, and stability; notice new situations and resolve new problems in a timely manner; and coordinate reform, development, and stability and make them promote each other, our modernization drive will win a new victory. Maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development is the aspiration of the people around the country, as well as a pressing need for the domestic and international situations. The sessions fully discussed, in dialectical terms, the relations among sustentation, rapidity, and healthiness in the course of economic development. It is necessary to deepen reform, open up wider, strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, vigorously readjust economic structure, promote technical progress, actively develop markets, and control inflation in this year's economic work, and we should virtually change our concepts for improving economic efficiency and should by no means resume the course of blindly pursuing output value, speed, and the expansion of investment scale. This is an important factor determining whether there will be healthy economic development. We should correctly analyze and have a clear understanding of the situation -- not only the favorable conditions, but also the adverse factors -- and do our best to maintain a vigorous and stable growth rate in line with reality. The wheel of reform is driving China's economy and various undertakings to a bright future, and people of all nationalities in China have deep feelings for reform. The Chinese people shall achieve two major objectives by the end of this century, one is to achieve the second-step strategic objective of socialist modernization and to achieve a comfortable living standard, the other is to preliminarily establish a socialist market economic structure. The attainment of these two objectives relies on reform. In promoting this year's reform, we must integrate the work of making significant breakthroughs with the work of promoting reform as a whole. The tasks are arduous and strenuous as we should not only push reform forward amid the speedy economic operation, but also maintain stability and development in the accelerating transformation of systems. To complete this year's reform missions, we should not only strengthen our confidence and adopt a scientific attitude, but also remain sober-minded and do a solid job. The two sessions have closed. As the guidelines of the sessions are conveyed and implemented, China's basic principles, policies, and measures for this year's economic work and various undertakings shall strike root more deeply in the hearts of the people and the overall situtation characterized by reform, development, and stability shall become the common ground of hundreds of millions of people. The current situation is good and the opportunity is rare. Under the guidance of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, let people of all nationalities across the country unite together with one heart and one mind and follow the course charted by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line to complete this year's tasks in reform and development and win a new victory in socialist modernization drive!
