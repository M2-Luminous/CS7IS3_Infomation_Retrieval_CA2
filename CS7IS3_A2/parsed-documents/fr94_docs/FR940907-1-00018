SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 25, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 14290) proposing to establish equipment standards, performance standards, and procedures for security against acts of terrorism on certain passenger vessels and associated passenger terminals. Passenger vessels of over 100 gross tons carrying more than 12 passengers on voyages of over 24 hours on the high seas and the associated passenger terminals would have been affected. These rules appeared necessary because of a lack of voluntary compliance with measures of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) published in 1986, or with these measures published as Coast Guard ``guidelines'' in 1987. In response to requests for further time to file comments on the proposed rule, the Coast Guard is reopening the comment period through November 30, 1994. It is also holding three public hearings. Written Comments The notice of proposed rulemaking published on March 25, 1994, invited and encouraged interested persons to participate in the rulemaking by submitting written comments, including views, data, and arguments, by June 23, 1994. Two organizations representing multiple members of the affected industry sought further time to file comments, citing both the need to assess current practices and compare them with the requirements in the proposed rule and the difficulty of preparing meaningful responses within the original 90-day comment period. Because of these requests, the comment period is reopened through November 30, 1994. Comments should include the name and address of the person making them, identify this rulemaking [CGD 91&hyph;012] and the specific section of the proposed rule to which each comment applies, and give reasons for each comment. Anyone wishing an acknowledgment of receipt of comment should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard. The proposed rule may be changed in light of comments received. All comments received during the comment period will be considered before final action is taken on the proposed rule. Public Hearing Several parties sought public hearings so they could present spoken comments. The proposed rule was responsive to the IMO's resolution in 1986 concerning security of passenger vessels and associated passenger terminals. In their requests for public hearings, however, several parties alleged that the rule would have a significant, negative effect on the passenger vessel industry and that they could state their cases better orally than in writing. Public hearings will therefore be held on the dates and at the hours indicated above under DATES and at the sites indicated above under ADDRESSES. Interested persons are invited to participate in these hearings. Each person wishing to make an oral statement should register by Monday, September 12, 1994. Oral statements by any persons previously unregistered will be allowed only if time permits. The Coast Guard reserves the right to impose time limits on oral presentations. It also reserves the right to close parts of the meetings to enable candor in the treatment of security against acts of terrorism. To register, write, telefax, or call the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA, 3406) [CGD 91&hyph;012], U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001; telephone number (202) 267&hyph;1477, telefax number (202) 267&hyph;0506.
