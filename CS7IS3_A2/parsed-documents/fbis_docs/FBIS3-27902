"Seoul and Beijing have agreed to sign the agreement on cultural exchanges and are now negotiating details of the agreement. The agreement is to be initialed in February and is likely to be signed officially in March," the official said. "China sent a draft agreement to Seoul and we delivered our reply, and recently China returned its revised draft. The drafts of both countries are nearly similar, so the agreement will be initialed by the end of February," he said. It usually takes a month from initialing an agreement to its formal signing, so Seoul and Beijing are expected to sign the accord formally in March. "The agreement refers to cooperation in many areas like culture, art, academics, education and sports and it will serve as momentum to boost cultural exchanges between Korea and China, which have shared close cultural exchanges over thousands of years," the official said. The agreement stipulates that the two countries set up a Korea-China cultural joint committee, which will deal with details on cultural exchanges. "Once the agreement is signed, the two nations will undertake joint projects such as restoration of old buildings in China," the official said. Before the Seventh Century, Koreans controlled a great deal of Northeastern China, so many Korean cultural assets exist in the region.
