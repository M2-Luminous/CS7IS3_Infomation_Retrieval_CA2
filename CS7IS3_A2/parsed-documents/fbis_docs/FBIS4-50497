Taiwan registered a surplus of US$2.47 billion in its farm trade with Japan last year, up 14.9 percent from that recorded in 1987, the cabinet-level agency said. Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan grew at an average of 1.6 percent annually between 1987 and 1993, with the amount rising from US$2.49 billion to US$2.74 billion, according to DGBAS statistics. Farm imports from Japan, however, declined 18 percent during the seven-year period to US$270 million for 1993, the directorate said. While two-way trade between Taiwan and Japan has continued expanding, the share of agricultural products in total bilateral trade has declined steadily, DGBAS officials said. Farm goods accounted for 30.6 percent of Taiwan's total exports to Japan in 1993, down 5 percent from the percentage registered in 1987. The farm goods ratio to Taiwan's total imports from Japan also dropped to 1.2 percent last year from 2.8 percent in 1987. Husbandry goods, pork in particular, formed the bulk of Taiwan's farm exports to Japan, accounting for 46.3 percent of the total last year. Aquacultural products followed at 34 percent. Taiwan has incurred a huge trade deficit in its overall trade with Japan as it has relied heavily on Japan for the supply of machinery, parts and industrial materials. Taiwan registered a record trade deficit of US$14.2 billion with Japan in 1993 and the amount is expected to surge further to a new high of US$16 billion this year. The trade imbalance already hit US$4.96 billion in the first four months of this year, according to customs tallies.
