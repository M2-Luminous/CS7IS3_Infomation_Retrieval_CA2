SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated March 10, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq. ), as follows: I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, resulting from a series of severe and prolonged winter storms on January 4, through and including February 25, 1994, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the Common-wealth of Pennsylvania. In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes, such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses. You are authorized to provide reimbursement for emergency protective measures and the repair of public utilities under the Public Assistance program in the designated areas. Other assistance under Public Assistance may be added at a later date, if warranted. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs. The time period prescribed for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 US.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date of this declaration. Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint Robert J. Gunter of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act as the Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster. I do hereby determine the following areas of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to have been affected adversely by this declared major disaster: Adams, Allegheny, Berks, Bucks, Carbon, Chester, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Fayette, Franklin, Greene, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Montgomery, Northampton, Northumberland, Philadelphia, Schuylkill, Snyder, Union, Washington, Westmoreland, and York Counties for reimbursement for emergency protective measures and the repair of public utilities under the Public Assistance program in the designated areas.
