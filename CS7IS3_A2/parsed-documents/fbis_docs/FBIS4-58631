The clashes began in the districts of Raniyah and Qal'at Dizah. Both parties used various kinds of weapons, and many people were killed or wounded on both sides. A number of innocent citizens were killed, and their houses were demolished. Fighting extended to the city of al-Sulaymaniyah, killing or wounding many people. The situation in al-Sulaymaniyah resembles a state of curfew. Detachments from both sides erected control points on most roads in and outside al-Sulaymaniyah. Many residents of al- Sulaymaniyah left their homes and fled to adjacent areas in the belief that they are more secure. In the Dahuk governorate, Mas'ud Barzani's group occupied the headquarters of Jalal Talabani's group in all towns in Dahuk, Zakho, al-'Imadiyah, and 'Aqrah, detaining their residents and impounding their weapons. In the governorate of Irbil, both sides yesterday exchanged fire in Shaqlawah, the district of al-Siddiq, and Hajj 'Umran. People who fled the area said that despite the calls made by the cliques of saboteurs to halt fighting, there is still continuous shooting between the two sides. The leaders of saboteurs failed to address the situation, which was coupled with cuts in the electric power and drinking water as well as burglaries and looting of citizens' homes and properties.
