In statements to AL-RA'Y, Hurani observed that the PLO's bylaws state that the Executive Committee quorums are met by the attendance of two thirds of its membership -- 12 out of 18 members. Six members have boycotted its meetings since last September over the Oslo agreement. He indicated that the bylaws also provide that if the 12-member quorum failed to materialize, a meeting may be set for the following day, with the attendance of half the committee members of nine plus one. Accordingly, any session to which fewer than 10 members report is deemed illegal. I suggested to him that this had been practice even before the Oslo agreement and was nothing new to the Executive Committee meetings. Hurani agreed, but noted that the decisions under consideration by the Executive Committee this time are crucial. He called the Cairo agreement an offspring of the Oslo accord, and contended that it yielded further ground to the Israelis. An assertive and vigorous popular action in the occupied territories, rather than smartness and skill at the negotiating table, can call a halt to these concessions, Hurani maintained. The PLO Executive Committee member, who is viewed as an independent, said he was not surprised by the Cairo agreement, seeing that it is substantially covered by the Oslo accord. The Cairo agreement simply spelled out certain details. The series of Palestinian concessions also did not come as a surprise to me, Hurani added. Criticisms and opposition, he said, must focus mainly on the root of the problem and that is the Oslo accord. Unless the Palestinian leadership rethinks the core of its position, the string of concessions seems unlikely to stop there. It has made a series of retreats on the boundaries, the crossings, the area of the Jericho enclave, Jewish settlements, and security. [passage omitted]
