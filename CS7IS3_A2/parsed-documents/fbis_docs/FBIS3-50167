How has this fact contributed to the development of bilateral relations? [Rumenovski] For the past two years, Bulgarian-Macedonian relations have been developing positively. Bulgaria's recognition of the Republic of Macedonia was welcomed with esteem and gratitude both at the highest level and by all the Macedonian people, as well as by all the remaining citizens of the republic, as you know well. Furthermore, this act acted as a stimulus for developing mutual contacts in specific fields. [passage omitted] [Boyadzhieva] Has the position that Greece has adopted regarding the name of the Republic of Macedonia hampered the young state from establishing itself internationally? [Rumenovski] The Republic of Macedonia is an equal member of the world community and the United Nations. It has received international recognition from over 50 countries, most of which have established diplomatic relations. These include all the members of the European Union, China, Russia, Japan, and others. Macedonia does not threaten any of its neighbors. Our independence and international recognition are not a cause of instability. Quite the contrary, we have demonstrated -- and the world is convinced of it -- that an independent Macedonia is a factor that prevents the war from spreading. The Macedonian state is a key factor for Balkan peace and stability. If I have to give a specific answer, it is certainly true that Greece's position delayed the process of recognizing Macedonia but failed to halt it. This is an irreversible process because Macedonia is established as an entity in international law. [Boyadzhieva] Bulgarian-Macedonian relations are developing well at the personal level. What is hindering them from developing better at the interstate level? The position adopted by official representatives in Skopje is strange, to put it mildly, especially regarding the two countries' histories. [Rumenovski] I would not completely agree with this assessment. On the contrary, official political contacts are developing well, as I mentioned previously. With no other neighboring country is the Republic of Macedonia developing such lively political contacts. Many ministries maintain regular contacts between one another. Our Foreign Ministries hold periodical consultations. However, the political will for cooperation is not being sufficiently well expressed in concrete terms. The reason for this is that the legal basis for our relations has not yet been developed. Many bilateral agreements are in the process of preparation. We have already concluded an agreement on economic and commercial cooperation, a consular agreements, and so on. As far as history is concerned, it is possible that the picture seems like this from Sofia's viewpoint. This is understandable, because many things have been inherited from the old system and prejudices have accumulated over the years. Both sides have a lot of work to do on overcoming these viewpoints, and this will be achieved by developing cooperation in all spheres, thus strengthening the trust between the two countries. Similarly, it is normal to expect that the contradictions and differences of view in this direction will be overcome. [Boyadzhieva] Bulgaria has opened its embassy in Skopje. Will Skopje respond by making a similar gesture, and how will this contribute to bilateral contacts? [Rumenovski] The establishment of diplomatic relations between Macedonia and Bulgaria was reciprocal. On 21 December 1993, the two Foreign Ministries exchanged notes on raising the consulates general in Skopje and Sofia to the level of embassies. The raising of our interstate relations to the highest level will certainly speed up and enrich both the development of Macedonian-Bulgarian relations and understanding and friendship between our two peoples. In the very near future, Macedonia will seek approval for its first ambassador in Sofia. This will open a new page in the relations between the two countries and peoples.
