During the assessment of the current sugar harvest in the southeastern region, Lage presented to Granma the banners acknowledging the province as the best of three during the first 10 days of April. Reporter Jorge Luis Batista has a recording by Lage on this matter: [Begin Lage recording] A political message of a sugar harvest that is beginning to recover is a very positive political message, one that helps and encourages us to tackle the situation and to confront the daily difficulties. I don't know whether I need to make a call for a final effort, because the appraisal that we have from all comrades is that the maximum effort is being made. The call must be to maintain that maximum effort during this harvest, because this is what will bring the nation resources, although these resources will be very limited because the harvest is still limited. Nevertheless, I am leaving with the conviction that the three provinces being assessed will fulfill their objectives -- especially Granma, because I had the opportunity to listen to the directors of the different complexes and I think the people are making the efforts that are necessary for the Revolution.
