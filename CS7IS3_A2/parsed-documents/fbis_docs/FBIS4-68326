V. Boykov, V. F. Galazin, Ye. V. Korablev; UDC 528.225:629.783] [Abstract] In the 1970's and 1980's, the Main Directorate for Geodesy and Cartography set out to revamp the state geodesic network. That task has been helped considerably by satellite geodesy, which, over the past 25 years, has involved three main areas: the development and observation of passive satellites such as Pageos, Lageos, and Etalon; the development and observation of satellites such as Geo-IK; and the use of satellite navigation systems such as GLONASS and GPS. This paper examines the results of the use of the domestic Geo-IK satellites, which were used in 1977, 1985, and 1990 to ascertain the geodesic parameters of the Earth, i.e., the main astronomical and geodesic constants; the characteristics of the coordinate base; and planetary models of normal and anomalous gravitational fields of the Earth and local gravitational-field characteristics. The Geo-IK has been used in efforts to make the GLONASS- and GPS-system coordinates compatible. NPO Applied Mechanics is developing the new Geo-IK-2, whose capabilities will include accuracies to centimeters rather than meters. Figures 1.
