The scenario is that trade frictions between Japan and the United States go from bad to worse and that the two countries square off not only on trade but also in other fields as well. The opinion gains ground in the United States that Japan has been getting a free ride on defense from the United States and that there is no need to protect such a country. Animosity becomes mutual. Nationalistic sentiment gains the upper hand in Japan as well. The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is discussed simply on an emotional plane, resulting in dire consequences, the scenario goes. The Japanese Government thinks that strains between the two countries should by all means be confined to trade alone. It is so worried as to be very jittery about their spreading to security issues. Inasmuch as the cold war has ended and the U.S. security strategy toward Japan based on the perceived threat from the Soviet Union has changed, however, a fresh study should be conducted as to whether the security arrangements between Japan and the United States ought to remain as they are, regardless of the direction that trade problems take. In a recent book, George Kennan, a former U.S. diplomat who has closely watched the world for the 50 years since World War II, writes about Japan-U.S. relations that, with the end of the cold war, the initial raison d'etre for the present defense agreements has been lost. (It should not be forgotten, though, that some remain as long as the problem of North Korea's effort to develop nuclear weapons is not solved.) Kennan says that, being a layman, he does not know whether the Japanese Government wants to retain these military agreements unchanged. If it does not, there is no clear reason for keeping them in the present form, he says. The United States should willingly accept their abrogation or revision, Kennan says. The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and its ancillary agreements are products of a bipolar world centered on the United States and the former Soviet Union. Consequently, although problems may remain on the Korean peninsula, the end of the cold war made the original reasons for their existence irrelevant, as Kennan says. In discussing the security arrangements, both the proponents and the opponents of the maintenance of those arrangements should start by facing up to that fact. When the reason for the existence of something disappears or changes, normally a fresh look is taken at its continuation. That ought to be true of our security treaty as well. Because the biggest country targeted militarily by that treaty has collapsed, the first question that must be asked is what is the target of the treaty. The question is whether the target is still the former Soviet Union or new threats from some other countries, and how far Japan and the United States should go in taking joint action against that threat. As far as is known from the United States' new international strategy, U.S. military interest has shifted from the former Soviet Union to various regional conflicts. In particular, the new focal points are the Middle East (especially Iraq) and Asia (notably North Korea). The role played by the U.S. troops in Japan has also changed. Greater importance is being attached to their role of military logistical support for dealing with regional conflicts, rather than as the forward base closest to the Soviet Union and the defense of Japan in case of possible contingencies in this country. In fact, the U.S. Forces in Japan played a major part in the Persian Gulf war. The center of gravity of our security treaty has shifted. It seems that security in the countries of Asia and the Middle East has assumed greater importance, taking up the slack in the security needs of Japan. Also, the regions that have newly assumed importance include some areas to which the security treaty did not give any consideration at all when it was signed. The Japanese and U.S. Governments should grope for a new framework for security in Asia after making clear how the picture has changed. Otherwise, the theory of "Japan getting a free ride" that is now held by some Americans will gain momentum and could lead to a depth of irreparable misunderstanding before we are aware of it.
