The NSP will also open offices to receive reports on such crimes in five major cities--Seoul and port cities of Pusan, Inchon, Cheju and Masan. An NSP spokesman said that the agency's move is to counter effectively the growing number of international organized crimes which occurred in the country recently. It is seen as part of the agency's effort to suit itself to the changing political and economic atmosphere. The NSP will fight against such crimes in the context of national security, said the spokesman. The spokesman said the newly established information center absorbs the "counter-narcotics information center" initiated last June. Last year, the counter-narcotics center collected over 300 pieces of drug-related information and distributed them to the prosecution, police and foreign intelligence agencies, according to the spokesman.
