In addition, memoranda about the agreement for a joint gas pipeline between the two countries have also been signed. Members of the agreement expressed satisfaction at the cooperation between the two countries. In the joint communique released by the two countries, emphasis was placed on stopping the atrocities being committed on the people of Kashmir and on respecting human rights. They emphasized that the Kashmir issue be resolved according to the UN resolution. This communique strongly demanded that efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue be accelerated. The joint communique asked that the opposing groups in Afghanistan stop fighting. It accentuated the importance of lasting peace in the Middle East, as well as cooperation and agreement among Muslim religious leaders. The joint communique from Iran and Pakistan is proof of past relations between the two countries. If we look at it within the framework of the present situation in the world it is very important, because the international situation at present shows a lot of unrest in the Islamic world because of the conspiracies of the Hindus and Jews against Muslims. The Indian atrocities in Kashmir, the massacre of Muslims in Bosnia, and the Jewish aggression against the Muslims in Palestine are problems which we can resolve by working together. Wherever the Muslims live now, there are economic and social problems. The non-Muslims also have a monopoly over trade and commerce. From the perspective of resources, Muslims are not behind in any country; however, the disagreements and minor scuffles among the Pakistani nations, as well as the unnecessary confrontation, have stopped Islam from making an important place for itself in the world. Even today, if Muslim nations cooperate with each other in economic and social areas, no power in the world can insult them. It is our misfortune that we have to depend on non-Muslims to obtain modern technology. If we sign mutual agreements for exchange of technology, then we will not have to look at anyone else. Iran, after the 1979 Islamic revolution, started to use its own resources. Soon after this revolution, the imperialists forced a war on Iran. Still, after this long war, Iran managed to keep its economic and social conditions under control. All this happened because of its strong faith, which was helped by the grace of Allah. Imam Khomeini once said that neither the United States nor communism were superpowers; only God is the superpower. If we trust someone else, then our faith is weak. In light of Imam Khomeini's statement, Iran confronted a major superpower, which influenced politics worldwide. It is a welcome development that the Muslim nations are also changing slowly, and that an atmosphere of mutual cooperation is increasing. This will help us to at least escape the control of foreigners. Relations between Pakistan and Iran for the last half century have prepared Pakistan to openly trust the Iranian Government and the people there. The people of Pakistan declare Iran their second home; similarly, our brothers in Iran consider Pakistan their second home. We pray the agreements made between the two countries will last until the end of the world, and that friendly relations between the governments and the people of Iran and Pakistan will never end.
