FR941006-1-00078 FR941006-1-00015 B. Qualified Campaign Expenses 1. Funding General Election Expenses with Primary Funds The Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act, and Commission regulations require that publicly funded presidential candidates use primary election funds only for expenses incurred in connection with primary elections, and that they use general election funds only for general election expenses. 26 U.S.C. 9002(11), 9032(9); 11 CFR 9002.11, 9032.9. These requirements are tied to the overall primary and general election expenditure limits set forth at 2 U.S.C. 441a (b) and (c), and at 26 U.S.C. 9004(b) and 9034(b). See also 11 CFR 9004.1, 9004.3(b), 9034.1(d). Therefore, once a primary candidate is the clear and projected winner of the primary election process and begins to campaign by addressing issues and comparability with other projected general election candidates, certain costs incurred prior to the candidate's primary election date of ineligibility are considered general election expenses that are reimbursable by the general election committee. The Commission is seeking comments on whether the pertinent rules should provide more specific guidance on how certain expenditures might be characterized. Questions have arisen in recent election cycles as to whether certain primary funding was in fact used to benefit the general election. As additional states choose to hold their state nominating conventions or primary elections early in the election cycle, the major parties' selection of a nominee is increasingly likely to be decided long before the convention. Once a candidate has secured enough delegates to win the nomination, the focus of the campaign may turn in large part to the general election. However, the Commission realizes that it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate primary campaign activity, such as that which is designed to lock up delegates, or is related to the primary outcomes or pre-convention preparation, from activity that is geared towards the general election. The Commission is considering several alternatives that would provide additional guidance to presidential campaign committees on how such expenditures are treated. The Commission welcomes comments on any of these approaches, as well as suggestions on other ways available to deal with this situation. One question concerns depreciation of primary committee assets in this situation. Section 9034.5(c)(1) currently permits a standard 40% depreciation of capital assets held by a primary campaign committee, except for items acquired after the committee's DOI. A higher depreciation is allowed for a particular item if the committee demonstrates through documentation that the asset's fair market value is lower. Under certain circumstances, however, the 40% figure may be overly generous. For example, if the primary committee purchases a $20,000 computer system shortly before the primary election DOI and then sells it to the general election committee, allowing the primary campaign to assume a 40% depreciation would result in a nearly $8,000 subsidy from the primary to the general election committee. The Commission is therefore proposing that paragraph 9034.5(c)(1) be amended to clarify that a higher, lower, or no depreciation may be claimed in appropriate cases. Current 11 CFR 9034.4(b)(3) states that expenses incurred after a candidate's primary election DOI are not considered qualified campaign expenses, except for certain winding down costs and costs incurred in continuing to campaign. See 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3). The Commission is considering whether this language should be expanded to clarify that, consistent with 26 U.S.C. 9002(11)(B) and 11 CFR 9002.11(b), goods received prior to the DOI that are used for the general election, and pre-DOI services that provide a benefit to the general election campaign, are considered qualified campaign expenses for the general election and not for the primary election. One approach would be to allocate the cost of each capital asset between the primary and the general election, based on when the asset was acquired and the time the committee began to focus on the general election. This could be difficult to administer, however, requiring as it would an asset-by-asset determination. Another approach would be to include a presumption in section 9034.4(b)(3) that capital assets purchased during a certain period before the first day of the candidate's party's national nominating convention are general election assets. Section 9034.4(b)(3) of the proposed rules would set a presumed cutoff date of 60 days before the start of the candidate's party's national nominating convention. However, the Commission is requesting comments on whether some other cutoff point would better serve this purpose, as well as whether a uniform cutoff date, such as June 15 preceding the national nominating convention, would be more appropriate. If so, what date should be selected? If a more flexible approach is desirable, how should the applicable timeframe be computed? Should it be the date of the candidate's party's last state primary election? Whatever approach is adopted, the presumption would be rebuttable based on each candidate's particular circumstances. If a candidate could demonstrate that he or she was still largely involved in campaigning for the nomination after the presumptive cutoff date, that date could be moved back. In the case of a brokered convention, several candidates might be found to have focused nearly exclusively on securing the nomination until the date during the convention on which one in fact did so. Conversely, a candidate who became the clear and projected nominee of a party early in the presidential election year might be found to have made expenditures in connection with the general election well in advance of the designated cutoff date.
