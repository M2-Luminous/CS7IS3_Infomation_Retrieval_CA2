The statement stressed that Sudan, proceeding from its conviction to respect human rights and respect international laws and resolutions, did not wish to see a deterioration in terms of hostilities in that region. It also does not wish to see the mounting suffering inflicted on the patient and steadfast Bosnian people on a daily basis, or the obstinacy of the Serbian forces, which exploit the UN Security Council's resolutions as an umbrella under which to commit further atrocities and massacres. The statement once again called on the international community to discharge its responsibilities towards a people suffering the worst fate ever to befall any people throughout the course of history. The Foreign Ministry statement called on the international community and the governments of the Arab and Islamic states and peace-loving governments, to adopt a more determined stance towards the Serbian aggressors so as to rescue what is left of the Serbian people under attack.
