On 30 December, summarizing the results of the exercise aboard the large ASW ship "Admiral Vinogradov," Admiral F. Gromov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, noted that Kuwaiti and Russian seamen, who successfully completed all of their missions, are honorably continuing the traditions of naval cooperation between our countries, established long ago by the legendary cruiser "Varyag," which entered the port of Al-Kuwait in 1901 to open a Russian consulate there. Kuwaiti Navy acting commander Lieutenant Colonel M. Yakut expressed deep satisfaction in the high organization and results of the first joint exercises of the two countries which, he emphasized, were a good school for Kuwaiti seamen. Captain 1st Rank A. Yakovlev, who directed the exercise, read the names of servicemen who distinguished themselves in the course of the combat exercises. On the Russian side these were Captain 1st Rank V. Chernyavskiy, commander of the large ASW ship "Admiral Vinogradov"; A. Denisov, captain of the tanker "V. Kolechitskiy"; Captain 1st Rank V.
