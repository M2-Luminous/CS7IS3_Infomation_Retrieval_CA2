FR940414-2-00135 FR940414-2-00084 New Sections XI and XII Added To Guidelines The most significant change involves the addition of a new Section XII to the guidelines governing the cancellation of any claim for liquidated damages in which the petition for relief is filed untimely. Under the provisions of § 172.12(b)(1) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 172.12(b)(1)), a bond principal has 60 days from the date of mailing of the notice of liability for liquidated damages to file a petition for relief. If the principal does not pay the claim, arrange to pay the claim or file a petition within the 60-day period, then the surety is notified of the claim. Pursuant to the provisions of §172.12(b)(2) of the Regulations (19 CFR 172.12(b)(2)), the surety has 60 days after notification to file a petition for relief. Under the provisions of §172.2(a) of the Regulations (19 CFR 172.2(a)), if any party liable for liquidated damages fails to pay, make arrangements to pay or file a petition for relief, the district director shall promptly refer the claim to the Department of Justice. If no response is received from both the principal and surety, Customs will issue bills to both parties, demanding payment of the unpaid claims. Billing is required before referral of the matter to the Department of Justice for commencement of judicial collection action in the Court of International Trade. Under the provisions of §172.23 of the Regulations (19 CFR 172.23), no petition may be entertained after a claim has been referred to the Department of Justice. In the past, Customs has articulated that, as a matter of policy, no late petitions would be entertained even if the matter had not yet been referred to the Department of Justice, but the petitioning period had expired. Under current procedures, if a principal or surety wishes to respond to the claim after billing has begun but referral has not yet occurred, it may only do so through the submission of an offer in compromise pursuant to the provisions of title 19, United States Code, section 1617, and section 161.5 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 161.5). Before acceptance of any offer, Customs must seek approval of the Office of General Counsel of the Treasury. Through this document, Customs is changing its policy with regard to acceptance of late petitions. Petitions which are not filed timely will be honored, but mitigation will be less generous than that offered in those situations where petitions are filed timely. Under new guidelines for mitigation to be offered when a petition is filed late, the district director will determine, based on the record and information submitted in the untimely filed petition, as to appropriate mitigation that would have been afforded had the petition been filed timely. The district director will then calculate the number of calendar days the petition is late. Weekends and holidays will not be excluded from the calculation of number of days late. He will then multiply the number of calendar days late by 0.1 percent. A calculation similar to that used to determine mitigation in late filing of entry summary cases will then be used, as the mitigation amount will be multiplied by the number of days late times 0.1 percent. A minimum additional payment of $100 on a late petition mitigation will be required. For example, on November 1, Customs issues a CF&hyph;5955A against a bonded carrier, indicating that the carrier is liable for liquidated damages of $100,000 for delivering merchandise directly to the consignee in violation of the provisions of 19 CFR 18.8 and its custodial bond. The petition for relief is due from the bond principal by January 1. A petition is received on January 21, some 20 days late. A review of the petition shows that entry was not made on the merchandise nor were estimated duties paid by the consignee. Had an entry been filed, duties of $9,900 would have been paid. The carrier was shown to have had a good record of compliance, militating toward mitigation in the low end of the $100-$1,000 range for that type of violation. Accordingly, had the petition been filed timely, mitigation to $10,000 ($9,900 in an amount equal to approximate lost revenue plus $100) would have been afforded. Insofar as the petition was 20 days late, the time of lateness (20 days) will be multiplied by 0.1 percent, resulting in a multiplier of 2 percent. The $10,000 mitigation will be multiplied by 2 percent, resulting in a calculation of $200. The $200 amount is compared to the minimum charge of $100 for a late petition. Insofar as the computed amount is higher than the minimum amount, $200 would be added to the mitigation. Mitigation would then be afforded in the amount of $10,200. As noted, under current procedures no petitions are accepted after billing of the principal and surety has commenced. While we are rescinding that policy through this document, in no case will a petition be accepted after the billing cycle has ended and the case has been determined by Customs to be eligible to be included in any surety sanctioning action pursuant to the provisions of §113.38 of the Regulations (19 CFR 113.38).
