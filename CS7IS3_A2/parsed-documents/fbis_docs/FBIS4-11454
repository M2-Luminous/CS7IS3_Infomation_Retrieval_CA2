FBIS4-11454 "drlat082_h_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Honduras Defense Minister Criticizes Military Bill Defense Minister Criticizes Military Bill PA2804045394 Tegucigalpa Voz de Honduras Network in Spanish 0258 GMT 28 Apr 94 PA2804045394 Tegucigalpa Voz de Honduras Network Spanish BFN [Text] Defense Minister General Reynaldo Andino Flores has clearly stated tonight that the Armed Forces accept President Carlos Roberto Reina's proposal to change the compulsory military service to one that is voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic only because the Armed Forces remain subordinate to the president. Nevertheless, the defense minister added, the Armed Forces do not agree with this change. Andino Flores said that if this is being done only to satisfy the whims of specific individuals, it will be dangerous and problematic, and he added that people within the military pray to God that all will go according to plan. The defense minister emphatically stated his position: We are only accepting this because we are subordinate, but not because we agree with a constitutional reform geared to turn the compulsory military service into a military service that is temporary, educational, social, and all the other alterations made in this constitutional reform bill. In last-minute, exclusive information made available to Voz de Honduras, we are providing you with the following statements by Defense Minister Reynaldo Andino Flores: [Begin Andino Flores recording] Well [words indistinct] we have faith, hope, and trust that everything will turn out well. The president is a man of experience. He is a national leader. He is our president and the top authority in the country. He knows what he is doing. We hope God will enlighten him in everything he does and decides. We, I repeat, are an institution that is at the service of the nation. The president has been elected by a system established by our laws, and we can do nothing but obey him. I only want to reiterate, once again, that we, the Armed Forces, do not believe voluntary military service is a good idea. We do not agree, not because we are conservative or reactionaries, but because we, as professional military men, know a bit more about military issues and believe there are more disadvantages than advantages in this idea. If this measure is going to be implemented only to satisfy personal interests and not national interests, we are doing the wrong thing. It is, of course, easier to do what we want and what interests us than to do what the country needs. If we are truly going to take this path, I cannot say how appropriate it will be to have a voluntary military service. I repeat, I hope we are wrong and that God has enlightened the [words indistinct] of the president and is enlightening all of the Honduran people. We hope this new measure will help Honduras to increasingly become a better and more prosperous country with better chances for an auspicious future. [end recording]
