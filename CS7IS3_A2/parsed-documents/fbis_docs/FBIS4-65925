These forecasts are made in the report entitled "Europe in 1998," published today by the Netherlands Economic Institute in Rotterdam. The Netherlands economy will grow by 1.9 percent until 1998, while the European Union (EU) average will grow by 1.8 percent, the institute predicts. The recovery of the European economy thus looks set to be far from vigorous and will certainly not be enough to solve the unemployment problem. After 1996, growth is even set to fall off again, according to the institute's computing models. During the period 1992-1998, the United States and Japan should experience a 2.6 percent growth. Europe must come to terms with the fact that most growth is going to come from Asia and the developing countries, the researchers write. These countries are set to experience growth of 6.9 percent and 4 percent, respectively, over the same period. The report states that it will not be enough to count on technological innovation alone. New products must also be linked to new forms of services, and at low prices. Europe must develop new mass consumer goods. Education, technology and, most importantly, the transfer of technical know-how must all be stimulated. As in the NAFTA countries (United States, Canada and the developing country Mexico), benefit must be drawn from the low labor costs in East Europe by closely involving the East European countries in the EU.
