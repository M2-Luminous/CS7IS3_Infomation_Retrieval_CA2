It has asked to consult civil servants as it develops plans and policies for the future. It is a clever request which squeezes a tender pressure point. What, after all, could better help a smooth transition than advice from those who know the workings of government? The Government yesterday responded to the PWC's initial specific request by warning that the Secretary for Economic Services, Gordon Siu Kwing-chue, would not be allowed to appear before the committee in Beijing. It further made it clear it had no plans to relax its wider ban on official civil service contacts with the PWC. But how that edict holds up as time passes may become a test of the Government's self-confidence in the final years of British rule. By inviting civil servants to appear before it, the PWC has challenged Chris Patten's authority over his staff and presented him with a profound dilemma. Mr Patten has strong arguments for refusing to let his officials talk to the PWC. Nothing would give more credibility and legitimacy to what is, to all intents and purposes, the Hong Kong takeover committee. The PWC has no official status in Sino-British relations and cannot take the decisions for which the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was set up. But treating it as though it were a legitimate body would tend to sideline the JLG and turn it into a rubber stamp. The influence of Britain and its governor would wane as his civil service switched its attentions, information, and advice to China. The Legislative Council would become an increasingly irrelevant talking shop. And the loyalty of civil servants would be divided: which government would be their real master? But if Mr Patten maintained his ban, he would be accused of a lack of cooperation and of undermining the smooth transfer of sovereignty. That in itself would not worry him. What would be harder to ignore is that as China develops the authority of the PWC, it will gain importance in the lives of Hong Kong people. If China continued to block progress in the JLG, the PWC might usurp some of its functions. Starving it of the information it needs to make the best decisions might be damaging to the territory in the long run. Further, as 1997 draws nearer, advising the PWC might be the best way for the Hong Kong Government to influence its thinking and, therefore, the policies to be pursued over the longer term. Here is the core of Mr Patten's dilemma. If he allows cooperation now, he might be forced into the role of co-conspirator in China's plans to reduce his influence. But if he rejects cooperation outright, over time he risks reducing his chance to influence developments. Mr Patten's own strategy centres on building up Legco's authority. But this task has been made harder by China's threat to disband the territory's parliament after 1997. So the PWC's request for contact with civil servants is not one that can be easily met with automatic and total rejection. It is an issue to which Mr Patten must give further deep and serious thought.
