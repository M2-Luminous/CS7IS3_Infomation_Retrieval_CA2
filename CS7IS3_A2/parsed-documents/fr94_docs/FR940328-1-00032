FR940328-1-00032 FR940328-1-00014 48 CFR Part 31 [FAR Case 91&hyph;112] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Civil Defense Costs, Plant Protection Costs, and Recruitment Costs AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by removing and reserving regulations on Civil defense costs and Plant protection costs, and by revising regulations on Recruitment costs. These proposed changes represent the second in a series resulting from the Councils' ongoing review of industry recommendations concerning FAR regulations on Contract Cost Principles and Procedures. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;112 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeremy Olson at (202) 501&hyph;3221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;112. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background As part of the Defense Management Review, the Office of the Secretary of Defense requested comments from industry concerning improvements to the Government's procurement regulations. The Council of Defense and Space Industry Associations (CODSIA) responded with several proposals, including one to revise FAR part 31, Contract Cost Principles and Procedures. CODSIA grouped its recommendations into six areas. Proposed rule changes will be published for comment as the Councils complete their incremental reviews of CODSIA's recommendations in each of these groupings. However, all resultant final rule changes will be published at one time, at the end of this effort. This proposed rule represents the second of these six groupings. The Councils believe deletion of FAR 31.205&hyph;5, Civil defense costs, is warranted because any ``extraordinary'' expenditures in planning for, and protecting life and property against, the possible effects of enemy attack (including terrorist attacks) can be subjected to the ``reasonableness'' criteria under FAR 31.201&hyph;3 or made the subject of an advance agreement under FAR 31.109. Likewise, removing FAR 31.204&hyph;29, Plant protection costs, is warranted because such costs are common and necessary expenses incurred by all contractors and can also be subjected to the ``reasonableness'' criteria under FAR 31.201&hyph;3. Paragraph (c) of FAR 31.205&hyph;34 is revised to clarify the allowability of offering any excessive compensation costs or any special emoluments (such as signing bonuses) to attract prospective employees from other Government contractors. In addition, paragraph FAR 31.205&hyph;34(b)(5) is deleted and the existing paragraph (b)(6) is redesignated as (b)(5) because the subject matter is discussed in the revised paragraph (c). We believe the proposed language at FAR 31.205&hyph;34(c) more effectively articulates the Government's long-standing policy against ``pirating''. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 91&hyph;112), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 31 Government procurement. Dated: March 18, 1994. Albert A. Vicchiolla, Director, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy. Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 31 be amended as set forth below: PART 31_CONTRACT COST PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 31 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c). 31.205&hyph;5 [Removed and reserved] 2. Section 31.205&hyph;5 is removed and reserved. 31.205&hyph;29 [Removed and reserved] 3. Section 31.205&hyph;29 is removed and reserved. 4. Section 31.205&hyph;34 is amended in paragraph (b)(4) by inserting at the end of the paragraph the word ``or''; removing paragraph (b)(5) and redesignating paragraph (b)(6) as (b)(5); and revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: 31.205&hyph;34 Recruitment costs. * * * * * (c) Compensation costs offered by a contractor to prospective employees working for another Government contractor which are in excess of those normally offered to its employees with substantially the same training and experience are unallowable. Such costs shall remain unallowable as long as they are in excess of normal compensation costs. For the purpose of this cost principle, compensation costs include total compensation for personal services (as defined in 31.205&hyph;6(a)) and any special emoluments associated with the recruitment.
