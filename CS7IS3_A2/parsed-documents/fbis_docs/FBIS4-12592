The undercover units have also stepped up their operations in the wake of new instructions issued by senior Southern Command officers. The Southern Command expects an increase in the attempts to perpetrate terror attacks due to the population's frustration as a result of the general closure of the territories and its close enforcement in the Gaza Strip. Consequently, it decided to step up the IDF's operations in the refugee camps and in the big cities. Last Friday, IDF troops operated in the Dayr al-Balah refugee camp, arresting a Fatah wanted man suspected of murdering a 70-year-old resident of Kefar Sava in February.

["The training program of many units has been halted to enable their transfer to the territories. The troops meticulously monitor every road, passage, and footpath leading from the territories into Israel."]
