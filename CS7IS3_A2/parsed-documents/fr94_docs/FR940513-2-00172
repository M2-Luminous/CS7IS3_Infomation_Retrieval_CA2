FR940513-2-00172 FR940513-2-00084 The Commission has reviewed carefully the NYSE's proposed rule change and, for the above reasons, believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of sections 6 and 11 of the Act 18 and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. In particular, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirement that the rules of the Exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, perfect the mechanism of a free and open national market system, and, in general, further investor protection and the public interest. Further, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with section 11(b) of the Act, 19 and Rule 11b&hyph;1 thereunder, 20 which allow securities exchanges to promulgate rules relating to specialists consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. 18 15 U.S.C. 78f and 78k (1988). 19 15 U.S.C. 78k(b) (1988). 20 17 CFR 240.11b&hyph;1 (1993). Specifically, the Commission believes that the NYSE's Rule 103A performance evaluation process provides the Exchange with the means to identify and correct poor specialist performance. Accordingly, the evaluation process is critical to the NYSE's duty to ascertain whether specialists are maintaining fair and orderly markets in their assigned securities, as required pursuant to Exchange rules and the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. Moreover, the possibility of a performance improvement action as a result of the evaluation process, in addition to the use of the evaluation results in stock allocation decisions, should help motivate and provide incentives for specialists to maintain and improve their market making performance for the benefit of investors. In summary, extension of Rule 103A's effectiveness until May 9, 1995 will provide the Exchange with the ability to continue evaluating specialist performance on an uninterrupted basis, which should enhance market quality and performance in Exchange listed securities. During the pilot, the Exchange should continue to consider and develop objective measures which evaluate both ITS matters and market making performance. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register . The Commission believes it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis so that the Exchange can continue to administer, on an uninterrupted basis, its Rule 103A evaluation process. During the one year extension of the Rule, the Commission expects the NYSE to continue its examination of the efficacy of its current specialist evaluation procedures, as well as determine whether to extend the pilot for a further period or, in the alternative, approve Rule 103A on a permanent basis. Finally, a substantial portion of current Rule 103A was noticed for the full statutory period in 1987, and the Commission did not receive any adverse commentary on the revised Rule 103A program. 21 Further, interested persons were invited to comment on the past proposals to extend the effectiveness of Rule 103A, the most recent of such proposals being the extension of Rule 103A until May 9, 1994. The Commission received no comments on these proposals. The Commission believes, therefore, that granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change is appropriate and consistent with section 6 of the Act. 22 21 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 24919 (September 15, 1987), 52 FR 35821 (notice of filing of File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;87&hyph;25); and 25681 (May 9, 1988), 53 FR 17287 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;87&hyph;25). 22 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988). V. Conclusion For the reasons set forth above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 6(b)(5) and 11(b) under the Act, and Rule 11b&hyph;1 thereunder. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act 23 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;7) is approved for the period ending May 9, 1995. 23 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 24 24 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993).
