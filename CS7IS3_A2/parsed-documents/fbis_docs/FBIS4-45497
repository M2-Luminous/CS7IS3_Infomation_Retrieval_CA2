He made this request at a news conference held after delivering his closing speech at the 24th OAS General Assembly in this, the capital city of Para State. Amorim noted that because funding for drug enforcement operations is very limited in Brazil, it is very important for our country to receive financial cooperation from countries where drugs are consumed. Amorim said: Drug producing countries are receiving resources to implement alternative crops. Yet countries that are being used as drug routes have not received the same kind of support.
