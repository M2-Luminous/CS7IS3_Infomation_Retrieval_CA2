Vitryanskiy presented to a regular plenary session of the court a draft of the first chapter of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation--a constitution of sorts, the "main law" for the creation of economic regulations. It was approved in the main by the Presidium of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers, with proposals from 34 components of the Federation being taken into account. At present, the Supreme Court of Arbitration intends to submit the draft to the Duma in an exercise of legislative initiative. The chapter "General Provisions" envisions fundamental provisions: norms concerning the exercise and protection of civil rights, their subjects and objects, transactions, representation, and statutes of limitation. Many of them are absolutely new in the legislation in effect. For example, commercial organizations (except for state and municipal enterprises) will be endowed with general legal capacity which will give them the right to engage in all types of entrepreneurship, provided licensing procedures are complied with. Uniform procedures for the registration of enterprises and a state register of legal entities will be introduced. This will make it possible for everyone to verify the real standing of their business partners. Unlike the previous "Law on the Enterprise and Entrepreneurial Activities," the code recognizes unlimited companies as legal entities, regulating their status in such a way as to avoid the passage of additional laws. So-called limited partnerships are being introduced which have partners who venture only the contributions made, along with those who are fully liable. The now confused issues of parent and subsidiary joint-stock companies will be clarified, and the notion of dependent companies and structures with mutual participation in each other's capital will be defined. A barrier has been erected to the fraudulent use of state and municipal enterprises. They will be declared unitary (i.e., united, integral); they will not be used for operations not directly envisioned in their statutes. The state, as well as state and municipal structures, will be able to participate in civil relations under the law, being liable for their obligations with the assets of the treasury. The legal regimen of the main objects of civil rights has been defined in detail, especially that of real estate, the rights to and transactions with which are subject to registration by the state, including undocumented rights and transactions that exist in computer memory. All owners will be given general guarantees of their rights. However, federal laws can establish specifics of the regulation of various forms of property. The scope of cases in which the involuntary taking of property from its owners is permitted, and then only by a court decision and with preliminary compensation for the inflicted losses, is circumscribed quite exhaustively. Arbitrary administrative restrictions of the rights of state enterprises are ruled out. It is expected that land legislation will not duplicate the norms of civil legislation, but will regulate conditions and procedures for the distribution, use, and protection of land, proceeding from public and state interests. The fact that categories of land will appear that cannot be put to other than the intended use has also been taken into account. Hence the rules for the confiscation of such parcels from violators with compensation. Contracts are another mainstay of a market economy. The new code regulates in detail the ways to ensure that obligations are honored: liquidated damages, collateral, suretyship, bank guarantees, and advance payments. Mechanisms, both judicial and nonjudicial, for the exercise of the rights of those to whom property has been pledged have finally been developed. The pledge of real estate should be regulated by the future law on mortgages. The new institution of bank guarantees is being introduced. It does not depend on the main obligation for securing which it has been issued. Unlike a surety, the guarantor (a bank, another credit institution, an insurance organization) may refuse to honor a creditor's claim only if this claim does not conform to the terms of guarantee, or was submitted to the guarantor after the deadline set forth in it. A number of provisions are aimed at increasing liability for violating obligations, in particular those associated with entrepreneurship. Stricter responsibility is envisioned for the latter when there has been a failure to meet obligations or they have been met improperly. To avoid liability, an entrepreneur must prove that the violation was caused by an act of God. The issue of losses has also been clarified. In determining their extent, one will have to proceed from the prices and bank rates that existed either at the moment of voluntary compliance by the debtor with the demands of the creditor or on the day the court ruling was made. Two entire sections are devoted to contracts. Citizens and legal entities will be free to sign them. The terms of contracts will be determined by agreement between the parties. However, cases in which the conclusion of a contract by one of the parties is mandatory or the content of an agreement is dictated by legislation will be exceptions. The pathos of these parts is designed to prevent the principle of freedom of contracts from resulting in unbridled arbitrary practices by entrepreneurs, in particular monopolies. The economically weaker party to the contracts, primarily consumers and citizens, require protection, too. For this reason, the code contains the notion of "public contracts." It applies to relations with the participation of commercial organizations--retail merchants, owners of public transportation, energy supply, health care and hotel services, communications, and so on. Such companies are not entitled to evade the signing of contracts or grant preferences to certain individuals in signing contracts. Procedures for amending and canceling agreements will be made stricter in order to make contractual relations stable. A contract may be amended or canceled upon the demand of one of the parties by a court decision only if the other party has substantially violated it.
