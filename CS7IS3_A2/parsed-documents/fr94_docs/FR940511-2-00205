FR940511-2-00205 FR940511-2-00128 (4) A workplan with an 18 months maximum task timeline providing an implementation schedule for the Youth Sports activities. (5) A budget describing the financial and other resources committed to each activity and service of the program. The budget must identify the share of the costs of the applicant's Youth Sports activities provided by a grant under this program and provide a narrative describing how the share of the costs provided from other sources of funds (e.g. local or tribal government, corporations, individuals), including funds from non-Federal sources, will be obtained. (6) A statement regarding the extent to which the applicant's proposed Youth Sports activities meet the selection criteria in section I.(d), above. (7) A plan designed to eliminate drugs and drug-related problems on the premises of the housing developments proposed for funding. Applicants are given a choice to satisfy this requirement in one of two ways. First, an applicant may submit a current-year plan prepared for the housing developments in accordance with 24 CFR 961.15 as a part of a Drug Elimination Program grant. In this case, the applicant must indicate how its proposed Youth Sports activities will be operated as, in conjunction with, or in furtherance of the ยง961.15 plan. The other choice is that an applicant may submit an abbreviated plan prepared for this NOFA as follows: (i) The plan must describe the drug-related problems in the developments that are proposed for funding under this program, using: (A) Objective data, if available, from the local police precinct or the PHA's or IHA's records on the types, number and sources of drug-related crime in the developments proposed for assistance. If crime statistics are not available at the development or precinct level, the applicant may use other reliable, objective data including those derived from the records of Resident Management Corporations (RMCs), Resident Corporations (RCs), or other resident associations. The data should cover the past one-year period and, to the extent feasible, should indicate whether these data reflect a percentage increase or decrease in drug-related crime over the past several years. (B) Information from other sources which has a direct bearing on drug-related problems in the developments proposed for assistance. Examples of these data are: Resident/staff surveys on drug-related issues or on-site reviews to determine drug activity; vandalism costs and related vacancies attributable to drug-related crime; information from schools, health service providers, residents and police. (ii) The plan must include a narrative discussion of the applicant's current activities, if any, to eliminate drug-related problems in the targeted developments. Any efforts being undertaken by community and governmental entities, residents of the development, Resident Management Corporations (RMCs), Resident Corporations (RCs), other resident associations, or any other entities to address the drug-related problems in the developments proposed for assistance must be described. The applicant must also indicate how its proposed Youth Sports activities will be operated as, in conjunction with, or in furtherance of the other activities described in the plan. (8) An estimate of the number of youth involved. (i) The applicant must provide the total estimated number of youth involved for each proposed activity and participating in youth leadership assignments (for example, team managers, assistant managers, team captains) computed on an annual and, if applicable, a session or seasonal basis (for example, classes or league sports may be organized in sessions or seasons that run for a certain number of weeks or months, or more activities may take place and more youth may be involved on weekends than on weekdays). (ii) The total estimated number given for each activity must be further broken down by categories of age (e.g., 5&hyph;8 years old, 9&hyph;12 years old, etc.), sex (male, female, co-ed), and residency in public or Indian housing. (9) A description of the facilities used. (i) Facilities to be used for Youth Sports activities must be described in the application with regard to their dimensions, location, accessibility to the disabled, and the number of youth that can be accommodated at one time. (A) In the case of an Indian housing development, if a facility to be acquired, constructed, or rehabilitated is not located on or adjacent to the premises of the development to be assisted, the application must specify how youth from the Indian housing development will have access to the facility (e.g., transportation will be provided, transportation service is readily available). (ii) Where applicable, the application must provide a detailed explanation of all facility acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, operation, redesign or modification proposed for funding under this program. (A) The application must specify what percent of the facility will be used for youth activities (as opposed to, for example, senior citizen or adult activities). This percentage may not be less than the percentage of Youth Sports funding provided for the facility. (iii) The application must identify the entity that will be responsible for the operation of any facility funded by a Youth Sports grant.
