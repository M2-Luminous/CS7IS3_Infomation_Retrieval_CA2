At a news conference in Jerusalem today, Betzelem said soldiers killed 21 Palestinian since the Hebron massacre. In response, the government said soldiers were under orders to be restrained but found themselves in life-threatening situations. Steve Linde reports: [Begin recording] [Linde] Betzelem says after the mosque massacre the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] (?streamed) large numbers of troops into heavily populated Palestinian areas and permitted them to use live fire against Palestinian demonstrators. Betzelem research director Yuwal Ginbar: [Ginbar] It was found that during less than a week 21 Palestinians and one Israeli were shot to death by Israeli security forces. This is an extremely large number. This stems from the fact that, right after the massacre, the army--instead of being moderate, instead of being tolerant, instead of letting the population express its anger and grief--went in with force to all the population centers, used heavily live ammunition in order to disperse crowds. And the result was the deaths, so many deaths. [Linde] In response, the government says soldiers opened fire only when their lives were threatened. Government Press Office Director Uri Dromi: [Dromi] Those soldiers were under danger for their life, and they had to open fire in order to rescue themselves from the situation. Needless to say, there were orders given to the soldiers in the beginning to try and restrain themselves--use the minimum fire possible--because we were all aware of the anger and the pain and the agony of the people. But, unfortunately, in this kind of loaded situation and strained environment, law and order must be maintained, and it is the duty of the army to do so. [Linde] Betzelem called on the authorities to refrain from augmenting forces in Palestinian population centers and introducing troops not trained in riot control, and it urged the government to immediately halt all forms of collective punishment, such as curfews and closures.
