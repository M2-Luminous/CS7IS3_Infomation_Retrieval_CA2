FR941110-2-00002 FR941110-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Wheat Crop Insurance AGENCY: Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA. ACTION: Notice of extension of sales closing date (acceptance of applications). SUMMARY: Effective for the 1995 crop year only, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) gives notice of its determination to extend the date for acceptance of wheat crop insurance applications for those counties where producers are offered the winter coverage endorsement. The sales closing date of September 30 previously extended to October 31 shall be further extended to November 4, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joan Rogers, Regulatory Specialist, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 254&hyph;8314. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under its regulations for insuring crops, FCIC requires that applications for crop insurance protection must be filed on or before the policy sales closing date. On Tuesday, October 4, 1994, FCIC published in the Federal Register (59 FR 50559), effective for the 1995 winter wheat crop year only, a sales closing date extension to October 31. FCIC has determined that an additional extension of the sales closing date may be needed for wheat counties in which the winter coverage endorsement is available. By extending the sales closing date, farmers will have more time to make crop insurance decisions for the 1995 wheat crop year. The Manager has determined that extension of the sales closing date for the 1995 wheat crop year only in counties in which the winter coverage endorsement is available will not adversely affect the actuarial status of the crop insurance program. Therefore, the Manager of FCIC has determined that the October 31 sales closing date shall be further extended to November 14 for wheat counties in which the winter coverage endorsement is available. No other crop insurance program dates are affected or extended at this time. Under the provisions of the General Crop Insurance Regulations (ยง457.8), the sales closing date for accepting applications may be extended by notice in the Federal Register upon determination that no adverse effect will result from such extension. FCIC has determined that no adverse effect will result from this extension. FCIC will discontinue the acceptance of applications if it determines that adverse conditions develop and that insurance risk becomes excessive. Notice Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. ), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) herewith gives notice that, effective for the 1995 crop year only, applications for wheat crop insurance in counties in which the winter coverage endorsement is available with published sales closing dates of September 30, 1994, will be accepted up to the close of business on November 4, 1994. This sales closing date may be terminated by the Corporation prior to November 4, 1994, if FCIC determines that adverse conditions develop and that insurance risk becomes excessive. Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1501, as amended. Done in Washington, DC on November 3, 1994. Kenneth D. Ackerman, Acting Deputy Administrator, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.
