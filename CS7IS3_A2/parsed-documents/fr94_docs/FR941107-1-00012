FR941107-1-00012 FR941107-1-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;163&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, &hyph;300A and Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ70A, &hyph;RJ85A, and &hyph;RJ100A Series Airplanes Equipped With Certain Air Cruisers Evacuation Slides AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, &hyph;300A and Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ70A, &hyph;RJ85A, and &hyph;RJ100A series airplanes. This proposal would require repetitive inspections to verify proper deployment of the evacuation slide at each door position, and various follow-on actions to correct discrepancies. This proposal is prompted by a report that, during operational checks of evacuation slides on in-service airplanes, the inflation valves failed to deploy the evacuation slide properly. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the evacuation slide to deploy automatically on demand, which would necessitate the flight crew to manually deploy the slide; this situation could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency. DATES: Comments must be received by January 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;163&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;163&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, &hyph;300A and Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ70A, &hyph;RJ85A, and &hyph;RJ100A series airplanes equipped with certain Air Cruiser evacuation slides. The CAA advises that, during operational checks of evacuation slides on these airplanes, the inflation valves failed to deploy the evacuation slide properly. Subsequent investigation, conducted by Air Cruisers (the manufacturer of the evacuation slides), revealed that the existing design of the inflation valves requires excessive operating pull force to activate deployment of the evacuation slide. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the evacuation slide to deploy automatically, which necessitates the flight crew to manually deploy the slide. This situation could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency. British Aerospace has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 25&hyph;328, Revision 2, dated July 10, 1993, which describes procedures for repetitive inspections to verify proper deployment of the evacuation slide at each door position, and various follow-on actions to correct discrepancies. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. Addditionally, Air Cruisers Company has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 201&hyph;25&hyph;17, dated June 4, 1992, which describes procedures for modification of the inflation valve of the evacuation slide. This modification entails replacing the existing valve with a new, improved valve. The new valve has a lower maximum operating pull force, which will permit the evacuation slide to deploy automatically on demand. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive inspections to verify proper deployment of the evacuation slide at each door position, and various follow-on actions to correct discrepancies. The proposed AD would also require modification of the inflation valve of the evacuation slide, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 41 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,610, or $210 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .

The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.
