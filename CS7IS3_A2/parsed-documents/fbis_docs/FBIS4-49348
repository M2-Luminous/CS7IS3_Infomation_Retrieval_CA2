'Arafat made the remarks at a press conference at the headquarters of Daimler-Benz A.G. in Stuttgart, Germany. Commenting on the planned signing of the self-rule agreement in Cairo Wednesday, the PLO leader said, "where there is will there is a way." But he cautioned that one person cannot dance a tango and the success also depends on the other party. He said his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo tomorrow will be devoted to solving "some problems" and he hoped the meeting could "remove obstacles." Asked when he would return to Jerusalem, Jericho or Gaza, 'Arafat said this will depend on when Israel withdraws its troops from the occupied territories. Israeli Army should have been pulled out of Gaza and the Jericho area before April 13 in accordance with an original plan. 'Arafat arrived in Stuttgart early today on a day-long visit at the invitation of the German automaker Daimler-Benz A.G. He met with company president Edzard Reuter on cooperation between Palestine and Germany. He also conferred with Erwin Teufel, minister-president of Baden- Wurttemberg.
