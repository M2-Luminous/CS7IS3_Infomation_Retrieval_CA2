The U.S. Government currently places top priority on resolving the North Korean nuclear question and is therefore refraining from bringing up trade issues with Seoul, the reports said. Labeling 10 major developing economies, including South Korea, as "Big Emerging Markets (BEMs), Washington decided earlier to focus on widening its access to these markets as this year's top trade policy. But it has reportedly made South Korea an exception until the North Korean problem is settled. The United States will instead concentrate on improving trade conditions in Japan and all other BEMs excepting Korea. It has chosen Indonesia to test the policy first and is limiting trade pressure against Korea to merely "telling what it wants" through the bilateral Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) channel, the reports said. But Washington is expected to turn up the heat on Seoul sometime before June as tensions from the nuclear problem slowly ease and the Uruguay Round [UR] act is likely to pass congress around then, they said. Its trade demands will aim mainly at Korea's financial services market and policy on corporate competitiveness, which were excluded from the UR negotiations, and Washington has alreadly begun dropping hints through the dec channel to soften the blow, they said.
