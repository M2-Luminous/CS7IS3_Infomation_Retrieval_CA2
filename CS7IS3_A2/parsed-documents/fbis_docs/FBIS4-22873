Pospelov, Yu.V. Kuznetsov, V.K. Legin (NPO [Scientific Production Association] ``Radiyevyy institut''), A.P. Kirillovich, I.G. Kobzar and V.P. Losev (NIIAR [Atomic Reactors SRI]); received December 19,1991; UDC 621.039.58] [Abstract] Wide-scale work on manufacturing transplutonium elements and using them for manufacturing of radiation sources, as well as on using plutonium for manufacturing of experimental fuel elements and TVS [expansion not given] is being conducted at the NIIAR. The article presents results of studies conducted by NPO ``Radiyevyy institut'' and NIIAR on developing a procedure for and work conducted on determining the content of plutonium isotopes in samples of soil and river bottom deposits collected over the NIIAR territory and in the sanitary protection and observation zones. It lists basic requirements to analytical procedures for determining plutonium activity and shows a flow chart of the analysis used in the studies. The procedure validity was tested when analyzing IAEA samples Soil 6; the analysis error did not exceed 10% at a 0.95% confidence level. The samples were collected in the most representative points between June 19 and 26, 1989, and between June 11 and 15, 1990. No noticeable effect of NIIAR activity on plutonium content in samples was detected. The studies showed that specific plutonium activity within 40 km of NIIAR was at the level of global activity for the Northern Hemisphere prior to the Chernobyl AES accident.
