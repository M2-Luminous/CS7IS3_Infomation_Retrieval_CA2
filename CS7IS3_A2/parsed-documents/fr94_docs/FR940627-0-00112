FR940627-0-00112 FR940627-0-00019 B. Public Participation In the months following the publication of the ANPRM (55 FR 32218) and the associated public hearing (on September 26, 1990), EPA explored the feasibility and appropriateness of applying regulatory negotiation procedures (under the provisions of section 583 of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990) to the development of this rule. Interviews and meetings were held with representatives of a variety of affected industry groups and environmental organizations, to assess their interest and willingness to participate in potential negotiations. This process indicated that there was insufficient support for regulatory negotiation among a number of key parties. A traditional rulemaking procedure was then followed to develop this rule. Following publication of the proposed rule, EPA held a public hearing on May 28, 1992, and accepted comments until June 30, 1992. Public response on the NPRM included five oral presentations at the hearing and the subsequent submission of 42 written comments. EPA also received 13 written comments on the issues discussed in the Notice of Reopening of Comment Period (referred to as the ``Reopening Notice'' in later portions of this document). A transcript of both public hearings and copies of all written comments are available in public Docket No. A&hyph;90&hyph;07. A discussion of comments received since the NPRM and EPA's responses are included in the ``Summary and Analysis of Comments for the Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations,'' which is available in the public docket referenced above. All public commentary was carefully considered in developing this final rule. Major areas of comment are described in the relevant sections of this preamble. C. Additional Information on the Effective Date The effective date of this rule is May 27, 1994. EPA notes that the general requirement (under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)), that publication or service of a substantive rule be made not less than 30 days before its effective date, does not apply here. Under 5 U.S.C. 559, the APA states that a subsequent statute does not supersede or modify the APA except to the extent that it does so expressly. CAA section 307(d)(1)(E) specifically applies to the promulgation or revision of any regulation pertaining to any fuel or fuel additive under CAA section 211. CAA section 307(d)(1) further provides that ``[t]he provisions of sections 533 through 557 and section 706 of title VI shall not, except as expressly provided in this subsection, apply to actions to which this subsection applies.'' Nowhere does subsection 307(d) expressly provide that section 553(d) of title 5 applies. Further, CAA section 211(e)(2) expressly provides that the time period for providing the ``requisite information'' under section 211(e)(2) is based on the ``date of promulgation'' of the rule. Therefore, the requirements under CAA section 211(e)(2) are effective on May 27, 1994. Additionally, even if section 553(d) were to apply to the portion of the rule promulgated under the authority of section 211(b) of the CAA, there is good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the APA to provide less than 30 days notice following publication in order to simplify implementation of the rule by establishing one effective date for the rule's requirements. As discussed in the following sections, this final rule provides a six year time period for completing Tier 2 testing, commencing on May 27, 1994. EPA believes this to be sufficient for the regulated industry to comply with the rule and that, given this compliance schedule, a reasonable amount of notice is provided for this type of information-gathering regulation. Finally, EPA has taken steps to provide notice of this final action to the regulated industry upon signature of the rule. For these reasons, EPA believes that establishing the effective date as May 27, 1994 is reasonable.
