FBIS4-24084 "drafr121_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 23 Jun South African Press Review for 23 Jun MB2306122294 MB2306122294 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Fair Balance -- "Keys well-balanced Budget should allay a lot of economic jitters, at home and abroad, while offering a sound basis of hope to the deprived. As in the old South Africa, the acid test is whether government spending will be kept firgly in check," states an editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 23 June on page 18. The "good news" is that Reconstruction and Development Program "is to be financed largely through cuts in existing allocations," with no increase in VAT [value-added tax] or fuel tax. As for the "widely expected soaking of the rich," this takes the form of a "one-off 5 percent tax surcharge on individuals and companies with taxable incme over R50,000 [rand] a year." As "redistribution" had to come, this "is not a bad way to approach it." "The Budget's stress on increased social spending sends the correct signals to a society in need of radical reconstruction," and while much "remains for the present in the realm of promise rather than performance, but at least the guidelines are firmly set out." SOWETAN PWV, KwaZulu/Natal Capitals -- The decision to make Johannesburg the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] capital "was much easier than resolving a similiar issue in KwaZulu/Natal" as "the political dilemna is not as tense," notes an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 23 June on page 10. "If a suitable resolution -- the decision has now been taken to the people for a referendum -- is arrived at, the fundamental political problems of that region might also be resolved. For stated simply, it is a political fight for control between the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], which runs the region, and the ANC which believes it should be running it." BEELD Television Tax -- "SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] proposing that part of its income should come from increased taxes can bring to an end its license problem." Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 17 June says in a page 10 editorial. "It creates an opportunity to ease the bigger problems experienced by the SABC, even though taxpayers could resist payment of licenses." "The plan is that a percentage of the state's income tax should replace the license fees. This is a much more efficient manner of collecting money than the expensive and ineffective effort to get television viewers to pay license fees every year." "However, the disadvantages of this system is that people who do not watch television would also be taxed, and that taxpayers could regard such a system as being unfair. It could also further undermine the SABC's Independence." "As a state-run corporation it enjoys much more advantages than the private media. In certain respects it has the monopoly, namely, television news programs during the peak period, and choice advertising." "The taxation plan provides the state with an opportunity to make the SABC less dependent on advertisements. It would be practically easier collecting increased tax than increasing license fees." "Although television tax will ultimately have several advantages, the matter should nevertheless be approached very cautiously."
