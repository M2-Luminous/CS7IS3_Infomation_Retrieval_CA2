FR941125-2-00068 FR941125-2-00051 Section 404(h)(1)(E), 33 U.S.C. 1344(h)(1)(E), requires that state wetland programs ``assure that any State *␣*␣* whose waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit may submit written recommendations to the permitting State.'' Similarly, Section 404(h)(1)(H), 33 U.S.C. 1344(h)(1)(H), requires that state wetland programs ``assure continued coordination with Federal and Federal-State water-related planning and review processes.'' Nothing in either section or anywhere else in Section 404 or the regulations implementing Section 404 requires that a state, as part of its Section 404 wetlands program, assure that the public is allowed to participate in any Federal, Federal-State or interstate coordinating processes. EPA's review of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program, therefore, is limited to a review of whether Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program contains provisions which assure the interstate, intrastate and Federal-State coordination required by Sections 404(h)(1)(E) and (H). As described below, EPA has determined that Michigan's Section 404 wetland program does contain such assurances. Section 323.1 et seq. of Michigan's Compiled Laws (Mich. Comp. Laws) established MWRC. Mich. Comp. Laws §323.2a(1) provides that ``[t]he water resources commission is designated the state agency to cooperate and negotiate with other governments, governmental units and agencies thereof, in matters concerning the water resources of the state, including but not limited to flood control, beach erosion control and water quality control planning, development and management.'' Michigan, in its October 26, 1983 program description, relied upon Mich. Comp. Laws §323.2a(1) as the basis for assuring EPA that the interstate, intrastate and Federal-State coordination required by Sections 404(h)(1)(E) and (H) would occur. Section III.B.1 of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 transferred all of these duties and authorities from the MWRC to the Director of MDNR and the Michigan Attorney General has certified that these authorities remain in full force and effect. Consequently, Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program assures that the interstate, intrastate and Federal-State coordination required by Sections 404(h)(1)(E) and (H) shall take place through the MDNR. A number of commenters noted that the Michigan Attorney General's Statement failed to specifically mention that MDNR, rather than MWRC, would be responsible for the interstate, intrastate and Federal-State coordination described above. According to these commenters, this claimed failure rendered Michigan's modified program description ``deficient on its face and, as a matter of law, [provides] an inadequate basis for public comment and provides EPA with an inadequate basis on which to determine whether or not the Michigan wetlands permitting program currently complies with applicable federal requirements.'' EPA disagrees. The basis for these commenters concern is their apparent belief that EPA must limit its review in this matter to the documents included with Michigan's December 15, 1993 letter to EPA, which included the Attorney General's Statement and Michigan's original October 26, 1983 program description. However, 40 CFR 233.16(d)(1) provides that a State may submit ``a modified program description or other documents which [EPA] determines to be necessary to evaluate whether the program complies with the requirements of the Act and this part'' (emphasis added). As described above, Michigan submitted a number of other documents to EPA in addition the December 15, 1993 letter, including a September 20, 1993 letter from Michigan which contained Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. As noted above, EPA's determination that Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program assures interstate, intrastate and Federal-State coordination is based upon the Attorney General's Statement, Michigan's October 26, 1983 program description, and Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. All of these documents were included in the administrative record which was made available for public review after EPA made its preliminary determination on April 21, 1994. The third set of comments regarding how Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 effected a change in public participation requirements pertained to the roles formerly played by the MWRC and the Michigan Natural Resources Commission (``MNRC'') as public ``sounding boards'' and sources of information pertaining to wetlands issues. According to these commentators, Executive Order 1991&hyph;31, in abolishing the MWRC and changing the role of the MNRC effected a change in public participation because the public now has less of an opportunity to understand issues or being decided or express concerns regarding the state's wetland program. EPA does not agree that this represents a change in the public particpation provisions of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. As described above, Michigan's original October 26, 1983 program description indicated that federal public participation requirements would be met based upon state statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to MDNR. There is nothing in Michigan's original program description which indicated that either MWRC or MNRC would play any role as part of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program in assuring compliance with federal public particpation requirements. Consequently, although these commissions may in fact have provided the public additional opportunities to receive information about and to comment on wetland issues, those opportunities were above and beyond the opportunities which were reviewed and approved by EPA as part of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. Consequently, the abolishment of MWRC and change in role for MNRC did not revise the public participation provisions of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. There were a number of comments regarding perceived changes in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program that have occurred since it was first approved by EPA in 1984, but which were not related in any way to Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. For example, commenters suggested that Michigan agencies and courts have interpreted the ``feasible and prudent alternatives'' test under Michigan law in a manner inconsistent with the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) guidelines. As was stated in the April 21, 1994, Federal Register notice, EPA's review in this matter is limited to a review of the revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program that have resulted from Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. A number of commenters stated that EPA cannot so limit its review. These commenters pointed to 40 CFR 233.1(b) which provides that ``[p]artial State programs are not approvable under section 404.'' EPA does not agree that 40 CFR 233.1(b) is applicable here.
