The Lusa news agency, in a report monitored here, said the guarantee was contained in a letter sent to the court by Macao Xinhua Vice-Director Ke Xiaogang. China has asked for the extradition of Bolivian passport holder Antonio Ti Luo, 45, who is wanted on charges involving a 50 million dollar joint venture fraud, and Hong Kong British Passport holder Yeung Yuk-leung, who is wanted on murder charges, Lusa said. The Supreme Court in the Portuguese enclave is due to rule on the request, although no date has yet been set. Portugal abolished the death penalty in the last century and under its constitution extraditions cannot be carried out for crimes involving capital punishment. The Macao lawyer of the two accused, Pedro Redinha, has questioned the guarantee, saying the Xinhua bureau is only a consular entity which would not have the power to commit state authorities to the pledge. London-based Amnesty International has also taken an interest in the case of Antonio Ti Luo and called on Macao not to extradite him as Portugal has no extradition treaty with China and because of its constitution, the agency said.
