FBIS4-67700 "jptep009___94059" JPRS-TEP-94-009 JPRS Epidemiology 19 March 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA INDIA Iodine Deficiency Causes 30,000 Still-Births Per Year Iodine Deficiency Causes 30,000 Still-Births Per Year BK2303142594 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS in English 19 Mar 94 p 2 BK2303142594 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS English BFN [Text] New Delhi -- More than 30,000 babies in India are estimated to be still-born every year, and over 1,20,000 are born cretins -- mentally retarded, physically stunted, deaf-mute or paralysed -- due to iodine deficiency in mothers, reports PTI. Disclosing this and other adverse effects of iodine deficiency, Executive Director of International Council for Control of iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), Basil S Hetzel, said here on Friday that the need for iodine starts even before a child is born. He said the total number of still births and neonatal deaths attributable to iodine deficiency was over 90,000. "If the mother is iodine deficient, the foetus too suffers iodine deficiency." When a child is deprived of its iodine needs during the period the brain is developing -- last six months of pregnancy to the first post-natal year -- the consequences could be disastrous, Hetzel said. Describing women of child bearing age and children under the age of 15 years as most susceptible to iodine deficiency disorders, he said the most common and visible ill-effect is goitre, an abnormal swelling in the neck.
