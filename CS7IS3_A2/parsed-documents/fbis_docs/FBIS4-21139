FBIS4-21139 "jptdd016__l94018" JPRS-TDD-94-016-L JPRS Narcotics Reaction to the 1994 U.S. State Department International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 5 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA PANAMA Ford Calls Report `Unfair' Ford Calls Report `Unfair' PA0604001194 Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 5 Apr 94 PA0604001194 Panama City Telemetro Television Network Spanish BFN [Text] According to a report released yesterday by Robert Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs [title as heard], Panama's dollar-based economy, the existence of a free zone in Colon Province, loose control over the exchange of money and raw material, and lenient laws have made Panama vulnerable to drugs, The report states that the Panamanian Government has not made any new, decisive efforts to curb the laundering of drug money in the past year; that Panamanian laws must be perfected; and that Panama's control organizations and resources are inadequate. According to a U.S. State Department report on international drug trafficking presented to the U.S. Congress, a number of countries, including Panama, are victims of corruption fostered by drug traffickers. The Panamanian Government has rejected this accusation several times, saying that it is making all possible efforts. Vice President Guillermo Ford thus reacted to the report: [Begin Ford recording] I am going to say this publicly and through our embassy. In 1990 the Republic of Panama issued a decree-law by which the Banking Commission would introduce rules to govern the management of cash through banks. Recently, through a cabinet decree, a new law was issued involving all assets coming into Panama through any port of entry. All countries are doing this. Meanwhile, Panama approved the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate. I think that instead of criticizing and promoting the idea that Panama supports drug trafficking and money laundering, we should all work together to eradicate these two scourges. [end recording] Nevertheless, the U.S. Government says that cocaine consumption has become a true worldwide scourge that corrupts and destroys lives, and it has accused Panama of lacking the political resolve to deal with the corruption caused by the drug. [Begin Ford recording] I must say publicly that I think it is unfair to say that Panama is not doing enough to eradicate this scourge. [end recording]. The State Department report asserts that drug production and trafficking are increasing and creating new opportunities for international criminals. In addition to Panama, the report lists Bolivia and Venezuela among the Latin American countries that are not making an effort to fight drug trafficking.
