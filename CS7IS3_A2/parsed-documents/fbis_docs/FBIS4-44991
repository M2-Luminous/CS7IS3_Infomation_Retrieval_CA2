Despite the fact that many issues having to do with agriculture were discussed, it is necessary to explain that what you have read and will read today is excerpts from this relatively long interview. Following the publication of the first and second installments of the interview, countless readers contacted the newspaper wanting to raise other issues with Dr. Kalantari. However, these readers must realize that it is practically impossible to discuss all the issues in one interview. Even so, their questions were sent to the Public Relations Office of the Ministry of Agriculture, so we can print the answers after we receive them from the minister of agriculture. It is worth mentioning that this interview will not be entirely conclusive unless we interview Engineer Gholam Reza Foruzesh, minister of construction jihad, and we hope to hold this interview as soon as possible. Printed below in this issue you will find the final installment of the interview with Dr. Kalantari. [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! With your permission, let us return to the first part of the interview. You have said repeatedly that the government has no money. On the one hand you have said that if the government would invest 900 million tumans over a seven-year period, many problems would be solved. This would be 120-130 million tumans per year, and we hope that the Majles deputies, the media, the officials, and the government itself will give the necessary importance to this important matter. In this same regard you mentioned that energy subsidies are useless. Mr. Minister! The elimination of this subsidy for a people who are crushed beneath the weight of high prices cannot be a suitable solution. The people are also without money. How much is this energy subsidy? [Kalantari] It is 2 trillion tumans per year! I am not saying this subsidy should be cut all at once. This should be done gradually, over a 10-year period. As far as I know, the government cannot make investments. This is an important point. With current revenues, with existing expenses, even if the government wishes to do so it cannot invest any more in agriculture. We need national investment. The people must be given a justification. The people must reduce their waste. The people must not be extravagant. [ABRAR] The government has asked the people with you, and they have made reductions. In these 15 years the people have declared their willingness to make every kind of sacrifice. But...? [Kalantari] We did not ask, but our religion has taught the people not to be extravagant for 1,400 years. [ABRAR] The people are not extravagant. If what you mean by extravagance is waste, the people are not to blame. For example, with regard to wasted bread, it is the bad quality of the bread. Are you and the government to blame for this? [Kalantari] This is one dimension of the problem. The government is also to blame. These very useless universal subsidies are one of the main factors in the waste. We must not give the public subsidies in the form of goods. We should pay money for the goods to the low-income classes. If someone buys bread at 35-40 tumans per kilogram and eats it, he does not throw it away, he does not waste it. A baker now makes 1 tuman profit for each kilogram of bread. Well, for this profit, we cannot expect him to sell good-quality bread. [ABRAR] The president of the republic has also said this, but we heard that some people asked that we not get into this subject. Is that correct? [Kalantari] Of course, those people want to take the easiest path, not the most proper path. They themselves do not want to deal with the problem. There are people who do not want to think. They do not want to put forth a new procedure. [ABRAR] In what way can cash subsidies be paid to the needy and deprived, who are said to number about 40 million? [Kalantari] About 40 percent of the nation's population is rural. We may not have anyone more deprived than them, but there is no bread subsidy for this great population (about 20 million people). They are buying bread at the true price. They are buying wheat at the same price it is sold to us and making it into flour and bread. There is no waste in their bread. There is also a solution for the others. [ABRAR] Let us talk about agricultural exports. What are the difficulties now facing exports? [Kalantari] Currently our food industries have two obstacles to exports, one is political, the other is hygiene. [ABRAR] In the first case, I do not think that this is a serious obstacle, that is if we can export food at international standards. [Kalantari] No, you are mistaken. If they are not buying our oil, does this mean they will buy our lemon juice and catsup? [ABRAR] Meaning, from this perspective we have a problem with the European Common Market? [Kalantari] Forget about the European Common Market. We have very little access to that. Consider our neighbor countries. With knowledge of the market price there, if we sold apples there at $.50 per kilogram, they would immediately bring the same apples of the same quality from that side of the world and sell them for $.20 per kilogram. [ABRAR] Well, do they do this "dumping" everywhere? [Kalantari] No! It is only for the products from our country. Just as soon as our agricultural products, and just ours, come in, this kind of competition, which is mostly political, takes place. Of course this is mostly done with goods that are subject to spoilage. [ABRAR] Of the nation's some 51 million hectares [ha] of arable land, how much is actually being used? Statistics say that 64 percent of Iran's soil resources, 55 percent of its water resources, 63 percent of its forest and pasture resources, and 85 percent of its aquatic food sources are not being used. Are the statistics correct? [Kalantari] The 51 million ha is correct, provided we have water. We now have 7.5 million ha of irrigated agriculture and about 11 million ha of dry-farmed agriculture. [ABRAR] Meaning that the country's existing water is not sufficient for these 51 million ha? [Kalantari] It is not adequate for 51 million ha. However, if we want, we can easily increase irrigated farm land from 7.5 million to 20 million ha, as I said before, if there is investment, if the government wishes to do so, if the Majles insists. [ABRAR] ...and 63 percent of the forest and pasture resources? [Kalantari] You should ask the minister of construction jihad about that, but I do not think this figure is correct. [ABRAR] ...and 85 percent of the aquatic food resources? [Kalantari] I think you should ask the executive director of fisheries about that. [ABRAR] We would like to know your view of the claim that if proper use were made of aquatic resources our country would be freed of the need to import hundreds of millions of dollars of food each year. [Kalantari] I think that we use more than 15 percent of the sea resources. It is difficult for me to believe this. [ABRAR] You asked us to ask the minister of the construction jihad about forests and pastures. What is your view? [Kalantari] The greatest damage to the nation's agriculture is the destruction of water and soil. In the future, this will not only be a cultivation problem, it will also be a major problem for the nation's industries as well. They are destroying the country, they are destroying life. Every year 4 billion square meters, or 400,000 ha, or 4,000 square km, of our nation's soil is destroyed and... [ABRAR] And this is negligence by you and the government! [Kalantari] All of us! It makes no difference if it is the people, the government, they all go together. [ABRAR] What did the people do wrong? How can they prevent the destruction of water and soil? [Kalantari] It makes not difference. All of us! We do not notice that our country's soil is being destroyed. [ABRAR] Well, now we ask you. What should be done to prevent the destruction of water and soil? [Kalantari] I say that we valued our country's water and soil when we were faced with a foreign enemy and our youth sacrificed themselves for every inch of our homeland's water and soil. Then we have thousands of kilometers of our soil being destroyed and we are silent. Yet it is necessary for us to give this same importance to our water and soil in the struggle against natural problems, and not just in the battle with the foreign enemy. This task does not cost a lot. Its importance has not yet become evident to the country. The people and the officials are not yet aware of the importance of this problem culturally and economically. [ABRAR] Now that we have become aware of the importance of the problem, what should we do to prevent heavy losses to our nation's soil? [Kalantari] We must determine what are the agents of the destruction. [ABRAR] Who should determine that? [Kalantari] We must determine it. [ABRAR] You are determining it. Are you studying in order to prevent this destruction? [Kalantari] As I said to you before, this task is not one of the responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture, it is the responsibility of the Ministry of the Construction Jihad. [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! Thank you for the time you have given us for this relatively long interview. We hope we have not tired you. [Kalantari] I thank you also.
