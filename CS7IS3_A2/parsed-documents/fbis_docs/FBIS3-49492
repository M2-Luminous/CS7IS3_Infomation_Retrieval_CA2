"If the Slovak Government still agreed with dissemination of RFE broadcasts, it would actually agree with the correctness of the discriminatory decision," Hrnko says. According to Hrnko, freedom of the press in Slovakia is comparable to that in the Czech Republic, Poland, or Hungary. "I do not think that everything is in order with democracy in Slovakia, as we still have a lot of work to become a really democratic country. But that sort of democracy we have is also in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary," Hrnko says, and points to the government's interference in radio and television broadcasting in Hungary. Hrnko notes that in the past the RFE was dividing the Slovak political scene into the democratic part, whereby the pro-Czechoslovak forces were meant, and the undemocratic part, whereby the advocates of Slovak sovereignty were meant. "This division complicates the real crystallization of the political forces. If someone labels the premier's steps as undemocratic, he automatically evokes the division into pro-Czechoslovak democrats and undemocratic supporters of Slovak independence." [passage omitted]
