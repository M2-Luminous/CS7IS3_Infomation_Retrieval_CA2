The construction of clandestine airstrips for medium- and large-sized planes in the Paraguayan Chaco is reportedly the key to all this. Bolivian drug traffickers are reportedly gradually giving up the obligatory route through Asuncion for shipment of cocaine directly from the Chaco. Police sources have reported that the Chaco-Europe connection reportedly includes Spain and Portugal, and other neighboring countries, as the final destination for the drugs. Top officials from the National Antinarcotics Secretaria (Senad) are reportedly aware of this fact, which is under investigation to verify the seriousness of what is really happening. The sources added that the clandestine airstrips are no longer limited to small single-engine or twin-engine planes, but can also receive larger planes capable of direct international flights or with fewer stopovers. The controls carried out lately at the airports in the various countries of our continent have forced traffickers to find other ways to continue to export cocaine to Europe with the least risk possible. The Paraguayan Chaco offers the traffickers the best possibilities for conducting clandestine operations and flights, due to little or no air or land control, the sources added. Senad does not yet know for sure where the landing strips are located, although the sources reported that they could be located in Pedro P. Pena, Eugenio A. Garay, Parque Cue, and Infante Rivarola. The police sources added that these airstrips could also be located north of Lagerenza, or in the woods near San Alfredo or Sierra Leon.
