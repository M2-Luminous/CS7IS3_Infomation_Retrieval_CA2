He said that he would discuss economic and trade issues with China on the trip, but that the United States attached more importance to human rights. Through various channels, the United States once again has spread the atmosphere that "if a decision were to be made now as to whether or not to grant China most-favored-nation [MFN] status, the United States would decide to cancel it, and that therefore China must make further progress." The United States is attempting to use "human rights" as a big stick to exert pressure on China, interfere in China's internal affairs, and issue orders as to what road China should take and how its reform should proceed. In the months before each June, the United States uses the MFN status as a trump card to continuously make various unreasonable demands, such as "allowing the United States to broadcast to China," issuing a list of prisoners they want released, "improving political and religious freedoms," "exporting no prison-made products," "visiting prisons in China," and "human rights in Tibet." The United States not only makes demands verbally, but at the same time supports some troublemakers in intentionally making trouble within the territory of China. With voices from the outside and the inside, they create all kinds of so- called "human rights" incidents in a planned way as a pretext for taking further interfering action. In 1989, U.S. officials repeatedly met with Fang Lizhi, Wang Dan, and others, and closely collaborated with them in making trouble. Last August, when China made a bid for the Olympic Games, Han Dongfang, who has close ties with U.S. labor unions, collaborated by attempting to return to the mainland via Hong Kong to "promote democratic movements." After he had failed in an attempt to steal through customs and had his passport withdrawn, some people in Hong Kong held gatherings and processions to show support. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten gave a speech attacking China. This year, on the eve of the U.S. secretary of state's China visit, some Americans went from Hong Kong to Henan's Fangcheng County and carried out illegal missionary activities there. They had overnight gatherings, made videotapes, and faxed records of their activities back to Hong Kong in different batches and at different periods. As they would not listen to the warning by the quarters concerned, action was taken to enforce the law, but the Americans immediately responded by lumping that togethre with the MFN status. A few days ago, the United States sent Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck to Beijing to "prepare" for Christopher's China visit. That was an official visit on which he should have respected diplomatic protocol by being with the host on his itinerary and schedule. Shattuck, however, went to meet with opponents of the Chinese Government, and discussed with them whether or not to grant MFN status to China. Some of them suggested that the United States cancel China's MFN status; others even wished to arrange for meetings between the secretary of state and the dissidents. Does the United States want a sincere dialogue with the Chinese Government, or is it attempting to do something to support the dissidents by making use of the visit to send them a political gift and give them support with a view to achieving the political aim of interfering in China's politics? Any country must safeguard its sovereignty and security, keep its internal affairs from outside interference, and allow no foreign country to support political dissidents in making trouble, let alone Wei Jingsheng, who is a parolee who still has to observe parole regulations. Now that he has violated the regulations, the Chinese public security authorities, naturally, could take legitimate summoning measures in accordance with law. The fact that the United States attempted to interfere in China's legal procedures and parole regulations, and to put China's judicial organs under its control naturally has violated international law. Clause number seven under article two of the UN Charter provides for the safeguarding of state sovereignty. It reads: "This Charter must not be considered as empowering the United Nations to interfere in any affairs that are of nature within the jurisdiction of a country." The human rights question involves the enforcement of law and is the internal affair of a country. If a foreign country is allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of a country as it wishes, it will lose its sovereignty, its political situation will become turbulent, and it will lose the right of national development, and in turn personal human rights will have no guarantee. Facts of aggression and intervention in the Third World explain this well. The developing situations in former Eastern European countires, and in Yugoslavia, also explain this. The United States knows very well how to safeguard its own sovereignty. Although there are seven international human rights pacts, the United States has joined only one, not the other six, because the pacts affect its sovereignty. The United States insists that its Constitution and laws prevail over the human rights pacts and that it is not interfered with by these pacts. On the one hand, it says it is safeguarding "human rights," but on the other, it is violating them. For instance, it carried out the armed aggression against Cuba, kidnapped its president, and bombarded its civilians. In Somalia, it shot women and children with guns. It openly supported cannon attacks on the people-elected parliament and the killing of several hundred people. It has tacitly allowed the slaughters and strikes in the Israeli-occupied territories every day, and has grossly intervened in the political criteria and social patterns of other countries. These countries have no political choice, as their right of choice is dependent on American will and new criteria are set by the U.S.-supported political parties. This U.S.-style "human rights" concept obviously is unacceptable to the Chinese people. If Christopher is going to discuss China's human rights question with an attitude of equality during his China visit, China will be glad to discuss it with him. If he wants to develop economic and trade relations with China, China holds a positive and cooperative attitude, as this is a mutually beneficial matter. However, if someone is going use "human rights" to pressure China to open its market, with a view to reaping economic interests or benefiting himself at China's expense, and if he goes so far as to use this to test China's ability and will to safeguard its sovereignty and to force China to swallow the bitter pill of having its internal affairs interfered with, then he underestimates China's determination for independence and self-determination, and will only end up in dream. If the United States cooperates, then both sides will benefit, but if it uses MFN status as a threatening means, it ultimately will harm its own interests.
