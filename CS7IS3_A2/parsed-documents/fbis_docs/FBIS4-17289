The Crisis in Light Industry and the Textile Industry Can Be Surmounted Only Through Joint Efforts by the Center and the Regions"] [Text] Production volumes in the textile industry and light industry have fallen more than 50 percent over the past three years. Today only a small proportion of enterprises is continuing to work steadily, while a further drop in production is occurring in the bulk of factories. A fall in production volumes has been noted for literally all types of output. The financial position of enterprises is continuing to deteriorate. As a result of the government's inflexible monetary and credit policy producers do not have the working capital to acquire raw materials. Because of this many factories are on the verge of bankruptcy, the majority of them are going over to a short work day and a short work week, and they have been forced to make people take unpaid leave. The critical situation which has taken shape in the sector necessitated the urgent holding in Moscow of an enlarged session of the board of the Russian Interregional Union of Textile and Light Industry Entrepreneurs. Boris Fomin, its president, pointed out that this is the first time the sector's problems have been discussed at such a high level. Representatives of the Russian Federation State Committee for Industrial Policy, the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank participated in the work of the conference in addition to leaders of enterprises. Representatives of 37 Russian Federation kray and oblast administrations were also invited to the capital. In Boris Fomin's opinion, the situation can be rectified if enterprises are given assistance out of local budgets. As is known, the federal budget today controls only 15 percent of all the funds, the rest of the money being in the regions. It is no coincidence that, as experience shows, the situation is far better where the leaders of krays and oblasts devote proper attention to enterprises' problems, allocate credits to them, and help them to acquire raw materials. But this does not mean, of course, that the government must entirely dissociate itself from the sector's problems; on the contrary, without state support for enterprises during this transitional period it is hardly possible to reckon on the successful implementation of economic reforms. The appeal to the country's leadership adopted by the participants in the enlarged session of the Union of Textile and Light Industry Entrepreneurs says that the sector is in a very grave position today. Hidden unemployment, which already has more than 700,000 working people in its grip, the majority of whom are women, is escalating into real unemployment. Wages are not paid for several months. People can see no way out of the present situation and have been reduced to despair, there is growing indignation at the government's failure to take effective measures, and strike committees are being set up. The appeal proposes a whole number of specific measures that might halt the collapse of these sectors of industry. The results of the conference were examined at a session of the Russian Federation Government Commission on Operational Questions under the chairmanship of First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. The Ministry of Finance was instructed to find an opportunity to grant to enterprises a deferment of the repayment of the preferential centralized credits issued in the sum total of 8.7 billion rubles [R], including R1.3 billion for Ivanovo Oblast, and to postpone the deadline for repaying the said credits until 1 January 1995. In addition, measures will be taken jointly with the Bank of Russia to prolong until 1 July 1994 the centralized credits to the tune of R32.4 billion received by textile and light industry enterprises in 1993 to acquire raw materials at the prime rate of the Bank of Russia, as well as measures to prolong through the end of this year the credits to the tune of R44 billion allocated to Ivanovo Oblast enterprises on the same terms. It was also decided to grant to individual textile and light industry enterprises in Ivanovo Oblast a six-month deferment of payments of profits tax and VAT into the federal budget to the tune of R25 billion.
