Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar at a press conference today indicated Estonia was interested in the "Partnership for Peace" program. He said the country was going to prepare its formal position on the issue within the next few days and submit it to NATO. He said the document which must bear the signatures of the president and the prime minister had been drawn up already. "We wish to start negotiations with NATO on future cooperation on the first opportunity. We wish to fill the agreements to be signed with a concrete content," the Estonian prime minister said. The issue of Estonia's membership in NATO was also discussed by the parliamentary foreign Affairs Commission today. The commission ruled to draw up a draft resolution for the parliament, seeking the president to write a formal application for Estonia's membership in NATO. The draft resolution was approved by the parliament's 9-member Foreign Affairs Commission with 6 votes to 2 and one abstention. The adoption of the resolution now depends on a vote in the parliament. "The idea that remained in the atmosphere at the discussion was that we were late with our application for NATO membership. Unlike in Latvia, there is even no institution in Estonia to have expressed support to Lithuania on the country's entering its application for NATO membership. The prevailing tone in the commission was that the process of becoming a member in NATO has to be set off to express our political attitude," said Tiit Made, member of the Foreign Affairs Commission. He said the commission's attitude toward the "Partnership for Peace" plan was mainly positive. The commission is to take the issue for discussion again on Jan. 24, when the text of the partnership plan is to be more closely examined. "It was found that early membership in NATO was not a realistic prospective and that 'Partnership for Peace' provides the possibility to move forward step-by-step. Also NATO has to maneuver politically while accepting new members, in view of Russia's attitude," Made said. Made in his interview with BNS also criticized the inactivity of the Foreign Ministry in expressing interest toward NATO and supporting Lithuania's application. Toivo Klaar, head of the political department at the Estonian Foreign Ministry, said Estonia's attitude toward the adoption of the "Partnership for Peace" program was positive and that the country was going to use every opportunity for cooperation with NATO and other countries involved in the partnership program. Klaar said the partnership program provided an "excellent opportunity for integration with NATO, for working closely with the alliance and moving toward the final goal, a member's status in NATO," he said. Commenting on the NATO leaders' decision not to grant security guarantees to the countries under the program, Klaar said that these things "are not yet the way we liked." But he pointed out as important that consultations can be held in case the security of the NATO partners is threatened. "The great potential that NATO has, the power that stands behind it, and the consultations -- already this by itself can be a guarantee of peace," he said. He said the Baltics as well as the Central European countries of the so-called Visegrad group -- Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic -- both had their best points for integration with NATO. "The Visegrad countries have bigger armies and more experience. At the same time the fact that our armies are small and young allows us to build them up from the very beginning on patterns suitable for NATO," Klaar said. He pointed out as an important step Estonia's decision to purchase of arms of the NATO standards from Israel, as well as the Baltics' decision to set up a common Baltic peacekeeping battalion, which can participate in peacekeeping operations together with NATO units in the future.
