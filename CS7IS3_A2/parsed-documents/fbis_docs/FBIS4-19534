[Uhrlau] It depends on how you define danger. If you ask about a danger to the liberal democratic basic system, then none of the wide-branching groups are a danger because they are so negligible. If you look at the matter from the viewpoint of militant behavior -- that is, you include public security and order to a great extent -- then the autonomous groups naturally continue to be important for the FRG's security system. The respective activities of the autonomous groups are related to issues and related to specific occasions, however, with all the difficulties that are linked with these statements. If there are no issues, activities decline. This also weakens the structure. This means that the readiness for action always depends on specific issues. [Lillig] Such a topic is "antifascism." How do you assess the struggle of "left against right?" [Uhrlau] First, you have to proceed from the premise that the so-called militant antifascist struggle of the 1970's and 1980's has an ideological foundation in the fact that "fascism" is inseparably linked with "capitalism" and that neo-Nazis and right-wing extremist parties that are not neo-Nazi parties are "henchmen" and "watchdogs" of the capitalist-imperialist system. And thus, for left-wing extremists, an attack on right-wing extremists is also a contribution to fighting against the system. This conflict took place by means of publications, publicly, and also through militant actions. And within the framework of this so-called antifascist militant struggle there were arson attacks, bomb attacks, bodily injury, and material damage in the 1980's -- a lot of material damage to cars --they were "flattened," as the scene said -- or material damage to the apartments of known right-wing extremists. The basis was the statement: "Hit the fascists where you meet them!" -- including fliers that were like wanted posters. And this was the situation in particular in the 1980's, a time when right-wing extremism did not play such a great role as in the 1990's. This model has been taken over by the right-wing extremists as of 1992. The conflict of "right against left" has, however, not been able to develop this systematic action of the left-wing extremists or at least not fully develop it. One can see an east-west difference in the conflict between "right/left" and "left/right." In the west, there is a stronger conflict of "left against right" and in the east a stronger conflict of "right against left," which can be explained against the background of the different regional distribution of the militant left-wing extremist and right-wing extremist scene. [Lillig] Well, one could assume that as long as they are busy with each other, they are not a danger to democracy. [Uhrlau] These acts of violence are an expression of a basic rejection of the system. For left-wing extremism, neo-Nazis or right-wing extremist parties and their members are something that must be attacked within the framework of the struggle against the system in order to weaken the system, to restrict fascism, which is growing stronger from their point of view: active participation, since the state cannot be expected to purposefully contain the right-wing extremists because of its nature as an "accomplice." For the right-wing extremists, including the skinheads, it also has something to do with the changed self-confidence, with the changed strength of these groups. This is then partly headed by the slogan "against antinational forces" to find broader space for their own activities and also space for their claim about themselves. All this has a very elementary effect on the self-understanding of our democracy, namely that no one must use violent means to enforce his political positions. In this respect, the conflict between the two groups is, at the same time, also an attack on essential elements of our democratic system. [Lillig] Let us return to the "mobilization" in the extremist struggle against each other: One could read In a news magazine that "leftist" and "rightists" are even shooting at each other. Is it to be expected that the militant "left/right struggle" will continue to amplify itself? [Uhrlau] These conflicts have never been distinguished by particular peacefulness. In justifying the militant "antifascist struggle," individual persons have certainly explained why, in a conflict with neo-Nazis, one has to condone the fact that one may have "to cross the Wupper" [get killed]. This is not the goal, but it if happens the left-wing extremists do not grieve, either. It is not an intention, but it is a result that is condoned. In the actions of "right against left," "left" need not necessarily mean "left-wing extremist." From the viewpoint of the "rightists," anyone who is not a supporter of national concepts and policy can be a "tick." This can be someone who refuses to say that Adolf Hitler is the greatest statesman of all times. And as a result of this initially verbal conflict, he will then be beaten and may be killed. This very brutal act, which is not controlled by a relation between the goal and the means used to achieve it, certainly influences the discussion among autonomous groups in relatiom to the rightists. They say that the rightists are contemptuous of people and hurt them. And then, in their view, one does not need a political argument, but "antifascist resistance" is "violent resistance." [Lillig] A completely different question: What do you say to the accusation that the state protects the "rightists" while acting against the "leftists" with excessive toughness? The accusation is, for instance, raised during "leftist" demonstrations against "rightist" party events, when the police protects the party followers against those who protest. [Uhrlau] The state protect the law. A party that holds a party congress -- which it is obligated to do, by party law -- a party congress that includes the naming of candidates or an election rally of a right-wing extremist party that runs for elections -- these events must be held, because if the state cannot enforce the right to the freedom of association, this would mean that any claim to a right would be arbitrary. This does not mean that the state accepts and must accept everything regarding the activities of rightist organizations and parties. For instance: In the election campaign in Hamburg, the "National List" tried with the most varied excuses to hold demonstrations, which were rejected by the administrative courts in both first and second instances. Thus, there were no demonstrations. It was assumed that such demonstrations would lead to crimes or would make it impossible to guarantee security and order. There were comprehensive bans on demonstrations all over the country. Quite another question is whether and where the right-wing extremists managed to get around extensive police barriers, also by using state-of-the-art communications technology, to turn up briefly but spectacularly in a completely different place and only with a fraction of those who were wiling to demonstrate. This was the case in Fulda and in Rudolstadt in 1992. This does not mean that the state let the "rightists" do what they want and those who oppose right-wing extremism are pushed away by the police. The available instruments are used very consistently against right-wing extremism. [Lillig] Why does the state then permit organizations that are hostile to the constitution to act at all? Why does it give them -- event though unintentionally and unplanned -- a forum instead of banning them? [Uhrlau] In a democracy, bans are always the last resort of state action because the instrument that is appropriate for a democracy is political argument. And only when certain developments and phenomena are no longer acceptable, when the advantages of a ban are greater for the community than the disadvantages and the restrictions on political activities, only then do bans make any sense. Regarding the neo-Nazi organizations -- and this also applies to two parties, for which an application for a ban has been made -- the point was to show that the acceptable threshold had been crossed, also in view of the very young people who were interested. [Lillig] What is the strategy of left-wing extremist forces to affect society? How do they exert their influence, what are their topics, how do they communicate with each other? [Uhrlau] In contrast to the 1970's, the topics are no longer large global issues. The issues are more regional and local, relating more directly to experiences so that more people get involved in the issues -- issues such as antifascism, the improvement of city districts, or the struggle for peace. The spreading of one's own position takes place via publications of the scene. They are very varied, very colorful, have rather small print runs, and for the authors these publications are their entire world. Then there is also the possibility to call attention to a certain topic by demonstrative actions, for instance by carrying out attacks or staging demonstrations. This is how the issues get into the press. When you think of Berlin, for instance, this setting fire to luxury cars, this destruction of shops for so-called prosperous people. [Lillig] Is there an international network in left-wing extremism? [Uhrlau] Given the left-wing extremism's own claim, it must be internationalist. What existed in the past within the framework of bipolarity, with a firm ideological center in Moscow, a minor center in Beijing, and perhaps another one in Tirana, and then a revolutionary center some place in Latin America for other groups -- this is largely a thing of the past. However, a real network, while preserving independence and a uniting for actions, did not exist in this form. If there is dependence, you do not have a network. In many demonstrations -- also of the autonomous science, which also has its internationalist struggle -- we have repeatedly had representatives of other countries, also as speakers, but these have been ties that were always very much related to a specific project, a specific object, and specific persons. When the people from Hamburg had contacts with Copenhagen, these were contacts at the level of squatters. For that there was solidarity, togetherness, perhaps also joint action at international economic summits or EC summits, or whatever. But we cannot see this as an expression of a common strategy, of common action. [Lillig] In conclusion, one question about Constitutional Protection: Is it sufficient what Constitutional Protection is doing to combat extremism? [Uhrlau] Clearly yes. Our instruments, both in terms of laws and personnel, are basically sufficient. [Lillig] Constitutional Protection has been variously criticized and its efficiently in combating extremism has been called into question. It has been said that the activists of the authorities are too restricted to collecting and evaluating information -- but they are prohibited from acting. [Uhrlau] Our assignment -- and you described that correctly -- is to collect and evaluate information. We are, therefore, an instrument of analysis. We are not an executive authority. And our activities are largely related to the nonmilitant area. As an instrument of analysis we are not the ones who make arrests; we are not permitted to do that; there is the clear command of separation of powers. However, with the information we gather and the analysis we make, we can enable others to act -- to prevent acts of violent and riots. We are not an instrument to prohibit thinking. It is the assignment of the Constitutional Protection authorities -- in particular as a part of a democracy that can defend itself -- to provide the governments with information and impressions about forces that operate against the liberal democratic basic system. Trying to link that to issues of criminal prosecution bypasses the actual task of Constitutional Protection.
