The issue of creating a federal tax system that is differentiated by the country's regions is being raised with increasing urgency. Our correspondent met with Candidate of Economic Sciences Boris Viktorovich Melentyev, a specialist on regional and interregional problems and a research associate at the Institute of Economics and Organization of Industrial Production of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The topic of their conversation is taxes. [Voronchikhin] Boris Viktorovich, literally everyone today is moaning about chaos in taxation. It is complicated, confusing, too much, unfair, and so on. In the past we only knew about income tax, plus childless people had to pay a certain percentage of their wages. Now there are all sorts of deductions. I bet that soon there will a tax on beards. Do we really need such a multitude of taxes, and can we not do without them altogether? [Melentyev] By tax we usually understand mandatory payments appropriated by the state. We usually part with this money with regret, especially if taxes are high. Nevertheless, a certain part of taxes, especially at the all-Russia (federal) level, are a necessary attribute of financial regulation of economic activities. They are needed because the state, through tax revenue, finances directly out of the budget, among other things, defense, the pension and other social funds, targeted development of new production, etc. [Voronchikhin] Since it is a "production necessity," dictated by "harsh reality," then should there not be, instead of the chaos that reigns today in state tax policy, a flexible system of duties that is agreeable for everyone? [Melentyev] Creating a logical system of taxes is to a certain extent an art: They must be simple; the principles for calculating them, understandable for everyone; there should not be many of them; and they should not be too high and should not suppress the initiative of economic growth. In order for taxes to serve as active means of state policy, it is desirable that they fulfill several functions--for instance, not only ensure the flow of revenue, but also stimulate achievement of certain policy goals. In particular, high excise tax on tobacco and alcohol products constrains consumption of these products by young people; increasing tax on profit if it is used for wages provides an incentive to direct it into production development. Unfortunately, most existing taxes do not meet these requirements. I will point out one peculiarity that is not typical of the tax systems of other countries, but for us it is simply mandatory. It is appropriation of an enterprise's extra income for its placement in favorable climatic conditions (one of the kinds of differential rents). In the world practice a differential rent is not calculated separately and is included in enterprise's income, therefore is appropriated only partially within the limits of tax on profit. But the world does not have other countries comparable to Russia in terms of territorial size. Differential rents manifest themselves in the income from foreign trade of southern countries with those in the north because of lower costs of agricultural products. A transition from the prevailing old system of financial regulation of economic activities by planned targets to management where economic (market) principles become increasingly predominant constitutes the main contents of the reforms began in 1985. Their goal is to shift to profit as the criterion of activities, and by providing a combination of centralized administration and market regulation to expand the principles of self-financing not only for territorial entities (oblasts, republics). [Voronchikhin] This means that today a lot depends on the competent actions of bodies of state administration? [Melentyev] Modern practice demands a transition from a rigid planning, lessening, and reduction of this function of central bodies, to strict measures of financial regulation. The old system of economic management could not make serious demands on the financial sphere. For instance, the prices enterprises charged for their products did not necessarily cover the costs, since what was demanded of enterprises was first and foremost to fulfill the plan. The all-national economic balance--distribution of the output produced--was carried out only at the top level; at the bottom, the disbalance was covered by subsidies. In the new environment, state administration bodies have to create for all economic entities an adequate economic and legal environment. It is characterized by a fair tax system, setting up a mechanism of mutual responsibility between enterprises and financial bodies, maintaining equivalent circulation, and timely banking and credit clearing. [Voronchikhin] You were talking about climatic conditions; I assume you had in mind northern allowances and the Siberian coefficient?.. [Melentyev] The process of expanding the regulating role of the state with the help of economic elements of administration (prices for the output of monopolist enterprises, taxes, credits, etc.) have their special peculiarities in our country because of its great territory and sharp differences in natural and climatic conditions. This peculiarity requires equalizing the operating environment across the regions. People living in the regions with harsher climate spend more on warm clothing and food. Also of considerable importance is that consumer goods are more expensive here as well. This means that wages in these regions must be higher than in the south. A man, no matter in what region he lives, should get for the same labor the wages that would provide him with the same standard of living. Until now the state regulated the factor of such differentials in the form of centrally set territorial coefficients to base wages. In addition, prices for enterprises' output also were centrally differentiated by region: in the south they were lower, and in the north, higher. This way differential rent was appropriated and production environment was equalized across the regions. In modern market relations most prices are set either by the market or by regional rather than central bodies. As is known, prices in any market have a tendency to equalize. For instance, during V. Chernomyrdin's visit to the Far East in August of last year, a demand was made to set electric power rates there at the same level as in the rest of Russia. But with prices the same on average across the regions, the differential rent ends up in the southerners' income. This is not fair since this income is not associated directly with the labor expenditures of those who have appropriated this income in a disguised form. Now the state function of factoring territorial differences is narrowed down and includes only entities financed out of the federal budget. For economically independent enterprises the principle of factoring regional costs and deduction of differential rent must be determined differently. [Voronchikhin] How? [Melentyev] Wages are an element of enterprises' costs. Therefore, those located in harsher climatic conditions objectively will have higher costs at least because of higher wages. In addition, harsh climate requires greater use of electric power, fuels, additional costs... This means that enterprises in the north will produce more expensive products that are not competitive with those produced by enterprises in the south. I do not have to explain the consequences. You cannot place the entire population in the square adjacent to the White House. It is in the interest of the state to distribute the population across the entire territory of the country. Therefore, wages must be differentiated, while enterprises' income must be equalized in accordance with the principle of social justice. The proposal is very simple: to introduce a federal tax on land; [column line missing] in the north it will be lower. The difference between the level of taxes must cover the additional expenses incurred in the north because of the harsh climatic conditions and the distance from industrially developed centers. [Voronchikhin] As many centuries of Russian history show us, the issue of land is one of the most difficult to resolve. Perhaps taxes would provide that very tool with the help of which this delicate problem at least may be regulated less painfully? [Melentyev] The impact of this tax is multifaceted. First, it provides an incentive for enterprises not to halt production, because this tax always has to be paid, even when the enterprise has no output. Second, it provides an incentive for prudent land use, because this use is not free. The aforementioned principle of equalizing production conditions sharply diminishes the need to develop a system of prices for transportable products produced by monopolist enterprises that are differentiated by zones, because a regional differential from the average national price will be determined by the difference in selling and transportation costs in deliveries between regions. Besides, land tax is more stable than prices. After all, its level does not depend on the changing state of the market and other operational environment. Establishing such a tax is not a goal in itself--it is an element of improving the system of financial regulation of economic activities. The main principle of the tax policy should be as follows: Only after fulfilling the equalizing function with the help of regionally differentiated land-use rent can a unified principle of taxation by other factors be ensured. [Voronchikhin] A regional tax differential probably should be scientifically substantiated, pass the expert evaluation of the Federal Assembly, and be codified in law, should it not? [Melentyev] Unfortunately, the idea of a regional tax differential makes headway with great difficulty and sometimes degenerates into foreign forms. Instead of differentiating taxes as such, the share of contribution into local and federal budgets is differentiated. This situation creates a basis for bureaucratic arbitrariness with very familiar rules: to give or not to give; how much to give and how much to take? [Word missing] for instance, the republics of Chechnya, Yakutia, Bashkortostan, and Tatarstan transfer the entire revenue from the value-added tax into local budgets; some oblasts transfer 20 percent, and some, 50 percent. Apparently, what is behind it is not economic calculation but rather the level of noise produced by statements of their sovereignty. [Voronchikhin] Is this not why other federation components before the adoption of the new constitution so actively demanded republic status? [Melentyev] Most likely. Keeping in mind the caution of federal authorities in this delicate business--what share of taxes to give up to the federal budget--it becomes necessary to set custom duties for one or another republic or oblast with respect to the import and export of products. The level of "import" duties should exactly correspond to the value of differential rents charged. For instance, Russia does not produce citrus fruit or grapes; this means that import of these products should be duty-free. But when we import what we make ourselves, we should apply the tax--in order to equalize the economic conditions of production, to protect domestic producers. Hence, the slogan of a single economic space that is currently being touted by the presidents of the CIS southern republics is unsuitable for Russia. Just as Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova have the right to purchase our gas or other goods in their own way, on different terms. Implementing the principles described above to construct a regional differential federal tax system finally will allow liquidation of the statute on unsubsidized development of the northern territories, or at least reduce the subsidies to one-time events, that is, temporary state subventions (development-aimed incentive subsidies). We have to hurry, because economic contradictions between regions and injustice usually result in social tension...
