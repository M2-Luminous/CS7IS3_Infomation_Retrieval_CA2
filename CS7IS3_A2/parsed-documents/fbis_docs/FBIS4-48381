The 2,000 people, who had been hiding in river swamps called nyamwiza, are the few people who have survived the massacres committed by Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND]'s militias and government soldiers. The survivors are telling stories of horror that thousands of people, men, women, and children were hacked to death while many others were tied with their hands behind their back and thrown into River Nyabarongo which flows into the River Akagera. These bodies have been flowing into Lake Victoria causing a health hazard along the Akagera River course through Tanzania and Uganda. The RPF has now taken control of Bugesera and restored calm in these areas. There are no more people being thrown into the River Nyabarongo, for the MRND's youthwingers who have been committing atrocities are now on the run. The dead bodies flowing down Akagera River are said to be decomposing and not fresh corpses. This has confirmed that the killings by the MRND youthwingers have been greatly reduced and peace is slowly returning to these areas.
