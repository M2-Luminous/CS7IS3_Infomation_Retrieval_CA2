Also, evidence, in the form of a certified Board Resolution, of the Sponsor's willingness to fund the estimated start-up expenses, the Minimum Capital Investment (one-half of one-percent of the HUD-approved capital advance, not to exceed $10,000) (see 890.250), and the estimated cost of any amenities or features (and operating costs related thereto) which would not be coverd by the approved capital advance. 15. A list of the applications, if any, the Sponsor has submitted or is planning to submit to any other Field Office in response to this NOFA or the NOFA for Supportive Housing for the Elderly (published elsewhere in today's Federal Register ). Indicate by Field Office, the number of units requested, and the proposed location by city and State for each application. A list of all FY 1993 and prior year projects to which the Sponsor(s) is a party, identified by project number and Field Office, which have not been finally closed. 16. HUD&hyph;2880, Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report including Social Security Numbers and Employee Identification Numbers. 17. Evidence of need for supportive housing. An identification of the proposed population and evidence demonstrating sustained effective demand for the housing for the proposed population in the area to be served, such as a description of market conditions in existing Federally assisted housing for persons with disabilities (occupancy, waiting lists, etc.), state or local needs assessments of persons with disabilities in the area, the types of supportive services arrangements currently available in the area, and the utilization of such services as evidenced by data from local social service agencies. 18. Evidence of control of an approvable site, or identification of a site for which the Sponsor provides reasonable assurances that it will obtain control within 6 months from the date of fund reservation (if Sponsor is approved for funding); (a) If the Sponsor has control of the site, it must submit the following information: (1) Evidence that the Sponsor has entered into a legally binding option agreement to purchase or lease the proposed site; or has a copy of the contract of sale for the site, a deed, long-term leasehold, a request with all supporting documentation, submitted either prior to or with the Application for Capital Advance, for a partial release of a site covered by a mortgage under a HUD program or other evidence of legal ownership of the site (including properties to be acquired from the RTC). The option agreement period must extend through the end of the current fiscal year and contain a renewal provision so that the option can be renewed for at least an additional six months. The Sponsor must also identify any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. In the case of a site to be acquired from a public body, evidence that the public body possesses clear title to the site, and has entered into a legally binding agreement to lease or convey the site to the Sponsor after it receives and accepts a notice of section 811 capital advance and identification of any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. However, in localities where HUD determines that the time constraints of the funding round will not permit all of the required official actions (e.g., approval of Community Planning Boards) which are necessary to convey publicly-owned sites, a letter in the application from the Mayor or Director of the appropriate local agency indicating their approval of conveyance of the site contingent upon the necessary approval action is acceptable and may be approved by the Field Office if it has satisfactory experience with timely conveyance of sites from that public body. In such cases, documentation shall also include a copy of the public body's evidence of ownership and identification of any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. For properties to be acquired from the RTC, include a copy of the RTC prepared Transaction Screen Checklist or Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, and applicable documentation, per the RTC Environmental Guidelines. [ Note: A proposed project site may not be acquired or optioned from a general contractor (or its affiliate) which will construct the section 811 project or from any other development team member.]
