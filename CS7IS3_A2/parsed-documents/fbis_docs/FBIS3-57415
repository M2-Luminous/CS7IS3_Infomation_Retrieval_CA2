Viktor Gerashchenko picked up the gauntlet and stated that the panic on the foreign exchanges had died down -- "it was even necessary to buy the currency so as to prevent a sharp fall in the dollar." Throughout the year the chief financier and the chief banker publicly exchanged caustic remarks or political invective until the former put the question quite bluntly: It's either me or Gerashchenko. The chairman did not leave the Central Bank, noting that he might be prepared to quit if Mr. Fedorov were to propose to the government something more valuable than he himself [Gerashchenko] was proposing. These poignant details of the clash between these two high officials would, in different circumstances, be a suitable subject for a gossip column, but behind their war of words is a fundamental question -- which course of reform will Russia choose? Until virtually the middle of last year the conflict between the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry was open and, so to speak, across the board -- in monetary, credit, budgetary, and currency policy, and on the problems of the ruble zone. January's slide by the ruble on the foreign exchanges was an indicator of the market's attitude to the merest hint of a deviation from the principles of strengthening the ruble. It was amazing to hear Viktor Gerashchenko's interpretation to the effect that the rate slumped because it had formerly been supported artificially. First, this was ruled out by the May agreement between the Central Bank and the government "not to intervene on the foreign exchange market." Second, the Central Bank had repeatedly stated on previous occasions that it merely smooths out fluctuations in the rate. And if throughout the entire past year 4 billion dollars passed through the market, was enough to ensure a smooth fall in the ruble, and has suddenly been termed artificial support, why was it necessary to throw $1 billion into the Moscow International Foreign Currency Exchange in the space of three weeks in January? Yet it is hard to get away from the impression that the Central Bank chairman is beginning the decisive round in the big-time political game called "change of course." Last May he formally abandoned his protracted confrontation first with Gaydar and then Fedorov and, as stated above, accepted the government's conditions. It was as if he were saying "if you want to pursue a tough monetarist policy I wash my hands of it, let's see what comes of it." Today not a thing can be said against Gerashchenko. Even the IMF, where he has long been out of favor, has no complaints about him -- the refinancing rate has been raised to a market level, loans are issued only through the budget, mutual offsetting of debts is not being allowed, circulating capital has not been indexed, and lending ceilings have not been breached. Outwardly it is hard to find fault with the Central Bank. But the Central Bank can point the finger at the monetarists in the government -- the production slump has deepened, investment is falling, inflation is high, and the budget is in a bad way. "The Finance Ministry is bankrupt," Gerashchenko stated on television. He is also talking of a link between 12 December and "market romanticism," and proposing that policy be amended. It is a more than successful situation for him. Fedorov has been removed from the government, and this means that it will be easy to bury the Finance Ministry's ideas. Ideas such as securitizing enterprises' debts. It will finally be possible to restore soft loans and import subsidies. It will not be difficult to force exporters to sell 100 percent of their hard currency -- and not to just anyone, but to the Central Bank, which has an automated control system. Fedorov has gone, and so, probably, has the Finance Ministry's intention to independently sell hard currency in the marketplace through a pool of banks, reducing the dollar rate. Gerashchenko can now play safely. Our reserves may keep the ruble afloat for a bit. "But what then?" a television reporter asked. "We will try to find other means," the Central Bank chairman replied. He is a civilized banker and refrained from using the word "administrative" in this context. But Mr. Gerashchenko is implying a fixed ruble rate, the idea of which was ratified last May by the abolished Supreme Soviet. I think it will be no great problem to get Viktor Chernomyrdin to do the same thing now. Gerashchenko's exceptional skill is his ability, acting on the "quiet," to move things to a point where the only decision can be a strong-arm one -- in other words, a political decision. This was the case after the bank note exchange in July, when there was a high-level flurry over the fact that Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were joining the ruble zone. Then everything collapsed at the last minute -- the Finance Ministry managed to show that a ruble union would be premature. But in December-January the Central Bank, sensing the support of Viktor Chernomyrdin, acted even more vigorously, expediting the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. Boris Fedorov calls the agreement on the procedure for this unification signed by Viktor Gerashchenko and Stanislav Bogdankevich, chairman of the National Bank of Belarus, "provocation on a large scale." The Central Bank chairman's influence over the head of the government is now obvious to all. Gerashchenko is a special kind of polyglot. He talks to the premier in his own language, he is subtle and witty with journalists, and speaks English and is very official with IMF experts. But Gerashchenko's main political talent, his strength, and the source of his unsinkability is his unerring ability to second-guess the secret wishes of the country's top leaders. Sensing Boris Yeltsin's "Belovezhskaya complex," he worked on the ruble zone agreements, cutting through Rutskoy's pathological hatred for Gaydar, and presented a balance of payments for Russia with a corresponding assessment of the level of capital flight abroad. Gerashchenko, latching onto the premier's unquenchable love for centralized administration, responded with proposals to organize interstate transactions among the CIS countries under the auspices of the Central Bank of Russia. Gerashchenko is indeed convinced that infusions of money and the restoration of old economic ties will revive production and ease the transition to the market by using methods of state regulation. An "easy transition" and "state regulation" are exceptionally important to him on a personal level too. Gerashchenko already has his eye on the post of chairman of the CIS countries' interstate bank. If Russia's monetary system is united with Belarus and Tajikistan to begin with, and if the "offense" felt by Messrs. Nazarbayev and Karimov is assuaged, then he -- Viktor Vladimirovich Gerashchenko -- would once again be head of virtually the USSR State Bank. And if that post is ratified by the parliaments of five or seven countries, then no Russian reformers would be able to budge this chief. It would be like the lifetime appointment of a U.S. Supreme Court justice.
