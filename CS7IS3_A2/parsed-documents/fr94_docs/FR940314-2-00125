FR940314-2-00125 FR940314-2-00066 The NASD estimates that it will collect the $200 surcharge on 75 percent of the approximately 5700 arbitration cases expected to be filed in 1994, which will result in over $800,000 of additional revenue for the Arbitration Department in 1994. Thus, the surcharge will effectively offset expenses to be incurred on arbitrator education through 1994. The NASD expects the arbitrator education program to reach over 3,000 new arbitrators and almost 500 chairpersons during the period that began in the fourth quarter of 1993 and will end at the end of 1994. This will add over $750,000 to the Arbitration Department expenses, which will include costs for staff and travel time, conference rooms, written materials, videotape production and mailing costs. The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5) 3 of the Act, which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members in that the proposed rule equitably assesses a surcharge on each member that is named or whose associated person is named and for which service is perfected in an arbitration proceeding and applies such revenue to additional costs resulting from increased arbitration resourcing needs. 3 15 U.S.C. 78 o -3. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Written comments were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge. At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
