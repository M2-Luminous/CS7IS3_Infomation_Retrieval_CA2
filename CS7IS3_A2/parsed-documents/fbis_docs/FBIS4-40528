Consequently, legislators rejected the previous version of the bill that applied copyright norms to state-owned radio and TV programs. Democratic Party's Ilga Grava supported the new version claiming that a broadcast schedule is not creative work but "a showing of work content of state institutions." The paid publication of the programs would soar newspaper prices and tax-payers would have to make additional investment into the maintenance of state-owned radio and television, speakers said.
