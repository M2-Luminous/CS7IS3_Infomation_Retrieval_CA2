Its mandate should not be extended again, he said. Addressing a PP assembly group meeting, Erbakan alleged that it has been documented that Poised Hammer extends food and medical aid to the separatist terrorist organization PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Erbakan also said that it is wrong to extend the state of emergency, which has been in effect for so long, by another four months. [Begin Erbakan recording] We want every kind of freedom to reign in every part of our country. We hold our country's unity and integrity above all else. While upholding our country's unity and integrity, however, we want the rules to be the same throughout the country. [end recording] Erbakan charged that constitutional amendments are the business of the parliament not of the government. He welcomed the decision to set up an interparty committee to prepare the constitutional amendments.
