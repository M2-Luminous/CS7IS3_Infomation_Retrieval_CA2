Results of Kazakhstani President's Visit to Japan"] [Text] Tokyo -- The first $120 million of Japanese Government aid and a "high assessment" of Kazakhstan's efforts in dismantling the nuclear arsenal, establishing market procedures, and democratizing society -- that was the chief result of President Nursultan Nazarbayev's first visit to Japan. "Russia without the territorial issue" -- this is the frequently heard unofficial Japanese view of Kazakhstan, hinting at the country's immense natural resources and industrial potential. The two years that have elapsed since the establishment of Japanese-Kazakhstani diplomatic relations have been marked by a rapid blossoming of mutual contacts. Alma-Ata [Almaty] has become a Mecca for Japanese businessmen. The red carpet has been rolled out regularly for Kazkah visitors to Tokyo, where they have been given a very attentive hearing in the highest reaches of the business world. This is all boils down to the fact that between 20 and 30 percent of the world's entire stocks of many valuable types of fuel, chemical raw materials, and nonferrous and rare-earth metals, largely undeveloped, are on Kazakhstan territory. But almost immediately there energed some intractable problems, although bilateral trade has actually increased, reaching the as yet not very impressive figure of $37 million. The first and biggest obstacle is that Kazkahstan has no independent access to the sea and transit communications are difficult. The second problem is the quality of deliveries. It is still well short of world standards. According to one Japanese businessman, who had already failed in that area of business, the future of trade with Kazakhstan remains illusory until these two problems are resolved, and this requires massive capital investment in the infrastructure and in the renovation of enterprises. But President Nazarbayev was optimistic when he reported to journalists on the results of his three days of meetings and conversations in Tokyo. There will be Japanese investment. The Kazakhstani leader was able to secure in a very short time credits worth $220 million from the Japanese export-import bank -- they will finance numerous private joint projects on the territory of Kazakhstan. The biggest of them is the construction of the West Kazakhstan oil refinery, costing $1 billion. A consortium involving the Mistubishi, Mitsui, and Toya corporations won the construction contract. Agreement was also reached on the free financing of geological surveys of gas deposits in the Aral Sea area by the Japanese national oil corporation. In the future, the president announced, we are talking about laying a gas pipeline to the shores of Japan. Finally, there was a promise of comprehensive financial assistance to develop railroad transport, including the laying of a "Friendship" track passing through China and terminating at the East China Sea. As far as one could judge from the president's words and from pronouncements by high-ranking hosts, another contributory factor in Japan's very favorable attitude toward business cooperation is Kazakhstan's specific steps to shed the burden of nuclear weapons. Japan intends to allocate an immediate $110 million for the dismantling of the nuclear arsenals that have built up over the past 40 years, following hard on the heels of the United States. We have never made a secret of the fact that we came here to resolve the main questions, economic questions, Nazarbayev said at the final news conference, and we are very satisfied with the accords that have been reached, since they "pave the way ahead" and impart "powerful new impetus to our relations in all spheres." Should Japan switch to helping the former republics of the USSR in view of Russia's recent great-power behavior toward its former dominions? -- a question from the floor. "Russia must be helped, not for what individual politicians say, but in order to support the process of reforms and democratization. This is necessary not only for Russia but for us too, and for you, who are Russia's neighbors."
