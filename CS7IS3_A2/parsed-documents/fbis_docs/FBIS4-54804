[Karabashev] I think that such a move is normal. Since the prime minister stated in front of the National Assembly and the people that he was dissatisfied with my work as minister of trade and deputy prime minister, he should have replaced me already on 27 April. It was abnormal not to do it. Since I adhere to normal things, I resigned. I intended to do it already last week because of differences with the prime minister, including on the issue of reshuffling the cabinet. However, I decided to wait a bit longer, because I hoped to reach a compromise. [24 CHASA] What was it that you did not like in the proposed reshuffling? [Karabashev] Initially, I was offered the posts of deputy prime minister or a minister without portfolio, without precisely determined functions. From the conversation with Professor Berov I did not understand what precisely I would be responsible for. Mainly from other people I also understood that he himself did not know this. Apparently, it was not the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] that changed its attitude toward me, but rather that he simply did not have an alternative candidate for my post. [passage omitted] [24 CHASA] Was not the fact that Mr. Matinchev was appointed acting prime minister the reason for the cooling of your relations with the prime minister? [Karabashev] This act indicated a certain lack of confidence in me, and in the final analysis this was confirmed by the proposals for reshuffling the cabinet. [24 CHASA] All right, what are the differences between you and the prime minister? [Karabashev] We differ on the Law on Privatization and the privatization process itself. There also were serious differences during the preparation and the adoption of the regulations on the state participation in the privatization and the related functions of the Privatization Agency. If you recall, there were great differences during the preparation of the documents related to establishing the Interdepartmental Council on the Military- Industrial Complex. The supradepartmental organ that was proposed then contradicted the constitution. In the final analysis, the proposal was rejected after I and Minister Bikov objected. You could also recall the disputes regarding the adoption of the so-called privatization list for 1994, which although it had no legal value, inflicted a severe blow on the privatization process. Contrary to Prof. Berov, who said in the parliament that I am the reason for the fact that there is no privatization, I maintain that he is the cause. This is related to his desire to replace the market privatization by a mass privatization already during the first days of his tenure. [passage omitted] [24 CHASA] With your resignation from the parliament [as published] the Alternative Social Liberal Party [ASP] ceases to be a ruling party. [Karabashev] It was not a ruling party anyway, because my influence in the cabinet was rather weak. [24 CHASA] Do you know what President Zhelev thinks about your resignation? [Karabashev] I talked to President Zhelev prior to my resignation.... [24 CHASA] Did he try to dissuade you? [Karabashev] No.
