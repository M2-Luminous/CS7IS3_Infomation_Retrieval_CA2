Following is the full text of the statement: After the 17th round of the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994/95 election in Hong Kong was held, the British side walked away first from the negotiating table and submitted the electoral bill to the Legco despite the earlier statement made by the Chinese side, thus, terminating the talks. Even so, we made it clear repeatedly that for the Chinese side the door for negotiations was open under the prerequisite that the British side must withdraw the submitted partial bill from the Legco. However, the British side has ignored this and clung obstinately on its own course. It has not only had the partial bill passed at the Legco, but also decided unilaterally to make public the contents of the 17 rounds of the Sino-British talks and to submit the rest of the electoral bill to the Legco, thus closing completely the door for resuming the talks. Therefore, the British side should be held fully responsible for ruining the talks. The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law stipulate that the British administration of Hong Kong will terminate on June 30, 1997 and the Chinese Government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of July 1, 1997. In accordance with these provisions, the Chinese side reiterates that as component parts of the British political body administrating Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district boards, the two municipal polls and the Legislative Council will definitely be terminated together with the end of the British administration of Hong Kong. Before the Chinese and British sides reach an agreement on the arrangements for the 1994/95 elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the partial electoral bill passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or any other electoral bill possibly to be passed by the Legco cannot stand over the year of 1997. By that time, the political body of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be formed according to the decisions of the Chinese National People's Congress and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law.
