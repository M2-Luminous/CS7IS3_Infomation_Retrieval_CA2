UNRWA will use this money to buy land in 'Akkar and northern al-Biqa' and build modern camps for Palestinian refugees to replace the camps destroyed during the Lebanese civil war and other camps which will be dismantled in the southern areas close to the Lebanese-Israeli border. According to reliable sources within UNRWA, the U.S. plan, whose implementation has actually begun in Lebanon, aims to settle the Palestinians living in Lebanon since 1948 and for which there is no hope of returning to their original homes. Diplomatic reports circulating in Paris last week indicated that Israel is trying to persuade Jordan to settle the Palestinian refugees in the Jordan Valley. This Israeli policy is incorporated in a booklet prepared by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres containing his concept of the future of joint cooperation between Jordan and Israel. This booklet was scheduled to be distributed to the multilateral talks on water that were held in the Sultanate of Oman recently.
