FR940919-0-00056 FR940919-0-00016 Several commenters also asserted that only combustion technologies can achieve the levels specified as treatment standards for organics. However, no treatability data were provided to support their general assertions. On the other hand, limited data were provided on specific alternative treatment technologies that can also achieve the treatment standards in today's rule. Therefore, the Agency is not convinced that the treatment standards for organics in today's rule require modification to be achievable by technologies other than combustion, and such other technologies may be used to meet these standards. D. Relationship of LDR Treatment Standards to Risk-based Treatment Standards The principal objection to the proposed UTS was that the values do not reflect risk, that is, the standards are based on performance of a treatment technology rather than on assessment of risks to human health and the environment posed by the waste. The debate over technology- versus risk-based treatment standards has continued throughout the development of the land disposal restrictions. EPA's ultimate policy preference is to establish risk-based levels that truly minimize threats to both human health and the environment. 55 FR at 6641 (Feb. 26, 1990). Such standards would cap the extent of hazardous waste treatment. RCRA section 3004(m)(1). The difficulties involved in this task, however, are formidable and very controversial. The technical issues include assessing exposure pathways other than migration to groundwater, taking environmental risk into account, and developing adequate toxicological information for the hazardous constituents controlled by the hazardous waste program. The Agency is currently working on a rulemaking that will define hazardous constituent concentration levels below which a waste is no longer designated under RCRA subtitle C as ``hazardous.'' Discussions concerning these levels are taking place in the Federal Advisory Committee on the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR). The HWIR Committee is discussing issues and providing recommendations for two rulemakings: as-generated waste and contaminated media. The HWIR Committee is made up of industry, environmentalists, treaters and disposers, and state implementing officials. The HWIR Committee has begun discussions by focusing on concentrations below which waste mixtures and treatment residuals would no longer be subject to the hazardous waste regulations (``exit criteria''), while also discussing whether there is a regulatory approach to bring under regulation clearly hazardous waste not now controlled by the hazardous waste regulations (an ``entry'' rule). In addition, EPA is working with the Committee to consider whether risk-based exit criteria or other risk-based values based on the same exposure modeling could also serve as minimize threat levels to potentially cap treatment standards for the land disposal restrictions. In Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. EPA, 886 F. 2d 355 (D.C. Cir. 1989), cert. denied 111 S. Ct 139 (1990), the court held that the statute can be read to allow either technology-based or risk-based standards, and further held that technology-based standards are permissible so long as they are not established ``beyond the point at which there is no `threat' to human health or the environment.'' Id. at 362. The court further held that the particular technology-based standards at issue were not established below this ``minimize threat'' level, notwithstanding that (in some cases) the standards were below Maximum Contaminant Levels used for drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and were below the RCRA characteristic level. Id. at 361&hyph;62. In the court's view, the RCRA section 3004(m) minimize threat standard was more stringent than that used to establish either drinking water standards or characteristic levels. EPA finds, for purposes of this rule, that none of the treatment standards are established below levels at which threats to human health and the environment are minimized. This finding stems from the Agency's inability at the present time, as explained above, to establish concentration levels for hazardous constituents which represent levels at which threats to human health and the environment are minimized. Unless the Agency determines risk-based concentration levels that achieve the ``minimized threat'' requirement for a particular wastestream, the Agency believes that BDAT treatment (as reflected by the UTS levels) fulfills the statutory charge. E. Treatment Standards for Hazardous Soil As stated in the September 14, 1993 proposal (58 FR 48124), EPA recognizes that the treatment standards promulgated for as-generated hazardous waste may not always be achievable or appropriate for soil contaminated with that waste. EPA therefore proposed less stringent alternative treatment standards that would specifically apply to hazardous soils. In addition, EPA proposed to codify the ``contained-in'' policy for contaminated media (see 58 FR 48127). Subsequent to the proposal, the Agency received a number of comments from the varied constituencies (industry, environmental, waste treatment and state) involved in the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) effort for addressing contaminated media, urging the Agency to await the results of that effort before developing soil-specific treatment standards. Thus, EPA has decided not to promulgate alternative treatment standards for hazardous soil and the codification of the contained-in policy as part of this rulemaking, but rather will address it as part of the HWIR effort for contaminated media. EPA announced this decision on November 12, 1993 (see 58 FR 59976) and again on March 8, 1994 (see 59 FR 10778). The Hazardous Waste Identification Rule for Contaminated Media, which is being developed by EPA in concert with the States and with affected stakeholders, is intended to create a comprehensive regulatory framework within RCRA Subtitle C that will apply to the management of contaminated media that are managed as part of remediation activities. Through the public dialogue process, a conceptual framework has been developed for HWIR for media. As currently envisioned, the HWIR media rule will establish mandatory treatment requirements for soils (and possibly other media) that are highly contaminated, while less contaminated soils would be subject to management requirements of the overseeing regulatory agency. The HWIR media rule is expected to encourage national consistency in the management of higher risk media, while providing management flexibility for a significant volume of lower risk contaminated media, thereby facilitating more timely and less costly cleanups.
