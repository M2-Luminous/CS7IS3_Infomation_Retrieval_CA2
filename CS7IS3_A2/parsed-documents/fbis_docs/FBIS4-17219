Zhirinovskiy's Falcon Did Not Singe His Wings In the Rays of Two Suns"] [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], the Social Democratic Party, and the Workers' Party of the DPRK will now jointly resist "U.S. expansion." This was said at a press conference by LDPR deputy chief Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, who has just returned from the DPRK. Mr. Vengerovskiy made his contribution on behalf of the LDPR to the all-people's rejoicing on the occasion of the 82d birthday of Great Leader Kim Il-song, who was handed a samovar with Palekh painting as a birthday present. Even the universal joy, however, did not help Mr. Vengerovskiy prod his North Korean friends into conceding whether they have a nuclear bomb or not. When asked bluntly, "Do you have it?," the top brass, making round eyes, said: "We do not know." They acknowledged, however, that work on delivery vehicles (missiles) is under way. Nor did he manage to find out the reason for the absence of the Beloved Leader and Great Commander -- Kim Chong-il -- from the festivities. In response to all his questions he was told that "two suns cannot shine together" or, more prosaically, "he is busy."
