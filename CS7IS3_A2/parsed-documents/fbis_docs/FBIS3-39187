"Our F-16's are equipped for bombings, but they are not provided with smart weapons, i.e. computer-controlled homing missiles, which demonstrated their usefulness during the Gulf war," he explained. "Even if other allies would provide our Air Force with this sort of high-tech weapons, it would still be impossible, because our pilots are not familiar with these weapons." In recent years, the Belgian Air Force mainly specialized in reconnaissance and defense missions.
