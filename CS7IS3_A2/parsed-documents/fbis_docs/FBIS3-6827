Facing a series of political setbacks at home such as failures to introduce a new tax and to carry out a cabinet reshuffle, as well as being linked to a money scandal, Hosokawa would have liked to score big on the diplomatic front to revamp his plunging public image. Since his three-day China trip came at a highly sensitive time on the international front regarding North Korea's suspected development of nuclear arms and U.S.-China relations over human rights, Hosokawa did speak out on these matters, going a step further than he had before. He criticized North Korea in unusually harsh terms for refusing to let inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conduct full checks on its nuclear facilities and stressed the urgency of the situation. He also broached the delicate issue of China's human rights. Hosokawa told reporters aboard a government plane back to Tokyo on Monday [21 March] at the end of his three-day trip that he was able to engage in "substantial and meaningful" discussions with Chinese Premier Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin. But he apparently fell short of gaining anything new from the Chinese leadership. In addition, Hosokawa's bluntness rather exposed differences of positions between Japan and China. When Hosokawa said the international community's patience in coping with the problems of North Korea is "nearing its limit" and cited the possibility of the matter being brought up at the United Nations Security Council, the Chinese leaders only reiterated their previous position that the matter should be resolved through "patient negotiations." China's Foreign Ministry said China disapproves of the matter being taken up by the Security Council and that the issue should be settled through dialogue by "parties concerned," namely, China, North and South Korea, the United States and the IAEA. Japan was not included in the list of "parties concerned." Hosokawa, pressed by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, also urged China to improve its human rights record. But he did so in a low-key way by pointing out that human rights are a "universal value" recognized by the international community and by referring to a declaration adopted at an international conference on human rights last June in Vienna. He refused to comment on specific cases involving the detention of pro-democracy activists. Hosokawa, who has been trying to stress that his administration represents a change from those of his predecessors, also failed to go beyond earlier expressions of regret for Japan's wartime responsibilities, despite indications by government sources that he might cite specific cases -- such as the Nanjing massacre and germ warfare experiments -- when offering an apology. In talks with the Chinese leaders, Hosokawa merely repeated the line in a policy speech last August in which he expressed "deep remorse and apologies for the fact that past Japanese actions, including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people." The only time he said anything new was when he visited Shanghai's Pudong economic development zone. When Shanghai officials called for Japanese companies to set up operations in the area, Hosokawa, using his experience as governor of the southern Japan prefecture of Kumamoto, gave them detailed advice on how to attract Japanese firms, such as making promotional videos. His comments were welcomed by Shanghai officials with vigorous nods.
