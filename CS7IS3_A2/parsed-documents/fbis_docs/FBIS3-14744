According to sources close to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the visit was put off due to the legal proceedings against an officer of the Ukrainian Security Service (the so-called case of Lysenko) continuing in Warsaw from January 19. Anatoliy Lysenko and his family left for Poland in August, 1993, on a private invitation and was arrested immediately after he crossed the border. Lysenko has been accused of spying for Ukraine. The Ukrainian Security Service refutes the accusations.
