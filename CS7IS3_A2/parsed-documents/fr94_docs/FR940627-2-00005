EFFECTIVE DATE: June 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Erik Warga or Ellen Grebasch at (202) 482&hyph;0922 or (202) 482&hyph;3773, respectively, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20230 Initiation of Investigations The Petition On May 31, 1994, we received a petition in proper form filed by QO Chemicals, Inc. (petitioner), the sole U.S. producer of furfuryl alcohol. Petitioner filed supplements to the petition on June 6, 15, 16, and 17, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioner alleges that imports of furfuryl alcohol from the People's Republic of China (PRC), Thailand, and the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that such imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Petitioner states that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and it is the sole domestic producer of furfuryl alcohol. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Scope of Investigations The product covered by these investigations is furfuryl alcohol (C 4 H 3 OCH 2 OH). Furfuryl alcohol is a primary alcohol, and is colorless or pale yellow in appearance. It is used in the manufacturer of resins and as a wetting agent and solvent for coating resins, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, and other soluble dyes. The product subject to these investigations is classifiable under subheading 2932.13.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of these investigations is dispositive. United States Price and Foreign Market Value People's Republic of China Petitioner based United States Price (USP) on FOB PRC port, C&F U.S. port, and CIF U.S. port, price quotes from PRC producers through their representative U.S. trading companies. Adjustments were made for foreign inland freight, ocean freight, and marine insurance. Petitioner based inland freight on the distance from the PRC producers of the subject merchandise to the PRC port of export. Freight transportation charges were valued using Indian surrogate data. ( See description of non-market economy (NME) below methodology). Ocean freight and marine insurance charges were estimated by comparing per-unit U.S. IM&hyph;145 customs value import statistics to per-unit U.S. IM&hyph;145 customs value import statistics to per-unit U.S. IM&hyph;145 CIF import statistics. Petitioner asserts that the PRC is a NME within the meaning of sections 771(18)(A) and (C) of the Act and in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act. Accordingly, foreign market value (FMV) should be based on the producer's factors of production, valued in a surrogate market economy country. The Department has determined in previous investigations that the PRC is a NME, and the presumption of NME status continues for the initiation of this investigation. See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sebasic Acid from the People's Republic of China , (59 FR 28053, May 31, 1994). Absent evidence that a particular NME country government determines which of its factories shall produce for export to the United States, we intend, for purposes of the investigation from the PRC, to base FMV only on those factories that produced furfuryl alcohol sold to the United States during the period of investigation (POI).
