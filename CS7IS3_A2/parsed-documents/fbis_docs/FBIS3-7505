In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job offers to job seekers, an indicator of labor demand, fell from January's 0.67 to 0.65 in February, showing there were 65 jobs for every 100 people seeking employment. The February jobless rate represents a rise of 0.6 point from a year earlier and the highest since June 1987 when it stood at 3.0 percent, the agency said. The unemployment rate among women hit a record high at 3.2 percent, topping the previous high of 3.1 percent marked in may 1987. The latest figure compares with a 2.7 percent jobless rate among men. Officials of the agency and the ministry said the nation's employment data is likely to worsen further in the months ahead although some bright signs can be observed in the economy as a whole. The number of jobholders in February rose 0.3 percent or 160,000 from a year earlier to 63.02 million, down from a climb of 0.5 percent or 300,000 in the previous month. The number of unemployed workers jumped 23.6 percent or 370,000 to 1.94 million. In the manufacturing sector, jobholders declined 3.2 percent or 480,000, continuing the streak of declines since November 1992. Manufacturers are shifting their production overseas to stay competitive amid the appreciation of the yen on the foreign exchange. Jobholders in the construction industry grew 2.5 percent or 160,000. Improvement was seen in the wholesale, retail and food sectors, with jobholders there growing 0.8 percent or 120,000. The climb in employees in the service sector, however, was trimmed, at 1.6 percent or 240,000.
