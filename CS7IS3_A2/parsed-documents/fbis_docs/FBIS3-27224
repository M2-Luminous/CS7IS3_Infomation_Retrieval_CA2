We will cherish his memory forever. I joined the Army in my early youth. I served under the command of Comrades Chen Yi and Su Yu, fighting in different parts of east China, and I directly perceived Comrade Su Yu's rare gifts and bold strategy in the art of war. Later on, I respectfully listened to his teachings. After he passed away, his wife, Elder Sister Chu Qing, presented me with the book Su Yu's Collections of the War Years. Through the study of Mao Zedong's military thinking, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new period, of this military masterpiece -- which was the fruit of Comrade Su Yu's life-long labor -- and other articles recalling Comrade Su Yu, I have gained a further understanding of the brilliant art of military command as shown by this proletarian revolutionary and military strategist who made great contributions in the Chinese revolutionary war. Throughout his military life, Comrade Su Yu "had a loyal heart for his country while his hairs turned white in the war years," creatively studied and applied Mao Zedong's military thinking, and added rich and vivid content to Mao Zedong's military thinking with his own practice. He was an outstanding military scientist and strategist who had both military theory and operational command practice. While fighting in battlefields, he cleverly devised strategies and thus led brilliant military successes. A devoted military officer with a lofty spirit and great force of character, he led troops and high-ranking military officers. He wrote books with unique original ideas and penetrating judgments. He deserves to be called a famous combat general commanding a million bold warriors. The legacy of his superb sense of command and his refinement as a general constitute a precious spiritual heritage. Being strategically minded as a commander of tactical operations was the important characteristic of Comrade Su Yu, who directed military operations with miraculous skill. Comrade Su Yu was a commander of tactical operations, but he would always conscientiously take the overall strategic situation into account as the starting point in reflecting on problems. During the 22 years of his combat career, Comrade Su Yu held important leadership posts in the relatively independent war zones, which were far away from the central authorities. While undertaking a combat task, he would attach great importance to the advantages and disadvantages and losses and gains of its implementation from the height of the overall strategic situation. He approached and pondered problems from a broad and far-reaching point of view and thus managed to serve, influence, and push the overall situation ahead conscientiously and freely with active and effective partial operations. The famous campaigns, which Comrade Su Yu directly conducted or in which he was engaged, included the central Jiangsu, south Shandong, Laizhou-Wuhu, Menglianggu, Shatuji, east Henan, Jinan, and Huaihai campaigns. He made proposals or tactical assumptions of his own accord for almost all of the campaigns, which were carried out after they had been approved by the Central Military Commission and Comrade Mao Zedong. These numerous major campaigns constituted the basic trend in east and central China in the Liberation War and realized the strategic intentions of the supreme command in a powerful manner. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The most important thing for those who direct the situation as a whole is to devote their attention to the overall war situation." In making military plans, Comrade Su Yu could not only give consideration to the situation in a specific war zone, but also kept his eyes on the overall strategic situation, set store by the overall situation and the strategic interests, and he did not hesitate to make the greatest sacrifices in terms of partial interests. For example, in the summer of 1947, to coordinate with the strategic move taken by the Li Bocheng-Deng Xiaoping Army to thrust into the Dabie Shan by leaping from 1,000 li away from the Dabie Shan -- while deciding without the slightest hesitation to leave some troops behind and encouraging them to support the extremely grim situation in Shandong and to do what they could to break through the enemy's selective attacks -- Comrades Chen Yi and Su Yu led the regular formations of the East China Field Army in rushing westward and launched attacks on exterior lines, thus creating the situation in which the Liu Bocheng-Deng Xiaoping Army, the Chen Geng-Xie Fuzhi Army, and the Chen Yi-Su Yu Army were bidding for state power. As the commander of a strategic area, Comrade Su Yu was admired for his boldness and adeptness in independently considering the issues which had a bearing on the overall war situation and promptly putting forth strategic proposals to the Military Commission. For example, in the early days of the Liberation War, his suggestion of first fighting on interior lines by relying on the liberated areas played an important role in changing the Central Military Commission's strategic principle of "launching attacks on exterior lines while going southward to conduct operations" into the principle of "first winning several battles on interior lines before turning to exterior lines." In the spring of 1948, his suggestion that the army under Su's command stay for the time being in central China to fight large-scale battles of annihilation rather than cross the river and swiftly open up the war situation in central China after achieving combat successes played a very good role in urging the Central Military Commission to determine to fight a strategic, decisive battle with the enemy. In the autumn of 1948, he suggested launching the Huaihai Campaign and further suggested cutting the Xuzhou-Bengpu line and annihilating the enemy's main forces in the places north to the Chang Jiang, thus greatly accelerating the victorious process of the national liberation war. It is very important for a military commander, a high-ranking commander in particular, to have a strong strategic awareness, be good at clearly discerning the changing situation, and grasp the developing overall situation. With profound understanding, Comrade Su Yu said: "As a military commander, one must understand the strategic issue of the Chinese Liberation War. Only when he has a profound understanding of the issue and can keep a clear head can he devise strategies and direct operations with facility." Drawing strategic plans and making analyses systematically are the main secrets of Comrade Su Yu's calm generalship. In organizing every campaign, Comrade Su Yu would always systematically draw up a plan after careful consideration to ensure that the plan was well-designed for carrying out schemes to give the enemy a false impression to lead them to make errors, for creating determination to launch operations, for starting a campaign to withdraw from battlefields to plan the next campaign, and for improving operational command to logistic support and to ideological education. In terms of mode of thinking, Comrade Su Yu's operational planning was identical with the basic viewpoints of modern operational systems engineering. The east Henan campaign was the masterpiece of Comrade Su Yu's systematic planning in operational command, and is of immortal military and academic value. In planning the campaign, Comrade Su Yu considered the war situation in central China as a big system. After giving consideration to the situations of both the enemy and his own army in central China, to the East China Field Army, and the Central China Field Army, and to the war zone's favorable climatic condition (being at the stage of a strategic turning point), favorable geographical condition (vast areas and smooth terrain are favorable for our regular army formations' mobile operations), and favorable human condition (with Shandong and the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area behind, the new liberated area in central China had begun to take shape) and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of conducting operations in central China and by crossing the Chang Jiang, Comrade Su Yu reached the conclusion that it was more advantageous to concentrate forces to conduct operations in central China than to cross the Chang Jiang and swiftly open the situation in central China, that it was imperative to fight large-scale battles of annihilation, and the condition for fighting such battles in central China was basically ripe. This was the basic operational assumption for concentrating forces to fight sizable battles in central China. On this basis, Comrade Su Yu further made an quantitative and qualitative analysis and by following the central demands, clearly defined that the basic goal of operations for the near future was to annihilate 5 or 6 to 11 or 12 enemy brigades in the Huang He-Huai He area. From the viewpoint of systematics, Comrade Su Yu's planning and direction of operations fully embodied the principle of "appropriate selection of the superior." In military struggle, the weighing of "discard" and "take" and decisionmaking are full of dialectics. Everyone who has some knowledge of the theory of systematics knows that the operations system is a dynamic system under which two living forces sharply confront each other and undergo drastic changes, and commanders of the opposing sides will make strenuous efforts to annihilate their enemy and achieve the "maximum value" of systems planning. However, although the "maximum value" exists in theory, it is difficult to achieve in reality. As such, military commanders are required to be good at judging the hour and sizing up the situation, weighing the advantages and disadvantages, and having the courage to "discard" while being good at "taking," and direct operations in a lively way. Comrade Su Yu attained perfection in this regard. At the beginning of the east Henan campaign, a method of "catching big fish" was adopted to annihilate the enemy's reorganized 5th Army and at the same time, Comrade Su Yu had worked out a plan to storm Kaifeng and then annihilate the enemy relief force. The enemy's reinforced 5th Army was Chiang Kai-shek's "elite" unit and the main force of the Qiu Qingquan Army in the battlefields of central China. Annihilating it would open the war situation in central China. Naturally, that was a "maximum value." When the Third and Eighth Columns under the command of the East China Field Army were moving from the Xichang area to Huaiyang, the Qiu Army, which was stationed in the southwestern region of Shandong, was lured by our forces and rushed southward. By seizing the opportunity, the main forces of the East China Field Army crossed the Huang He from the Puyang area. At that time, shocked by the move, the enemy supreme command swiftly ordered the main forces of the Qiu Army and the reorganized 75th Division to return to the north at top speed so as to block our troops from crossing the river. At the same time, they reinforced the area by dispatching three more reorganized divisions and a brigade. For a while, big armies converged there, and moreover, it was not easy to break up the reorganized 5th Army, the main force of the Qiu Army, as it was neatly deployed. As the enemy advanced, we retreated, and the conditions to annihilate the 5th Army had not matured, but the opportunity of first attacking Kaifeng and then annihilating the enemy reinforcements had emerged. By this time, our Third and Eighth Columns had entered Tongxu, Weixian, and Jixian, a one-day journey to Kaifeng, the capital of Henan under the Kuomintang government. Although the city was guarded by more than 30,000 enemy troops, their combat capability was poor as they were not under unified command; moreover, they were in a state of isolation and the regular army formations that could be moved to reinforce them were deployed 100 kilometers away from the capital. On the contrary, the regular formations of the East China Field Army and a unit under the command of the Central China Field Army were deployed relatively closely. In terms of timing and position, capturing the city was like taking something from one's pocket and attacking the enemy reinforcements was like casting a net to catch fish. Comrade Su Yu determinedly discarded the pursuit of the expected "maximum value" and made a prompt decision to strive for the relatively realistic "satisfaction value" of attacking Kaifeng and annihilating the enemy reinforcements. In the course of operations, he was considering creating conditions for the coming operations. To ensure the victory of the current campaign, once again Comrade Su Yu discarded the pursuit of the "maximum value" of completely annihilating the surviving forces of the enemy's besieged reorganized 72th Division and concentrated forces to attack the Huang Botao Army, which frenziedly advanced toward our positions in an attempt to overwhelm our forces. With overriding momentum, he attacked the enemy forces in their early move, thus overawing the other enemy reinforcements and gaining the "satisfaction value" of victorious troop shifts. By continuously devising brilliant moves and blazing new trails, Comrade Su Yu was able to win every battle he fought. Marshal Chen Yi said: "In directing battles, General Su Yu has consistently maintained his record of being invincible. The more moves he devises, the more brilliant they will become, and the more battles he fights, the more brilliantly he does." As I understand it, this remark was not only praise for Comrade Su Yu, but also an indication of one characteristic of his art of war, namely, continuously bringing forth new ideas which are "boundless like heaven and earth and inexhaustible like the rivers" rather than confining oneself to set rules. It was precisely his ability to "devise a brilliant move in every battle he fights" that enabled him to "fight the battle more and more brilliantly." In his article "Develop Ourselves in the Enemy's Rear Areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the Tianmu Shan Campaign," there were remarks full of military philosophy. He wrote: "In fighting battles, dialectics is necessary, because both sides are living persons in action and like ourselves, the enemy can use their brains and can walk. While fighting, they can change their tactics. We have to follow suit. Even if they do not change their tactics, we must change our tactics in light of the changes in the battlefields." Comrade Su Yu was well versed in military dialectics. Like everything, war undergoes constant change as time, place, and conditions change. No two operations are completely the same. Military tactics are bound to differ in thousands of ways. War is a field full of vitality. Only a military strategist who has a trailblazing spirit and keeps forging ahead can establish himself in an unassailable position. In operations, Comrade Su Yu boldly blazed new trails and adopted appropriate measures as time, geological conditions, and the enemy's situation changed. In the central Jiangsu campaign, he carefully directed one live drama full of power and grandeur after another. In the first battle he launched in Xuanjiabao and Taixing, he directed troops in an unusual way: Annihilating the enemy troops before they managed to take action by adopting a counteroffensive method. In the battle of Runan, he ignored the closer enemy positions and led his troops 100 li away and then stormed the enemy from their flanks and rear. In the Haian battle, he blunted the edge of the enemy's advance while beating them back. In the Libao battle, he commanded his troops to launch a surprise attack on the enemy while they had their heads turned by "victory celebrations." In the Dingyan-Linzi battle, selecting the enemy's weak points, he directed his troops in launching a frontal attack on the enemy, and later on, in attacking Huang (Qiao) to rescue Shao (Bo), he commanded his troops to go deep into the enemy's hinterland to carry out operations there. Thus he successfully applied the Chinese ancient military tactic of "besieging the State of Wei to rescue the State of Zhao" in a tactical operation. It helped energetically support Shao Bo's operations and annihilate 17,000 enemy troops in the operation. The enemy were so badly beaten that they were reduced to a state of utter stupefaction and were completely at a loss. Comrade Su Yu commanded a 30,000-strong army to confront an enemy army 120,000 strong. His troops fought the enemy for 18 months in the strategic forward areas close to the enemy's heartland, won the seven battles they fought, and annihilated more than 50,000 enemy troops. This was rarely seen in the history of war. In the Menglianggu battle, when the strong enemy forces converged to launch selective attacks on our forces, in accordance with Chen Yi's instructions and by making full use of the favorable condition that our troops fought in the hinterland of the liberated areas, Comrade Su Yu adopted the method of "playing a dragon lantern" -- sometimes fighting in the south and sometimes in the north, sometimes in the east and sometimes in the west, and sometimes advancing and sometimes retreating, and fighting while retreating -- and created opportunities to fight. By seizing the opportunity of the enemy elite force, the reorganized 74th Division, made a central breakthrough and, using the tactic of "a fierce tiger ripping out the heart of its prey," he assigned five columns the task of surrounding and annihilating the enemy and four columns the task of blocking the enemy relief force and ordered his troops to thrust into the middle of the enemy battle formation to cut the 14th Division's ties with its friendly neighboring units, thus wiping out the whole division in one fell swoop and creating the miracle of "chopping off the head of a general in an army one million strong." This was also an example of Comrade Su Yu's "marvelous" art of war. There are rules, but not hard and fast rules, to follow in directing operations. In directing operations, Comrade Su Yu would always seek rules outside the established ones, and seek original changes. In the Laizhou-Wuhu campaign, by adopting the tactic of feinting to the east and attacking in the west, while putting a military presence in south Shandong, he launched a decisive battle in central Shandong. In the Wusong-Shanghai campaign, while attacking Wusong, he adopted the tactic of making a feint to the east and attacking the east and directed this offensive at the enemy's main and strong positions so as to lure more enemy troops to bite the hook. In the Huaihai Campaign, he adopted the tactic of "leaving the unconditioned as it stands and making the best of everything" and gave the enemy in Xuzhou a way out. In the Jinan campaign, he adopted the tactic of "leaving the conditioned as it stands and making the best of everything" and by ordering a 180,000-strong army to prepare to attack the enemy relief force, he clearly stated to the enemy that so long as you had the courage to come, we were in a position to annihilate you. In terms of ambush, sometimes he ambushed the rescuing, retreating or "passing-by" enemy troops and sometimes he "lured the enemy by promise of gain" or "threatened them by force." In terms of encirclement and annihilation, he sometimes "encircled a division and destroyed one-tenth of its force [wei shi que yi 0953 1597 7067 0001]," sometimes he "encircled the enemy without destroying it," sometimes he laid a long-term encirclement on the enemy, and sometimes he annihilated the enemy the moment he encircled them. In terms of besieging a city to annihilate the enemy relief force, sometimes he made a faked besieging a city but attacked the enemy relief force in reality. He sometimes faked attacking the enemy relief force but actually besieged or captured the city while attacking the enemy relief force. This endless change in his use of stratagems was a vivid embodiment of Comrade Su Yu's outstanding ability to command. Being brave, fearless, capable, industrious, and prudent constituted the solid foundation for Comrade Su Yu to put himself in a superior position against the enemy in the sharp and complicated military struggles. He was well-known for daring to fight big battles, tough battles, and fierce battles. During his 22 years of military life in battlefields, he always used a small force to defeat a large one, used a weak force to fight a strong one, destroyed enemy strongholds and took the edge off the enemy's spirit, and inflicted repeated reverses on a formidable enemy. He had unusual revolutionary courage and resourcefulness. Nevertheless, in reviewing his brilliant battlefield experience full of "shining spears and armored horses and daring" in those years, this battle-tested veteran general with several decades of military life made such remarks as "the burden is heavy" and "I feel nervous," and made no mention of his bravery. When recalling his feelings on the eve of the decisive Huangqiao battle, he said: "The responsibility for the success or failure of the battle rests completely with us. In a situation in which we are outnumbered by the enemy, the burden we are shouldering is very heavy." When recalling the central Jiangsu campaign, he stated: "In helping Comrade Chen Yi direct the Subei campaign, I deeply feel that I have a grave responsibility and I feel nervous." In speaking of the Shatuji campaign, he remarked: "Now I feel I have a grave responsibility." In talking about his feelings when he was ordered to plan operations for east Henan, he said: "I deeply feel the burden I am shouldering is heavy and I feel I issued a 'military order' to the central authorities this time" and it was not until Kaifeng was captured that he said "I feel secure." These thought-provoking records genuinely and vividly reflected Comrade Su Yu's fine character of being brave and fearless, capable, industrious, and prudent. The confrontation of two armies is not only a contest in military strength, firepower, and morale, but also a contest in the astuteness and resourcefulness and the art of command and of both sides' commanders. Under given conditions, more often than not, victory hangs on a momentary slip of the commanders. Therefore, their burdens cannot be said to be light and they cannot be said not to feel nervous. The feelings that "I am shouldering a heavy burden" and "I feel nervous" precisely reflected Comrade Su Yu's high level of responsibility to the party's cause and extreme prudence in directing military operations. In studying the many campaigns Comrade Su Yu directed, we all felt they were soul- stirring. A careful study shows that he did not have the slightest idea of winning by fluke. His profound idea of creating a spirited atmosphere using strategy and the superb art of command are admirable. Comrade Su Yu led troops in crossing the natural chasm -- the Chang Jiang -- at full speed three times. Whether he led several hundred troops in sneaking across the river or commanded a 100,000-strong army in forging the river, he always "made serious preparations and worked out well-conceived plans" and directed the operations by "centering his complete concentration on" them. Hence, no errors were made. In the second phase of the Huaihai Campaign, he did not sleep for seven days and nights and later on, he contracted Meniere's syndrome and still he directed military operations in spite of illness. It was said that Marshal Chen Yi praised Comrade Su Yu as a "Master Zhuge who eats less but attends to numerous things." This was a vivid embodiment of Comrade Su Yu's fine style of working diligently and rigorously, sparing no pains. Comrade Mao Zedong urged commanders to become brave and wise generals. Comrade Su Yu may be rated as a good example in this regard. Persisting in seeking truth from facts, proceeding in all cases from actual conditions, and taking the unity of subjective guidance and objective reality as the basic principle and requirement for directing military operations constituted the essence of Comrade Su Yu's art of command. Comrade Su Yu studied war realistically and worked hard to probe the objective laws governing war. He said: "In my youth, I studied how to lead troops and fight with Commissar Mao [Zedong] and Army Commander Zhu [De]. The most profound experience I gained is that war has its own laws. We must seek the method of vanquishing the enemy in accordance with the actual conditions of the enemy and ourselves and the inherent laws governing war. This truth has benefited me all my life." In studying war, with his eyes focused on characteristics and development, Comrade Su Yu was good at grasping the laws governing war at different levels and periods. For example, his theory of a "turning point" in operations direction divides war into three levels: The strategic turning point of the overall war situation, the periodical turning point of the war zone, and the turning point of the process of campaigns. When the Liberation War was imminent, in the light of the changed new situation, Comrade Su Yu "repeatedly pondered so as to seek the laws governing the war, in particular, the laws governing the early period of the war." Until his evening years he was still working hard to probe the laws governing modern war. In directing war, Comrade Su Yu always combined the higher authorities' instructions and actual conditions and creatively implemented the higher authorities' intentions. He persisted in going deep into the realities of life to conduct studies and familiarize himself with the various aspects of the situation of the enemy and ourselves, sought the laws governing military actions, and applied these laws to his own operations, and ensured the unity of subjective guidance and objective realities. "Fight battles wherever it is convenient for us to wipe out the enemy, fight battles whenever it is convenient to wipe out the enemy, and attack the enemy whom it is convenient for us to wipe out." This idea completely stresses basing oneself on actual conditions. Comrade Su Yu was not only good at integrating the universal truth of Mao Zedong's military thinking and the concrete practice of directing operations, but also good at summing up practical experience and condensing and upgrading it into theory. In his remaining years, he devoted himself to summing up his operations experience. While writing his recollections, he insisted in "writing real past events" and worked hard to "accurately reflect how the understanding and mastery of the laws governing war by the commander of a campaign leads to a victory or a loss." He maintained: "If we describe the complex war process as a process which has been well planned by wise commanders and use this idea to educate our coming generations, this will get us into trouble when a war breaks out." This fully demonstrates the firmness and persistence of a proletarian military strategist in upholding the ideological line of seeking truth from facts. The best way to commemorate Comrade Su Yu is to learn his art of command and decorum as a general, realistically study the military struggles under the conditions of contemporary technology, in particular, high technology, more conscientiously study and apply Mao Zedong's military thinking, implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new period, carry out Comrade Jiang Zemin's "five remarks" general requirement for army building, and strive to provide a powerful security guarantee for China's reform and opening up to the outside world and economic construction as well.
