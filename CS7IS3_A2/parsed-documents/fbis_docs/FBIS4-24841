Anson Chan, the Chief Secretary, yesterday told a private meeting of legislators that the Government had no intention of supporting legislation that would establish a human rights commission and introduce an access to information bill. Sources said that the Chief Secretary admitted that China "had a direct bearing on the situation". This is the first time the Government has officially admitted this and contradicts earlier suggestions that pressure from China was not an important factor. Officially, the Government says that it is still considering a number of proposals and that an announcement will be made tomorrow. The Government will announce a package of other anti-discrimination measures. Chan made it clear to legislators that the Government would not support the human rights commission proposal tabled by the legislator Anna Wu and recommended by the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee in recent report. She also said the Government would reject the proposal for an access to information bill put forward by the legislative councillor Christine Loh. Instead, the Government will announce tomorrow that it will incorporate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women into Hong Kong law. This is a UN convention, which China has signed. The Government is believed to be in favour of drafting new laws against discrimination on the grounds of sex, age or disability. In addition it will propose the establishment of an equal opportunities commission. These measures will not go even half way to meeting campaigners' demands for more laws to protect human rights. Liberal minded legislators are likely to be most angered by the Government's admission that it is bowing to pressure from China over the issue. Wu last night accused the Governor, Chris Patten, of reversing his previous policy of standing up to Beijing. She reiterated her view that the Government should first consider the opinions of the Legislative Council, which she is convinced would support her proposals. Earlier in the week the Executive Council gave an initial thumbs down to the idea of a human rights commission. It is believed that the Government's willingness to bend to the wishes of China is prompted by a wish for a thaw in relations, following the row over political reform. It is feared that any moves that go against China's wishes on human rights could jeopardise an agreement with China on the new airport and other key economic issues. Lu Ping, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Aifairs Office, hit out last month at proposals by legislators to protect against human rights abuses. He said that a human rights commission would violate the Basic Law and be dismantled by Beijing after the 1997 handover. Patten has criticised the proposal on other grounds, arguing that a human rights commission would cost the Government $60m and would be bureaucratic and toothless. Officials have used similar arguments in opposition to Loh's access to information bill, which they say would strain the already limited resources of the civil service.
