While creatively carrying forward and developing Comrade Mao Zedong's idea on the united front, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward a whole set of theories, which meets the objective needs of China's modernization drive, accords with the law governing historical development, and bears the distinctive imprint of the times. To breathe new life into united front work, we must earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, especially his theory on united front work for the new period, to facilitate our study of new situations and problems arising from united front work. I. The Nature of the United Front Is More Clearly Defined in the New Period As one of the three magic weapons for China's revolution and development, the united front led by the CPC has gone through several historical periods. The nature of the united front varied with the change in the principal contradiction in society and in the party's central task. In his opening speech at the second session of the fifth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee held in June 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: China's working class has greatly strengthened its position and the worker-peasant alliance will be further consolidated and developed on the new basis of the socialist modernization drive. A great number of intellectuals have become a component part of the working class, and they are consciously working for the socialist cause. The means of production owned by the capitalist class have been turned over to the state for a long time, and most members of the capitalist class who are fit to work have become self-supporting workers. Various fraternal minority nationalities have taken the socialist road in turn and established a new relationship between themselves characterized by fraternal unity and mutual assistance. Patriotic religious believers in various nationalities have made great progress. Compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas Chinese love the motherland and are playing an increasingly important, active role in the reunification of the motherland and in the modernization drive. "China's united front has become a broad union of socialist laborers and patriots supporting socialism led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance." In September of the same year, after listening to a report on the 14th national conference on the united front work, Comrade Deng Xiaoping extended the front by embracing in it all people cherishing a fervent love for the motherland, stressing that the united front "is the union of socialist laborers and patriots" by nature. Later, he pointed out more clearly that the united front in the new period is by nature "the broadest union of all socialist laborers and all patriots supporting socialism and the reunification of the motherland." It is safe to say that this is a most fundamental and important thesis showing that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has creatively carried forward and developed Comrade Mao Zedong's idea on the united front. Since then, the united front in the new period has freed itself from the yoke of the doctrine of "taking class struggle as the key link" and has grown and become more consolidated with each passing day, holding high the two banners of socialism and patriotism. II. The Patriotic United Front Has Become Broader in the New Period After a basic change took place in the class mix in the country, some comrades were doubtful as to whether the range covered by the united front was too broad or too narrow and whether the targets for the united front were too many or too few. In light of the circumstances, Comrade Deng Xiaoping expounded the target and the range of the united front in a scientific way. He said: "Clearly the targets for the united front, as the term suggests, are all the people that can be united. It is a broader range rather than a narrower one that is to our advantage." In June 1981, the "Decision on the Party's Several Historical Problems Since the Founding of the PRC" drafted under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping and adopted by the sixth plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, formally stated: The concept of "patriotic united front" is designed to enable all individuals and organizations to join the front, irrespective of their social systems, political stands, ideologies, and ways of life, to expand the range. Patriotism is a banner with a tremendous cohesive force and a strong appeal that can achieve broad unity among the people of the Chinese nation. Holding high the two banners of patriotism and socialism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping advanced the scientific idea of "one country, two systems" in 1982. By doing so he put forward a practical strategy for the united front in the new period, a front which comprises two unions: One is composed of all laborers and patriots on the mainland on the political basis of socialism and the other is composed of compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as overseas Chinese, on the political basis of supporting reunification of the motherland. On the whole, the two unions have three goals, namely: Achieving unity among the people on the mainland on the basis of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; achieving unity between compatriots on the mainland and those in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao on the basis of supporting peaceful reunification of the motherland; and achieving unity among the Chinese at home and abroad on the basis of reinvigorating the Chinese nation. The presentation and implementation of the principle of "one country, two systems" and the interpretation of the range covered by the two unions constituted a new departure in united front work for the new period characterized by being based on the mainland and keeping in view the outside world. Consequently, the range for united front work became broader and the number of people drawn into the front greater. III. There Is a Great Change in the Targets for the Patriotic United Front in the New Period With the establishment of a socialist market economy and a new change in the socio-economic structure, there has been a great change in the targets for the united front. One. The change in the social structure brought about by adjustment of the structure of production and the shift from primary to secondary and tertiary industries has affected united front work. Two. A shift in the ownership structure has resulted in a change in the economic structure. A prominent phenomenon over the last few years is that the private sector, including self-employed industrial and commercial operators, private enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises, has grown very rapidly. The expansion of the private sector has brought forth a number of new representative figures. An important mission for our comrades responsible for promoting united front work is to carry out the principle of uniting, helping, guiding, and educating these representative figures of the private sector, so we can choose from them activists who will cooperate with our party for a long period, and can encourage, through them, their colleagues to love the country, develop respect for their work, and abide by law to contribute to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Three. There is also a change in the contingent of intellectuals. A certain number of intellectuals, including cultural workers, teachers, scientific researchers, and medical and public health workers, quit their posts to "go into business" or join managerial staffs of industries using new and high technologies. Intellectuals drifting away from their original posts have imposed on united front workers a new task involving, in particular, winning over non-party intellectuals. Four. As members of democratic parties and representatives of minority nationalities and religious circles of the second and the third generations are replacing their predecessors, it is a difficult task to train new representatives of democratic parties and religious circles as well as minority nationality cadres. And, Five. The increase in the number of overseas Chinese and the change in their mix also calls for a change in the united front work and presents new problems. IV. The Patriotic United Front's Task for the New Period Is More Important In June 1976, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: The task for the united front in the new period is to bring every positive factor into play and unite with all the forces that can be united in a common effort to safeguard and develop political stability and unity and build China into a modern, strong socialist country. Soon after that he said that it is necessary to vigorously develop the patriotic united front to achieve reunification of the motherland at an early date. As we are trying to make breakthroughs in some key areas, and, at the same time, pressing ahead with the whole project of establishing a socialist market economy, which represents a profound revolution, we will certainly witness a situation in which the new system contradicts the old one and advantages are accompanied by disadvantages. Radical change in the economic field will inevitably exert extensive and intensive influence in politics and social activities. This year the party Central Committee advanced the 20-character principle of "seizing the current opportunity, deepening reform, opening China wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability." This is the general task of the country and the party as well as the general task of the patriotic united front. Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thesis on the mission of the patriotic united front in the new period and on the general task of the country and the party, the tasks of the patriotic united front in the new period are: To work in the interest of, first, stability and unity; second, the reform, opening up, and modernization drive; third, strengthening democracy and the legal system; and forth, the reunification of the motherland--in short, to work for the general objective of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Clearly, the responsibility of the united front is heavier rather than lighter than before, and the united front is more important to us now than in any period before. The united front is not something which is dispensable. Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that the united front remains a magic weapon for us and that it should be strengthened and expanded rather than weakened and reduced. V. The Patriotic United Front Has More Prominent Social Functions in the New Period In the new internal and external environment, the united front has the social function of uniting with as many people as possible, promoting democracy, coordinating relations, and maintaining stability to serve the general objective of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. To accomplish the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must unite with all the forces that can be united and bring every positive factor into play. In this respect, the united front has a special role to play. The essential task of the united front is to achieve unity on the broadest possible scale. The competence of a ruling party or a leading body is mainly judged by their abilities to make policy decisions and to achieve unity. If they make an inappropriate policy decision, all will go wrong; if they do not do a good job in uniting all forces, all will end with failure. In a sense, unity shows how competent they are; unity represents the overall interest; unity is strength; and unity is victory. As the old system is being replaced by a new one, adjustment of various interest relations will inevitably give rise to new contradictions. These contradictions are basically contradictions among the people. Correctly handling them is an important subject of the our political life and also for the united front. As the reform deepens and China opens more widely to the outside world, especially in the process of building up a socialist market economy, new contradictions and problems will keep cropping up. Failure to deal with and solve these contradictions and problems earnestly and in a timely manner will lead to chaos. For example, in general, minority nationalities and religious believers are united and the relevant situation is stable, but certain contradictions are unavoidable. We must make painstaking efforts to solve problems concerning minority nationalities and religion when and where they make their appearance. Doing a good job in coordinating relations among various parties, various nationalities, and members of various sectors within the united front is essential to consolidating and developing the political situation of solidarity, stability, and harmony.
