"Raful is in view, passing you on the left," one of those present, perhaps Ayal Arad, or Dany Eyran or Eyvat Liebermann, told the Likud chairman. "He's talking about negotiations with the PLO, Iran, and even Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. He's also threatening you from the right by taking an uncompromising position on the Golan Heights. What do we do?" Netanyahu placed two fingers on his forehead, as he likes to do in a tough spot, thought for another minute and came up with a tactical decision. He would adopt a statesmanlike posture, refraining from an attack on Raful and declaring that everyone has the right to run, for why else had he himself fought all those years, even against Shamir and the Likud, for direct elections? At the same time, however, Netanyahu sent his loyalist, Knesset member [MK] Tzahi Hanegbi, to the media to explain that Raful is exploiting the national camp and why this is liable to cause Netanyahu's defeat. Since then, one poll after another has been taken, and Raful is gaining on Netanyahu (and on Rabin) to a worrisome degree. Netanyahu, those close to him say, has long understood that no one running for prime minister in the next elections, which will undoubtedly be held early, will be able to win 50 percent of the vote and prevail in the first round. Raful wants to force a second round. In the expected face-off between Rabin and Netanyahu, the winner will be the one who controls the middle point. What are they doing now? They are creating an image of pseudo-moderation. They are speaking, for example, about cosmetic changes on the Golan Heights, and fleeing towards the center, the key to success. So it was that Netanyahu found himself on Tuesday, relaxed and smiling, in the Labor faction's meeting hall on the fifth floor of the Knesset, sitting between Avigdor Qahalani, chairman of the lobby for the Golan, and Eli Dayan, the coalition whip, working together with other members of the Knesset on how to strengthen the Golan law in the Knesset and constrain Rabin, who has drifted to the left. Netanyahu, by the way, made clear at the meeting that he was not understood correctly, and that his remarks about some centimeters were meant only to annoy the prime minister, but that the public had already solidified its impression of him as a pragmatic person, and that is what was important. Netanyahu also argued that he had not intended his comments for any purpose and that he was not speaking from firm opinions. Here too, one may believe him and those close to him, who contend that if he had really wanted to send up a trial balloon, he could have staked out moderate positions on issues that are much more popular, such as the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu is no fool, and he would not deliberately walk into the traps happily laid for him by his rivals in the Likud's top ranks. MK Moshe Qatzav, chairman of the Likud faction, headed off a discussion in the faction leadership this week on "Netanyahu's remarks" after he heard the explanations, but he asserted in private conversations that "the government is deep in negotiations with Syria and the Likud doesn't need to speed it up to lower the price. You can't talk about centimeters and not about meters." It is reasonable to suppose that Ari'el Sharon (of whom more later) also has jumped at the opportunity and is now meeting with his inner circle and planning how he will get to Netanyahu, without mentioning his name, of course, during the Likud assembly on Sunday. Perhaps he will pull out the speech he made to the Likud central committee, which met on 17 May at the Yad Eliyahu arena, with only minor changes. One recalls that at that time, Sharon summoned his most sneering tone to tell those eyeing the center: "The Alignment wants to hand over the Gaza Strip. Even among ourselves, we have heard voices on this subject. Fine, that's popular, it may indicate a readiness to compromise. That puts us in the middle." Netanyahu wants to place the Likud in the center and himself in the center of the Likud. This is a tricky maneuver, bound to run into obstacles, that Netanyahu adopted with all deliberation only after the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in September. His zigzag course since then has made still other tactical changes of direction. Netanyahu at first totally ignored public support for the agreement and was swept along behind Gandhi [Rehavam Ze'evi], Sharon, Benny Qatzover, Uri Ari'el and many other settlers who led the unruly right-wing demonstrations outside the prime minister's residence. He failed to offer any alternative. Even his speech to the Knesset on the day of the signing was not particularly impressive. Today, there is nothing to remember of Netanyahu except some superfluous thoughts he shared with his listeners about the bitter fates that befell Viet Nam and Korea. Netanyahu also failed to impose party discipline on his comrades as his image continued to deteriorate. He and his staff realized in October that the nation was waiting to hear a reasoned alternative. Netanyahu planned to unveil his alternative in the Likud central committee, which convened at the Cultural Center last month, but the Citadel leaked out the details one by one before that to keep the momentum up. The plan, in the end, contained nothing new and restated his narrow political philosophy: large security zones and Jewish settlements on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, which would not be subject to autonomy. The zones and the settlements, according to the plan, would form a territorial continuum between the coastal plain and the Jordan Valley. Earlier proposals raised by Netanyahu's staff for changing planks in the Likud platform and approving negotiations with the PLO were rejected eventually by the movement's chairman. Netanyahu himself has admitted that he has been speaking for years about the plan that he presented to the central committee. It represents not distilled pragmatism but only a concrete formulation of the security aspect of autonomy. One way or another, this recycling of ideas shook off his back his critics from both within and without and proved, somehow, that he was ready to deal with the new reality. He even called on Rabin this week to hold elections on the basis of one plan against another. Fortunately for Netanyahu, he has managed to leap into a comfortable position in the Likud's center, between the moderates and the extremists, even if some are certain that his plan wipes the Camp David accords off the map. In an interview in HA'ARETZ on the eve of the primaries, Benny Begin declared that Netanyahu's policy was contrary to common sense and the national interest. Nothing less. "Netanyahu, in fact, is seeking to annul the Camp David accords," said Begin. "He has adopted Ari'el Sharon's slogan, `Islands of autonomy in a sea of security.' What that means is taking unilateral steps and completely ignoring the need to reach an agreement" (2/18/93). David Levy, Moshe Qatzav, 'Uzi Landau and Dan Meridor have also stated since the signing of the agreement with the PLO that it is necessary to adhere to the Camp David formula. Sharon, as noted, has stated that we must quickly forget the autonomy plan. That is how Netanyahu found himself positioned between the unbending Camp David camp and the movement's "left," which is represented by MK Me'ir Shitrit, who supports the agreement. In contrast to all the others, Netanyahu is portrayed as a politician who does not move too quickly but who also does not stay stuck in place. Netanyahu's smoke-screen tactics have worked well on the issue of Gaza, too. Whether intentionally or not, Netanyahu has avoiding teaming up with Begin, Sharon, and Landau, who suddenly are all in the same boat on this subject and consider Gaza an inseparable part of the state (Begin calls the strip an "integral part"). On the other hand, Netanyahu has not kept aloof from the plan offered by Roni Milo to the Likud central committee in May calling for disengagement from Gaza. According to a number of sources, the Likud chairman even encouraged Milo to present his proposal. Netanyahu was heard in the past making perfectly moderate suggestions about Gaza. Now he wants to apply his security zone plan to Gaza as well, although he is ready to be generous with the Palestinian population during the negotiations over a permanent arrangement. Inevitably, his office sometimes forces on Netanyahu middle-of-the-road positions, even if he secretly is against them. For that reason, Netanyahu, along with David Levy, Begin, Qatzav, Meridor, and others, promises to observe the agreements with the PLO even after the Likud returns to power. He knows that the Israeli public is still prepared to give the process a chance and that international public opinion will not tolerate abrogation of the agreements. Any talk of annulling the peace with the PLO, therefore, must be confined to the mouths of Ari'el Sharon, faction whip 'Uzi Landau, and Tzahi Hanegbi. Sharon is Sharon. Landau, an eccentric in a suit, forces his colleagues to begin every meeting with a rendition of the Betar [youth movement] anthem. Hanegbi announced this week that when the Likud returns to office, he will expel every PLO official and have 'Arafat executed. Hanegbi also gave assurances that the public would support a platform adopting these warmhearted ideas on the eve of the elections. On a number of occasions, Netanyahu has stated that he would hold talks with whomever wins the elections scheduled to be held in the territories in another six months. If 'Arafat is elected, he will sit down with him. Netanyahu also said that he is in constant contact with Palestinians but, of course, he shares the opinion of most Likud central committee members, who showered jeers on MK Ya'aqov Shamai for his suggestion to open a channel of communication with the PLO to gauge its intentions. And when someone commits the grave infraction of crossing the Likud's ideological boundaries, Netanyahu does not put up with it. After Eli Levy, a member of the central committee, spoke about returning territories on the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights, and sought to fly to Tunis for meetings with Yasir 'Arafat, Netanyahu threatened to expel him from the movement. Not because of his opinions, explained the Likud chairman, but because Levy had not raised them in the proper forum. And then there is Shamai. After a central committee meeting at which he made his proposal concerning a channel to the PLO, he had a conversation with Yitzhaq Shamir, the former prime minister. The two had a rather strange dialogue. [Shamir] What's this proposal? Why do you need all this? [Shamai] We need to talk with them. Even you, as prime minister, would have kept the agreement. Shamir: Get out. No way. This agreement would have blown up a lot earlier. Now that he has found his place in the Likud, over the past two weeks Netanyahu has renewed his attack for the middle of the political map in an attempt to displace the Labor Party. He had three excellent opportunities. It began, as noted, with the Golan Law, in which he was nearly burned by the right but scored points from the other side. Ra'anan Cohen said at a Labor faction meeting that his party has turned left and that the Likud has seized the center. MK Eli Goldschmidt called on Yosi Beilin to resign because he had stated that the Jordan River is not the security border. Netanyahu also made a visit this week to the Jordan Valley, another place over which a consensus exists in the Labor Party, heard complaints from the residents and promised to work so that the settlements of the Jordan Valley do not fall under autonomy as a matter of law. Finally, there also came the announcement of support for a peace agreement with Jordan. Netanyahu, who, just like Sharon, has in recent years promoted the idea that the Palestinian state already exists in Jordan, was not bothered by the intrinsic contradiction. Jordan is Palestine, he explained, but that doesn't mean that the PLO has to take over there. Rumors were heard around the Knesset this week that Netanyahu is preparing the ground for bringing the Likud into a national unity government in which he wants to serve as minister of defense. Netanyahu has vehemently denied that, claiming that he would go along with it only if the government changed its platform. Meanwhile, he is getting ready for the next elections. The municipal elections, mostly in the Jerusalem region, taught him that in a system of direct elections, the party is only a means, and not very important. Ehud Olmert heads the third-largest faction on the city council, only one of its members belongs to the Likud, and yet Olmert is mayor because he won public support. "You have to please the general public, satisfy everyone in some way," said Ruby Rivlin, one of David Levy's close supporters, this week. "Netanyahu now has to play to all the galleries. He just has to avoid losing all of them, and mostly, losing his way." Bibi Netanyahu is walking a tightrope. That is precisely why he wishes the next elections were held tomorrow. He knows very well that many candidates can promise him the second round against Rabin, but that the war among the right-wing bloc contestants in the first round will utterly destroy him, particularly if Levy and Sharon are in the picture. In personal elections, he knows, there is no mercy. In this respect, one might consider the cases of Teddy Kollek and Ehud Olmert, and of Roni Milo and Avigdor Qahalani. And never forget that it was Netanyahu who got us into this whole mess. To get down to simple truths, in the next elections Netanyahu is liable to bump into not just Raful but also many of those who are plotting his death in the Likud. By law, the prime minister will be elected for a period of two terms and his cabinet composed of no more than 18 ministers, half of them from outside the Knesset. Moshe Qatzav, Benny Begin, Ehud Olmert, and Dan Meridor can wait, and perhaps some of them will become members of Netanyahu's government, if there is one. All of them are desperate to replace him before the end of the next elections. Levy and Sharon know that the new system is taking them down a path of no return. Netanyahu did not find a senior post for Sharon in the Likud after the primaries; what about in a government? Netanyahu does not speak to Levy. At the faction meeting last April after the municipal elections, Levy congratulated faction chairman 'Uzi Landau but ignored the party chairman sitting next to him. Levy, and even more so Sharon, are mercilessly grinding Netanyahu down and may already have begun their national campaign against him. Levy has said that he considered leaving the Likud after the elections for the local authorities, but there was some success in the meantime and he stayed in the Likud, waiting for Netanyahu to stumble again (the "amateur," he calls Netanyahu), particularly in social matters. Sharon is flaying Netanyahu on practically every issue. He describes Netanyahu as "wringing his hands on television under the tutelage of slick personal image experts," claims that he has a secret fund, and says that he is financially supporting only his municipal candidates. In a letter to MA'ARIV published early in July, Sharon contended that Netanyahu has a history of clandestine recording. This Sharon is so petty. During the primaries, he performed an examination and found that Netanyahu, in his mind, has accepted the Rabinite formula proscribing coming down from the Golan but not withdrawing from the Golan. This nuance has occupied Sharon's internal propaganda ever since.
