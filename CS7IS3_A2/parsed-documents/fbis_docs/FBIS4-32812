These people tried to steal a fishing boat but the reaction of the owner and the guards thwarted their effort, the source added. In the action, a soldier was wounded "by shots fired by one of the attackers," who were trying to illegally leave the country via the U.S. military installation. A police report stated that the attackers jumped into the sea and so far two of them have been arrested and the other three are still at large. On 17 April, Raul Castro, defense minister and second in Cuba's political hierarchy, admitted that tranquillity prevailed on both sides of the border last year and so far this year. "Our determination is to continue doing our part to maintain this climate," he added. Castro said that this is the reason why all sorts of measures will continue to be applied "to frustrate the crazy attempts of those who plan to leave the country by this means." He recalled that this is a "highly mined" area, and thus, escape attempts are not only "crazy but an act of provocation against the country's security."
