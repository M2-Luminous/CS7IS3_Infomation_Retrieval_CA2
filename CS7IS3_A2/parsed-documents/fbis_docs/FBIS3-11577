The first was on Sunday. The second came yesterday morning around 0930. The last farewell had not been announced, and instead, it was chaotic, brief, and unpleasant. A total of 34 former soldiers of the Movement for the Defense of National Sovereignty (MDSN) trespassed into the gardens of the Italian Embassy to demand the fulfillment of the agreements signed in October in exchange for their demobilization. These agreements include the delivery of 240 Italian packages (construction materials valued at $500 per package), food packages (each valued at $80), and 3,000 cordobas for each rifle turned in. According to the former soldiers, some of whom were involved in last September's kidnapping of UNO's [National Opposition Union] top leaders, some former soldiers were told they would be "attended to" first and, after that, the rest. One of the former soldiers standing near the Montoya monument said: "None of the three things promised have been given to any of us. They said that one month after our demobilization, which occurred in October, they would give us a response... but as of now, we have not received anything." Violet Chamorro's government also promised them a 3,000 manzana security zone... "but we have received nothing up until today," said one of the group's spokesmen. "Instead, they evicted us from San Cristobal, where we had begun planing.... Those crops are now lost." At 1040, after a brief discussion with Subcommander Manuel Ledezma, head of patrols in Managua, only one negotiating commission remained at the embassy. The demobilized soldiers remained standing outside the embassy in the scorching Lenten sun. The Cenidh [Nicaraguan Human Rights Center], from which the former soldiers sought mediation, rejected the soldiers' actions as being illegal, although Cenidh considered their demands fair. Cenidh Director Vilma Nunez said she understood their frustration, especially taking into account the manner in which the government is now negotiating with El Chacal [3-80 Northern Front rebel leader Jose Angel Talavera]. At approximately 1330, after negotiators Edwin Gomez, Fidencio Duarte, and two Italian Embassy officials returned to the Special Disarmament Brigades [BED] Headquarters, an agreement was announced: "We will meet at BED Headquarters on Tuesday at 1000 to discuss the timetable for commitments to be met." The atmosphere was bittersweet. One of the men, angered and frustrated, said: "If this time they fail to keep their promises, we will return to the mountains, and then they will have to fulfill the commitments."
