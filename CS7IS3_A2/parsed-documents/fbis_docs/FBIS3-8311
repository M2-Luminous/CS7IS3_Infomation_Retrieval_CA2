[passage omitted] Prime Minister Meksi conveyed the greetings of Sali Berisha, president of the Republic and commander general, to those present. He wished them success in their new, sacred task of defending the country. Among other things, Meksi said: [Begin Meksi recording] Today is a remarkable day for you and the Army. Your promotion and graduation, as well the start of the school process in the Defense Academy, which is completely reformed and restructured, constitute an important achievement. All this is being held at a historic moment of special importance, at a time when real democracy is being consolidated in our country and when, on the international level, Albania's position has been improved and recognized through its numerous education activities in many important international institutions. Consequently, even our Army, with its reformation, has already broken the framework of long isolation by cooperating with many armies of Western and other democratic countries, thus aiming to be converted into a qualitative, modern, and contemporary army. These prospects become more certain due to the approach to NATO as well as the signing of the Partnership for Peace initiative, which will naturally integrate Albania into the bosom of the NATO alliance. However, the road to membership passes through the difficult but indispensable road of efficiency, increased military and contemporary knowledge, high discipline, and a very high state of alertness.
