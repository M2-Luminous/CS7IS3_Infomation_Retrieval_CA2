The country's leader, Captain Blaise Compaore, has dissolved the government and the prime minister, Youssouf Ouedraogo, has resigned. The prime minister has been on the job since June 1992, but it seems he might have been giving jobs to people that ruling party militants did not approve of. On the line to Ouagadougou, Dan Isaacs asked our correspondent, Pierre Kazoni, if any reasons have been given for the prime minister's resignation: [Begin recording] [Kazoni] Well, no official reasons have been given, but according to the general public it is said that the pressure put on him to resign came from the militants of the majority party, the ODP-MT [Organization for Popular Democracy-Labor Movement], which is also President Compaore's party. He is also accused of not being [word indistinct] with conviction, and that he does not appoint the militants of the ODP to top positions. Well, these are the unofficial reasons, according to the people here, that have motivated his resignation. [Isaacs] So is it simply that the prime minister has been appointing ministers who are not from the majority party, the ODP- MT, he has been giving posts to other people? [Kazoni] Yes. I think the ODP-MT, which is the majority party, they want everything for themselves. It was said clearly during the National Assembly, in the National Assembly's session here that the majority in the government should rule and those who are not in the government should oppose. This was said clearly by a member of parliament who is a militant of the ODP-MT. But this is not the vision that Youssouf Ouedraogo has. He is a technocrat and he believes in the right man on the right job. [Isaacs] From what you are saying the prime minister, Mr. Ouedraogo, sounds less like a technocrat and more like somebody who really is his own man and wanted good men in good positions. Was he a popular prime minister? [Kazoni] You may say that he was popular in a sense, in a sense that he achieved something during his during his term of office, and the World Bank and the IMF have openly declared their satisfaction with the way Mr. Ouedraogo handles the SAP, the Structural Adjustment Program. [Isaacs] So will the new government, when it has been announced, be totally dominated by dominated by the majority party, the ODP-MT? Is that what we can look forward to now? [Kazoni] Very much, because since it is the outcry of the majority. I think Compaore may probably listen to them. But it does not really rule out completely that Compaore will put in somebody who is not probably a member of the majority party. This is possible. We can always expect something like that.
