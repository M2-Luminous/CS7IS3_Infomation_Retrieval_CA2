The agreement with Norway on the fishery issue, which was achieved over last night, is to be "emphatically welcomed," in particular since FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel played a "decisive part" in it, Deputy Government Spokesman Norbert Schaefer said. Without mentioning Spain and Britain by name, the Federal Government expressly regretted "the attitude of two partners," who have once again prevented a restructured blocking minority for votes in the larger Union. However, Bonn confidently hopes that a final agreement can be achieved at a special meeting next Tuesday.
