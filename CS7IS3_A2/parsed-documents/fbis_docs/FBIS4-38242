Eyewitnesses have said that three northern aircraft bombarded the oil refinery in Aden yesterday, causing damage to two pipelines. In a significant development, southern military sources have stressed the northern forces' use of modern French-made tanks which were not among the Yemeni Army's armament after unification. The sources pointed out that the tanks are part of the military aid provided recently to Sanaa by two Arab states with financing from a non-Arab Islamic state that has broadened and reinforced its relations with the Sanaa regime, especially since the Yemeni war broke out. Northern forces intensified their bombardment of the positions near Aden airport, damaging part of Aden Hotel, the Badr Camp, and the al-Nasr Free Trade company. [passage omitted]
