But the fact that the bilateral discussions were held here for the first time did provide local citizens with a personal opportunity to find how unrealistic the communist-held mainland is in dealing with Taiwan. This personal finding should go a long way toward building a consensus over the government's mainland policies. Many businessmen, politicians and a lot of members in the general public in the past have consistently criticized the government for being too slow in improving relations with the mainland. It is not the government that does not want to normalize relations with Beijing. In fact, Taipei has always been trying to do that. The problem is that Beijing has stubbornly refused to recognize this government and to respect its jurisdiction over Taiwan. It is this unreasonable stance of Beijing that once again prevented the solution of the three thorny issues in the Taipei round of bilateral talks. This Beijing position was expressed by its negotiators throughout the five-day discussions. For example, the Beijing negotiators contended that the entry of mainland people into Taiwan can be viewed as illegal only when they also break relevant regulation of the mainland. Why Beijing has such a view is apparently because it thinks Taiwan is a province of Mainland China and thus its people travel to this island does not constitute a crime of illegal entry. This is ridiculous. If Beijing continues to stick to its unrealistic Taiwan policies and ignores the fact that Taiwan and the mainland are politically divided and that this island has its own legitimate government and independent judicial system, there will never be a day for the two sides to normalize relations. Despite the failure to reach any agreement in the latest round of talks, local negotiators should be lauded for their firm position on protecting Taiwan's jurisdiction and sovereignty. To yield on this most important matter means to acquiesce in communist rule.
