FR941012-2-00106 FR941012-2-00072 Biweekly Notice Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations I. Background Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from September 19, 1994, through September 29, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49425). Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to (Project Director) : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50-400, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina Date of amendment request: August 19, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment will move the current procedural details of the radiological effluent Technical Specifications (TS) programmatic controls for radioactive effluents, radiological environmental monitoring and solid radioactive wastes from the Administrative Controls Section of the TS to the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual (ODCM) or the Process Control Program (PCP), as appropriate, in accordance with the guidance of Generic Letter 89-01. This amendment will also incorporate changes to the reporting requirements for the Effluent Release Reports, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36; incorporate references to the new 10 CFR Part 20; and revise the terminology for the gaseous effluent release rate limits. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Transferring the procedural details from the TS to the ODCM and PCP and their replacement with programmatic controls have no impact on plant operation or safety. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operation will be altered as a result of this proposed change. The changes are unrelated to the initiation and mitigation of accidents and equipment malfunctions addressed in the Final Safety Analysis Report. The proposed revisions to the reporting requirements for Effluent Release Reports, the gaseous effluent release rate limit and the relocation of the old 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302 have no impact on plant systems, plant operations or accident precursors. The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in nature. The change to the gaseous effluent release limit is also administrative in nature in that it will allow the continued operation of the facility with the same release rate limits as are currently implemented by the Technical Specifications. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Transferring the procedural details from the TS to the ODCM and PCP and their replacement with programmatic controls have no impact on plant operation or safety. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operation will be altered as a result of this proposed change. No changes to plant components or structures are introduced which could create new accidents or malfunctions not previously evaluated. The proposed revisions to the reporting requirements for effluent Release Reports, the gaseous effluent release rate limit and the relocation of the old 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302 have no impact on plant systems, plant operations or accident precursors. The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in nature. The change to the gaseous effluent release limits is also administrative in nature in that it will allow the continued operation of the facility with the same release rate limits as are currently implemented by the Technical Specifications. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The procedural details of the current RETS will be transferred to the ODCM and PCP and replaced with programmatic controls consistent with regulatory requirements, including controls on revisions to the ODCM and PCP. Thus, no requirements or controls will be reduced. The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in nature and therefore have no effect on the margin of safety. The proposed revisions to the gaseous effluent release limits will maintain the release rate limits at the same level as currently implemented by the Technical Specifications. Therefore, there will be no change in the types and amounts of effluents that will be released, nor will there be an increase in individual or cumulative radiation exposures to any member of the public. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Cameron Village Regional Library, 1930 Clark Avenue, Raleigh, North Carolina 27605 Attorney for licensee: R. E. Jones, General Counsel, Carolina Power & Light Company, Post Office Box 1551, Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 NRC Project Director: David B. Matthews Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-295 and 50-304, Zion Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2, Lake County, Illinois Date of amendment request: September 19, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications by reducing the frequency for testing the containment spray system spray nozzles. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. The relaxation of surveillance frequency will not affect any of the initiators or precursors of any accident previously evaluated. Performance of CS spray nozzle testing on a ten year basis rather than on a five year basis will not increase the likelihood that a transient initiating event will occur because transients are initiated by external events, equipment malfunction, and/or catastrophic system failure. There are no failure mechanisms or modes for the CS system or spray nozzles that could initiate a transient since the CS system is passive except during a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). Upon receipt of a Containment Spray signal (Containment High-High Pressure coincident with a Safety Injection Signal), the CS pumps automatically start and valves align to provide spray flow through the CS risers, ring headers, and out the spray nozzles. Periodic testing requirements for the CS pumps and valves (the active components of the system) are unaffected by the proposed changes. Industry experience and previous test experience at Zion Station supports the conclusion that functional checks of the spray nozzles on a ten year basis is adequate to detect degradation or blockage of the spray nozzles. The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical Specifications and will remove temporarily imposed Bases that are no longer applicable. Based on the fact that reliability of the system will not be affected and transient precursors and initiators are not affected by operation in accordance with the proposed changes, the probability of occurrence of accidents previously evaluated will not significantly increase. The proposed change in surveillance frequency will not affect the ability of the CS system to function as designed during the accidents considered in the Safety Analyses. Periodic testing requirements for the CS pumps and valves (the active components of the system) are unaffected by the proposed changes. Industry experience and previous test experience at Zion Station supports the conclusion that functional checks of the spray nozzles on a ten year basis is adequate to detect degradation or blockage of the spray nozzles. Given the proposed changes, the CS system will maintain the ability to reduce containment pressure, remove heat from containment, and remove iodine from the containment atmosphere during the design basis LOCA. As a result, peak containment pressure will be maintained below design pressure and the off-site release due to the postulated accident will remain as described in the Safety Analyses. Therefore, based on the previous discussion, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not involve the addition of any new or different types of safety related equipment, nor does it involve the operation of equipment required for safety operation of the facility in a manner different from those addressed in the safety analyses. No safety related equipment or function will be altered as a result of the proposed changes. Also, changes to the procedures governing normal plant operation and recovery from an accident are not necessitated by the proposed Technical Specification changes. The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical Specifications and will remove Bases that are no longer applicable. Since no new failure modes or mechanisms are added by the proposed changes, the possibility or a new or different kind of accident is not created. 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins are established through LCOs, limiting safety system settings, and safety limits specified in the Technical Specifications. There will be no changes to either the physical design of the plant or to any of these settings and limits as a result of relaxing the surveillance frequency of CS nozzle checks from five years to ten years. Testing on a ten year basis is adequate to detect spray nozzle degradation or blockage since the system piping and spray nozzles are constructed of corrosion resistant Type 304 stainless steel and since the system is normally passive (i.e. spray risers and spray rings are empty with no flow except during an accident). This conclusion was also provided in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05 which recommended revising the surveillance frequency as proposed. The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical Specifications and will remove Bases that are no longer applicable. Based on the above discussion, the ability to safely shut down the operating unit and mitigate the consequences of all accidents previously evaluated will be maintained. Therefore, the margin of safety is not significantly affected. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Waukegan Public Library, 128 N. County Street, Waukegan, Illinois 60085 Attorney for licensee: Michael I. Miller, Esquire; Sidley and Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60690 NRC Project Director: Robert A. Capra Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50-414, Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, York County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: August 25, 1994 Description of amendment request: The requested amendments modify the trip setpoint and allowable value for the 4 kilo-volt (KV) electrical bus degraded grid undervoltage relay and the allowable value for the loss of offsite power relay in response to an issue identified in the licensee's Self-Initiated Technical Audit. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Criterion 1 The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The amendments will not affect either the probability or the consequences of an accident, since no physical changes to the plant are being proposed. The amendments merely change the existing technical specification settings for the above relays to more conservative values. Current field settings for these relays are already at these more conservative values. No changes to the manner in which the plant is operated are being proposed. Criterion 2 The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As stated above, no actual changes to the physical plant are being proposed. No effect on plant operation will occur, therefore the possibility of new accident types is not created. Criterion 3 The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will be unaffected, since no changes to the plant are being made. The proposed technical specification values are more conservative and are intended to make the technical specifications correspond with the actual plant relay settings. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: York County Library, 138 East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina 29730 Attorney for licensee: Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422 South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 NRC Project Director: Herbert N. Berkow Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50-414, Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, York County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: August 25, 1994 Description of amendment request: The amendments would change the frequency for conducting the surveillance test required by TS 4.7.1.2.1 for the auxiliary feedwater pumps from once per 31 days to at least once per 92 days and would add a footnote which clarifies that testing is not required to be performed until system heatup has progressed to a pressure (600 psig) that will support conduct of the test. The change in the surveillance frequency has been evaluated and approved by the NRC staff as discussed in Section 9.1 of NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.'' The change is based on the finding in NUREG-1366 that an analysis of AFW pump failures indicates that a monthly surveillance test interval may be contributing to AFW pump unavailability through failures and equipment degradation and, therefore, AFW pump availability is increased by quarterly testing on a staggered basis. Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' provided the sample TS for this change. The change is accomplished by dividing TS 4.7.1.2.1a into two parts. The new 4.7.1.2.1a maintains the previous 31-day testing frequency for the AFW valves while the new 4.7.1.2.1b inserts a new frequency of once per 92 days for the AFW pump tests. Also, an obsolete footnote is deleted. The new footnote discussed above is consistent with NUREG-1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse Plants.'' Appropriate changes to the Bases for the TS have also been proposed. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The requested amendments decrease from monthly to quarterly the frequency at which the motor-driven and turbine-driven AFW pumps must be demonstrated operable as specified in TS 4.7.1.2.1. They also incorporate a note of clarification from the new Westinghouse STS into the existing Catawba specifications concerning when the pump head or discharge pressure versus flow verification for the turbine-driven pump is required to be performed. Criterion 1 The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Decreasing the frequency of AFW pump testing as specified in TS from monthly to quarterly will have no impact upon the probability of any accident, since the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. Also, since Catawba's AFW pump performance history supports making the proposed change, system response following an accident will not be adversely affected. Therefore, the requested amendments will not result in increased accident consequences. Deletion of the obsolete footnotes as indicated in the Catawba technical specification markups is purely an administrative change, and therefore will have no impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident. Incorporating the new STS note will only serve to clarify when the turbine-driven pump is required to be tested and will not have any impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident. The pump will still be tested as before and its acceptance criteria will be unaffected. Criterion 2 The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As stated above, the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. No new failure modes can be created from an accident standpoint. The plant will not be operated in a different manner. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete footnotes has no bearing on any accident initiating mechanisms. Incorporating the clarifying note from the new STS will not result in any new acident sequences, since plant operation will be unaffected. Criterion 3 The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will be unaffected by the proposed changes. The AFW pumps will still be capable of fulfilling their required safety function, since plant operating experience supports the proposed change. The availability of the AFW pumps will be increased as a result of the proposed amendments because they will not have to be made unavailable for testing as frequently. Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent with the NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete footnotes will not result in any impact to plant safety margins. Incorporating the note from the new STS will not impact any safety margins. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: York County Library, 138 East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina 29730 Attorney for licensee: Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422 South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 NRC Project Director: Herbert N. Berkow Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-220, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: September 1, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.2.2, ``Minimum Reactor Vessel Temperature for Pressurization,'' and the associated Bases. Specifically, the proposed amendment replaces existing TS Figures 3.2.2.a,b,c,d, and e and associated TS Tables 3.2.2.a,b,c,d, and e, that define the limits for minimum reactor vessel temperature for pressurization and account for neutron damage at exposures up to 18 effective full power years (EFPY), with new figures and tables that are applicable for up to 18 EFPY. The licensee stated that the new pressure-temperature (P-T) limits were developed based on a plant-specific Charpy shift model for Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 which is consistent with and meets the requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, ``Radiation Embrittlement of Reactor Vessel Materials.'' The new P-T limits were calculated in accordance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, and with the requirements specified in Appendix G to Section III of the American Society of Mechnical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code). Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 [NMP1], in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Components of the reactor primary coolant system are operated so that no substantial mechanical or thermal loading is applied unless the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) materials are at a temperature well above the reference nil-ductility temperature (RT NDT ) of the limiting RPV material. Protection against brittle fracture is further ensured by postulating a defect with a depth 1/4 of the RPV wall thickness and a length 1-1/2 times the wall thickness, and calculating the allowable pressure loading as a function of temperature using linear elastic fracture mechanics. Safety factors are applied to the allowable loading determination and lower bound fracture toughness properties are used to represent the material behavior. The net effect of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and the ASME Section III, Appendix G P-T curve calculative procedures is to produce very conservative P-T curves. These procedures have been applied in the calculation of the proposed P-T limits. Neutron damage during plant operation is accounted for in the allowable pressure loading by calculating an adjusted reference nil-ductility temperature (ART NDT ). Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, defines the ART NDT as the sum of the reference nil-ductility temperature (RT NDT ) plus the shift in the reference nil-ductility temperature caused by irradiation ([delta]RT NDT ), plus a margin. The proposed amendment replaces Equation (2) in Regulatory Position 2.1 with an accurate plant-specific model. The ART NDT margin is the same as for earlier P-T curve calculations. Operation of NMP1 in accordance with the proposed P-T operating limits will preclude brittle failure of the RPV materials. Safety margins for brittle fracture are in accordance with those specified in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code. Therefore, the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment incorporates P-T operating limits based on previously established calculative procedures described in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code, and Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2. The proposed changes to the P-T operating limits are based on analyses of the irradiated limiting plate material for Nine Mile Point Unit 1. The proposed changes do not modify any plant equipment nor do they create any potential initiating events that would create any new or different kind of accident. Operation in accordance with the proposed P-T operating limits will preclude brittle failure of the reactor vessel material, since safety margins specified in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code will be maintained. Therefore, the proposed P-T limits will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the amendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Operation in accordance with the proposed P-T operating limits will preclude brittle failure of the reactor pressure vessel since safety margins in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code will be maintained. The plant-specific limiting material [delta]RT NDT has been reduced as compared with the overly conservative [delta]RT NDT used in previous P-T curve calculations as a result of the more accurate representation of the Nine Mile Point Unit 1 RPV plate behavior as a function of neutron exposure. However, the [delta]RT NDT is intended to be an accurate representation of the Charpy shift (indexed at 30 ft-lbs of absorbed energy) as a function of fluence. Since the ASME Section III, Appendix G safety factors have been maintained and the Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, margin term specified in Regulatory Position 2.1 has been applied in the same manner as in earlier P-T curve calculations, no significant reduction in the margin of safety has resulted from the use of a plant-specific [delta]RT NDT model. Therefore, the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Reference and Documents Department, Penfield Library, State University of New York, Oswego, New York 13126. Attorney for licensee: Mark J. Wetterhahn, Esquire, Winston & Strawn, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3502. NRC Project Director: Michael J. Case Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-275 and 50-323, Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, San Luis Obispo County, California Date of amendment request: August 17, 1994 (Reference LAR 94-06) Description of amendment request: The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to change TS 3/4.1.2.5, ``Borated Water Sources - Shutdown,'' TS 3/4.1.2.6, ``Borated Water Sources - Operating,'' and TS 3/4.5.5, ``Emergency Core Cooling Systems - Refueling Water Storage Tank.'' The changes delete the minimum refueling water storage tank (RWST) solution temperature and increase the allowed outage time (AOT) of the RWST for adjustment of boron concentration from 1 hour to 8 hours. Specifically, the minimum RWST temperature requirement of TS 3.1.2.5b(3), TS 4.1.2.5b, and TS 4.5.5b would be deleted. TS 3/4.1.2.6 would be revised as follows: (1) TS 3.1.2.6b, Action Statement b., and TS 4.1.2.6b, pertaining to the RWST, would be deleted. (2) Editorial changes would be made to reflect the deletion of the RWST requirements. TS 3/4.5.5 would be revised as follows: the minimum RWST temperature requirement of TS 3.5.5c would be deleted, and the action statement would be deleted and replaced with two action statements. Action Statement a. would specify the requirements when the RWST is inoperable due to boron concentration. The action statement would also provide 8 hours to restore the boron concentration to within the required limits. If boron concentration is not restored within 8 hours, the action statement requires that the unit be in hot standby within 6 hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Action Statement b. would specify the requirements when the RWST is inoperable due to reasons other than boron concentration. The associated Bases would also be appropriately revised. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The increase in the RWST AOT does not alter the plant configuration or operation. The potential for the RWST boron concentration to be outside the TS limits is small because the RWST and its contents are not involved with normal plant operation and are not subject to process variations associated with plant operation. The potential causes of boron concentration deviation have been evaluated with the conclusion that any deviation in RWST boron concentration would not be expected to increase significantly during the proposed 7 hour AOT increase. The increase in the RWST AOT from 1 hour to 8 hours for reasons directly related to boron concentration does not have a significant effect on the accident analyses. The removal of the redundant statement of RWST requirements from TS 3.1.2.6 is an administrative change with no impact on plant operation. The removal of the minimum temperature limit for the RWST has no effect on the plant configuration or operation. The removal of the temperature limits does not affect any accident analyses since evaluations have demonstrated that, due to the moderate climate at DCPP, the RWST will not exceed the limits assumed in DCPP accident analyses. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? Increasing the RWST AOT from 1 hour to 8 hours for reasons directly related to boron concentration does not require physical alteration to any plant system and does not change the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. The removal of the redundant statement of RWST requirements from TS 3.1.2.6 is an administrative change that does not affect the design and operation of the plant. Deletion of the RWST temperature has no impact on any accident analysis due to the moderate climate at DCPP. Additionally, the deletion of the temperature does not require any physical alteration to the plant or change the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? Increasing the RWST AOT for reasons directly related to boron concentration does not affect any accident analysis assumptions, initial conditions, or results. The margins of safety reflected in the DCPP TS are not compromised by the 7 hour AOT increase. Consequently, the proposed change does not have an effect on margin of safety. The removal of the redundant statement of RWST requirements from TS 3.1.2.6 is an administrative change that does not affect the requirements for the RWST nor alter its function. The removal of the RWST temperature limits will not affect the assumptions of any accident analysis because the moderate climate at DCPP will prevent the temperature assumptions in the analyses from being exceeded. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.

As part of the relocation of TS 3/4.4.2.1, TS 3/4.4.2.2, ``Safety Valves - Operating,'' would be revised to require that the pressurizer safety valves be operable in Mode 4 with the reactor coolant system cold-leg temperature greater than the low-temperature overpressure protection system enable temperature, and TS 6.8, ``Procedures and Programs,'' would be revised to include the reactor coolant pump flywheel inspection program. The specific TS changes proposed are as follows: (1)Technical Specifications (TS) 3/4.4.2.1 ``Safety Valves - Shutdown,'' 3/4.4.7, ``Chemistry,'' 3/4.4.9.2, ``Pressurizer (Temperature Limits),'' 3/4.4.10, ``Structural Integrity,'' 3/4.4.11, ``Reactor Vessel Head Vents,'' and TS 6.8, ``Procedures and Programs,'' would be revised in accordance with the Commission's Final Policy Statement on TS Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors. (2)TS 3/4.4.2.2, ``Safety Valves - Operating,'' would be revised to require that the pressurizer safety valves be operable in Mode 4 with the reactor coolant system cold-leg temperature greater than the low- temperature overpressure protection system enable temperature. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: a. Do the changes involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed changes simplify the TS, meet regulatory requirements for relocated TS, and implement the recommendations of the Commission's Final Policy Statement on TS Improvements. Future changes to these requirements will be controlled by 10 CFR 50.59. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any modifications to any plant equipment or affect plant operation. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. b. Do the changes create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The proposed changes are administrative in nature, do not involve any physical alterations to any plant equipment, and cause no change in the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. c. Do the changes involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? The proposed changes do not alter the basic regulatory requirements and do not affect any safety analyses. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.

Attorney for licensee: Christopher J. Warner, Esq., Pacific Gas & Electric Company, P.O. Box 7442, San Francisco, California 94120 NRC Project Director: Theodore R. Quay Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-275 and 50-323, Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, San Luis Obispo County, California Date of amendment request: August 17, 1994 (Reference LAR 94-09) Description of amendment request: The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to change TS 3/4.4.9.1, ``Reactor Coolant System - Pressure/Temperature Limits,'' Figures 3.4-2, ``Reactor Coolant System Heatup Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' and 3.4-3, ``Reactor Coolant System Cooldown Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' to extend the applicability up to 12 effective full-power years (EFPYs). TS 3/4.4.9.3, ``Overpressure Protection Systems,'' would be revised to specify a new low-temperature overprotection (LTOP) system actuation pressure setpoint. The associated Bases would also be appropriately revised. Additionally, TS 3/4.1.2.2, ``Flow Paths - Operating,'' TS 3/4.1.2.4, ``Charging Pumps - Operating,'' TS 3/4.4.1.3, ``Hot Shutdown,'' TS 3/4.4.1.4.1, ``Cold Shutdown - Loops Filled,'' TS 3/4.4.9.3, and TS 3/4.5.3, ``Tavg Less than 350 Degrees F,'' would be revised to specify a new LTOP system enable temperature. (1) In TS 3/4.4.9.1, Figure 3.4-2, ``Reactor Coolant System Heatup Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' and Figure 3.4-3, ``Reactor Coolant System Cooldown Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' are revised as follows: (a) The ``Controlling Materials'' for the pressure/temperature curves are revised to reflect the current reactor vessel beltline region limiting weld and plate materials. (b)The title for the figures is changed to reflect the applicability of the pressure/temperature curves for up to 12 EFPYs of service life. (2) The proposed changes to TS 3/4.4.9.3 are as follows: (a) The LTOP enable temperature would be changed from 323 ○F to 270 ○F to be consistent with Branch Technical Position (BTP) RSB 5-2, Revision 1, Branch Position B.2. (b) LTOP system actuation pressure setpoint would be revised from less than or equal to 450 psig to less than or equal to 435 psig. (3) TS 3/4.1.2.2, TS 3/4.1.2.4, TS 3/4.4.1.3, TS 3/4.4.1.4.1, TS 3/4.4.9.3, and TS 3/4.5.3 would be revised to change the LTOP enable temperature from 323 ○F to 270 ○F to be consistent with BTP RSB 5-2, Revision 1, Branch Position B.2. TS Bases 3/4.4.9.1 would be revised to delete a reference to Table 4.4-5, ``Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program - Withdrawal Schedule.'' The table was deleted from the TS in Amendments 54 and 53 issued in July 1990. Reference to the table in Bases 3/4.4.9 was inadvertently not deleted. The information in this table is currently contained in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) Update. (4) TS Bases 3/4.4.9.3 would be revised to discuss limitations on reactor coolant pump (RCP) and emergency core cooling system/chemical and volume control system pump operation during low reactor coolant system (RCS) temperature conditions. (5) The other affected TS Bases would also be revised. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed changes to Figures 3.4-2 and 3.4-3 of TS 3.4.9.1 and the associated Bases will extend the applicability of the RCS heatup and cooldown pressure/temperature limits from 8 to 12 EFPY. Since the level of reactor vessel embrittlement projected for 12 EFPY is bounded by that previously projected for 8 EFPY, the proposed changes will not impact the probability of brittle fracture of the vessel, and consequently not impact the consequences of an accident. The present LTOP pressure setpoint was reviewed and found to be acceptable and conservative for the extension of the pressure/temperature curves to 12 EFPY. However, as a result of issues unrelated to the change in the applicability of the pressure/temperature curves, the LTOP actuation pressure setpoint is reduced. The change accounts for pressure measurement error identified in NRC IN [Information Notice] 93-58, a time delay in the LTOP system actuation introduced as part of the installation of the Eagle 21 protection system, and additional conservatism incorporated into the DCPP LTOP analysis. The changes to the pressure setpoint are conservative and provide assurance that the maximum cold RCS pressure will not be exceeded. The proposed change to TS 3/4.1.2.2, 3/4.1.2.4, 3/4.4.1.3, 3/4.4.9.3, and 3/4.5.3 will revise the LTOP enable temperature to be consistent with the methodology and definition of ``low temperature'' provided in BTP RSB 5-2 Revision 1. The proposed changes do not involve physical alteration of the LTOP system or change the method by which the LTOP system performs its function. The proposed changes will benefit DCPP by expanding the RCS pressure/temperature window, thereby increasing operator flexibility during heatup and cooldown. This will decrease the probability of an accident by decreasing the likelihood of an inadvertent PORV [power-operated relief valve] actuation. Deletion of reference to Table 4.4-5 from TS Bases 3/4.4.9 is administrative in nature and does not affect plant operation. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The proposed changes to TS 3.4.9.1 do not involve any physical alteration to any plant system or change the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. The probability of catastrophic failure of the reactor vessel will not be changed as a result of the extension of the curves to 12 EFPY. The present LTOP pressure setpoint was reviewed and found to be acceptable and conservative for the extension of the pressure/temperature curves to 12 EFPY. However, as a result of issues unrelated to the change in the applicability of the pressure/temperature curves, the LTOP actuation pressure setpoint is reduced. The change accounts for pressure measurement error identified in IN 93-58, a time delay in the LTOP system actuation introduced as part of the installation of the Eagle 21 protection system, and additional conservatism incorporated into the DCPP LTOP analysis. The changes to the pressure setpoint are conservative and provide assurance that the maximum cold RCS pressure will not be exceeded. The proposed change to TS 3/4.1.2.2, 3/4.1.2.4, 3/4.4.1.3, 3/4.4.9.3, and 3/4.5.3 will revise the LTOP enable temperature to be consistent with the methodology and definitions provided in BTP RSB 5-2, Revision 1. Additionally, the proposed changes will not affect the ability of the LTOP system to provide pressure relief at low temperatures, thereby maintaining the LTOP design basis. Deletion of reference to Table 4.4-5 from TS Bases 3/4.4.9 is administrative in nature and does not result in physical alterations or changes to the operation of the plant. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? The proposed changes to TS 3.4.9.1 will extend the applicability of the RCS heatup and cooldown pressure/temperature limits to 12 EFPY, but will not physically change these limits. The pressure/temperature limits have been determined in accordance with 10 CFR 50, Appendix G, and include the safety margins with regard to brittle fracture required by the ASME Code, Section III, Appendix G. The RT ndt s determined for the reactor vessels at 12 EFPY are lower than the values previously determined at 8 EFPY. Therefore, there will be additional safety margin in the pressure/temperature limits with respect to Appendix G requirements. The change in the LTOP pressure setpoint is conservative and provides assurance that the current margin of safety is maintained. The proposed change to TS 3/4.1.2.2, 3/4.1.2.4, 3/4.4.1.3, 3/4.4.9.3, and 3/4.5.3, will revise the LTOP enable temperature to be consistent with the methodology and definitions provided in BTP RSB 5-2, Revision 1, which provides the requirements for reactor vessel overpressurization protection at low temperatures. Deletion of reference to Table 4.4-5 from TS Bases 3/4.4.9 is an administrative change and does not involve any physical alteration to the plant. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.

Attorney for licensee: Christopher J. Warner, Esq., Pacific Gas & Electric Company, P.O. Box 7442, San Francisco, California 94120 NRC Project Director: Theodore R. Quay Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-352 and 50-353, Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Date of amendment request: August 12, 1994 Description of amendment request: The amendment would revise the Limiting Condition for Operation for the Emergency Core Cooling System specified in Technical Specifications Section 3.5.1 and associated Bases Section 3.4.5.1 to include a new ACTION statement in the event that the High Pressure Coolant Injection system and one Core Spray subsystem, and/or one Low Pressure Coolant Injection subsystem, are inoperable. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed TS change does not involve any physical changes to plant systems or components, nor does it affect the ability of the Low pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) Core Spray (CS), and High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) systems to respond to an accident. These systems are not accident initiators, since their design function is accident mitigation. This proposed TS change, which only addresses equipment status, will not significantly increase the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated. The addition of the proposed ACTION statement enables the plant not to implement TS Section 3.0.3, which requires a plant shutdown, when the HPCI system is inoperable in conjunction with one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem. The proposed TS change does not impact the operation of any equipment important to safety. This proposed TS change does not make physical modifications to the plant or to equipment, nor does it impact any design requirements of the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems. The proposed TS change does not introduce any failure mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated, since no physical changes are being made to the facility. This proposed change will not create any new failure modes which would cause plant equipment to malfunction more frequently than previously evaluated. The basis for TS Sections 3.8.2.1 and 3.8.3.1, which specify that four (4) independent divisions of Safeguard dc electrical power shall be operable, or shall be restored to operability with 8 hours, is to ensure that sufficient power is available to supply safety-related equipment required to safely shut down the plant, and to provide for mitigation and control of accident conditions at the plant. As discussed in Section 6.3.2 of the NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER), i.e., NUREG-0991, ``Safety Evaluation Report Related to the Operation of Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2,'' dated August 1983, the most limiting single failure for the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), which includes all break sizes, is the failure of the dc power system common to the HPCI system, one (1) CS subsystem, and one (1) LPCI subsystem. Only one (1) single failure is assumed to occur in the event of a Design Basis Accident (DBA). Therefore, three (3) LPCI pumps, one (1) CS subsystem, and the Automatic Depressurization (ADS) system would be operable and available, for use in the event of a DBA, to provide sufficient core cooling to safely shut down the plant. Although the loss of Division 2 dc power specifically impacts the ``B'' LPCI and ``B'' CS, the analysis performed in the NRC SER evaluates the number of ECCS available for use in a DBA. Since the amount of available core cooling is independent of which loop of LPCI or CS is assumed to fail, this analysis is applicable to the loss of any division/loop of LPCI or CS. Therefore, the loss of the HPCI system, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem is bounded by the existing analysis. Since the loss of HPCI, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem is an analyzed condition, and actions associated with TS Section 3.0.3 are related to unanalyzed conditions, the requirements of TS Section 3.0.3 are not applicable to this scenario. Adding an ACTION statement, as proposed, identical to the ACTION statement which currently applies to the loss of Division 2 of Safeguard dc electrical power causes no change in the consequences of any accidents previously evaluated. This proposed TS change does not impact systems, structures, and components designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. In the event of an accident, the plant configuration following the event will be within the bounds of the existing analysis, and there will be no change in the radiological consequences due to an accident. Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident [previously] evaluated. 2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed TS change does not require any physical changes to plant systems or equipment, nor will it affect the ability of the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems from performing their design functions, which is to mitigate the consequences of an accident. These systems do not contribute to the initiation of an accident, since their function is accident mitigation. This proposed TS change will not introduce new equipment malfunction or failure modes. The proposed TS change will not introduce any failure mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated. The existing design basis for the plant, as described in Section 6.3.2.5 of the LGS Updated Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) and Section 6.3.2 of the NRC SER, bounds the condition proposed by this TS Change Request. Section 6.3.2 of the NRC SER indicates that the most limiting single failure for the ECCS is the loss of the dc system powering the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems. Assuming this failure, three (3) LPCI pumps, one (1) CS subsystem, and the ADS would still be operable and available, for use in the event of a DBA, to ensure adequate core cooling to safely shut down the plant. Although the loss of Division 2 dc power specifically affects ``B'' LPCI and ``B'' CS, the analysis performed in the NRC SER evaluates the number of ECCS available for use in a DBA. Since the amount of available core cooling is independent of which loop of LPCI or CS is assumed to fail, this analysis is applicable to the loss of any division/loop of LPCI or CS. Since the loss of HPCI, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem, is an analyzed condition, and the actions associated with TS Section 3.0.3 pertain to unanalyzed conditions, the requirements of TS Section 3.0.3 do not apply to the condition proposed by this TS Change Request. Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed TS change [TS] does not involve any physical changes to the design or functional requirements of the LPCI, CS, or HPCI systems. These systems will continue to function as designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. This proposed TS change involves adding an additional ACTION statement, and revising the associated supporting Bases section, to specifically address the inoperability of the HPCI system in conjunction with the inoperability of one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem. These systems would be inoperable in the event of the loss of Division 2 of the Safeguard dc electrical power supply. The Bases associated with Safeguard electrical power systems, which provide power to equipment required to safely shutdown the plant and to mitigate consequences of an accident, are unchanged. The proposed TS change involves adding an ACTION statement which is identical to the ACTION statement which addresses the inoperability of Division 2 of Safeguard dc power, which is a condition analyzed in the LGS UFSAR and NRC SER. Therefore, the proposed TS change to include an additional ACTION statement does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Pottstown Public Library, 500 High Street, Pottstown, Pennsylvania 19464. Attorney for licensee: J. W. Durham, Sr., Esquire, Sr. V. P. and General Counsel, Philadelphia Electric Company, 2301 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101 NRC Project Director: Mohan C. Thadani, Acting Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-352 and 50-353, Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Date of amendment request: August 23, 1994 Description of amendment request: This amendment would remove the 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table from Technical Specifications, which is consistent with NUREG-1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications.'' Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This proposed change removes the repetitious 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table which is also found in the LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The proposed change to TS does not affect the requirement to perform surveillance testing and the manner of performing surveillance testing is adequately described in plant procedures. The UFSAR containing the Battery Load Cycle Table and station procedures are maintained using the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59 and are subject to the change control process in the Administrative Controls Section of the LGS TS Section 6.0. Since any future changes to these controlled documents will be evaluated per 10 CFR 50.59, no [changes] (significant or insignificant) in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will be allowed. Therefore, this change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. This proposed change removes the repetitious 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table which is also found in the LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). This change will not alter the plant configuration (no new or different type of equipment will be installed) or make changes to methods governing normal plant operations. This change will not impose different requirements and adequate control of information will be maintained. The manner of performing surveillance testing can be adequately described in plant procedures. The proposed change will remove the table, and will not alter assumptions made in the safety analysis and licensing basis. Therefore, this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This proposed change removes the repetitious 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table which is also found in the LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The change will not reduce the margin of safety since the location of the Battery Table has no impact on any safety analysis assumptions. Since all Battery Load Table changes (i.e., UFSAR Changes) and procedure changes are evaluated per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, no reduction (significant or insignificant) in the margin of safety will be allowed. Therefore, this change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The existing requirements for NRC review and approval of revisions, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.90, to those details and requirements proposed for deletion, do not have a specific margin of safety upon which to evaluate. However, since the proposed change is consistent with the BWR Standard Technical Specifications (NUREG-1433), revising the TS to reflect the approved level of detail and requirements ensures no reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

P. and General Counsel, Philadelphia Electric Company, 2301 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101 NRC Project Director: Mohan C. Thadani, Acting Public Service Electric & Gas Company, Docket No. 50-354, Hope Creek Generating Station, Salem County, New Jersey Date of amendment request: August 5, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment incorporates line item Technical Specification improvements listed in Generic Letter 93-05 relevant to Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) surveillance requirements. The proposed amendment eliminates the requirements to start EDGs with an inoperable offsite circuit(s) of AC electrical power and adds a provision that eliminates required testing of the remaining EDGs when one EDG is inoperable due to an inoperable support system or an independently testable component with no potential for common mode failure for the remaining EDGs. In addition, if testing of the EDGs is required, then the surveillances will be performed within 16 hours instead of 24 hours as currently specified. The proposed amendment also deletes the requirement to perform a loss of offsite power (LOP) test following the 24-hour EDG endurance run test. In its place, a hot restart test (no LOP load sequencing) will be established. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. LCR 94-10 The proposed changes in this License Change Request (LCR) have been extensively reviewed by the NRC during the preparation of NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05, and by [Public Service Electric and Gas Company] PSE&G during the development and approval of this LCR. The LCR revises the current ACTION statement of Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 to eliminate testing of the unaffected Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) upon loss of an offsite power circuit(s) and/or an EDG. The basis for this testing was originally to verify the reliability of the EDGs, however, as stated in NUREG-1366, industry experience has shown that excessive testing of the EDGs has in fact reduced reliability. The EDG design and function remain as previously analyzed and the EDG response during accident conditions is not affected. This change will improve EDG performance by reducing the number of unnecessary starts and by requiring more appropriate testing (within 16 hours instead of 24 hours) when there is a potential common mode failure. These changes will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident, nor will it result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. LCR 94-13 The proposed changes in this License Change Request (LCR) have been extensively reviewed by the NRC during the preparation of NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05, and by PSE&G during the development and approval of this LCR. Regulatory Guide 1.108, Rev. 1, states that the performance of a loss of Off-site Power (LOP) test (Surveillance Requirement 4.8.1.1.2.h.4.b) immediately following the 24 hour endurance run demonstrates that the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) can start in the prescribed time when the EDG is at its normal operating temperature. The purpose of performing the LOP test immediately following the 24 hour endurance run is to demonstrate the hot restart capability of the EDG at full load conditions. However, demonstrating diesel generator hot restart capability without loading the engine does not invalidate or reduce the effectiveness of the hot restart test. Performance of this test can be conducted in any plant condition since its performance at power will have no adverse effect on plant operations. The LOP test will continue to be performed at standby conditions to provide assurance that the EDG is capable of responding to a LOP as assumed in the accident analyses. EDG design and function remain as previously analyzed. Their response during accident conditions [is] not affected by these changes. Therefore, no significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated results from these changes. 2. Will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. LCR 94-10 The elimination of the unnecessary EDG starts will not result in any change in plant configuration or operation. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated or analyzed. LCR 94-13 The proposed revisions to the Technical Specifications do not involve a physical change in any system configuration and do not introduce new operating configurations. These changes will not result in any net reduction in testing and will not affect EDG reliability. This test may be performed in any plant condition since its performance at power will have no adverse effect on plant operations. Therefore, these changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3. Will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. LCR 94-10 The changes proposed in this LCR do not reduce the ability of any system or component to perform its safety related function. The basis of NUREG-1366, Generic Letter 93-05 and the analysis performed in support of this LCR is that the reduction in unnecessary EDG starts can improve safety by diminishing challenges to plant systems and reducing equipment wear or degradation. These proposed changes involve only surveillance frequencies and do not change the method of performing any surveillance. The operation of systems and equipment remains unchanged. Therefore, eliminating unnecessary EDG starts does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. LCR 94-13 Surveillance testing per the proposed Technical Specifications would continue to demonstrate the ability of the EDGs to perform their intended function of providing electrical power to the emergency safety systems needed to mitigate design basis transients consistent with the plant safety analyses. The margin of safety demonstrated by the plant safety analyses is therefore not affected by the proposed changes. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Pennsville Public Library, 190 S.

Thadani, Acting Public Service Electric & Gas Company, Docket Nos. 50-272 and 50-311, Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Salem County, New Jersey Date of amendment request: August 19, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed changes add a new statement (b) to Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.1.3.2.1, Rod Position Indication Systems, and reletters the existing action statement (b) to (c). The new action (b) will read: With two or more analog rod position indicators per bank inoperable, within one hour restore the inoperable rod position indicator(s) to OPERABLE status or be in Hot Standby within the next 6 hours. A maximum of one rod position indicator per bank may remain inoperable following the one hour, with Action (a) above being applicable from the original entry time into the LCO. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The request (both proposed changes) does not change any assumption or parameter assumed to function in any of the design/licensing basis analysis, and therefore the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not increased. The change, as described in section IB, [the addition of the new action statement] incorporates into the applicable LCO the action statement which is already taken under technical specification 3.0.3, and does not alter the operator response or response time. 2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not introduce any design or physical configuration changes to the facility which could create new accident scenarios. 3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As stated in response to question number 1 above, the change does not change any assumption or parameter assumed to function in any of the design/licensing basis analysis. No changes to the operator response or operator response time is proposed, only that the response is now taken under the confines of the LCO. Therefore, there is no reduction in any margin of safety from the proposed changes. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Salem Free Public library, 112 West Broadway, Salem, New Jersey 08079 Attorney for licensee: Mark J. Wetterhahn, Esquire, Winston and Strawn, 1400 L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005-3502 NRC Project Director: Mohan C. Thadani, Acting South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, South Carolina Public Service Authority, Docket No. 50-395, Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit No. 1, Fairfield County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: July 20, 1994, as supplemented September 20, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed change would modify the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit 1, (VCSNS) Technical Specifications (TS) to allow alternative, equivalent testing of diesel fuel used in the emergency diesel generators (EDG). These alternative methods are necessary due to recent changes in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulations that are designed to limit the use of high sulfur fuels. The licensee also proposes to modify the VCSNS TS by changing the revision level of WCAP-10216-P-A, ``Relaxation of Constant Axial Offset Control - FQ Surveillance Technical Specification,'' referenced in TS 6.9.1.11. This pertains to the FQ(z) TS (TS 3.2.1 and 3.2.2) and is necessary since Westinghouse revised their methodology in determining FQ(z). Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. The change in testing methods for the EDG fuel oil has no impact on the probability or consequences of any design basis accident. These tests have been determined to be equivalent to the previously approved testing methods and are needed due to changes in the EPA's regulations regarding sulfur in motor vehicle fuels. The dye used to identify high sulfur fuels will have no adverse affect on the performance of the EDG's. The proposed testing assures a continued high level of quality of the diesel fuel received and stored on site. The change in revision level of a reference in TS section 6.9.1.11 has no impact on the probability of occurrence or consequences of any design basis accident. All design and performance criteria will continue to be met and no new single failure mechanisms will be created. The change in revision level for WCAP-10216-P-A does not involve any alterations to plant equipment or procedures which could affect any operational modes or accident precursors. This change only incorporates by reference, the methodology for determining the penalty to be used in calculating Core Operating Limits. This methodology allows the penalty to be cycle specific and is primarily affected by the core configuration. This penalty is used for normal operation and provides more conservatism to the core operation for the cycle. 2. [The proposed license amendment does not] create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The change in testing methods for the EDG fuel oil will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. These tests have been determined by the EPA and other organizations to be equivalent to the previously approved testing methods. The effect of the blue dye, used to identify high sulfur fuels, on the performance of the EDGs has been evaluated and determined to be insignificant. The testing proposed assures a continued high level of quality for the diesel fuel received and stored on site. The change of revision level of a reference in TS section 6.9.1.11 has no impact on the probability of occurrence or consequences of any design basis accident. All design and performance criteria will continue to be met and no new single failure mechanisms will be created. The change in revision level for WCAP-10216-P-A does not involve any alterations to plant equipment or procedures which could affect any operational modes or accident precursors. This change only incorporates, by reference, the methodology for determining the penalty to be used in calculating Core Operating Limits. This methodology allows the penalty to be cycle specific and is primarily affected by the core configuration. This penalty is used for normal operation and provides more conservatism to the core operation for the cycle. 3. [The proposed license amendment does not] involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The change in testing methods for the EDG fuel oil will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed testing methods have been determined to be equivalent to the previously approved testing methods. The test for sulfur assures that the sulfur content is within the allowable range for weight-percent. The test for color and clarity assures that the fuel is relatively free of water and particulate contaminants. The proposed tests provide at least an equivalent level of quality and repeatability for the fuel oil analysis, thus assuring that the margin of safety is not reduced. The change in revision level of a reference in TS section 6.9.1.11 does not change the proposed reload design or safety analysis limits for each cycle reload core. The associated change to WCAP-10216-P-A due to the revision will be specifically evaluated using approved reload design methods. The larger penalty actually provides for an increase in margin during certain burnup ranges. Since the safety analysis limits are unaffected, and the cycle specific analysis will show that the analysis limits are met, the change proposed will have no adverse impact on a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Fairfield County Library, Garden and Washington Streets, Winnsboro, South Carolina 29180 Attorney for licensee: Randolph R. Mahan, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, Post Office Box 764, Columbia, South Carolina 29218 NRC Project Director: David B. Matthews Southern California Edison Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-361 and 50-362, San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 2 and 3, San Diego County, California Date of amendment requests: July 28, 1994 Description of amendment requests: The licensee proposes revisions to Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.8.1, ``Shutdown Cooling and Coolant Circulation -- High Water Level,'' TS 3.9.8.2, ``Shutdown Cooling and Coolant Circulation -- Low Water Level,'' and their Bases to facilitate testing of low-pressure safety injection system components and permit additional flexibility in scheduling maintenance on the shutdown cooling system. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? Response: No Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) in Technical Specifications (TSs) 3.9.8.1 and 3.9.8.2 define the operability requirements for the Shutdown Cooling (SDC) system during refueling operations (Mode 6) while the water level above the top of the reactor vessel flange is at least 23 feet and less than 23 feet, respectively. The objective of these TSs is to ensure that (1) sufficient cooling is available to remove decay heat, (2) the water in the reactor vessel is maintained below 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and (3) sufficient coolant circulation is maintained in the reactor core to minimize boron stratification leading to a boron dilution incident. The proposed TS changes affect the current limits imposed while ensuring adherence to the basis of the TS. No plant modifications are being made. The reactor cavity water level limitations and SDC system required operating times are being changed based on plant specific calculations and the objectives of the TSs are being maintained. (1) reduce the water level where two trains of SDC are required from 23 feet to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, In the Bases Section 3/4.9.8, it is stated that ``With the reactor vessel head removed and 23 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange, a large heat sink is available for core cooling, thus in the event of a failure of the operating shutdown cooling train, adequate time is provided to initiate emergency procedures to cool the core.'' In the Bases for the New Standard Technical Specifications, ``NUREG 1432, Revision 0, dated September 30, 1992, Section B 3.9.4 it is stated that; ``The 23 ft level was selected because it corresponds to the 23 ft requirement established for fuel movement in LCO 3.9.6, ``Refueling Water Level.'' Southern California Edison (Edison) calculations show that there is a minimal difference in the time to boil due to the 3-foot change in required water level. Therefore, adequate water is still available to mitigate the consequences of losing SDC. (2) increase the time a required train of the SDC system may be removed from service from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period to up to 2 hours per 8-hour period, (3) allow the SDC system to be removed from service to allow testing of Low Pressure Safety Injection system components, The proposed TS changes the time the SDC train may be removed from operation from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period to up to 2 hours per 8-hour period, and allows removal of the SDC train from operation for testing of the Low Pressure Safety Injection (LPSI) system components as well as for core alterations in the vicinity of the hot legs. The proposed TS change also imposes certain restrictions to ensure operating the SDC system in accordance with this proposed TS change is of no safety significance. These restrictions are discussed separately below. When securing the only operating train of the SDC system, the maximum Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature is maintained less than or equal to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The initial conditions and heatup rate are selected such that the RCS temperature remains less than or equal to 140 degrees Fahrenheit during the test. Therefore, there is ample margin to boiling. Typical initial temperatures are less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The water being injected by the LPSI system test is cool water from the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) and will increase the available inventory providing the heat sink by several inches. The two hours is sufficient time to align the system to test, perform the test, and restore the train of SDC to operation prior to exceeding 140 degrees Fahrenheit. No operations are permitted that would cause a reduction of the RCS boron concentration. This minimizes the probability of an inadvertent boron dilution event. The use of adequately borated water for injection into the RCS during the test provides assurance that the test itself cannot lead to a boron dilution event. When the SDC system is operating, the minimum SDC flow rate of 2200 gpm imposed by TS 4.9.8.1 and TS 4.9.8.2 is sufficient to ensure complete mixing of the boron within the RCS. The LPSI component testing is only allowed when the reactor cavity water level is maintained greater than or equal to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange. This level ensures an adequate heat sink to perform the LPSI pump suction header check valve test. (4) allow for running 1 train of shutdown cooling with additional requirements when the water level is less than 20 feet but greater than 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, (5) add an action to be taken when operating 1 train of SDC with less than 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange when the specified requirements are not met, In the event of a loss of SDC, the time to boil is reduced from approximately 3.7 hours when the water level is 23 feet above the reactor vessel flange to approximately 2.3 hours at 12 feet, assuming the reactor has only been shutdown for 6 days. However, this is ample time to close containment (less than 1 hour) and to restore SDC or initiate alternative cooling (e.g., add water to the cavity (approximately 1 hour)). Twelve feet of water above the reactor vessel flange corresponds to 24 feet 8-7/8 inches above the active fuel. Requiring the reactor to be shutdown for at least 6 days to have only one train of SDC operable when the reactor cavity level is between 20 feet and 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures that the time to boil is greater than twice the time it would take us to establish containment closure and to commence reactor cavity fill with the required standby equipment. One train of SDC operating with a containment spray pump allows for the high capacity LPSI pump to be the main standby pump capable of filling the reactor cavity to at least 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange upon loss of SDC. The high pressure safety injection pump will also be maintained ready to increase the water level if needed. In support of this contingency the RWST will be required to contain the volume of water required to raise the level to 20 feet above the reactor vessel flange.... The reactor cavity can be filled at a rate of approximately 4.0 inches per minute with the LPSI pump. If operating one train of the SDC system with less than 20 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange and any of the required conditions are not met, requiring immediate action to establish greater than or equal to 20 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures no time is wasted trying to restore conditions that should be used to increase the volume of water of the heat sink. By taking action to restore the level to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange the plant will be placed in TS 3.9.8.1, which only requires one train of SDC to be operable. Additionally, the core will not heat up while the water level in the reactor cavity is being raised with cool water from the RWST. This will provide additional time to either restore the one train of SDC or take other actions to provide core cooling. A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), with (a) one train of the SDC system operable with the reactor cavity water level greater than or equal to 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, and (b) one train of the SDC system operable with the reactor cavity water level greater than or equal to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, showed that the operations in accordance with the proposed TS would not significantly increase the probabilities of inventory boiling and core damage. (6) delete the obsolete reference to the implementation of DCP 2-6863 and MMP 3-6863, This is an editorial change. (7) delete an obsolete footnote allowing removal of both trains of SDC with the water less than 23 feet above the reactor vessel flange from the Unit 3 TSs. This is an editorial change. Therefore, proposed changes 1 through 7 do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. 2. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? Response: No (1) reduce the water level where two trains of SDC are required from 23 feet to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, (2) increase the time a required train of the SDC system may be removed from service from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period to up to 2 hours per 8-hour period, (3) allow the SDC system to be removed from service to allow testing of Low Pressure Safety Injection system components, (4) allow for running 1 train of shutdown cooling with additional requirements when the water level is less than 20 feet but greater than 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, (5) add an action to be taken when operating 1 train of SDC with less than 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange when the specified requirements are not met, The Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) in Technical Specifications (TSs) 3.9.8.1 and 3.9.8.2 define the operability requirements for the SDC system during refueling operations (Mode 6) while the water level above the top of the reactor vessel flange is at least 23 feet and less than 23 feet, respectively. The objective of the proposed TS changes is to ensure that the intent of the Bases is maintained. [i.e., (1) sufficient cooling is available to remove decay heat, (2) water in the reactor vessel is maintained below 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and (3) sufficient coolant circulation is maintained in the reactor core to minimize boron stratification leading to a boron dilution incident.] The proposed TS changes affect the current limits imposed while ensuring adherence to the basis of the TS. No plant modifications are being made. The reactor cavity water level limitations and SDC system required operating times are being changed based on plant specific calculations and the objective of the TSs are being maintained. The added requirements and action statement facilitate safe operation. (6) delete the obsolete reference to the implementation of DCP 2-6863 and MMP 3-6863, and This is an editorial change. (7) delete an obsolete footnote allowing removal of both trains of SDC with the water less than 23 feet above the reactor vessel flange from the Unit 3 TSs. This is an editorial change. Therefore, the operation of the facility in accordance with proposed changes 1 through 7 does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? Response: No Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) in TSs 3.9.8.1 and 3.9.8.2 define the operability requirements for the SDC system during refueling operations (Mode 6) while the water level above the top of the reactor vessel flange is at least 23 feet and less than 23 feet, respectively. The objective of these TSs is to ensure that (1) sufficient cooling is available to remove decay heat, (2) the water in the reactor vessel is maintained below 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and (3) sufficient coolant circulation is maintained in the reactor core to minimize boron stratification leading to a boron dilution incident. (1) reduce the water level where two trains of SDC are required from 23 feet to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, In the Bases Section 3/4.9.8, it is stated that ``With the reactor vessel head removed and 23 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange, a large heat sink is available for core cooling, thus in the event of a failure of the operating shutdown cooling train, adequate time is provided to initiate emergency procedures to cool the core.'' In the Bases for the New Standard Technical Specifications, ``NUREG 1432, Revision 0, dated September 30, 1992, Section B 3.9.4 it is stated that: ``The 23 ft level was selected because it corresponds to the 23 ft requirement established for fuel movement in LCO 3.9.6, ``Refueling Water Level.'' Edison calculations show that there is a minimal difference in the time to boil due to the 3-foot change in required water level. Therefore, the margin of safety has not been significantly reduced. (2) increase the time a required train of the SDC system may be removed from service from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period to up to 2 hours per 8-hour period, (3) allow the SDC system to be removed from service to allow testing of Low Pressure Safety Injection system components, The proposed TS changes the time the SDC train may be removed from operation from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period to up to 2 hours per 8-hour period, and allows removal of the SDC train from operation for testing of the LPSI system components as well as for core alterations in the vicinity of the hot legs. The proposed TS change also imposes certain restrictions to ensure operating the SDC system in accordance with this proposed TS change is of no safety significance. These restrictions are discussed separately below. When securing the only operating train of the SDC system, the maximum RCS temperature is maintained less than or equal to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The initial conditions and heatup rate are selected such that RCS temperature remains less than or equal to 140 degrees Fahrenheit during the test. Therefore, there is ample margin to boiling. Typical initial temperatures are less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The water being injected by the LPSI system test is cool water from the RWST and will increase the available inventory providing the heat sink by several inches. The two hours is sufficient time to align the system to test, perform the test, and restore the train of SDC to operation prior to exceeding 140 degrees Fahrenheit. No operations are permitted that would cause a reduction of the RCS boron concentration. This minimizes the probability of an inadvertent boron dilution event. The use of adequately borated water for injection into the RCS during the test provides assurance that the test itself cannot lead to a boron dilution event. When the SDC system is operating, the minimum SDC flow rate of 2200 gpm is sufficient to ensure complete mixing of the boron within the RCS. The LPSI component testing is only allowed when the reactor cavity water level is maintained greater than or equal to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange. This level ensures an adequate heat sink to perform the LPSI pump suction header check valve test. The added requirements and the nature of the test provide assurances that the water temperature will be maintained less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit and that boron stratification is prevented. (4) allow for running 1 train of shutdown cooling with additional requirements when the water level is less than 20 feet but greater than 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, (5) add an action to be taken when operating 1 train of SDC with less than 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange when the specified requirements are not met, In the event of a loss of SDC, the time to boil is reduced from approximately 3.7 hours at 23 feet to approximately 2.3 hours at 12 feet, when the reactor has only been shutdown for 6 days. However, this is ample time to close containment (less than 1 hour), and to restore SDC or initiate alternative cooling (e.g., add water to the cavity (approximately 1 hour)). Requiring the reactor to be shutdown for at least 6 days to have only one train of SDC operable when the reactor cavity level is between 20 feet and 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures that the time to boil is greater than twice the time it would take us to establish containment closure and to commence reactor cavity fill with the required standby equipment. One train of SDC operating with a containment spray pump allows for the high capacity LPSI pump to be the main standby pump capable of filling the reactor cavity to at least 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange upon loss of SDC. The high pressure safety injection pump will also be maintained ready to increase the water level if needed. In support of this contingency the RWST will be required to contain the volume of water required to raise the level to 20 feet above the reactor vessel flange. The reactor cavity can be filled at a rate of approximately 4.0 inches per minute with the LPSI pump. If operating one train of the SDC system with less than 20 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange and any of the required conditions are not met, requiring immediate action to establish greater than or equal to 20 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures no time is wasted trying to restore conditions that should be used to increase the volume of water of the heat sink. By taking action to restore the level to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange the plant will be placed in TS 3.9.8.1, which only requires one train of SDC to be operable. Additionally, the core will not heat up while the reactor cavity water level is being raised with cool water from the RWST. This will provide additional time to either restore the one train of SDC or take other actions to provide core cooling. A PRA showed that the operations in accordance with the proposed TS did not significantly increase the probabilities of inventory boiling and core damage. (6) delete the obsolete reference to the implementation of DCP 2-6863 and MMP 3-6863, This is an editorial change. (7) delete an obsolete footnote allowing removal of both trains of SDC with the water less than 23 feet above the reactor vessel flange from the Unit 3 TSs. This is an editorial change. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with proposed changes 1 through 7 do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.

Beoletto, Esquire, Southern California Edison Company, P. O. Box 800, Rosemead, California 91770 NRC Project Director: Theodore R. Quay Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket Nos. 50-327 and 50-328, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, Hamilton County, Tennessee Date of amendment request: September 9, 1994 (TS 94-04) Description of amendment request: The proposed change would revise specifications associated with the cold leg accumulators (CLAs). Specifically, the proposed amendment would: (1) remove a footnote from Specification 3.5.1.1.c that applied to Unit 2 Cycle 6 operation only; (2) add a requirement to Specification 3.5.1.1 that power be removed from the CLA isolation valve when the reactor coolant system pressure is above 2000 psig; (3) modify Specification 3.5.1.1 Action Statement a. to indicate that with a CLA inoperable for reasons other than the boron concentration not being within limits, the CLA must be returned to operable status within 1 hour or the plant placed in the hot standby condition, and the pressurizer pressure reduced to 1000 psig or less within the next 6 hours; (4) modify Specification 3.5.1.1 Action Statement b. to indicate that with a CLA inoperable because the boron concentration is not within limits, the boron concentration must be restored to within limits within 72 hours or the plant placed in the hot standby condition within the next 6 hours and the pressurizer pressure reduced to 1000 psig or less within the next 6 hours; (5) remove the wording from Specification 4.5.1.1.1.a.1 for using the absence of alarms or level measurement as the technique used to verify CLA volume and pressure; (6) add the requirement to Specification 4.5.1.1.1.a.2 to verify that the CLA isolation valve is ``fully open'' rather than ``open;'' (7) modify Specification 4.5.1.1.1.b to show that verification of boron concentration is not required for additions from the refueling water storage tank, and add a footnote to indicate that the verification is required only if the affected accumulator experienced a volume increase; (8) modify Specification 4.5.1.1.1.c to show that the test is satisfied by verifying that power is removed from the isolation valve, not that the valve operator is disconnected by removal of the breaker from the circuit; (9) delete Specification 4.5.1.1.1.d to verify that each CLA isolation valve opens automatically when reactor coolant pressure exceeds the P-11 setpoint, and upon receipt of a safety injection signal; (10) delete Specification 4.5.1.1.2 to verify the accumulator water level and pressure channels operable by performing Channel Functional and Calibration tests, and delete the related footnote; (11) change ``tanks'' to ``each cold leg injection accumulator;'' and (12) revise the associated Bases where necessary to reflect these changes. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to TS 3.5.1.1 implement revised action times for cold leg injection accumulator (CLA) inoperability. Several other clarifications and enhancements have been incorporated to provide consistency with the latest version of standard TSs (NUREG-1431). The new action times provide a prompt one-hour action to initiate unit shutdown for conditions that could prevent the injection of a CLA into the core. For boron concentration outside limits, a 72-hour action to restore CLA concentration is allowed because the CLA can still perform the core injection safety function. The removal of surveillance requirements (SRs) for verifying automatic opening features for the CLA isolation valves does not impact the required TS alignment that is assumed in the safety analysis. The instrumentation calibration and functional test SRs have also been removed based on the instrumentation only providing CLA level and pressure indications for TS compliance and not performing an accident mitigation function. The above changes do not alter the required limits for CLA operability or system configurations. These changes are consistent with NUREG-1431 and provide acceptable flexability[sic] for CLA operability verification and surveillance testing and reasonable actions for CLA inoperability. Since no changes have been proposed that would change the conditions assumed for the CLAs in the accident analysis, the consequences of an accident will not be increased. The CLAs perform accident mitigation functions and are not considered to be the source of an accident. Therefore, since the plant configurations and functions are unchanged by the proposed changes, the probability of an accident will not be increased. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed changes clarify existing CLA operability requirements, modify action times for CLA inoperability, enhance and simplify SRs, and remove surveillances that are not required to verify the CLA's ability to perform safety functions. None of these changes affect the operation of the plant or the CLA configuration and accident mitigation capabilities. Therefore, since the CLAs will continue to support the plant as before, these proposed changes will not create a new or different kind of accident. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The CLA requirements for volume, pressure, boron, and isolation valve position are not changed by the proposed request. The CLAs will continue to provide the same safety function capabilities as assumed in the safety analysis. Therefore, no reduction in the margin of safety will result from these chanes because CLA functions are unchanged. The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Hebdon Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket Nos. 50-327 and 50-328, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, Hamilton County, Tennessee Date of amendment request: September 9, 1994 (TS 94-08) Description of amendment request: The proposed change would add ``main steam vaults'' to the footnote of Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.1. This would allow inspection of the valves, blind flanges, and deactivated automatic valves located in the vaults that are required to be in the closed position during accident conditions and that are locked, sealed, or otherwise secured in the closed position, on a cold shutdown frequency rather than every 31 days. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determine that it does not represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.93(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change will exempt containment isolation valves in the east and west main steam valve vaults from examination every thirty one days if those valves are locked, sealed or otherwise secured. The valves and flanges that are located inside the main steam valve vaults and are required to be closed during accident conditions, will be verified in their required position during cold shutdown and will be secured in this position. The environmental conditions in these areas ensure they will be low traffic areas where the probability of misalignment or manipulation is remote. Loss of containment integrity is not considered to be an initiator of any accident. This change does not affect any accident analysis assumptions or results for SQN. Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, as a result of this change. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. This revision will not change any plant equipment, system configurations, or accident assumptions. The appropriate components in the valve vaults will continue to be verified in the closed position and locked, sealed, or otherwise secured. The physical congestion and high temperatures in the area will be effective in maintaining this as a low traffic area that will contribute to the low probability of misalignment or manipulation of these components between inspections. Therefore, this change will not affect the safety function of these components and will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change is consistent with current SQN accident analysis assumptions since only the time interval between performances of the surveillance is being extended. This change will not impact any margin of safety. The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402 Attorney for licensee: General Counsel, Tennessee Valley Authority, 400 West Summit Hill Drive, ET 11H, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902 NRC Project Director: Frederick J. Hebdon Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-280 and 50-281, Surry Power Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Surry County, Virginia Date of amendment request: July 14, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications would remove the remaining references to cycle-specific parameters in Technical Specification 3.12.A.2 and associated Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A and 1B. These figures and the control bank insertion limits are presently specified in the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). The NRC-approved methodologies presently listed in the Technical Specifications are used to calculate and evaluate the parameter limits presented in the COLR for each reload core. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Specifically, operation of Surry Power Station in accordance with the Technical Specification changes will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The removal of the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A and 1B, from the Surry Technical Specifications has no influence or impact on the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment is administrative in nature in that it corrects omissions from a previously approved amendment. This change has no impact on actions to be taken when or if limits are exceeded as is required by the current Technical Specifications. Each accident analysis addressed in the Surry UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] will be examined with respect to changes in cycle-dependent parameters, which are determined by application of NRC-approved reload design methodologies. The impact of these parameter changes on transient results is then evaluated to ensure that the results remain bounded by respective transient analysis acceptance criteria. This examination, which is performed per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, ensures that future reloads will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The removal of the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A and 1B has no influence or impact, nor does it contribute in any way to the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operating characteristic will be altered as a result of the proposed changes. This cycle-specific variable (control bank insertion limits) is calculated using NRC approved methods, and the results are submitted to the NRC for information in accordance with Technical Specification 6.2. The Technical Specifications will continue to require operation within the required core operating limits, and appropriate actions will be taken when or if any of these limits are exceeded. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not in any way create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety is not affected by this administrative change which removes the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A and 1B from the Technical Specifications. The margin of safety presently provided by current Technical Specifications remains unchanged. Appropriate measures exist to control the values of these cycle-specific limits. The proposed amendment continues to require operation within the core limits which were developed from the NRC-approved reload design methodologies. Further, the actions to be taken when or if limits are violated remain unchanged. Development of limits for future reloads will continue to conform to those methods described in NRC-approved documentation. In addition, each reload requires a 10 CFR 50.59 safety review to assure that operation of the unit within the cycle-specific limits will not involve a reduction in any margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not impact the operation of Surry in a manner that involves a reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Maupin, Esq., Hunton and Williams, Riverfront Plaza, East Tower, 951 E. Byrd Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219. NRC Project Director: Victor M. McCree (Acting) Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-280, 50-281, 50-338, 50-339, Surry Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2 Surry County, Virginia and North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2, Louisa County, Virginia Date of amendment request: September 6, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed changes would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for Surry 1&2 and North Anna 1&2. Specifically, the proposed changes would revise the: (1) Management Safety Review Committee (MSRC) review responsibilities regarding safety evaluations and Station Nuclear Safety and Operating Committee (SNSOC) meeting minutes and reports, and (2) SNSOC review responsibilities for procedure changes. However, the changes now also state that the MSRC will review safety evaluations, and the SNSOC will review procedure changes, as programmatically discussed in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The licensee's proposed changes revise and supersede the licensee's original proposed changes dated December 27, 1993 and noticed in the Federal Register on February 16, 1994, (59 FR 7700) for NA-1&2, and March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12371) for Surry 1 & 2. The North Anna and Surry Power Station Technical Specifications presently address the organization and responsibilities of both the onsite and offsite review groups, the SNSOC and the MSRC, respectively. The responsibilities of the SNSOC include the review of new procedures and changes to procedures that affect nuclear safety. The MSRC review responsibilities include the review of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports. It is proposed that the extent of these review activities be revised in the Technical Specifications to ensure the two review groups are focusing on nuclear safety issues and not spending an unnecessary amount of time on administrative activities of minimal safety significance. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: [Specifically, operation in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes] will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. As administrative changes, the proposed Technical Specifications changes have no direct or indirect effect on accident precursors. No plant modifications are being implemented and operation of the plant is unchanged. SNSOC review of new procedures and procedure changes that require a safety evaluation ensures that activities that could affect nuclear safety are being properly reviewed. The MSRC's overview of representative samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports based on performance ensures these programs are being properly implemented and nuclear safety is not being compromised; or 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated since physical modifications are not involved and systems and components will be operated as before the change. The proposed changes are wholly administrative in nature and have no impact on plant operations or accident considerations. These changes modify the scope of SNSOC review of procedure changes and MSRC's review functions concerning safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports. Procedure changes will continue to receive management review in accordance with administrative procedures, however, only changes that require a safety evaluation will require SNSOC approval. MSRC review of representatives samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports based on performance will continue to provide adequate assurance that nuclear safety is being properly considered; or 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as defined in the basis of any Technical Specification since the responsibilities of the SNSOC and MSRC are not addressed by the existing Technical Specification Bases, nor are review requirements for procedures. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on, nor were they considered in, existing UFSAR accident analyses. Safety significant procedure changes, i.e., changes that require a safety evaluation to be prepared, will continue to be reviewed by SNSOC, as will new procedures. Procedure changes still require cognizant management approval and preparation of an activity screening to determine whether or not the change impacts nuclear safety. This ensures activities important to nuclear safety are being appropriately reviewed. The effectiveness of the safety evaluation program, and the thoroughness of SNSOC meetings and reports will be assured through the MSRC's plant overview function which is based on observed performance. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

NRC Project Director: Victor McCree, Acting Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: August 24, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) 3.1.b.1 and Figure TS 3.1-4 regarding Low Temperature Overpressure (LTOP) protection for the reactor coolant pressure boundary. Currently, the TS specify the LTOP requirements through the end of operating cycle 20 or 17.14 effective full power years. The proposed change extends the LTOP requirements through the end of operating cycle 21 or 18.40 effective full power years. The Basis Section would also be modified to reflect these changes. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed change will not: 1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The use of RG 1.99, Revision 2, Regulatory Position C.2 does not modify the reactor coolant system pressure boundary, nor make any physical changes to the facility design, material, construction standards, or setpoints. The probability of a LTOP event occurring is independent of the pressure temperature limits for the RCS pressure boundary. Therefore, the probability of a LTOP event occurring remains unchanged. The use of predicted fluence values through the end of operating cycle 21 is appropriately considered within the calculations in accordance with standard industry methodology previously docketed under WCAP 13227. Revised flux values were used for Cycles 16, 17, 18 and 19 based on actual core reload designs. Previous cycles flux values are the same as reported in WCAP 12333. The calculation of pressure temperature limits in accordance with approved regulatory methods provides assurance that reactor pressure vessel fracture toughness requirements are met and the integrity of the RCS pressure boundary is maintained. Similar methodology was used in calculations to support approved amendment 108 to the Kewaunee Technical Specifications dated April 7, 1994. The use of Regulatory Position C.2 and fluence values through EOC 21 meet previously established criteria for protection of the health and safety of the public. The consequences of a LTOP transient therefore, remain unchanged. 2) create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from an accident previously evaluated. The use of Regulatory Position C.2 and fluence through EOC 21 does not modify the reactor coolant system pressure boundary, nor make any physical changes to the LTOP setpoint or system design. Therefore, no new failure mechanisms are created that could create the possibility of an accident of a new or different type. 3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The Appendix G pressure temperature limitations are calculated in accordance with regulatory requirements and calculational limitations specified in RG 1.99, Revision 2. RG 1.99, Revision 2, is an acceptable method for implementing the requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendices G and H. Similar methodology was used in calculations to support approved amendment 108 dated April 7, 1994. The reactor coolant pump starting restrictions of TS 3.1.a.1.c remain in place. The revised calculations meet the NRC acceptance criteria for the LTOP setpoint and system design as described in NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER) dated September 6, 1985 which concluded that ``the spectrum of postulated pressure transients would be mitigated...such that the temperature pressure limits of Appendix G to 10 CFR 50 are maintained.'' The use of Regulatory Position C.2, meets previously established criteria for the pressure temperature limits for the LTOP system and setpoint. Thus, the margin of safety as described in the NRC SER is not reduced. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Jackson, Esq., Foley and Lardner, P. O. Box 1497, Madison, Wisconsin 53701-1497. NRC Project Director: John N. Hannon Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: September 7, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications (TS) by adding two new sections, TS Section 3.0 and TS Section 4.0, with associated bases. TS Section 3.0 would establish the general requirements applicable to each of the Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) within Section 3 of the KNPP TS. TS Section 4.0 would establish the general requirements applicable to Surveillance Requirements. The new requirements of TS 4.0.b would also affect TS Sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and Tables TS 4.1-2 and 4.1-3. The proposed TS amendment incorporates guidance statements similar to Section 3.0/4.0 of NUREG-0452, ``Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse Pressurized Water Reactors.'' Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed changes will not: 1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The likelihood that an accident will occur is neither increased or decreased by these TS changes. These TS changes will not impact the function or method of operation of plant equipment. Thus, there is not a significant increase in the probability of a previously analyzed accident due to these changes. No systems, equipment, or components are affected by the proposed changes. Thus, the consequences of the malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) are not increased by these changes. The proposed changes have no impact on accident initiators or plant equipment, and thus, do not affect the probabilities or consequences of an accident. These changes are consistent with the requirements established in the Westinghouse STS. Therefore, the proposed changes will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve changes to the physical plant or operations. Since these changes do not contribute to accident initiation, they do not produce a new accident scenario or produce a new type of equipment malfunction. Also, these changes do not alter any existing accident scenarios; they do not affect equipment or its operation, and thus, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes do not affect plant equipment or operation. Safety limits and limiting safety system settings are not affected by these proposed changes. These changes are consistent with the Westinghouse STS. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances) During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a Federal Register notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee has been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to (Project Director) : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
