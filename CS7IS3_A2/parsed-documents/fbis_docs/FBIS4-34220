At the end of the meeting in Cartagena de Indias, the Latin American presidents endorsed a proposal to appoint Salinas as head of the World Trade Directorate, which will replace GATT next year. Ibero-America is not free from risk. In the presence of Ibero-American heads of state and government, Salinas warned that industrialized countries want to impose social dumping on developing countries. [Begin Salinas recording] They want to blame us for selling at lower prices and failing to adhere to environmental protection and labor standards. [end recording] Salinas said that trade and investment provide the only means to meet the region's urgent need for growth. His participation in promoting the Cartagena Summit was acknowledged. In this framework, Argentina proposed Salinas to head the World Trade Directorate, which will replace GATT next year. The proposal was accepted by the rest of the Latin American countries. [Begin Salinas recording] The organization is in a stage of formation and is expected to become fully operational only next year. For this reason, I affirm that I am fully devoted to my duty to serve the Mexican people, and I will continue to do so until 30 November 1994. [end recording] Salinas described as encouraging the outcome of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Regarding the controversy on Cuba, which was urged to move toward democracy, Salinas said this. [Begin Salinas recording] When the Ibero-American Summit was promoted, it was never expected that there would be a consensus among those attending the meeting. Instead, the idea was that, within the framework of the plurality that marks us, we would be able to agree on similar purposes and goals. [end recording] The summit has come to an end. The Ibero-American countries know that they must be integrated into subregional markets, otherwise the world trade changes will carry them away.
