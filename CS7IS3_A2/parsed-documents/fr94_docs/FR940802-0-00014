ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: In Federal Register , 59 FR 32649, published June 24, 1994, OSHA amended Subpart C, South Carolina, and Subpart I, North Carolina, of 29 CFR Part 1952 to reflect the Assistant Secretary's approval of South Carolina's ``Palmetto'' Star and North Carolina's ``Carolina'' Star Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP). For South Carolina, in designating §1952.97, ``Changes to approved plans''; and for North Carolina, in designating §1952.157, ``Changes to approved plan'', the designations inadvertently duplicated sections already codified under their respective Subparts. This notice will correct those errors. For the purpose of clarity, the full text of the codification sections for Subpart C_South Carolina, §1952.97, ``Changes to approved plan'' and Subpart I_North Carolina, §1952.157, ``Changes to approved plan'', are contained in this notice. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 26, 1994.

Signed at Washington, D.C. this 26th day of July, 1994. Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary of Labor. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, the rule document (FR Doc. 94&hyph;15346) beginning on page 32649 in the issue of Friday, June 14, 1994, amending 29 CFR Part 1952 is hereby corrected as follows: PART 1952_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for Part 1952 continues to read as follows: Authority: Sec. 18, 84 Stat. 1608 (29 U.S.C. 657); 29 CFR part 1902, Secretary of Labor's Order No. 1&hyph;90 (55 FR 9033). 2. On page 32650, in the second column, §1952.97 is corrected to read as follows: §1952.97 Changes to approved plan. (a) Legislation. (1) On March 29, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved South Carolina's revised statutory penalty levels which are the same as the revised Federal penalty levels contained in section 17 of the Act as amended on November 5, 1990. (b) The Voluntary Protection Program. On June 24, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved South Carolina's plan supplement, which is generally identical to the Federal STAR Voluntary Protection Program. South Carolina's ``Palmetto'' VPP is limited to the STAR Program in general industry, excludes the MERIT AND DEMONSTRATION Programs and excludes the construction industry. Also, injury rates must be at or below 50 percent of the State industry average rather than the National industry average. 3. On page 32650, in the third column, §1952.157 is corrected to read as follows: §1952.157 Changes to approved plan. (a) Legislation. (1) On March 29, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved North Carolina's revised statutory penalty levels which are the same as the revised Federal penalty levels contained in section 17 of the Act as amended on November 5, 1990. (b) The Voluntary Protection Program. On June 24, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved North Carolina's plan supplement, which is generally identical to the Federal STAR Voluntary Protection Program. North Carolina's ``Carolina'' VVP is limited to the STAR Program, and excludes the MERIT and DEMONSTRATION Programs. Also, injury rates must be at or below 50 percent of the State injury average rather than the National injury average.
