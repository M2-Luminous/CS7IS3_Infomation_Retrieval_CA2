They discussed the DPRK's suspected development of nuclear arms, and agreed that this problem should be resolved through dialogue. This is the first time Japanese and Russian defense officials have shared a common view on the North Korean issue. Sato also suggested a visit to Moscow by Naoaki Murata, director general of the DA Defense Policy Bureau, in 1994. Lukyanov agreed in principle. Exchanges between the two countries on defense matters started two years ago at the councilor level. [If Murata's visit materializes,] this will be the first exchange at the bureau director general level.
