The Guayaquil daily EL UNIVERSO reports that out of 600 persons polled 63 percent said they agree with holding a referendum, while 37 percent said they are opposed to it. EL UNIVERSO adds that 66 percent do not know what the questions of the referendum are, while 34 percent do know what they are. Other questions asked were whether congress should be a single chamber as it has been up to now or whether there should be two chambers. Another question was on the issue of double nationality for emigrants who have acquired another citizenship. Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced that on 1 May there will be a referendum on eight questions that refer to elections, duration of deputies' terms, reelection for presidential and other public offices, and parliamentary control over state funds. The referendum has been criticized by the majority of Ecuadoran political sectors, who say that it is unconstitutional and irrelevant. However, the poll discloses that the majority of people support the referendum. The same poll states that 33 percent of people feel that the questions are very important; 34 percent say they are quite important; 27 percent describe the questions as not very important; while only 6 percent believe they are not important at all.
