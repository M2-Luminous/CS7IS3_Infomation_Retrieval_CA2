The attacks are focused on the area between the Krivaja river and the southwestern part of the Ozren-Vozuca front where, with strong artillery and tank support, the Muslim forces are launching infantry attacks and using terrorist-sabotage groups in attempts to break through Serb lines and destroy all Serb villages. This is why a mass exodus of the Serb population has begun. According to the statement, the Muslims are also attacking Serb defense lines in Vozuca from the direction of Banovici, Lukavac, Zivinice, and Tuzla. According to the statement, it is becoming more obvious that the UN Protection Force has been offering logistical and fire support in the area between Ribnica and Vijenac. A mass exodus of the population has also begun from this area after many civilians, mostly children and women, were killed in Muslim artillery attacks on their villages. [passage omitted]
