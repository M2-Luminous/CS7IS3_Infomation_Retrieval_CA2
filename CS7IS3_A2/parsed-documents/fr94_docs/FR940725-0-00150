FR940725-0-00150 FR940725-0-00019 (5) Ability to perform all required tests and inspections required of competent persons by Subpart B, and (6) Ability to inspect, test, and evaluate spaces to determine the need for further testing by a Marine Chemist or a Certified Industrial Hygienist. These skills and this knowledge provide the competent person the ability to perform the initial tests and inspections necessary to determine whether or not a space contains hazardous quantities of toxic substances, as required by final §1915.12(c)(1). Once the space has been determined to contain hazardous quantities of toxic substances, it is then the employer's responsibility to make the space safe for entry through ventilation under final §1915.12(c)(2). If the space cannot be made safe for entry through the use of ventilation, OSHA believes that it is necessary to require a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist to develop and implement appropriate control measures to protect employees from the hazards involved. On the basis of the record, OSHA has concluded that these two groups of persons are the only ones capable of establishing appropriate control measures to protect shipyard employees under these circumstances. Considering the complexity of the hazards involved and the protective techniques that need to be applied, the Agency believes that other, less qualified, individuals cannot be relied on to take all the steps necessary to protect employees fully. Paragraph (c)(2) of final §1915.12 requires spaces containing a concentration of any substance exceeding its permissible exposure limit (PEL) or, if the substance has no PEL, its IDLH value, to be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers''. Ventilation must then be provided to ensure that air concentrations of these substances are maintained within their PELs or below their IDLH values. After the ventilation renders the atmosphere safe for entry, paragraph (c)(2) permits the signs to be removed. The previous §1915.12(b)(2) requires spaces to be ventilated if they contain a substance in concentrations above a level that is IDLH. The ventilation is required to bring the concentration below that level. The NPRM proposed to continue these previous requirements in §1915.12(c)(4). Requirements for labeling spaces containing concentrations of toxic substances above their PELs were proposed in §1915.12(c)(6). The previous standard contains no labeling requirement. OSHA received no objection to the proposed labeling requirement, and it has been incorporated into the final rule. The final rule, unlike the previous standard, permits competent persons to test and inspect confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres for the presence of toxic substances. The previous standard requires these tests and inspections to be performed by a Marine Chemist or by an industrial hygienist. Entry into a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere for the performance of work is permissible only as long as concentrations of toxic materials are maintained below their PELs. As noted earlier, OSHA has concluded that a competent person is capable of testing and inspecting spaces for hazards related to the toxicity of various chemicals. Thus, the competent person can make a determination based on these observations and tests that a space is or is not safe for entry. If ventilation is necessary, the competent person can make this threshold determination, as well. However, the competent person is not normally capable of developing the specific control measures necessary to protect employees from exposure to any substance above its PEL. If a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere exposes an employee to a substance at concentrations above the permissible exposure limit, a Marine Chemist or a Certified Industrial Hygienist is required to establish the procedures to be used to protect employees. The final rule makes this concept mandatory. For spaces in which ventilation cannot maintain an acceptable atmosphere, paragraph (c)(3) of final §1915.12 requires a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist to retest the space until it can be certified as ``Enter with Restrictions'' or ``Safe for Workers.'' The previous standard, under §1915.12(b)(3), requires employers to comply with the respiratory protection requirements of Subpart I whenever concentrations of toxic substances are above their PELs but below IDLH levels. The NPRM proposed to continue this requirement in §1915.12(c)(5). However, OSHA believes, as noted in the summary and explanation of final §1915.11(a), that employees should not enter, on a routine basis, any confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere containing a serious hazard. Atmospheres containing concentrations of toxic substances above their permissible exposure limits can pose serious hazards, especially to employees working in the exposure area for extended periods of time. As noted earlier, many of the rulemaking participants asserted that shipyard employees are better protected by industry practice, under which routine entry is permitted only if the space involved is certified safe for workers, than by the general industry permit space standard. OSHA agrees that the shipyard approach provides safety for employees, and is codifying that practice in final §1915.12(c)(3) and (c)(4) (discussed next). Paragraph (c)(4) of final §1915.12 prohibits entry into spaces that are ``Not Safe for Workers'' (under paragraph (c)(1)), except for emergency rescue or for a short duration for the installation of ventilation equipment provided that:
