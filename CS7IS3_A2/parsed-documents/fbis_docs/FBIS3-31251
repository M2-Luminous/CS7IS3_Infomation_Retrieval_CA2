"Although we are going through a difficult time, we are still optimistic to a certain degree and we believe that the worst will be avoided. That would be useful not only for the Balkans but also for the whole of Europe," Papoulias said. Describing his talks with President of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic as "cordial, as usual," Papoulias stressed that at this moment in time it is extremely important to direct all efforts toward finding a peaceful solution to the Bosnian conflict, and also underlined that it is important that all the key players accept the EU's peace plan. Reminding journalists that Greece has reservations as regards the latest NATO decision on the ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, Papoulias said -- stressing that he is speaking about this as the Greek foreign minister, not as the EU chairman -- that Greece has reservations essentially because it does not believe that actions such as air attacks could contribute toward achieving peace in Bosnia. "We insist on the resumption of negotiations, that is, on finding a solution to the Bosnian conflict through negotiation," Papoulias said, emphasizing that the NATO decision on air strikes was made against the wishes of the Greek Government. Replying to numerous questions which exclusively referred to the NATO threat against the Bosnian Serbs, the Greek foreign minister said that, according to the latest information, the process of withdrawing heavy weapons from the positions around Sarajevo in under way, which is cause for hope, and that he sees no reason for additional pressure on the Serbs. "I believe, however, that the withdrawal of heavy weapons is not an obligation for the Bosnian Serbs alone. The same should be done by Bosnian Muslims," Papoulias said, adding: "Greek policy is well known -- all the warring sides in Bosnia must make the same concessions in order to restore peace and maintain the EU peace initiative. As a country that holds the EU presidency, Greece insists on this." What will Athens do if, nevertheless, air strikes take place? "We are doing everything in our power to avoid the spread of the war, because there is a real danger of the Bosnian crisis spreading south. Should that happen, it would mean a dramatic escalation of the conflict which would no longer be limited to the Balkans but would also be a European conflict, given the fact that nobody in that case could rule out the possibility of the involvement of third parties." As EU president, is Greece is able to convene an urgent session of the EU ministers before the NATO ultimatum expires? "Yes, this possibility exists and we are examining it," Papoulias briefly replied without going into details. At the end of his news conference, the Greek foreign minister confirmed that the Belgian, German, and Greek foreign ministers will meet in Athens tomorrow and that Andrey Kozyrev will be joining them. "This is the usual practice of the EU troika (the former, present and the future president), and dialogue with Russia fits into this. However, one of the issues to which we will devote attention will be the crisis in former Yugoslavia," Karolos Papoulias said.
