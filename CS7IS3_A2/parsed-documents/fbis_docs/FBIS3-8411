Kovac appeared in parliament today with a report on the state of the Slovak Republic. "I had and still have nothing against the (ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia of which Meciar is chairman) HZDS and the government, but I have serious reservations about the way Mr. Meciar governs the country and the practices which create an atmosphere of confrontation in political life," Kovac said. He stated that at HZDS meetings he was regularly accused of "banding together" with the opposition and Hungarians, and of "being bribed" by foreign countries. The end of Kovac's address seemed to be a defence of his performance as president and an extraordinarily strong criticism of the premier's methods of ruling. However, Kovac did not call on the parliament, in which the government has lost its majority, to dismiss the premier, nor did he urge the premier himself to resign. He said that an end should be put to denouncing people, and called for political, national and civic conciliation. The premier was not present in parliament when Kovac was speaking. Kovac assured deputies he would never commit treason "even if he had to drain the cup of bitterness to the dregs." Observers believe the president's speech could influence talks between Meciar's HZDS and the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the strongest opposition party, on the government's stability, the term of early elections, if they take place, and the possibility of expanding the government coalition (now formed by the HZDS and the Slovak National Party -- SNS).
