A. Gudayev, E. E. Paul; UDC 621.315.592] [Abstract] Experiments performed with PbS samples for finding the parameters which determine the motion parameters and recombination of the carriers, as well as the value of the PbS photosensitive layers as a function of temperature, demonstrated that the behavior of the photoconductivity temperature curves in the low temperature region is determined by the mobility temperature of the charge carriers, and in the high temperature region is determined by exponential dependence on the life-time temperature of nonequilibrium carriers. Depending on the technology of the substrate preparation before the photosensitive layers are deposited, the surface condition at the interface between the film and the substrate can play a role in the recombination process. If the surface recombination is increased, the life-time of the nonequilibrium carriers and the mobility is decreased, and the temperature dependence of the photoconductivity is changed.
