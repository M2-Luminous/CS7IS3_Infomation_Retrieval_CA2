FBIS4-5871 "dreas073_a_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-073 Daily Report 15 April 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Roundtable Discussion on World Patent System Roundtable Discussion on World Patent System 942A0081A Tokyo TSUSAN JANARU in Japanese Feb 94 pp 20-25 942A0081A Tokyo TSUSAN JANARU Japanese CSO [Roundtable Discussion with Takuma Yamamoto, board of directors chairman, Fujitsu; Yoshimasa Ito, president, director Koden Seisakusho; Kenji Naemura, professor, Keio University; Wataru Aso, director general, Japan Patent Office; place and date not given: "For Implementation of Globally Sustainable Patent System"] [Text] Increasing Number of Intellectual Property Disputes [Wataru Aso] These days the number of international patent disputes or, more generally, the number of international intellectual property disputes is increasing. Domestic patent disputes are also on the rise. Furthermore, huge sums are being awarded these days for patent infringements. I'd like to start by getting a clear picture of the situation and your views on what's happening. First, I would like to start with Mr. Yamamoto, who is one of our leading industrialists. [Takuma Yamamoto] Patent and copyright disputes having to do with software started increasing in the second half of the 1980's when the United States first adopted policies to protect intellectual property--in other words, when it started taking a pro-patent stance. As indicated by Mr. Aso, the settlements have been fairly large. At one time, large corporations in the United States took a relatively generous position on patent questions. Recently that hasn't been the case. The United States is a society of lawyers, and although I don't have any evidence to support my suspicions, it seems they tend to stir things up among smaller and midsized businesses, giving rise to frequent litigation. Even setting aside Fujitsu's case, I think we'll find examples where a broad interpretation is being given to patents. It's not a matter of simply being "pro-patent" or not. It's a problem of interpretation: something which the Japanese might not think is in violation of a patent will be interpreted in the United States quite differently. Another problem, which will probably be discussed later, clearly has to do with the patent system in the United States--with so-called "submarine patents" that one day seem to surface out of the blue. [Aso] Mr. Ito's company [Koden Seisakusho] has trading partners all over the world. Are you encountering problems with regard to patents or intellectual property rights? [Yoshimasa Ito] Well, I don't think that we're in violation of any patents, but when it comes to talk about triple indemnity awards and parity, those stories in themselves are enough to make me want to give up on the idea of going to the United States. Actually, those worries occupy a foremost place in our work. In the case of the United States, there were a lot of times, particularly in the case of patents, when I thought that certain situations wouldn't go well even if they were put in the hands of a professional. As Mr. Yamamoto was saying, the United States is a litigious society, and in a sense, a part of its culture, which emphasizes on individualism, has taken a strange turn. I think one can say without exaggerating that there is a side to the current U.S. pro-patent system that makes it easy to turn patent problems into disputes, which can be considered to be even immoral. Certainly that has affected us psychologically to a very great extent. Japan's Role With Regard to Developing Countries [Aso] Professor Naemura, what do you think of this situation? [Kenji Naemura] Technology leads economies, and at a time when economies are turning global, technology naturally crosses national boundaries and enters various countries. When that happens, it is inevitable for technologies to come up against the cultures of those countries and their respective patent and legal systems. We have to think about strategies ahead of time premised on those differences. Questions are now being raised, I think, about Japan's policy in light of the pro-patent policy of the United States. It's not a matter simply for the Japanese Government. More broadly, it has to involve consensus-building that includes those in industry. Right now there are people in Japan asserting that a pro-patent stance will have the effect of "hollowing out" industries and that a move to strengthen the patent system, in and of itself, is not a good idea. Such views may be all right if one wants to treat the symptoms, but we have to have debates on whether that is in fact the general consensus in Japan. With regard to damage awards--data exist showing that, compared to the early half of the 1980's when the United States started taking pro-patent measures, the average damage award has increased about five fold. Compared to increases in the average cost of goods, a five fold increase in 10 years is just too steep. It's like the bubble phenomenon that occurred here with regard to land prices. Somehow we have to get this situation under control. At the time, people were asking what would happen if land prices were to drop suddenly. The same questions are being asked now. So it's imperative that we consider measures that will bring things to rest at a suitable level. [Ito] Take the case of semiconductors for example. Useful products come into being as the cumulative result of a number of innovations. When an unreasonable amount is demanded in royalties for a single patent, technology is going to suffer. It's going to end up wrecking businesses. Within the United States, a rather confusing situation has come about as the result of cross-licensing. The possibility of strengthening patents was just mentioned. But patents are like the flowering of an idea that begins with an individual and then builds on the accumulated wisdom of others. To claim credit, as if solely responsible for that flowering, on the basis of what is really only a small part of the entire process, is excessive and wholly undesirable. There should be counterarguments to such claims on philosophical grounds. For example, when Japan provides technology to developing countries, we should be able to argue against such claims. Talks between industrially advanced countries and between advanced countries and developing countries include surprisingly nettlesome philosophical issues. U.S. demands at this time, I can't help feeling, are a little excessive. [Aso] Mr. Naemura, how do you feel about the relationship between advanced and developing countries with respect to intellectual property rights? [Naemura] I have the feeling the so-called developing nations are about two steps behind countries like the United States and Japan in regard to intellectual property rights. In developing countries, those rights haven't been clearly set down in a system yet. But let's say they are. It doesn't follow that these countries are then all going to be rushing forward in the same direction as industrially advanced countries. There is another step in between where technology is introduced and that serves as the basis for further technological developments. Compared to economies, when technology is involved, the process involves at least one more step, and we have to think about how to help them through that additional step. It's the sort of problem that can't be solved simply by making a single rule and having that apply in common to everyone. In the last 50 years or so since the end of World War II, Japan has come through that process, and the current generation has to pass that know-how on to developing countries. In that sense, Japan has an extremely important role to play. U.S. System Is a Worldwide Problem [Aso] Unlike patents, which specify who the inventor is in a way that's evident to people, it's often hard, in the case of copyrights, to tell whose rights have been violated and at what point until a lawsuit or charge has been brought against the alleged violator. In other words, copyrights are like land mines. It's hard to tell where they might lie buried or how big an explosion they'll set off. Among companies, how is such a problem handled, I wonder? [Yamamoto] Well, in the case of programs, one can't go and investigate each and every invention that has ever been developed independently. It's impossible to thoroughly research what amounts to a mountain of material. So a term like "clean-dom" has appeared. All one can do is isolate oneself in an environment uncontaminated by others and there development something uniquely one's own. For general patents, the Patent Office is creating a paperless [electronic] database. We would like to use this database to research precedents and previous technology. It costs large enterprises a lot of money to research such matters, but I'm afraid the costs for medium-sized businesses and smaller enterprises may still be prohibitive. The U.S. system has caused a lot of problems in the past. There hasn't been a system for the public to get information, and one day someone suddenly comes up claiming to have a patent for old technology which is so self-evident that people now take it for granted. This leads to a mess. It has driven me to the point sometimes of almost feeling it is the most unfair system around, and it really has to be revised. It is a problem that can probably be solved through harmonization. In any case, I would definitely like to see the problem resolved as soon as possible. [Ito] One of the problems is that you don't know if you're going to be stepping on a land mine. You don't know where the land mines have been planted. And even if you do, besides knowing where they are, you have to have a system that you know how long a mine is going to be a threat; for example, a battery should be placed inside them with an expected life span of 20 years, and when those 20 years are up, even if you should step on them, you're safe. [Aso] A submarine patent has recently surfaced that has to do with [Jerome] Lemelson's image-processing technology. He applied for the patent in 1954. In 1992, 38 years later, the patent is finally approved. Under the U.S. system, this patent is in effect for 17 years, from 1992. Technology that everyone is using and has assumed is common property suddenly surfaces with a patent on it. Japan isn't the only country to suffer as a result. U.S. industries and industries throughout the world are suffering. This system has to be changed as soon as possible. [Yamamoto] Lemelson's patent is for technology anyone would have thought of, and to that extent, it was inevitable that someone would have tried to patent the idea. The problem is that such ideas can be patented in the first place. One of the fundamental problems with the patent system lies here. The system is causing hardships throughout the world. It's enough to make me wish we could go back through history and set things right from the start. [Naemura] For example, the United States and others are accusing Japan of having closed, idiosyncratic markets. Make them the same as markets elsewhere, we're told. But as far as patent systems go, the U.S. system is also closed and out of step with systems elsewhere. It also presents a problem in terms of its domestic-versus-foreign bias. So, we're at a period now, I think, when we should be asking why the U.S. system is closed and at the same time explaining to U.S. consumers how that system is hurting them and its industries in general. It's true that Japanese industries are having a very hard time; but the United States isn't going to listen if we say we're hurting, so their system has to be changed. Rather, what's needed, I think, is to argue the point that the system is not only inconveniencing the United States but is bad for elsewhere in the world as well. Europe and Japan's positions are very similar. We're both advocating the same kinds of things: change from a first-to-invent to a first-to-apply system, to a system where the public has access to patent information, and to a system where the patent period is calculated from the date of application. In the sense that other countries are advocating such changes, the U.S. system can be said to have become a worldwide problem. The first-to-invent system that the United States is advocating is based on the idea of individualism--giving due respect to the individual and to individual gifts and talents--and places disproportionate emphasis on that philosophy. But I have a feeling that by establishing time limits, something can somehow be worked out. [Yamamoto] I think a time limit is the first condition. But [patents] are very broadly interpreted. For example, in the case of the autofocus technology in cameras. You think there are no problems and then you go to the United States and there are. It's a tough situation to be in. One of the issues involved is how to decide on a matter when similar patents and similar claims emerge in a single stretch in the course of history. In any case, what happens is that the differences in various systems and ways of thinking rub up against each other to cause friction among countries. And even with the harmonization of systems, I suspect there will still be problems. [Aso] Even when systems are harmonized, the next problem to arise may be in their application and implementation. But, first of all, it's important to try our best to harmonize the various systems. [Yamamoto] Yes, I hope we can move forward on this. Technological Innovation, Source of Japan's Vitality [Aso] The United States is now trying to build consensus regarding the direction its people want to see for the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) treaty. Professor Naemura, what do you think we should be anticipating from the United States? [Naemura] It has already been mentioned in our discussion, but the U. S. system is very idiosyncratic. [Aso] First of all, the United States has to be brought around to realizing that fact. [Naemura] It means demanding changes in the current system in terms of the first-to-invent principle that it embodies and in terms of time requirements, public access, and the domestic-foreign bias that exists in the system. On the other hand, it means that demands will also be placed on Japan. For example, if the principle of parity is introduced and adopted, it will mean giving a broader interpretation in Japan to patent claims, and so it will be necessary to build consensus in Japan regarding such proposed changes. [Aso] The United States is saying that Japan's patent review process takes too long. They also want applications to be accepted in English. Again, Japan recognizes objections from third parties before a patent is granted. The United States wants patents to be granted first and, then, if there are any objections, for those matters to be dealt with later. They are also asking for changes that would require a change in Japan's patent laws or fundamental revisions in the way the system operates--for example, when they say Japan's grace period is too short or the review period for applications is too long and they want it to be shortened. If the United States said it would take bold steps to revise its system, then despite some problems, Japan too would make bold concessions. We have to approach future talks with an attitude that says to the United States, since Japan is going to make concessions, so should you. [Yamamoto] I think a turning point has definitely come for private enterprises, too. First of all, it means paying serious attention to the system of investigating prior cases and precedents. It means not frivolously applying for patents. And through revisions in patent law, it means a shift which makes it possible to apply for ideas after they've been put together and better developed; in other words, it means a shift from quantity to quality. [Ito] I think it's somewhat regrettable that the message for small and midsized enterprises may be to be very selective in their applications for patents, and wonder if some distinctions shouldn't be made in such cases. Of course, there's no way to argue against the idea of quality over quantity. But I think we also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that technological innovation has been an essential source of the energy that has been behind Japan's vitality. [Aso] Yes, you're quite right. To ask applicants to be very selective in applying for patents is apt to hold down applications as a whole and be taken as a directive against inventing and developing new technologies, and that certainly is not our intention at all. We want people to keep coming up with a lot of good ideas. But we also want them to do their homework and look thoroughly into the matter of related, prior inventions. The Patent Office doesn't want to be flooded with an indiscriminate number of applications without this homework having been done. Promote the Harmonization of Patent Systems and Their Application [Aso] Mr. Yamamoto mentioned this awhile ago, but in July 1993 the Patent Office put a system into operation that is completely electronic. As part of our database, we've already processed some 30 million cases and made this information available to the public. We want the fruits of this paperless database be our common property. [Yamamoto] Japan's Patent Office's paperless database system seems to be the first of its kind in the world. It's important, not only in the sense of preventing patent disputes, but also in the sense of being forward-looking. The system will probably be a useful reference for developing countries, too. We are looking forward to seeing the Patent Office working together with the appropriate countries when the time is right. [Ito] It's splendid that a project of this scope has been successfully carried out. From here on, the task will be to update the system on a constant basis, and as Mr. Yamamoto said, I hope its use can be broadened to include assistance to developing countries. [Naemura] I imagine that, through this system, the process of reviewing applications will be made much more efficient. Naturally, that's one of the points to be appreciated. I hope its merits will also be assessed in terms of volume. [Aso] Right now, databases are kept separately. The United States has its own database and the same with Europe and Japan. So each of their respective patent offices has gotten together and they are trying to make it so that the data can all be mutually used. Also, since their methods are all different for searching and looking into previous technology, hopefully, there will be some harmonization here, too. Another point is that views differ in respect to novelty or originality. This is the most difficult point, and work is now in progress in this area. In addition to harmonizing systems, I hope energy is put into harmonizing the way the systems are put into practice and operation. Thank you for participating today in our discussion of so many different issues.
