Operation Bahamas Turks and Caicos Islands (OPBAT), a cooperative effort involving the three territories, was started in April 1992 to stamp out the drug trade. And already, 18 months later, Butler says cocaine trafficking through the islands has dropped. The public safety minister added that the 1993 total for cocaine seizure, though not yet official, was expected to be just about 700 kilos. "This is an 86 per cent decline from the 4.85 metric tons seized in 1992 and it is the lowest annual seizure total since late 1970," he said. The minister explained that another first for the Bahamas in 1993, was that there was not a single interception of cocaine at an airstrip in the Bahamas. "The fact that only two airdrops were intercepted in Bahamian territorial waters compared to six in international waters show great respect for the OPBAT and an obvious decline in the traffic." Butler noted that for the 18 months OPBAT has been in operation--from April, 1992, through December 31, 1993--only 1.59 metric tons of cocaine was seized in Bahamas. And 1.85 metric tons were seized in international waters, much of it close to the north coast of Cuba. "I think we can conclude that our remarkable joint OPBAT programme has brought the traffic of cocaine from Colombia to South Florida through the Bahamas down to irreducible minimum during this 18 month period." The public safety minister also reported a fall by more than half, in the number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment, as a direct result of the anti-drug programme. This, he said, indicated that the drug problem was "receding" or "stable."
