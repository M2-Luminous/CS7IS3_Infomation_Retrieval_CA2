Zharinov: "From the Nonparty Bloc?"] [Text] All elections, whatever you say about them, have their own birthmarks. For example, an obligatory and unfailing attribute of past elections was the slogan concerning the indestructibility of the "bloc of communist and nonparty candidates." Anything else at that time was inconceivable for the party and people were united. Today this slogan seems inappropriate and illogical. In actual fact, the Russian people here are united, and there are several dozen parties, each of which is endeavoring to "merge" with them and express their interests. If the formation of parties continues to be so dynamic, there is a fear that the people will not be enough to go round. The people themselves, it has to be assumed, are beginning to understand that the parties standing in line to defend their interests at times represent no one and nothing. And have sometimes been created merely in order to "state," "protest," and "demonstrate." We are persuaded that this is the case by the preliminary results of the elections to the oblast soviet of deputies. At least 10 political organizations, blocs, and movements have loudly stated their aspiration to fight for deputies' seats. The oblast organizations of Democratic Russia, the Free Russia People's Party, the Economic Freedom Party, the Russian Communist Workers Party, the Working Novosibirsk and Fatherland movements, and the Unity Association have actively begun to introduce their candidates. The electorate remembers their periodic appearances on television and radio and in local publications. SOVETSKAYA SIBIR ran a serious of publications devoted to election associations. Let us leave in the background for the time being the original lack of coordination (the amendments to the Election Statutes, revision of the district boundaries), which undoubtedly contributed to the false start. Let us take a closer look at the problem. Of the deputies elected, only three represent political parties and movements. From the Communist Party of Russia, Viktor Kuznetsov, secretary of the oblast party committee, and Vladimir Karlov, director of Vocational-Technical School 16 (both ran in Berdsk), and from Russia's Choice, Nikolay Krasnikov, chief of the administration of the Koltsovo community. However strange, well-known and respected people, skillful politicians, are among those who have withdrawn. Account was taken of the candidates' political past and an ability to think in a manner out of the ordinary and present one's position interestingly. And of the subjective, psychological factor, of course. Nonetheless, the ability to organize the campaigning was, I believe, determining in the election. It was frequently undertaken in talentless manner, with the old methodological baggage. The cliche that the Russian Communist Workers Party defends the interests of the working people and supports a change of political and economic course was bandied about, for example. And the party members evidently believed that this said it all. The people would be aroused and would head for the polls. They did not. For almost the same slogans had emanated from other political forces. The philosophy of campaigning self-sufficiency (we are for the people!) proved unproductive in the general chorus of people's defenders. Having had a surfeit of slogans concerning protection unrealized with each new election, the people preferred to ignore them and to vote, at best, for those whom they know best, not showing their affection for any party. Nor was the tried-and-tested, reserve campaigning echelon: the arrival in Novosibirsk of political leaders of Russia V. Anpilov, V. Lipitskiy, and I. Malyarov, any help. The electorate greeted them warmly, but many people simply failed to show up at the polls. The program of the oblast organization of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation would seem to be the most constructive, balanced, and specific of the election material. It does not summon to the "far blue yonder" but offers a resolution of socioeconomic problems at the oblast level. And this, I believe, was appreciated by the electorate of Berdsk, which cast its votes for the communists. Social psychologists say that a candidate who organizes his campaign not on real, constructive matters but on withering criticism of his opponents fails, as a rule. This was evident to some extent. One likable party candidate from Tsentralnyy Rayon so fulminated in his election speeches against the communists as to introduce into his vocabulary the terms "communist Vendee," "red faces," and so forth. In a word, the voter knew where everything stood with this politician. And rejected him. One further campaign method: the flashed-message effect. As many people believe, in November V. Zhirinovskiy's multiple television meetings made him not only a star of the screen but of the electorate also. The method was employed actively by local candidates also. The pithy phrase broadcast daily on the radio: "Konstantin Zheleznov is a man of action! He is your candidate!" is still implanted in the minds of many Novosibirskers. The politician candidates did not dare take such a step. In order to be, if not elected, at least, known. Granting SOVETSKAYA SIBIR an interview, Kirill Volobuyev, leader of the local Liberal Democrats, complained at the discrimination in relation to political parties: We were forced to collect signatures for the candidates. "People should be nominated for the oblast soviet by party, by slate!" As it transpired, the party could today barely "cover" several electoral districts with its candidates. None was elected to the oblast soviet. From the viewpoint of party representation and the apportionment of political forces this is not, as they say, to the benefit of democracy. But how can the electorate's interests be represented in the soviet if it is as yet denying this representation?
