In Pretoria, he said the arrests were made after more than six weeks of intensive investigations into a series of far-rightwing terror attacks in the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal. On Monday, police arrested five suspects linked to far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and others in Welkom. Over the weekend, the SA Police arrested seven people, including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, Mr Kriel said. Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were seized when the arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni, and near the scene of the crime in Richard's Bay. Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal and the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the police. Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said. During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun at members of the police through a closed door. A policeman, Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest, but escaped death because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was under police guard in hospital. [passage omitted]
