Where does the regime's concern come from and what plans are officials preparing to establish security? Obviously the Islamic Republic is under intense pressure both at home and abroad. At home the people's dissatisfaction with the regime is increasing more each day. The outcome of the policy for economic adjustment and some minimal economic steps have only led to more bottlenecks in the lives and livelihood of millions of Iranians. The policy of economic adjustment that the regime has adopted has led to the dismissal and unemployment of tens of thousands of civil servants, workers, and teachers and more and more people are without jobs in our country. Thus, the lives of the poor and the destitute are becoming more difficult each day. At a time when inflation is soaring, undoubtedly the disgruntled people will not sit idle but will demand work, bread, health and hygiene, education, and other needs. This is one of the main roots of the insecurity that the regime speaks of. But the regime, which is unable to ensure either the people's livelihood or work, is preparing to fill the empty stomachs and protesting throats of these people with [word indistinct]. Meanwhile, the regime's failure to confront the so-called cultural onslaught by the West is yet another issue that has increased its concern and feeling of insecurity. However, the regime's officials have not only not learned a lesson from their defeats but they want to continue their blind opposition to the civilized world and its achievements. The rulers of Qom and Tehran have also realized that the preservation and safeguarding of an ideological regime like that of the Islamic Republic cannot be possible without crushing freedom and democracy, violating human rights, and interfering in the people's private lives. They also know that the people oppose this policy of the regime and will fight it. The clerical regime, which is politically, culturally, and philosophically unable to satisfy the people, will undoubtedly resort to suppression, the gallows, torture, and arrests to advance its policies and to crush the people's freedom-seeking ideas. Thus, the regime's inability to meet the people's daily needs, the deepening of the economic crisis, the fall of cultural policy into an impasse, the isolation on an international level, and the pressures of public opinion have all helped to instill these feelings of concern and insecurity. Because of all these elements, the regime has deployed all of the country's potential to ensure its security and to preserve itself. The most important part of this security plan is the centralization of the suppressive organs, the strengthening of the (?ties) among them, and the elevation of the combat ability of its forces. It is not without reason that the regime has assigned Besharati the responsibility of heading the Islamic Republic's [Supreme National] Security Council in addition to his position as interior minister. Also, the organizing of its suppressive forces and of its war machinery is another part of the regime's security plan. The regime now intends to further organize its suppressive forces and to increase their strength in crushing operations. Seyfollahi, commander of the Islamic Republic's law-enforcement forces, says that he needs 300,000 fresh forces to remove the existing problems. In addition, among the regime's other steps are the return to the scene of the Resistance Basij and the formation of another body known as executive officers for judicial affairs to help in the implementation of the policy of doing good and shunning evil in a bid to safeguard the security of the Islamic Republic. In addition to all these, the regime has also issued orders on the formation of a rapid deployment force to further crush Kordestan. Efforts to weaken the opposition's activities also form another part of the regime's policy. The signing of joint accords with Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to plot against the Kordestan movement and the Baluchi combatants is the most convincing proof of this. In addition to all of this, the Islamic Republic is also trying to limit the sphere of activities of the [Iranian] opposition in Europe. To achieve this, it inflicts pressures on it on the one hand and grants concessions to it on the other. [sentence as heard] Clearly, the assassination of regime opponents is the most outstanding aspect of the regime's security policy abroad. In short, the regime continues to pursue the policy of suppression and violence to safeguard its security. But the question is: Can this policy have a favorable outcome for the regime? We think not because the methods that the Islamic Republic has adopted and tested throughout its existence have all been futile and have not borne any favorable results. Now that the regime is facing an impasse because of its clerical policies, thoughts, and culture the only thing that it can use is suppression and violence. Since it does not know any other language but that of suppression and arms, naturally we should expect it to speak in this language. However, sooner or later it will be proven that the regime's suppressive machinery will not always be useful vis-a-vis the people's determination and uprisings and that finally it will have to kneel down in front of the people and of justice.
