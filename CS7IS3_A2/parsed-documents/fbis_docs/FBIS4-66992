In almost every province in the region there are areas where poppies are being cultivated at very high yields. In Ha Tuyen Province [name of province as published] alone poppy plants are being grown in five districts, producing high yields at low capital and labor costs. These are the districts of Hoang Su Phi, Quan Ba, Yen Minh, Dong Van, and Meo Vac. This region is also part of the Brown Triangle -- better known as the Golden Triangle -- the well-known poppy planting region in Southeast Asia. Lao Cai Province has poppy cultivation areas in Bac Ha, Muong Khuong, Bat Sat, and Sa Pa. Yen Bai Province has intensive experience in poppy cultivation, with acreage of up to 1,484 hectares in Mu Cang Chai and Tram Tau districts. Poppy plants are usually hard to grow, but not in high mountain regions where the climate is cool and dry. The plant does not require much labor or care. The current price in these planting areas is one tael of gold for 3 kg of opium. The further the opium is transported and the more control posts it gets through, the higher the price. The "brown fairy" has always been with the multi-ethnic compatriots at funerals and wedding parties, spring festivals, harvest festivals, and parties to congratulate people on their job promotions or new houses. In recent years opium has become so popular that people treat each other to opium the same way they do with cigarettes. It has become a popular habit; in all gatherings, there is usually a pipe and opium provided by the host. In localities where poppies are grown, among every 10 local people -- regardless of age or gender --there are three or four opium addicts, and one of them is heavily addicted. We do not thus far have official records on the number of families and individuals addicted to opium in the six northern mountain provinces. Records in the former Hoang Lien Son Province three years ago showed there were some 70,000 addicts, including 12,000 who were seriously addicted. Yen Bai Province's records in 1993 showed 6,000 serious cases among 32,000 addicts. These numbers were drawn solely from voluntary statements by the addicts. We are unsure about the number of people who did not declare. Among the addicts, more than 35 percent were young people. They are usually heavily addicted and are the main concern for society. Prior to 1975, poppy planting was virtually eliminated and the number of addicts was negligible. During the 1980's, the poppy plant was imported and grown as a medicinal plant. Since then, localities that have the appropriate soil conditions have rushed to grow poppy plants and have neglected food crops. Poppy plants have become a garden plant, and people smoke opium openly just like cigarettes. There were times when opium was collected in lieu of taxes because poppy growers did not pay taxes in cash or food grains. In some years in the past, some district authorities had to store several hundred kg of opium and put them up for sale. The lawful buyers of this medicinal substance are cigarette companies and the pharmaceutical general company. Buyers were few but sellers were many, so naturally they could not agree on prices. This paved the way to the development of smuggling activities. In poppy cultivation areas, each smoker uses about 3-4 kg of opium a year. A family would spend many millions [currency not specified] on it; could the amount a province would offer to the "brown fairy" be hundreds of billions? There were times when cadres and state employees used their savings to buy and store opium at harvest time, and then sell it when the price was high. Mountain regions have been haunted by the poppy plant again and again; addiction has become ever more serious, people's health has deteriorated, and poor regions have become even poorer because poppy cultivation has prevented the development of food crops. After the successful August Revolution, we carried out a movement to substitute food crops for poppy plants in parallel with the campaign to control addiction. We also carried out measures to prevent opium and other drugs from being imported into Vietnam. Thanks to the universal movement to suppress addiction, we basically eradicated drug addiction in the fifties, sixties, and seventies. In the eighties, with poppy plants being grown in the mountain provinces, drug addiction has made a comeback. To deal with the situation, we have motivated all people to participate in movements to control and prevent drug addiction, substitute food crops or other medicinal plants for poppy plants, and punish offenders through strict administrative measures. In addition to imposing harsh punishment on drug procurers and rehabilitating drug addicts over the last few years, the authorities in Yen Bai Province have arranged to collect opium and destroy it on the spot. Mu Cang Chai District, for example, has burned 292 kg of opium. The province provided the local H'Mong people with 80 tonnes of rice to help them during the planting season for food crops. The province also invested over 4.1 billion dong in capital lending to local people to help them grow corn, fruit trees, and wheat on lands that used to grow poppy plants. Lao Cai, Lang Son, Son La, and Lai Chau Provinces also provided tens of billions of dong and many thousands of tonnes of food staples to help people overcome addiction and substitute food crops and medicinal plants for poppy plants. The agriculture sector has carried out successful research on new species of vegetables and medicinal plants with high economic value to replace poppy plants effectively. In order to eliminate drug addiction successfully, we have to be persistent in encouraging the replacement of poppy plants with food crops, high-value medicinal plants, or vegetables used for oil. We have to accelerate the campaign to denounce drug dependence as a bad and immoral practice. The families of drug addicts, together with society, should help rehabilitate addicts and keep them away from drug pushers. The vice of drug addiction is bringing disaster to many households. Nobody should avoid participating in the movement to suppress this dangerous vice.
