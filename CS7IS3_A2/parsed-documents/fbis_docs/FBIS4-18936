Balladur said the "success of the referendum," announced on Monday, was an illustration "of his government's chosen method," a communique from the Prime Minister's Office said. Reforms could only succeed with majority support, the communique said, adding that "only dialogue and consultation will permit progress on the road of a society that is both fairer and more dynamic." The "Balladur method" of government, seen as a succession of climbdowns, has come under increasing criticism from within his own Rally for the Republic (RPR). Most of the critics are supporters of RPR leader Jacques Chirac against Balladur for the May 1995 presidential elections. The government came under fire for dropping an earlier restructuring plan for Air France last October after a violent strike and for caving into student protestors last month by withdrawing a scheme to pay young people less than the minimum wage. According to official returns, 81.2 percent voted for the new Air France package, which calls for 5,000 job cuts and a wage freeze, intended to cut back on estimated 1993 losses of 7.5 billion francs (1.25 billion dollars). Acceptance of Air France chairman Christian Blanc's rescue plan was a condition for a massive capital injection of 20 billion francs (3.3 billion dollars) by the government, but the European Commission must also approve the recapitalisation plan. Tuesday's communique said that Balladur's privatisation programme was financing the capital injection, adding "the privatisations are allowing us to provide support for the public sector." The communique said the prime minister was anxious to win European Union approval for the injection "very quickly." Balladur was due to meet European Aeronautical Affairs Commissioner Abel Matutes later on Tuesday.
