Agayev, Azerbaijan National Aerospace Agency, Baku; UDC 551.521:629.195] [Abstract] A study was made of the spectral properties of the atmospheric transfer function, on the basis of the color tones and saturation of surface features observed from spaceships making it possible to ascertain their colorimetric characteristics at the surface. The findings are illustrated by the results of computations of the colorimetric characteristics of the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea and uniform water surfaces for the case of a molecular atmosphere in the presence of ozone and a molecular atmosphere in the presence of aerosol and ozone for three observation angles (0, 30, 60�) with a change in solar zenith distance from 0 to 60�. For a uniform water surface the transfer functions always have greater values than those for the shores. With the addition of scattering particles (aerosols) to a molecular atmosphere in the presence of ozone the values of the transfer functions for the color coefficients X and Y increase, whereas those for Z decrease. When the atmosphere is polluted by aerosol particles the role of scattering particles in the transformation of surface colorimetric characteristics substantially increases. The results indicate that the colorimetric characteristics observed from space are dependent not only on the relation among the optical parameters of aerosol, but also are determined by the conditions of atmospheric illumination by direct solar radiation.
