More than 60 experts called for an early start of the construction at a meeting organized by the China Association for Science and Technology, which closed here Thursday [17 March]. The opinion of the experts agrees with that of deputies from Ningxia, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia, who have put forward the same suggestion to the ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress. Experts at the association's meeting, including noted academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhang Zongyou, Ma Zongjin and Li Tingdong, hold that the construction of a hydropower plant at Daliushu in the Heishan Gorge, on the upper reaches of the Huanghe River, is feasible both technologically and economically. The experts said that the loose rock base at the proposed reservoir covers only part of the area and is superficial. It poses no major difficulty for construction or safety. In fact, the experts pointed out that loose rock has been handled successfully at power plants both in China and abroad. Feasibility studies of the plant in the past decades have been accompanied by controversies over whether there should be two lower dams at Xiaoguanyin in Gansu Province and Daliushu in Ningxia, or only one high dam at Daliushu. The high dam plan won the argument in November, 1991, when an experts group of the Ministry of Water Resources conducted studies in geology, construction, investment and irrigation. According to the final plan approved by the State Council, the Daliushu plant will have a 160 meter high dam and a reservoir containing 1.1 million cu m of water. The generating sets will have a capacity of two million kw, generating 7.8 billion kwh of electricity a year. The water of the reservoir will be able to irrigate 400,000 ha of farmland in the region in the short term, and more than one million ha in the long run. It will also supply abundant water resources to the energy and chemical industries in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia, and cleaner water to hundreds of thousands of local people who are suffering from a too-high fluorine content in their drinking water. As the construction of the plant is of great significance to the development of western China and has been put on the agenda by the State Council in its plan for China's agricultural development in the 1990s, the experts urged that it should be started as soon as possible.
