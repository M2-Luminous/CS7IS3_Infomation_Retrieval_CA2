Speaking after a meeting with Acting Foreign Minister of Moldova Ion Botnaru, he said the expansion of NATO to include new members would be a simplistic solution. Kozyrev did not contest the right of other countries to join the alliance but "this could lead to the creation of new barriers in Europe if implemented." In his words, Russia's voice was heeded by NATO, Eastern and Central Europe. This is a case illustrating that a short cut is not always optimal, leading nowhere and to wrong decisions, Kozyrev said. By contrast, he added, a longer road can lead to the right destination. The minister said the Partnership for Peace proposal had been discussed by Yeltsin and Clinton on Thursday and that both of them were satisfied it implied partnership rather than membership. Kozyrev spoke of having discussed the problem with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier in the day. "It is too early yet to say how the period of partnership will end," the minister said. "One option is to expand NATO by accepting new members, including Russia, something we do not rule out," he said. Other options are also possible, he said, including the creation of broader security systems and the consolidation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. The minister called for efforts to be taken in parallel in all those directions but all of these must end up in greater stability and cooperation in Europe. For his part, Botnaru spoke of seeing his talks with the Russian foreign minister as a step on the road to implementing the Partnership for Peace plan.
