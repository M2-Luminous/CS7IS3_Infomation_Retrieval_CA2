FR940919-0-00075 FR940919-0-00016 D. Incorporation of Newly Listed Wastes Into Lab Packs and Changes to Appendices On June 1, 1990 (55 FR 22629), EPA promulgated alternative treatment standards under 40 CFR 268.42(c) for waste codes listed in 40 CFR 268 Appendix IV and V that are placed in lab packs. These alternative standards are legally constructed, in part, as ``specified methods of treatment'' because of physical difficulties in measuring compliance with numerical standards for these multi- coded waste forms (i.e., compliance is complicated by the fact that many lab packs are comprised of hundreds of small containers, each with different organic or organo-metallic chemicals in them, making it difficult to accurately sample treatment residues for those organics). In the January, 1991, correction notice and again in the May 30, 1991, Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (56 FR 24453), the Agency requested comment on potential improvements to these alternative standards. EPA's original intent in establishing two separate appendices was to distinguish between those lab packs containing organo-metallics (Appendix IV) and those containing only organics (Appendix V). As such, lab packs containing organo-metallics (Appendix IV) were expected to need stabilization after performing the specified method of treatment, INCIN (i.e., incineration), while Appendix V lab packs only needed to be incinerated. However, under 40 CFR 268.42(c)(4), all treatment residues of either type of lab pack also had to comply with the standards for the extraction procedure (EP) for metals, i.e., D004, D005, D006, D007, D008, D010, and D011. (D009 is not included in this list because most mercury-bearing wastes were excluded from the use of the alternative standards in both of these Appendices.) As such, if metals were concentrated in the residues from the incineration of an Appendix V lab pack and the resultant residues then exhibited one of the characteristics for EP metals, these residues would also have had to be stabilized to comply with the appropriate treatment standard for metals. In such a case, there was no practical difference between Appendix IV and Appendix V lab packs in terms of the treatment that was needed. The majority of the comments received from the regulated community supported the Agency's proposed approach. In this final rule EPA is, therefore, replacing Appendix IV and Appendix V with a new Appendix IV. In order to simplify the new Appendix IV it only contains those wastes excluded from lab packs. The following wastes are excluded from lab packs (and appear in new Appendix IV) for the purpose of using the alternative lab pack treatment standard in 40 CFR 268.42(c): D009, F019, K003, K004, K005, K006, K062, K071, K100, K106, P010, P011, P012, P076, P078, U134, U151. In today's rule, EPA is also stating that the alternative treatment standard for lab packs applies to the following additional waste codes that were previously not included in Appendix IV or V: wastes for which treatment standards were promulgated in the LDR Phase I rule August 1, 1992 (57 FR 37194), and wastes (including TC organic wastes) for which treatment standards are promulgated in this final rule. Today's rule does not list these as excluded waste codes in the new Appendix IV. As a matter of clarification, the alternative treatment standard for lab packs is INCIN. This required combustion technology combined with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.42(c)(4) (ash residues are treated to meet the characteristic metals treatment standards), will ensure that all underlying hazardous constituents present in characteristic wastes (other than those excluded in the new Appendix IV), will be treated. The use of this alternative lab pack standard negates the requirement to monitor for, or comply with, the UTS for underlying hazardous organic constituents. For reasons outlined in the June 1, 1990 final rule, mercury wastes were excluded from this alternative standard for lab packs. Mercury is considered a ``volatile metal'' which may lead to excessive air emissions in some combustion devices when present in large quantities. Mercury is also very difficult to stabilize if present in ash residues in large quantities. Commenters did not provide any justifiable technical reason for EPA to modify its position with respect to mercury wastes, and thus these wastes shall remain excluded from this alternative lab pack treatment standard. E. Changes in the LDR Program in Response to the LDR Roundtable EPA convened a roundtable meeting on January 12&hyph;14, 1993 to discuss the LDR program. The purpose of the roundtable was for EPA to hear suggestions on improvements to the LDR program from persons who implement it. Participants included representatives of hazardous waste generators, treaters, and disposers; public interest groups; state environmental agencies; EPA regional offices; and other federal agencies. EPA is today promulgating several recommendations made by roundtable participants. The Agency is consolidating the three existing treatment standard tables into one table, and is simplifying notification requirements and reducing paperwork, as discussed below. In addition, as discussed in an earlier section of this preamble, the Agency is also promulgating universal treatment standards. Furthermore, the Agency is committed to continue to identify ways the LDR program can be simplified. Additional opportunities for such streamlining will be explored in future LDR rulemakings. 1. Consolidated Treatment Table Several of the groups present at the LDR roundtable expressed an interest in having a consolidated treatment standard table in the regulations. Participants stated that the existing system of three separate tables at 40 CFR 268.41&hyph;268.43 was too complex and burdensome. In its September 14, 1993 notice, EPA proposed a single consolidated table of treatment standards. Comments on the table were favorable. Today, EPA is replacing the three existing treatment standard tables with the consolidated table, called ``Treatment Standards for Hazardous Waste'' and placing it at §268.40 along with much of the text found currently in §§268.41&hyph;268.43. Section 268.42 continues to describe the technology codes, to regulate California list PCBs and HOCs, to set out exemptions from the required methods, and to provide procedures for equivalency determinations. The numerical treatment standards in the consolidated table are identical to the UTS promulgated in today's rule with the exception of characteristic metal wastes. Reformatting §§268.40&hyph;268.43 also corrects a confusing aspect of the way the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has appeared for some time. The ``No Land Disposal'' treatment standards that have appeared at §268.43 will be deleted from the regulations and should no longer appear in the CFR. These treatment standards have not been in effect since 1990, when the LDR Third Third rule set treatment standards for these wastes that were expressed as either methods of treatment or numerical standards that now appear in the consolidated treatment standard table §268.40. It was only a drafting oversight that made these ``No Land Disposal'' standards continue to appear in the regulations, and today's rule corrects this mistake.
