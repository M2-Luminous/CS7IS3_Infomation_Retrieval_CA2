The sides understand different things by the term "Maras" [Varosha]. This is how the sides define Varosha: TRNC: The fenced area of Varosha is the area whose north and west is fenced, and which extends to the sea on the east and to the Golden Sands Hotel in the south. The Greek Cypriot side and the United Nations: The fenced area of Varosha is the area whose north and west is fenced, and which extends to the sea on the east, and to "Varosha's administrative boundary" on the south. There is a nearly 1.5 square km difference between these two definitions. In the Greek Cypriot and UN definition, the "fenced area of Varosha extends 1.5 km south of the Golden Sands Hotel." Some hotels and many unfinished buildings are located in this area. The Sides Are Insistent on Their Positions In defining the fenced area of Varosha, the TRNC used the present definition from the very start, whereas the United Nations indicates that from the "very start" it understood it to be the area defined by the United Nations today, and it draws attention to the fact that the area in question is also fenced on the south. In addition, the Greek Cypriots and the United Nations want the region between the southern part of the Varosha area -- as they define it -- and the borders (Green Line) [preceding two words in English] to be unmanned. In which case, this region will be transformed into some kind of a "buffer region" and the TRNC armed forces will be forced to withdraw from the southern border of this region. According to the Greek Cypriots and United Nations, this is the only way to ensure reliable communications for the Greek Cypriots between southern Cyprus and Varosha. On the other hand, the TRNC is opposing the seizure of additional lands from the TRNC by putting forward new concepts, and is stressing that this is unacceptable. What Installations Are Found in the Region? According to the new map prepared by the United Nations, in addition to the 105 hotels and hotel-apartments inside the fenced area of Varosha, there are eight hotel-apartments and many residential buildings and shops in the new region coveted from the Turkish side. This region, which is the continuation of John Kennedy Avenue and passes in front of the 1000-bed Golden Sands Hotel on the southern border of the fenced-in Varosha area, is a 1.5 sq km coastal strip. The residential buildings in the region end with the house known as the Painter's House, after which John Kennedy Avenue continues as a dirt road until it reaches the Green Line 1 km away. Report on Leasing Was Not Confirmed In the meantime, the reports in the Turkish press, which were also quoted by some local papers and magazines, to the effect that "the United States wants to lease a place in Varosha," have not been confirmed. A high-ranking official told our newspaper that no such proposal had been submitted to the TRNC by the American officials dealing with the Cyprus problem. This high-ranking official said: "No such issue was raised during the talks held in Nicosia last week. The Americans did not make such a proposal to us. Just like you, we too read that in the Turkish press. We are investigating it."
