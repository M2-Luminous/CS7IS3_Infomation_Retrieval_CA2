In the four decades and more since the founding of the country, it has provided to the state large amounts of oil, coal, timber, large complete sets of power station equipment, machines, and national defense and military equipment and 142.7 billion yuan of profits and taxes, thus playing its role as an old industrial base. Due to the influence of systems, policies, our own work, and other factors, investment in technical transformation was lacking to a serious extent in the past few years. As a result, merely 10 percent of the large- and medium-sized enterprises, whose output value accounted for 75 percent and whose original value of fixed assets and profits and taxes delivered to the state accounted for 80 percent of the province's total, underwent systematic transformation, more than a half of their equipment is in a state of extended service or will soon have to be scrapped, and the products of a half of the enterprises are in recession. Large- and medium-sized enterprises are faced with numerous difficulties in production and operation, and an overwhelming majority of them have been operated at low speed and low efficiency for a long period. In addition, we have failed for many years to build the new projects that can promote local economic development, our industrial structure has yet to be radically adjusted, the overall economic efficiency is low, and the role as an old industrial base is weakening. To regain the magnificence of Heilongjiang, accelerate economic development, and continue to make still greater contributions to the state, the historical task to speed up the transformation of the old industrial base is thus included in our work schedule. Heilongjiang enjoys complete branches of industry, strong technological force, and pretty good equipment foundation. Many of its products, such as the three major power resources, heavy-duty machines, precision bearings, and flax fabrics, are unique or very few in the country. Such a substantial industrial foundation should be regarded as a great advantage, not a burden. This advantage should be fully developed when we transform the old industrial base. We should make the best of enterprises' available assets to carry out more technical transformation projects and fewer capital construction projects. This is an effective way to yield quicker and greater results with less investment. We should pay particular attention to the technical transformation of large- and medium-sized enterprises and enable them to be fully invigorated and play a leading and promoting role in Heilongjiang's economic development. We do not mean to rule out development of new capital construction projects when we advocate more transformation projects for the existing enterprises and less capital construction. Heilongjiang has long failed to address its irrational product mix, large proportion of important means of production, and a large loss of efficiency. To change such a situation, we should build a number of key projects focusing on the intensive processing of such resources as oil, coal, and timber that can lead relevant industries and support rapid economic development. However, either in technical transformation or capital construction, we should conduct a serious study of the market, do a good job in scientific appraisal, accurately select projects, and make sure that products are marketable and investment can be recalled within a short period after the projects are completed. We should never spend money to buy a burden. In technical transformation, we should emphasize "technology." To transform the old industrial base, we should rely on scientific and technological advances and use high and new technology to transform traditional industries. As has been proven in the practice of modern production, the development and change of productive forces, the evolution of industries, the improvement of the standing of products, the optimal organization of enterprises' essential elements of production, and the effective regulation of production process are all decided by the scientific and technological advances, especially the infiltration, radiation, and influence of high and new technology in traditional industries. Over the past few years, Heilongjiang has established a number of high- and new-technology industrial development zones and science and technology parks and has developed and initially industrialized a number of electronic information technology, automation technology, bioengineering technology, new materials, and other high- and new-technology achievements. All localities should make the best of the role of these development zones and parks as "incubators" to distribute high- and new-technology achievements, scientific and technological policies, and operating mechanisms to promote the transformation of traditional industries. Sufficient investment is needed in transforming the old industrial base. Shortages of funds constitute a major factor restricting Heilongjiang's transformation of the old industrial base. To solve this problem, we should rely on our own efforts. After financial allocations are changed into loans, neither local authorities nor enterprises can expect the state or the province to allocate funds to develop projects. They can only use their own funds or bank loans. Enterprises should use most parts of their retained profits in technical transformation and continuously snowball their funds for technical transformation. When conditions permit, they may also accelerate the depreciation of their fixed assets in line with relevant state policies and use the increased depreciation funds chiefly in technical transformation. It is a feasible way to use the funds and advanced technology from outside the border to renovate old enterprises and build joint ventures and exclusively foreign-funded enterprises whose technology is advanced and products are readily marketable. Heilongjiang is located at the center of the Northeast Asian economic circle and neighbors Russia, which has abundant resources and great market potential. Its major cities and localities have established economic and technological development zones or high- and new-technology development zones, and some of them have also been designated by the state as border open cities or pilot cities for overall reform, which enjoy almost the same policies as coastal open cities and very great advantages in opening up. Last year, Heilongjiang brought in 230 million yuan from abroad, accounting for 50 percent of the total amount brought in after border cities were opened to the outside. Even so, the capital brought in from abroad last year accounted for less than 1 percent of the total of the country. This means that we have great potential to tap. While transforming the old industrial base with our own efforts, we should actively strive for state support. Entrusted by Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji led responsible comrades of relevant state ministries and commissions to conduct investigation and study in Heilongjiang. During that period, he helped the province address a series of difficulties and problems, including those on the projects, funds, and policies concerning the transformation of the old industrial base. All localities and departments should seize the opportunity to work in a down-to-earth manner and realistically transform the old industrial base to enable it to regain magnificence.
