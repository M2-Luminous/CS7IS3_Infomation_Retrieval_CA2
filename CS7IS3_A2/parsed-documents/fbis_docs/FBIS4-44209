"Minister of Harmony" is how the man that [National Alliance, AN, leader] Fini chose to put into the executive to redress the balance on the Right likes to refer to himself. Just listen to the sibylline formula that the telecommunications minister used to "advise" the wise men at the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] to leave the RAI of their own free will: "I hope that the guardians of public service impartiality, the interpreters of both the spirit and the letter of the law, will always have a home in Viale Mazzini and Saxa Rubra [RAI buildings]." Strictly according to the rules, in other words, Dematte and company are safe. But in actual fact, following the political changes brought by the two elections on 27 March and 12 June, it is up to them, the old governors, to have the tact to resign. So, is this the guardians' last week, in view of the imminent revision of the save-the-RAI decree? "I do not have the agenda to hand," says Tatarella evasively. The AN deputy thus granted IL GIORNALE this first interview in his role as deputy prime minister to talk solely about the great reform. And, at least in part, this is his prerogative, as Tatarella has just pulled off another of his feats, this time an institutional one, by bringing the exponents of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the League into agreement on the subject on which they were most divided, regional autonomy. The cabinet is now about to approve a constitutional bill that, for the first time ever, brings together presidential government and federalism: the direct election of the presidents of the regional governments and a majority system for all 15 regular regions. On the basis of this unitary principle, each region will adopt the electoral model that it prefers: one-tier, French-style two-tier, three-way second ballot of the type practiced in Sardinia, and so on. [Guiglia] A lot of smoke and no fire, this is what the opposition is saying. Will a bill of this sort ever see the light of day? [Tatarella] All fire and no smoke, and the fact that Salvi of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and Rotondi of the [Italian] Popular Party [PPI] are so cross about it is exactly what proves it. They are the ones making the smoke. Using old tactics, they had sent up smoke signals indicating agreement around [Institutional Reform Minister] Speroni's original proposal to delegate the electoral system to the regions. But this signal really concealed an attempt to get the government coalition to fall out. The attempt failed miserably. The executive will examine the Speroni bill, amended to take account of our demands, which emerged from the meetings held between AN and the League, between Fini and Bossi, and between the experts, Fisichella and Miglio, even before the government was born. [Guiglia] Which side made more concessions, the Northern League or the AN? [Tatarella] Neither, and I am definitely not saying so for diplomatic reasons. It was a matter of incorporating the burden of the talks that our two delegations had had beforehand into the proposal drafted by the institutional reform minister. We had to combine the AN's demand for direct democracy with the League's demand for local democracy and autonomy. An ad hoc committee comprising Maroni, Del Debbio, and myself had been appointed at [Education Minister] D'Onofrio's suggestion, and all we did was reconvene it, as Berlusconi suggested. This way we arrived at the decision to stand by the agreed program, all under the guidance of Minister Speroni. [Guiglia] And what if it turned out to be just a wonderful, unattainable project? [Tatarella] It is a challenge to the opposition. Let it come out into the open and, instead of thinking about the leader that is no more, start thinking about the reform that may be. And let it start now, otherwise it might give grounds for suspicion that the opposition wants to slow the pace of regional electoral reform in parliament so that the regions will go to the polls with the old proportional system, which is regrettably still in force, and which forms the highway for the associationism system of the dominant groups in the PDS and PPI. [Guiglia] And what if constitutional reform runs aground between the two houses of parliament? [Tatarella] We shall have to resort to ordinary legislation; but you can be sure of one thing: The regions will not go to the polls again under the proportional system. [Guiglia] [Interior Minister] Maroni has granted local authorities greater freedom to recruit staff. An instance of state handouts on First Republic lines? [Tatarella] The press has emphasized only a part of Maroni's initiative. First of all, there is a general criterion laid down by the Treasury. Furthermore, its purpose is also to lessen the political weight and powers of discretion held by some local authority technical offices.
