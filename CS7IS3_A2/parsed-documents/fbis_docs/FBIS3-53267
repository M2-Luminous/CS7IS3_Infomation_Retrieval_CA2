Following the encouraging measures, particularly in the security sphere, that the spokesman of the National Dialogue Commission revealed yesterday, four parties submitted a document to the Higher State Council [HCE] and the National Dialogue Commission [NDC]. This document includes measures to ensure the success of the national dialogue. Mahfoud Mannan has the details: [Mannan] Today, the national radio received a copy of a document signed by four political parties: the National Liberation Front [FLN], the Movement for Democracy in Algeria, HAMAS, and al-Nahdah. The document contains supporting measures to ensure the success of the national dialogue. The aforementioned parties addressed it to the HCE and the NDC. The document includes 14 measures, among which are: adopting measures for the benefit of the leading members of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] to allow them to participate in making the national dialogue successful; closing the security centers and releasing people under administrative detention who have no charges against them or have been sentenced for their opinions; easing the security measures ensuing from the state of emergency to pave the way for lifting them; abolishing the restrictions imposed on political activity; suspending the work of the special courts to pave the way for the abolition of emergency courts and laws; ceasing raids and different types of infringement; investigating torture crimes; respecting the freedom of the press; return of the suspended newspapers; and putting an end to the harassment against journalists on account of their opinion. A short while ago, colleague Chaabane Ouleki talked on the phone with al-Nahdah Movement leader Shaykh Djaballah and asked him about the content of this document. [Begin recording] [Djaballah] We submitted the document with a sincere desire to provide a suitable atmosphere and the necessary conditions for the success of the national dialogue. We therefore believe that solutions to the crises the country is experiencing must be found only through national dialogue. But we see that the dialogue is still at an impasse. Thus, we have been pressing since the start of the national dialogue, not only from today, from the first meeting with the HCE and in the different meetings, for the need to adopt measures to help the national dialogue succeed and to restore the people's peace of mind. What the NDC announced yesterday represents the first useful and encouraging steps, but these are insufficient. [Ouleki] Mr. Djaballah, you said the dialogue was still at an impasse, but we have noticed that the sides that took part in putting forward this issue, also participated in the meetings with the NDC and put forward these demands. Have you discussed among yourselves the issue of participating or not participating in the national dialogue conference, because we are a few days away from it? [Djaballah] We were extremely frank in our last meeting with the NDC. In principle, we rejected the pilot study proposed by the NDC and rejected it for objective and extremely precise reasons. We have presented our point of view verbally and also presented it in writing. [Ouleki] You say that the dialogue has reached a dead end, but if we read some of the demands mentioned in the platform, they are nearly either about to be implemented or included in the preliminary text of the study; for instance, the cancellation of restrictions on political activity, easing the security measures, respecting the citizen's basic rights and general freedom, and respecting the nation's feelings in the mass media. These ideas, or the spirit of these points, are almost available in the pilot study and could have been addressed in more detail either before or after the conference. [Djaballah] Yes. In truth, there are positive issues, but they are insufficient in our opinion; for instance, of the negative issues present in the pilot study presented by the NDC, I can mention that an agreement was reached with the NDC to exclude the discussion of the program for society [political program on the nature of the regime to be established], but it was noticed today that the document they presented has dealt with the most important constituents of the program for society through what has been mentioned in the preamble, aims, and guarantees. We could mention numerous examples to support this but it would take too long. For instance, it was noticed that the study did not aim at dealing with the situation in the country as much as solving the problems faced by the current authorities. This is in complete contradiction with what has been agreed on regarding the need to direct all efforts to solve Algeria's crises. For example, the study dealt with numerous issues in general and abstract terms, a matter that caused great confusion on the implicit meanings. This is bound to open the door wide for different interpretations and bad explanations now and in the future. [Ouleki] But Mr. Djaballah, even in political activity, if each side puts forward its own conditions on the basis of which it decides whether to participate or not, is it easy and simple to satisfy all the conditions, even though they might be contradictory, divergent, or (?incoherent), if there were no reciprocal concessions by the sides to the dialogue? [Djaballah] This is a valid question. This is why we have made a distinction between the administrative and technical issues and those connected with the nature of the important political choices. We said that issues of an administrative and technical nature could be settled by voting. As for the issues dealing with important political choices, they should be avoided. We called for avoiding these type of issues because it would be difficult to reach a firm decision for two main reasons, the first of which is the difficulty of the subject, and the second is the brevity of the period and the difficulty of the circumstances. Thus, I think that if the study restricted itself to the issues of an administrative and technical nature, the chances of its success would be greater. This is what we wish. [Ouleki] Mr. Djaballah, will the parties that signed the platform document participate collectively or be absent collectively in the conference, or is the issue of participating or abstaining from the conference a matter that concerns each party? Have you discussed this issue or this possibility? [Djaballah] We have not discussed this issue until now. I think that the issue concerns each party. I think that. [Ouleki] In other words, irrespective of the response to the demands present in the platform? [Djaballah] I think that the issue concerns each party. [end recording]
