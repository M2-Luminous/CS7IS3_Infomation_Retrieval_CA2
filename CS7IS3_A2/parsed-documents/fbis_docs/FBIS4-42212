The clarification Sinn Fein had been seeking of the Downing Street declaration on peace in Ulster had been given and they must now make their decision, said Mr Spring. "The time for debate, clarification and for equivocation has ended. Now it's time to sit down and make progress to end the conflict in this country." Mr Spring said the Irish Government had been working for a number of weeks to put forward a framework document about future peace talks. "We want everybody as part of the democratic process. Both the Irish and British Governments have worked very hard at bringing the paramilitaries on both sides away from the violence. They have to make their decisions. The governments want to move on and we hope that the other parties will move with us. I would say to the Unionist and Nationalist leaderships that there is an opportunity to establish peace on this island now. That opportunity must be embraced by all sides." He added: "If Sinn Fein or others associated with violence do not grasp the opportunity that is there now, they are going to be isolated and they are going to face a long time in isolation if they are not part of the democratic process." Asked if he could see Unionists sitting around the same table as Sinn Fein, Mr Spring said: "If the people in this country have an interest in solving the problem, then they should all be sitting at the table. Obviously, there are certain requirements and a cessation of violence is one and that has to precede anything that happens." Mr Spring was speaking to reporters in Londonderry as he made his way to County Donegal for the Euroelection campaign.
