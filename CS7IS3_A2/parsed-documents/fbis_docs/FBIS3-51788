Sixteen persons were injured -- three of whom were shot -- and 15 were arrested. The clashes occurred after a group of PRD members blocked both lanes of the Mexico-Cuautla road to protest the victory of PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] member Susana Plaza Aguilar during the 14 November election for a new municipal president. Due to this incident, after removing the PRD members, surveillance was increased at the city council office in Tlalmanalco to prevent demonstrators from seizing the installations.
