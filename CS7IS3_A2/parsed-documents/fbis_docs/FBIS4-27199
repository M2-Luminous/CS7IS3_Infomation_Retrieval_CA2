The signature-gathering campaign "has made it difficult for them to table a no-confidence motion before bills for political reform are legislated," the official said on condition of anonymity. Although the Diet enacted bills in January to replace the current multiseat electoral system in the 511-seat House of Representatives with a mixture of 300 single-seat electorates and proportional representation, enactment of a redistricting bill must be in place before an election can be held under the new system. He said opposition moves to force the administration to call an early election under the current multiseat system could be scuttled by a growing intraopposition rift over the wisdom of forcing a vote before an electoral redistricting bill is passed. He said that as many as 42 Liberal Democratic Party legislators and 21 Social Democratic Party [of Japan -- SDPJ] lawmakers have signed the petition objecting to the holding of elections before the redistricting bill. At present, the LDP and SDPJ leaderships are studying a strategy of submitting a no-confidence motion immediately after the Diet passes the long-overdue fiscal 1994 state budget. The official said that, meanwhile, the ruling coalition is stepping up its efforts to convince the SDPJ to return to the fold of the anti-LDP coalition. The SDPJ stormed out of the coalition April 26 after coalition parties abruptly announced a decision to form a new parliamentary bloc in the lower chamber excluding the SDPJ. The withdrawal rendered the Hata administration to a fragile minority government. "The time will come when we will review the current combination of coalition parties without having it entail the disbandment of the whole cabinet," the official said. He said the coalition "would not be able to accomplish tax system reforms if it remains a minority government," in apparent reference to a controversial agenda of raising the rate of the 3 percent consumption tax. In a related development, a leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, a minor coalition partner, blasted the opposition for plotting to scuttle the Hata administration before the redistricting bill is enacted. "The righteous political argument is that the general election should be called after the electoral redistricting bill is legislated," DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa said. "If (the LDP and SDPJ leaderships) try to force the election under the multiseat constituency system, each of the two parties would face intraparty dissenting voices who will rap such moves as attempts to crush political reform," he said. Proponents of the single-seat system have argued the system would clear up Japan's money-dominated politics, as it would eliminate the intense competition among candidates from the same party as seen under the current multiseat system. Critics of the single-seat system argue, however, that it would intensify the race among only a few candidates seeking to grab the sole available seat, thereby tempting candidates to wine and dine voters or raise murky funds to cuddle voters.
