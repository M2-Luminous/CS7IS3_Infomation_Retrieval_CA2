In the Statistics Center comparison, Finland's investment in research narrowly exceeds the average level for the European Union. Still, in Germany and Sweden, for example, a clearly larger percentage of the gross national product (GNP) than in Finland has been invested in research. About 10.4 billion markkas, which is about 1 percent more than in 1991, was used for research and development activities in Finland last year. Research and development's share of the GNP rose from 2.1 percent to 2.2 percent. This relative change is in large part due to the decrease in the GNP, but, on the other hand, it shows that research activities have not declined at the same rate as production. Dependent on research activities, the Finnish high-tech industry exported 13.5 billion markkas worth of products last year. There were 2.7 billion markkas more in foreign high-tech imports than exports. In accordance with the OECD definition, production in which research and development expenses are in excess of 4 percent of sales volume is considered to be high tech in the Statistic Center's calculations. High-tech products accounted for 12.6 percent of Finland's exports last year, which was 1.6 percentage points more than in 1991. The most important high-tech exports were communications equipment, electrical appliances, and ADP equipment. The technology products most frequently imported by Finland were ADP equipment and chemicals. Drugs and Communications Tops in Technology Products According to a study conducted by Markku Virtaharju and Mikael Akerblom for the Statistics Center, high-tech development in Finland has focused especially on the drug industry and the manufacture of communications equipment. These industries clearly stand out above the others if the so-called intensity of the R&D--that is, the ratio of expenditures for research and development to the value of production--is used as a yardstick. The industries differ from one another like night and day as concerns research and development activities. The communications equipment manufacturing industry, which received the highest rating for R&D intensity, a parameter used in the Statistics Center comparison, was 236 times higher than the publishing industry, which received the lowest rating. In terms of general technology levels, the highest-level industries are manufacturers of instruments, computers, and electrical appliances, in addition to drugs and communications equipment. The ratio of direct and indirect investments in technology to production value was used as a yardstick of the technology level in the study. Like investment in research, according to the Statistics Center study, technology as a whole is at its lowest level in the production of foodstuffs, textiles, and wood products, as well as in the publishing industry. The order corresponding to the technological levels of the industries remained in the main the same throughout the 1980's. Finlandia Interface Lives Product Development According to production chief Karl Lahtinen, Finlandia Interface, which manufactures electrical equipment, puts well over 10 percent of its sales volume, which will come to about 58 million markkas this year, into product development. In the Statistic Center's classification, the industry, represented by the company, comes under the heading of industrial electrical equipment, which in Finland includes mostly industries that invest in research and development activities. The sales volume of the company, which develops and produces power sources, that is, certain kinds of electrical transformers suitable for various kinds of equipment manufactured by client firms, has quintupled over the past eight years. Over the past two years its sales volume has nearly doubled, in part thanks to the devaluation of the markka. According to Lahtinen, the development effort has paid off. They have not had to increase sales volume with [bargain] sales, but the company's profit margin has also increased. Along with its increased sales, the company has added to the number of its employees, but not nearly proportionately to the increase in sales volume. Lahtinen believes that the future of Finnish industry is largely dependent on high tech, but it will not become the savior of the employment situation, at least not quickly. According to Lahtinen, aside from being developed to be technologically better, their products are also being developed in such a way that they can be produced with increasingly less labor.
