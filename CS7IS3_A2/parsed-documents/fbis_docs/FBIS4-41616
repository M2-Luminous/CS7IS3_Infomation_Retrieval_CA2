Such a view was expressed by experts, helping Ivan Plyush, a presidential candidate, to conduct his election campaign. They published a paper with analysis of the situation in the industrial military complex and its prospects. They contend that the most hopefull export commodity could be the T-84 tank designed in Kharkov. It is superior in its characteristics to both its Western counterpart and the Russian T-80 tank. Experts regard diesel submarines, anti-aircraft and anti-submarine missiles as equally promissing for Ukrainian export. They revealed that next year the country plans to put out a new modification of the Kalashnikov automatic rifle, out-performing the basic model. They single out Asia as the most lucrative market for Ukrainian arms. An offer from an Indian company called Resources Argumentation is seen as particularly enticing for Kiev. Especially as they offer $5-$7.5 billion in long-term credit to advance Ukrainian industry. When the USSR was in existence, Ukraine's share in the Union's production of arms amounted to 40 percent for spacecraft, up to 50 percent for tanks, and up to 15 percent for other arms. At the same time, by some statistics, up to 20 percent of Ukrainian industry worked for defense. Since then the figure has shrunk to 10 percent. Meanwhile, Ukraine and the U.S. have reached agreements to implement projects on converting some Ukrainian munitions plants to civilian production. This concerns a Kiev-based aircraft construction plant where civilian aircraft are planned to be assembled, the Malyshev plant (diesel engines production), and the Arsenal plant (medical equipment manufacture). Experts estimate the conversion projects at $770 million.
