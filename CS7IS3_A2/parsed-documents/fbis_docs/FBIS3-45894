It is the United States. This is the case today. What about tomorrow? Regardless of the prospects for their own political lives, they are now picking and choosing the archenemy in 26 years time (i.e. the year 2020). Is it still the United States? There are divergent views on this question. Those from the leadership think tank share a general view: Japan. This view was disclosed in a document issued by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. Twenty-three Departments Participated in a Symposium on Developments in the International Situation During the period from 25 November to 5 December 1993, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the Central Military Commission held a symposium on the development of the international situation. During the symposium, discussions were conducted on the development of the world situation, China's position in today's world, the challenges China may face in the next century, and the polarization pattern in the world. The symposium was held at the Jingxi Hotel. Among the units participating in the symposium were 23 departments and organs, including such organs under the CPC Central Committee as the Research Group on International Relations, Research Group on Diplomatic Relations, Research Group on Relations With the United States, Research Group on Relations with Japan, Research Group on Relations with Western Europe, Research Group on Relations With Russia, and organs under the Central Military commission, such as the Research Office on International Strategy, Research Office on European and American Strategy, Research Office on Asian Military Intelligence, Research Group on Far East Strategy, Research Office on National Defense Military Strategy, the Operations Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters, and the Research Office for Strategic Studies. A total of more than 60 papers were published at the symposium. Many Central Leaders and Senior Statesmen Attended the Meeting The symposium was attended by many leaders of the CPC Central Committee, including Qiao Shi, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Chi Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Hong Xuezhi, Cao Shuangming, Zhang Lianzhong, Zhao Nanqi, Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Wei Jianheng, Tao Siju, and Jia Chunwang. Among the senior statesmen present at the symposium were Bao Yibo, Wan Li, Li Desheng, Gu Mu, Xiao Ke, and Zhang Aiping. The 11-day symposium was presided over respectively by Yang Dezhong, Wang Ruilin, and Li Ji. At the meeting, participants reached a consensus on the assessment of the current international situation, the threat from the international community toward China from the present stage till the beginning of the next century, China's major rivals in the year 2020, and China's stance on its sovereignty over Hong Kong. Discussions were also unfolded and different opinions and comments made on a number of issues, such as the future development of Sino-Russian relations, whether or not China should offer economic aid to Russia (to boost the bilateral relations), the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Sino-U.S. relations, China's stance in the United Nations, China's ties with Third World countries, China's relations with India and Indonesia, as well as China's ties with Germany and French. "The Major Target of U.S. Hegemonism Is China" On the basis of the above consensus, the symposium drew a number of conclusions, one of which read: From the present stage to the beginning of the next century, the major target of U.S. hegemonism and power politics is China and Third World countries in Asia. Its strategy toward China is to, through economic activities and trade, control and sanction China and force China to change the course of its ideology and make it incline toward the West; take advantage of opening up, personnel exchanges, and propaganda means to make ideological infiltration into China's upper strata; give financial assistance to hostile forces both inside and outside Chinese territories and wait for the opportune moment to stir up turbulence; support and encourage western groups to impose economic sanctions against China with a view to reaching their political goal; fabricate the theory of a China threat toward neighboring Asian countries to sow dissension between China and countries like India, Indonesia, and Malaysia; and manipulate Japan and South Korea to follow U.S. strategy toward China. However, things may look different in 20 years' time. Over 60 Percent of Participants Regarded Japan as China's Archenemy During the symposium, over 60 percent of the participants believed that by the year 2020 Japan would surpass the United States in economic strength and become a new economic empire. Restricted by Japan's lack of nature resources, militarist forces inside the country will grow alongside economic development; when its military strength and armaments go beyond its needs for self-defense and reach a nondefensive stage, Japan will surely challenge China politically and militarily. By that time, the United States will change its policy from utilizing, inciting, and manipulating Japan to follow its strategy to supporting Japan's policy and strategy toward China. Under the present situation where the Soviet Union has disintegrated and Russia faces an unclear future in its political and economic reform, Japan's military development, which was previously aimed at preventing Soviet aggression, will take China as the target. Based on its economic as well as scientific and technological strength, which are constantly growing, Japan will engage in arms expansion and become the world's largest military power by the year 2020. Japan will rank first in the world in per capita military expenditure, 25 times higher than China. However, regarding Japan as China's archenemy in 2020 was not the only view expressed at the symposium. A Quarter of the Participants Still Consider the United States as China's Major Rival A quarter of the participants still consider U.S. hegemonism and power politics as China's greatest rival in 2020. In addition to continuously subverting and interfering in China's internal affairs through the means of ideological propaganda, the United States can also make use of Japan and South Korea to present military challenges to China. The United States is still the world's only military power, the leader of the western alliance, and the biggest backstage boss of political interests. Besides Japan and the United States, some people also keep an "imaginary enemy" in their mind. About 10 Percent of Participants Believe That Russia Is Going To Be China's Most Dangerous Enemy During the symposium, less than 10 percent of the participants held the view that Russia will become China's most dangerous enemy by the year 2020. They based this view on the adjoining territories of China and Russia, where a vast part of Chinese territory is inhabited by minority nationalities, on territorial disputes between the two countries, on Russia's long desire for China's territories, and on ideological differences between the two countries. When discussing China's relations with foreign countries, the issue of China forging an alliance with other countries was also brought out into the open. With a view to coping with China's present and future enemies, some people raised the idea of playing the Russia card. "Rebuild a Friendly Cooperative Relationship Between China and Russia" It was noted by many participants in the symposium that, judging from ties and strategic positions between nations, it is not practical for China to give up the chance to enter into an alliance with other countries. To serve the purpose of safeguarding China's national interests and social system, it suits China's interests to build nonideological allied relations or enter peace and cooperation treaties with Third World countries or Russia on the basis of mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and non-interference. Those present at the symposium also suggested that China should provide economic aid to Russia and CIS countries in order to rebuild a friendly cooperative relationship with Russia. They believe that building up a friendly cooperative relationship with Russia is the most practical strategy to adopt to contend with U.S. strategy toward China, and is also a strategy to guard against the revival of Japanese militarism in 2020. Veteran Generals Have a Tendency To Play the Russia Card A number of papers and data became the focus of the symposium, including a paper entitled "On Japan's Strategy Toward and Influence on China in the Year 2020," which was written by the Research Group for International Relations under the CPC Central Committee; a paper entitled "On Japan's Strategy Toward China in the Next Century," which was prepared by the Research Office for International Strategic Studies; papers under the headings "Japan Lists China as Its Number-One Political Enemy" and "Factors Leading to Anti-China Wars By Japan," which were published by the Research Office for Asian Military Intelligence; papers entitled "Japan's Influence on and Ambitions Toward Taiwan" and "the Realities of the Revival of Japanese Militarism," which were released by the Research Group on Far East Strategy; as well as data prepared by the Operations Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters under the heading "the Development and Strategy of Japanese Military Strength" and "Japan Possesses the Technology and Equipment To Produce Nuclear Weapons." All the veteran generals who attended the meeting had a tendency to play the Russia card, suggesting that China further promote its ties with Russia at an appropriate time. Military personnel who once studied in the Soviet Union even favored the idea of providing Russia with substantive economic aid to make a good impression on Russia. During the symposium, the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission submitted a 63,000-character, five-part final report under the heading "Analysis of This Symposium on the Current International Situation as well as Future Changes in the World Setup." Reflecting the CPC's Feeling of Isolation in the International Community A person in the know said privately after the meeting that this symposium served to reflect the CPC's present isolated position in the world, the feelings of the CPC's decisionmaking level of being cut off by the international community under the present situation where communism is declining, and the CPC's urgent desire to seek allies to resist the world-wide historical tide of democracy. He indicated: "However, it will prove a mistake if China picks Russia, for Russia is not the Soviet Union but `the former Soviet Union,' still less the Soviet Union of the Stalin era. This is one reason. The other reason is that China is faced with many variables, and who can guarantee that China will still be a 'socialist' paradise by the year 2020?" This person hates foreign aggressors bitterly, especially Japanese militarists. He believed, however, that once China is able to get onto the normal track of history and becomes powerful and rich, no enemy would scare China.
