Properly handling the relations between reform, development, and stability is of crucial importance to accomplishing all tasks this year. We have learned from the experiences we have gained from reforms and opening up during the past decade or so that reform, development, and stability are closely related; that nothing can be achieved without a stable social environment; and that stability can be fundamentally maintained only when we persist in carrying out reform, opening up to the outside world, and developing the economy. China's national economy has enjoyed two consecutive years of high growth, and our success has caught worldwide attention. Meanwhile, certain conditions for economic growth have become more stringent as a result of a "bottleneck" hindrance and increasing pressure from inflation during our economic development; and how to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic growth, ensure the successful implementation of all reform measures, and maintain social and political stability have become major problems to which all party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, must attach great importance and exert themselves to resolve. This year is crucial for implementing the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decision and changing the economic structure. Various major reform measures for establishing a socialist market economic structure have been introduced since early this year. The mission from now on is to make meticulous efforts in organizing their implementation. According to the objectives of establishing a socialist market economic structure, many reform measures to be carried out this year are preliminary in nature and we must follow the right direction and exert ourselves in establishing the new structure from the very beginning. Efforts must be made in this regard while reforming the financial, taxation, banking, investment, planning, and foreign trade systems so that a framework of the new structure can be set up. We must continue to implement the "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations Governing the Change of State-Owned Industrial Enterprise Operating Mechanisms," and exert positive efforts in changing the state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms and exploring effective ways to establish a modern enterprise system. We must expedite price reform in a timely manner and develop a consolidated, open, competitive, and orderly market system. The basic way to solve the outstanding problems and deep-seated economic problems lies in deepening reform. Without a deepened reform, it is unlikely we can expedite development and achieve stability. Leading authorities at all levels must rally and lead the broad masses of cadres and people to take a clear-cut stand in supporting reform, actively throw themselves into reform, and work earnestly and meticulously in pushing forward reform. To make sure that all reform projects can proceed healthily and successfully, we must sternly criticize and resolutely correct those who have disregarded the requirement of overall importance, gone their own ways, and acted erroneously -- such as recklessly raising prices -- by flaunting the banner of reform. The purpose of speeding up the pace of reform toward establishing a socialist market economic structure is to liberate and develop productive forces even further. We must firmly focus on economic construction and concentrate our efforts on boosting national economic development. Under no circumstances should we waver in this regard. Development is the last word. We need new ideas and ways to achieve development. While setting economic development targets, we must make sure that mental emancipation and being pratical are unified, that we attach greater importance to higher quality when pursuing higher total output, and that we never return to the old path of seeking high output value and expanding investments unscrupulously. We must steer our economic construction to the track of counting on scientific and technological progress and improving workers' qualities; make great efforts to readjust structures and achieve higher returns; and achieve higher growth through improving management, upgrading technology, and improving quality. Only growth achieved in such a way is solid. We must continue to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, comprehensively coordinate economic operations, and maintain a basic balance of economic aggregates. A sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development is the foundation of social stability; and it can also create an economic and social environment favorable for the reform process. To deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, and promote national economic and social development in all quarters, we must continue to consolidate political stability and unity and maintain social stability. The deepening of reform and the development of the economy certainly will give rise to readjustments of the patterns of interests in certain sectors and changes of mentality, and they will inevitably touch certain deep-seated contradictions and encounter many complex situations and issues never encountered before. We must correctly distinguish and handle the two different types of contradictions, and pay particular attention to knowing the development of things from small clues and checking erroneous ideas at the outset so that problems can be properly resolved when they are still in the bud. We must oppose bureaucraticism and subjectivism. We must go deep into the realities of life to investigate and study, to understand the people's mental state at all times, and to intensify and improve ideological and political work. We must establish close ties with the masses, care about their livelihood, and always be concerned with their well-being. While our reform is in line with the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of people, not everyone in all strata can enjoy the same interests and benefits at the same time during the reform process. Moreover, the levels of economic development are also very uneven in different areas. This being the case, we must pay special attention to caring for and assisting those who are not well off, or may even be quite badly off, for the time being. Upholding the principle of being firm in "promoting material civilization and socialist ethics at the same time," we must intensify building a socialist spiritual civilization and a democratic legal system, and harshly crack down on crime. We must remain sober minded and persist in cracking down on hostile forces' sabotage activities. In short, development is our objective, reform is the dynamics, and stability provides the guarantee. These three are an organic whole. Understanding and grasping the inner ties among them constitute the level and art of leadership which leading cadres at all levels, especially senior leading cadres, must have. During this new year, we must, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, firmly adhere to the guidance provided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and that provided by the party's basic line, comprehensively implement the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and seize new and even greater victories in our cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
