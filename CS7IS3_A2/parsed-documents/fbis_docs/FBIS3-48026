This was confirmed by Negri Sembilan police chief SAC [Senior Assistant Commissioner] 1 Abas Johar here. Kitingan was released from the Kamunting detention camp on December 22 last year after being held there under the Internal Security Act since May 13,1991, and put under restricted residence in Seremban for a duration of not more than two years. Under the earlier restriction order, Kitingan was not allowed to write or help to write any article that is political in nature, hold gatherings in his house or compound or in any building under his control or make Press statements. Kitingan, 45, collected his release letter after police officers escorted him from the Allson Klana Resort hotel to the police headquarters at 12.25pm [0425 GMT]. He said he was very happy and thanked Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, who is also Home Minister, for releasing him unconditionally. "I am very happy and I take this opportunity to thank Dr. Mahathir for releasing me without any conditions," he told reporters at the hotel lobby. Kitingan said he hoped the Prime Minister would also release other Sabah people who were still under restricted residence. He said he would leave for Sabah tomorrow morning. Asked if he would contest a seat in the forthcoming Sabah State elections, he said, he would do so if he was named as a candidate. [passage omitted]
