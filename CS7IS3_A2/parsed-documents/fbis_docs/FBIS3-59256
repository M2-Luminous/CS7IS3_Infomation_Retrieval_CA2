The governor, appointed by the British monarch, has supreme ruling power, so in reality the Hong Kong Government is an autocracy with the governor acting as dictator. The Executive Council and Legislative Council are nothing more than consulting bodies; the latter is not a true lawmaking body. The Hong Kong Government bears no resemblance to that in Britain, where power is divided among the three branches of government for checks and balances. Both the Green Paper and White Paper made it clear what the British are up to: An attempt to foist on Hong Kong what it did in its other colonies, namely decolonization. But Hong Kong is different from other British colonies. It is part of China territorially, so there is no question of its becoming independent. Britain should return to China the Chinese territory it had invaded. It should return the government to China, not to the people of Hong Kong. As for returning the government to the people, that would be up to the Chinese authorities. In the Green Paper, the British were still taking a go-slow approach. In the White Paper, however, they were trying to speed things up. About elections to the Legislative Council, for instance, the proposal was to advance to 1985 what was originally scheduled for 1988, that is, three years earlier. Under the Green Paper, there would be six elected seats on the council in 1984 and 1985 and 12 by 1988. The White Paper, on the other hand, called for 12 elected seats. In its debate on the government report with a number of Legislative Council members such as Dame Lydia Dunn, the Hong Kong British government also proposed setting up a ministerial system. It suggested that the government reassess the central organization, take steps to put together a ministerial system, something similar to what they had in the United States, and give the legislative body decision making power. The idea was to remove the decision making power currently held by the Executive Council, actually the governor, and hand it over to the legislature. That would change the present government framework fundamentally. Many people in Hong Kong were pleased with the British Government's relentless push for a representative system in Hong Kong and its move to change the local political framework drastically. Mostly these people had no confidence in China. Many other people, a majority of them from the upper and middle to upper crusts of society, were also concerned. The current issue of the magazine JIUSHI NIANDAI published two interviews, one with the senior unofficial member of the Executive Council, Zhong Shiyuan [6945 1102 337], and the other with a high-ranking official about to retire, Secretary for Home Affairs Li Dunyi [7812 2415 5030]. Their conversations spoke volumes. According to Zhong Shiyuan, when China said things would not change for 50 years, it did not mean there would be no change from the way things would be in 1997, but from the existing state of affairs. So he had three worries. First, would Hong Kong really be run by the people of Hong Kong, or would it be run by Beijing? Second, how can we ensure true non-intervention? Is it like the headquarters telling the manager of a branch office there would be no intervention? Third, can China guarantee that its open policy would remain in place and that it would not go back to its ultra-leftist line? Hong Kong had lost the first round, he said, so there was no reason why Hong Kong should keep the form of organization of the colonial government. Instead, it should adopt a political system of democratic elections. It should spend the three years switching to a representative system. Zhong Shiyuan disclosed two other things. First, he realized full well that when China said there would be no change for 50 years, it meant there would be no change from the existing situation, not the conditions in 1997. Be that as it may, they wanted to change the existing situation in 13 years. Second, how? A political system of popular elections. What Zhong Shiyuan said made it clear that the British strategy toward China's takeover of Hong Kong had changed. Executive Council members were kept abreast of what was going on in every round of the Sino-British talks. Many times either their opinions reflected those of the Hong Kong Government or they saw eye to eye with the latter. Li Dunyi was even more blunt. He said unequivocally, "Times have changed. We need to move from one era to the next. The way things are, the governor is appointed by people outside Hong Kong. We hope they will treat the people well, but they may turn out to be bad guys. I don't think anybody wants to see this situation continue in the next 13 years, all the way to the transfer of power. That is why we must switch to another system of government, specifically a legislature created through elections and an executive body that is held accountable to the legislature." He told the people of Hong Kong, "It is up to you from now on." The interviewer, JIUSHI NIANDAI chief editor Li Yi [2621 1837], asked him, "In the past the government has always shied away from changing the political system, even contending that few local citizens wanted to see a change in the system. Now it is pushing for change, radical change, in the political system." Referring to this inconsistency, Lidunyi said, "How can we justify it?" Li Yi then asked, "You had no choice under the circumstances?" He answered, "Absolutely not." Li Yi asked, "In the past some government officials kept telling us, `Democracy is not the only good system.' Indeed we don't have a democratic system..." Li Dunyi said, "That's right. Things were more quiet before there were any politics." As a high-ranking official in the Hong Kong Government, Li Dunyi was privy to insider information even though he was about to retire. What he said proved that Britain had changed its strategy in its maneuverings with China and awkwardly exposed the hypocrisy of the British government when it declared its intent to "return government to the people." An article at the time said, "Britain wants to make radical change in the next 13 years but demands no change for 50 years." [Installment No. 50] [24 Jun p 2] Britain Jumps the Gun on Political Reform; First Press Conference Touches Off Controversy At the beginning we did not fully understand the matter. We only knew that Britain wanted to introduce a representative system but had no inkling of its desire for radical change. I was not sure about the situation in Beijing, but at least that was the case in Hong Kong. When Beijing said, "No comment," we echoed it. In response to a reporter's question, I added, "This has to do with the British Government." Later Beijing picked up this line, saying, "This is a matter for the British Government. We have assumed no such obligation." Perhaps taking this as a sign of Chinese acquiescence, more and more Britain acted as though what it was doing was "inevitable." Based on information from all sources, particularly the statement "radical change in 13 years, no change in 50 years," we concluded that the British Government had indeed changed its strategy toward Hong Kong's return to China. Its jumping the gun on political reform for Hong Kong was all in all a premeditated move, a tangible expression of its assertions that it would continue its ties with Hong Kong beyond 1997 to protect its interests. It might continue to play the "public opinion card," even turning it into the "democracy card," and advanced the plan in the Sino-British Joint Declaration to reform the governmental system of the special administrative region after 1997. It might sell its political reform plan to the Hong Kong people as an example of British benevolent rule for Hong Kong in order to win the locals' goodwill and support. At the same time, its actions would further divide society, helping the Hong Kong British authorities nurture and develop pro-British forces which could be relied on to continue to rule Hong Kong after 1997 as a regent of London even in the absence of British rule. At my request Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378] called a meeting to discuss this matter. The meeting was attended by leaders from the Hong kong and Macao Affairs Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Foreign Affairs Office. By then the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already made representations to Britain, demanding that the switch to a representative system be consistent with the future basic law for Hong Kong and not affect the smooth transition in 1997. The British had not made any formal response by the time the meeting was held. At the meeting we speculated that Britain might try to bring about another kind of transition, that by speeding up reform it might create a fait accompli which the basic law must live with. By effecting radical change in 13 years while demanding no change for 50 years, it would in effect go back on its commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This was something China could not accept and must do its best to prevent. We were also aware that the Green Paper and White Paper had whetted the appetite for democracy among some people in society. If there was absolutely no change in 13 years, these people would be disappointed. There was also the need to help the British find a way to exit gracefully. In accordance with Deng Xiaoping's "step by step" approach, any move affecting the political system must be incremental and cautious. At the meeting I told Ji Pengfei that I had promised reporters in Hong Kong that I would hold a press conference upon my return from Beijing. Should they ask me what was discussed at the meeting, I said to Ji Pengfei, I would respond in accordance with the spirit of the conference. Ji Pengfei nodded and did not offer any objection. On 21 November I held a press conference at the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, the very first in my life. Both TV networks covered the event live. The moderator, Yang Qi [2799 1142], asked the reporters to present the questions in writing so that I could address them collectively after they were collected and assembled. The press conference was about to end when a female reporter from a radio station suddenly posed this question, "What is most essential to maintaining prosperity and stability in Hong Kong? What may happen now that would undermine such prosperity and stability?" Essentially this was how I responded, "The main thing is to proceed firmly, comprehensively, and substantively in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. If we depart from the provisions in the declaration, we may be undermining the declaration." "These days we can see some people are not operating in accordance with the document. We cannot but keep a close eye on them." "If there is any unexpected change, this must be it." The reporter shot back with this follow-up question, "Who really is not operating in accordance with the document?" I laughed, "I can't tell you now. The time is not quite right yet." Deputy director Chen Baijian [7115 0130 1017] of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, who accompanied me to the press conference, said, "We all have an idea as to who is not operating in accordance with the document." At this point I had already been fielding questions for over an hour; my glasses had fogged up, so I took them off to wipe them. I held them in my right hand and picked up a copy of the Sino-British Joint Declaration with my left hand, gesturing and talking at the same time. In photographs and on the TV screen I came across as quite emotional. My public acknowledgement of the existing rift between China and Britain touched off a chain of reactions, dubbed by the Hong Kong media as the "document controversy." The Hong Kong British Government responded swiftly, and so did the British Foreign Office. The British media too got busy and commented on my remarks. The British Foreign Office issued a statement reiterating that Britain "has the responsibility to govern Hong Kong until 1997. The Chinese government, on the other hand, is responsible for formulating the basic law. The governments of both nations are taking the Sino-British Joint Declaration as the point of departure." The Foreign Office also stressed that Britain had not violated the joint declaration. Some newspapers said, "With Beijing taking a high-handed approach, one is skeptical that China would give Hong Kong a substantial measure of self-rule." Locally, the community reacted strongly, with the Hang Seng index plunging 50 points. Some groups went so far as to protest to XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, complaining that I had been irresponsible in my statements. [Installment No. 51]
