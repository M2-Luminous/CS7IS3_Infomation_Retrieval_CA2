Specially informed sources in the eastern region affirmed that investigations have proven that the Iraqis there are experts in missiles, defense systems, radar, and planes. The first post where the Iraqis are stationed is in Madabay in Khawr Ashraf and Port Sudan city. This region was more or less a marginal station for radar before the coup by the Islamic Front. Recently, it has been reinforced with highly developed equipment, as well as computers. The region is experiencing strict security measures and 24-hour armed patrols roam around it. Shepherds and Arab nomads have been completely removed from the area within a 60 km circumference. The region of Dalawat on the Red Sea near the city of Hala'ib also has an Iraqi presence. The identity of the people is unknown and strict security measures are also in force. In addition, there is a station at the town of It, parallel to the city of 'Arus al-Sahaliyah where there are some Iranian elements. Alleged Iraqi experts were also seen in the region of Karnakanat on the northern coast of the city of Tawkar. This is a region for prospecting for natural gas. The contract of a French company working in this area was terminated. Some armed boats belonging to the Sudanese Navy are also in the same region supervised by Iranians. In addition, our sources confirm Iraqis are supervising the development of the secret airport in Udrus, west of al-Wihdah district, the last district of Port Sudan. This region is surrounded by special forces and shock troops to secure the area.
