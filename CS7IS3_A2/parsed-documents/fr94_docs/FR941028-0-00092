FR941028-0-00092 FR941028-0-00009 Second, OSM has deleted subparagraph (a)(2) of proposed §843.24. The proposed section would have required action by OSM when OSM determined that a State had systemically failed to comply with proposed §773.27, periodic check of ownership or control information. As has been discussed previously, OSM is deferring action on proposed §773.27 as part of a subsequent rulemaking. See 58 FR 34652 et seq. In dealing with a similar deferral with respect to proposed §843.23 described above in this preamble, OSM was able to allow references to proposed §843.23 to remain in other final rules in the event of the ultimate adoption of 843.23. If §843.23 is ultimately not adopted, the references in the final rules to it will be mere surplusage. Unlike those other references to proposed §843.23, the references to proposed §773.27 contained in final §843.24 are presented within a context of defining and applying a special standard, systemic noncompliance, applicable only to a State's failure to comply with §773.27. The rationale for adopting the particular standard of systemic noncompliance is inextricably linked to the issue of whether the adoption of proposed §773.27 is appropriate. Accordingly, both issues will be appropriately addressed together in the separate rulemaking. Thus, OSM has deleted all of subparagraph (a)(2) of proposed §843.24. Further, the provisions of paragraph (c) of proposed §843.24 would have required OSM to initiate action under §§735.21 or 886.18 and/or §733.12 if OSM determined that a State had failed to comply in a systemic manner with the State program equivalent to §773.27. In the final §843.24, OSM has deleted such language for the reasons justifying a similar deletion of subparagraph (a)(2) of the proposed rule. OSM emphasizes that the deletion of this language does not indicate that OSM has made a prejudgment with respect to the ultimate adoption of proposed §773.27 or with respect to the issue of systemic noncompliance with respect to such proposed section. These matters will be addressed in the subsequent rulemaking. In accordance with the above discussion, §843.24 is adopted as modified. III. Procedural Matters Effect of the Rule in Federal Program States and on Indian Lands This rule will apply, through cross-referencing, in those States with Federal programs: California, Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington. The Federal programs for these States appear at 30 CFR parts 905, 910, 912, 921, 922, 933, 937, 939, 941, 942, and 947, respectively. The rule will also apply through cross-referencing to Indian lands as provided in 30 CFR part 750. No comments were received concerning unique conditions in any of these Federal program states or on Indian lands which would require changes to the national rules or as specific amendments to any or all of the Federal programs or the Indian lands program.
