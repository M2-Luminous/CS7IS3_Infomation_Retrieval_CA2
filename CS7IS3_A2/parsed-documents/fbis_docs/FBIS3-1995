Statistical work is moving in the direction suitable to a socialist market economy. As a key link to changing statistical work in compliance with a market economy, the experiment on establishing and improving a new national economic accounting system has evolved into the phase of practice, and the basic framework of accounting systems for the state and provinces has been preliminarily established. The "China National Economic Accounting System (Experimental Program)," which was developed and formulated in 1992, not only tallies with China's actual situation in developing a socialist market economy but also conforms to the international norms commonly practiced in the world. Compared to China's original accounting system, the new system has made new breakthroughs in the scope, contents, and methods of accounting. China will comprehensively transfer to the new accounting system in 1995. Statistical organs in all localities and departments have treated this reform as their central work, whereas the State Statistical Bureau and the overwhelming majority of provincial, regional, and municipal statistical bureaus have fully used all kinds of statistical data, including those held by departments in charge of various businesses at all levels, to complete the compilation of gross national product [GNP] and the form for it, the input-output table, the flow of funds accounts, the balance of international payments, and other basic accounting forms, thus laying a foundation for a complete transfer to the new system. To meet the requirement of strengthening macroeconomic management, China has also studied and established relevant special statistical systems in carrying out statistical work. Together with the departments concerned, the State Statistical Bureau has formulated a program for improving the application of indexes to appraise and assess the industrial economy and a program for the trial computation of the quarterly GNP, in addition to having established the systems of industrial value added, sales, output value, a system for assessing and computing the economic efficiency of industrial enterprises, and a quarterly GNP accounting system. Meanwhile, to reflect in a timely manner the basic conditions in China's factors-of-production markets, the construction of development zones, and the development of trial state enterprise groups, the State Statistical Bureau also formulated the "system of synthetic statistical forms for factors-of-production markets and development zones" and the "system of statistical forms for trial state enterprise groups." The implementation of the new program using indexes to appraise and assess the economy has played a positive role in improving China's macroeconomic management and in correcting the tendency of pursuing an increase in output value alone and blindly competing with one another in terms of growth rates.
