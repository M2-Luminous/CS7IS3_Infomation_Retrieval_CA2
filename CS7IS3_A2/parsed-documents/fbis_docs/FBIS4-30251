In a statement issued on the railroad and subway workers' strikes, Yi said his government would not compromise with unlawfulness and sternly deal with the incident if only for the civilian-led government to fulfill its duty to promote democratization. The statement was made soon after he presided over an emergency ministers meeting at the Sejong-ro government building. The prime minister said in the statement that the railroad workers' strike was illegal since, he said, it was staged by those who are public officials in status and who, therefore, have no right to collective actions. Saying that split and confrontation within the country serve no national interests, Yi said the government would sincerely try to improve working conditions if striking workers regain reason and return to normal work.
