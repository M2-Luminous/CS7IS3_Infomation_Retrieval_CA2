Uros Lipuscek reports about his talks at the UN Headquarters: [Begin Lipuscek recording] Last night's talks between Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle and French Ambassador to the United Nations Jean-Bernard Merimee, who is presiding over the UN Security Council this month, and Brazilian Ambassador to the United Nations Raoul [name indistinct], president of the UN Sanctions Committee, have proven that, at the moment, there is no chance of the UN Security Council exempting Slovenia from the arms embargo. The president of the UN Security Council, according to Peterle, showed understanding for the Slovene views and proposed that the Slovene diplomacy continue the debate concerning this problem with the leading members of the UN Security Council. The Slovene foreign minister said that after the signing of the Partnership for Peace agreement, which we recently signed with NATO, and a successful development of the U.S. diplomatic action for the solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, some objections toward Slovenia have disappeared in this sense. Because of all this, the Slovene foreign minister believes that we are on a good way to having the UN Security Council exempt Slovenia from the arms embargo; however, one cannot specify exactly when that will happen. In the UN Security Council, Russia and Great Britain are categorically opposed to Slovenia's exemption from the embargo, while the French position is unclear. At a time when Russia is evidently still not ready to fully support the latest U.S. diplomatic initiative for solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, there seems to be absolutely no chance of Russia agreeing to, for example, the exemption of Slovenia from this embargo. Slovenia will stay on the former Yugoslavia train regarding weapons purchases until the superpowers have agreed on a uniform policy in the Balkans -- that is, when the solution for the Balkan crisis is in sight. That, despite the latest U.S. initiative, is still not in sight. That was also confirmed by last night's talks of Slovene Foreign Minister Peterle at UN Headquarters. [end recording]
