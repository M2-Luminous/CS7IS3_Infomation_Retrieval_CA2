Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister. [Silajdzic] Good evening. [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, the Muslims and Croats have agreed on a constitution in Vienna but not on a new map. What will be the next step -- talks on a new map, or talks with the Serbs on the return of territories? [Silajdzic] Well, let me tell you first that we are very glad that these negotiations are taking place in Austria, in Vienna, because the Austrian Government has spent a great deal of time and energy on this peace process. To answer your question, we are not yet discussing maps. We have to talk to the Serbian side to achieve a final settlement. [Hochner] It looks as though the Muslims and Croats might form a military alliance. Can you imagine that Croats and Muslims might take joint action against the Serbs and recapture the territories which they claim if no agreement should be achieved on a new map, for example? [Silajdzic] We believe that this draft constitution is a victory for peace and not for war. But everything is possible after two years of violence. After a very difficult situation of suffering, everything is possible. Yet, as I said, we sincerely hope for peace and not for war. We hope that the human rights mentioned in the draft constitution will have real meaning -- the right to life, the right to freedom, the right to free movement, the right to think, and the right to think differently. We hope that these things will be respected. They are all stipulated in the constitution. [Hochner] The Russians have recently intervened in the peace process in Bosnia. They reportedly cooperate very closely with the United States. However, there are also fears that a new East-West border will be established politically in the middle of your country. How do you assess the influence of the Russians? [Silajdzic] Well, I was in Moscow three days ago, and I openly spoke about our worries concerning this kind of Russian engagement. We cannot ignore one fact: that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy visited the occupied part of Bosnia-Herzegovina a few weeks ago, and that he gave nationalistic and incendiary speeches. A few weeks later, Russian troops came to Bosnia without being invited. The Bosnian Government was not consulted, and the troops were deployed on some lines in Sarajevo. We are afraid of a division of Sarajevo. We are afraid of a new Berlin Wall there. We will naturally do everything possible to prevent another Berlin Wall there. But we are worried. [Hochner] The UN embargo against the rest of Yugoslavia might be used as an instrument to exert pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. Do you believe that a lifting of the embargo might be promised to the rest of Yugoslavia to achieve a compromise among the Serbs in Bosnia? [Silajdzic] Are you talking about the arms embargo? [Hochner] I am speaking about the economic embargo. [Silajdzic] Yes, of course. But that should be done very cautiously. It must be done strictly in accordance with the withdrawal. I think that this is the only effective instrument in the hands of the international community. Unfortunately, the civilian population is affected by the embargo. That seems to be inevitable in order to make the Belgrade regime behave. [Hochner] Let me ask you a final question, Mr. Prime Minister. The Croats and the Bosnian-Muslim army of the government waged a bloody war against each other. Negotiations are now being held. How stable is the new basis of trust between the two ethnic groups? Do you think it might break again? [Silajdzic] As I said, everything can happen. Yet a direct and very important result of these talks is a stable cease-fire, particularly in Sarajevo and Mostar. This encourages us and gives us hope to continue. We hope for the best. [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for the interview. [Silajdzic] Thank you.
