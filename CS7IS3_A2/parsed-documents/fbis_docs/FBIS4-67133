It discussed the problems of fighting illegal drug trafficking in Ukraine. The acutely urgent issue of controlling illegal production, transportation, sale, and use of narcotic substances in Ukraine, as well as problems relating to providing the relevant bodies fighting this type of crime with the necessary equipment and financing, were discussed with representatives from the Ministries of Health, Finances, Internal Affairs, Environmental Protection, Education, and other state institutions. It was pointed out at the session, inter alia, that a shortage of funds allocated to the law enforcement bodies is weakening their actions to seize consignments of narcotics and arrest the persons carrying them. It was decided to submit for the consideration of the Cabinet of Ministers a proposal to allocate, in a separate paragraph in Ukraine's state budget, funds to fight the spread of narcotics and drug addiction. Those taking part in the session agreed on the necessity to start developing, in conjunction with the Academy of Science of Ukraine and the relevant government departments, Ukrainian-built equipment to detect narcotic substances during customs inspections, and also anesthetizing medical preparations that do not induce narcotic dependence.
