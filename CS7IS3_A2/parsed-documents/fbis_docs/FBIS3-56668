A vote cast by the speaker will be estimated at five points, first deputy speaker - four points, a committee chairman - one point, a deputy committee chairman - 0.5 points. During vote-counting, every point will be considered equal to 7 deputies' votes. The "Russia's Choice" bloc which received 11 points in the Duma council will have the best advantages. It is followed by the "New Regional Policy" faction which collected 9.5 points, the faction of the Liberal Democratic Party (9 points), the Agrarian Party (8 points) and other factions in hierarchy depending on the number of points they collected. The council of the State Duma will consist of 15 members, including the speaker and deputy speakers, heads of factions and deputy groups, committees, chairmen of vote-counting and mandatory commissions and a human rights commissioner. The "weightlifting categories" of factions and parliamentary groups are expected to play a decisive role when adopting draft bills.
