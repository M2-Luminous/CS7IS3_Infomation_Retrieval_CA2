During a political forum held on 9 February promoted by the Center for Latin American Studies, CELA, Ruben Blades, presidential candidate for the Papa Egoro Movement, MPE, said that the current government corruption in Panama fosters the "imperial arrogance" of the international financial institutions, IFI's, that for many years have disbursed million-dollar loans that have only benefited their promoters. He stressed that it is time to put an end to the dance of millions received through international credits supposedly to carry out social works, but which never reach the poor people. He added that those who pay the foreign debt obtain juicy profits in reward for their services. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 10 Feb 94 p 3A) At the same forum organized by CELA and sponsored by the EC, MPE presidential candidate Ruben Blades said he favors revising the Labor Code, privatizing public services, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Panama. Blades criticized corruption in the government and private sectors, and proposed the decentralization of the state, the purging of public administration, and independence of the Judicial Branch. On the subject of the U.S. military presence, he said the 20 December 1989 Just Cause military operation was not a "liberation, but an invasion." He added: "We have been clear. We believe in (Panama's) total demilitarization. That means the withdrawal of foreign troops from Panama."

Carles described the Just Cause military operation as a "liberation," and announced that if elected president, on 9 May he will send three delegates to Washington to seek a new relationship with the United States. According to Carles, since Panama will remain under "the Pentagon's umbrella," he will demand export quotas for our agricultural and manufactured products in exchange for the U.S. military presence beyond the year 2000. He also said he will repress drug trafficking and money laundering, and that he favors the privatization of public services. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 1) Presidential Candidate Carles traveled to Honduras on 14 February to visit industrial zones in that country. In a communique, the coalition supporting Carles said that the creation of industrial zones is being studied as a means to reducing unemployment in Panama. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 14 Feb p 2) Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes Escoffery ruled out the possibility of holding "a second round of elections" after 8 May. He said the subject was discussed by the National Commission for Revising the Electoral Code, but was not approved. Christian Democratic Party Legislator Guillermo Cochez has questioned Article 255 of the Electoral Code, which according to him violates Article 172 of the Constitution, which establishes that the president of the republic must be elected "by a majority of votes," meaning that he must obtain 51 percent of the votes. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 10 Feb p A-1) On 16 February, the Electoral Tribunal will officially announce its final decision on whether to reconsider the acceptance of candidates for the Authentic Liberal Party who did not present their documents in time to register for the upcoming elections.
