There is no doubt that the self-organized society is more progressive than the artificially structured one. But the industrial potential that took shape in past decades rejects market spontaneity, and the transition process has been conditioned by contradictory trends. Nonetheless, we have yet to see the harmonious combination of these extreme forms in a single government program. The dominant idea is the market, and merely when it reduces to crisis a sector that has succumbed to reform are backward steps taken in order to stabilize if only the low level of the economy, as was the case with industry in 1993, but subsequently the same type of alterations with, it has to be assumed, a new spiraling of collapse are programmed. That is, as long as a choice between different directions is possible, the leadership of the republic will opt for a path at the end of which we will find ourselves in an extraordinarily difficult situation with just one, nondiscretional, way out. And the forced measures are, as a rule, the former rejected methods of management, in their worst version, what is more. Swings between two polar-opposite approaches were clearly manifested, for example, in the program of socioeconomic development for the present year that has been drawn up by the government. Let us take the measures to stabilize prices and increase the well-being of society. As was to have been expected, control and prohibitory methods are prevalent here: government price control, a ban on the sale of foreign currency, a fuel price fork, restrictions of currency exchange, and so forth. But prohibitory campaigns even in the times of the command economy amounted in the initial demonstration period more often than not to selective repressive measures and, on the whole, merely engendered new problems. The method most beloved of our government is, it would seem, being taken from the arsenal of the state's regulatory influence on the market: commodity and dram intervention. With a well-computed quantity and precisely chosen time and place it does, possibly, have the desired effect. But if the measures are adopted inopportunely? Several attempts by the government to knock down prices in the market were condemned to fail from the very outset since, first, the action was mounted when the high prices had already taken hold; second, and this is particularly important, the quantity of the commodity that was poured out was so small as to have been unable to have had any powerful impact. The market did not even notice the flea-bite, but some people made out pretty well. More sober-minded people proposed simply selling the available stocks to the needy, and they were right. One-time interventions of a commodity, as of currency also, make sense as a calming influence given incidental outpourings and perturbations of the state of the market, but not as a means of rectification of a constantly intensifying crisis. It is necessary once again here to immediately combat the cause, not the effect. It is the economic policy of recent years that we have to thank first and foremost for the inconceivable deterioration in the well-being of the population of the republic, the shortage of basic necessities, the jacked-up prices, and the decline in the value of the dram. We could have avoided all this or have experienced it in a more tolerable form had the ill-considered price liberalization not been implemented, had there not been the accelerated winding down of state trade, had the sweeping privatization of agriculture not been undertaken, and had the state not begun hastily to rid itself of the leadership of industry. But let us examine these matters individually. Price Policy Price liberalization will continue. Certain measures of control and regulation will affect merely a very limited list of commodities, but commodities and services at fixed prices will be made available to the whole population. In our view, these are fundamentally mistaken measures. The point being that the formation of prices is genetically conditioned by the form of economic system. If it is basically composed of an aggregate of self-sufficient independent works, the natural form of the exchange of commodities is the market with a completely unrestricted price system. If, on the other hand, a state-organized production system operates, the price of a product is both coordinated and regulated by the state. With a mixed economy, pricing should reflect the predominant system of production. Both command intervention in the price relationships of private manufacturers and liberalization with the prevalence of the public sector are equally wrong (unless we are talking about special cases, of course). The state can merely maintain low prices for consumer goods in order to bring them into line with the established minimum wage. But this privilege cannot be extended to all, since income and remuneration in the private sector are of a market nature. Now, when the dance of prices is in full swing, and they are subject to the influence of the vast market of Russia and, partially, of the world market also, the state is required for the purpose of the stabilization of production and the social condition of part of the populace (whose income depends on the state and is for this reason less labile) to regulate in the public sector exchange, price relationships. It is necessary particularly to harmonize with the minimum wage the prices of a vitally necessary set of commodities and services, with their identical periodic indexation. In a number of instances it is more convenient to have prices tied to the market index, but to compensate them by subsidy. In order to successfully influence the market and regulate its prices, it is essential to bring the relative value of the consumer merchandise presented for sale by the state into line with the generated state product's share of the gross national product. Barter exchange, clearing, and state trade are perfectly capable of securing this proportion. Trade, the Market It is hard to provide any rational explanation for the fact that a working person in receipt of wages established on the basis of his labor in the public sector, where the bulk of the wealth of the republic is created, is supplied with goods in the marketplace, for here the tradesmen have put the price of his labor on the level of that of a laying hen. We can hardly be satisfied here with the explanation that it is easiest to privatize subjects of trade, and this is why the state has rid itself of the last component in the "commodity-money" system. The last instance of the movement of money has come to be in the hands of businessmen, and so it is they who hold sway over everything. The government is on the one hand devising special measures to stabilize prices and the dram and to restore the well-being of society and, on the other, never having understood cause and effect, evidently, is blessing that same policy of the privatization of trade. It is hard not to see the harm of such an act. First, we have acquired a distorted economy. It is based predominantly on a state system of production, and at the level of exchange, something akin to a market with some arbitrarily established commodity prices. A market economy has not eventuated, all the same, nor could it have. For this it is essential to have a certain number, meaningful in the overall system of production, of noninterconnected independent enterprises. Trade is not creating them. Second, the production-consumption chain, into which a mass of businessmen, more often than not simply profiteers and swindlers, has been squeezed, has been artificially extended. The super-profits that they obtain have served to increase prices. The remuneration of the direct producer has become meager compared with the income of those who, following a series of exchanges, sell to them the product of their labor. The coffers of the state, which has voluntarily given away its auriferous vein, are empty. The population is starving. Third, There has been a shift of stimulus of the activity of the entrepreneurs. Everyone has made a dash for trade, where it is possible to get rich without any particular effort. It has swallowed up, all else aside, human business capital also. Fourth, against the background of the virtually constant decline in production, a small group of people is becoming incredibly wealthy. The negligible good things that are still being created ultimately become the spoils of nimble smart operators who are very far removed from production, but who are dexterously availing themselves of the current situation. Personal income is concentrated in their hands. The structure of consumption is being distorted. The product of light industry, which could cover a considerable proportion of the national currency that has been issued, is going begging on account of the exorbitantly inflated prices of the products necessary for people's existence. In order to maintain the circulation of cash and drams, the government has been forced to switch its attention to the requirements of the latter-day nouveaux riches. They are interested least of all in investment in industry. You can indulge them with jewelry and foreign currency, which the government does from time to time, lest the dram be strangled at birth. The stabilization of the dram in January, which was an object of the unconcealed pride of the government, was secured by several measures: a delay in payments to the public, the sale of foodstuffs via state trade, a ban on the sale of currency, and currency intervention. The first measure in fact signified a reduction in personal income, which is simply impermissible. Prohibitory and control measures are ineffective, and currency is urgently needed for more important things. There remains, as a method for the future, state trade, but it is this that the program for 1994 assigns merely an auxiliary role for a sporadic impact on jacked-up prices. It is time to conclude the flawed market game. An alternative policy in the sphere of trade should consist of the state taking control of just as much of it as is necessary for the form of exchange to be brought into line with the form of production. It is possible to this end to organize the sale of a prudently limited quantity of basic necessities exclusively to employees of the public sector and to persons in receipt of a payment from public funds in a fixed per capita amount, with regard to their dependent underage children. To appoint for the corresponding organizations wholly subordinate stores and distribution outlets. Commodities purchased on a clearing or barter basis and via state trade without parasitical middlemen would be priced considerably below the market. This path would permit the social protection of the populace against mistakes of the reforms that are being undertaken, the enhancement and balance of consumer demand, consolidation of the position of the dram, and the preservation of foreign currency. Agriculture When the land was being exultantly distributed to the peasants, it was believed, evidently, that the sense of ownership would signify a growth of the productivity of rural labor to the level of the private farms of the West, almost, but no thought was given to the fact that the farmer is merely a link in an integral system of the production, shipment, processing, and sale of agricultural produce. All components of the system--be they the creation and servicing of equipment, the supply of chemical agents, or transport, marketing, or consultation services--operate in strictly interconnected fashion. The farmer has only to be squeezed out of this system, and, despite the astonishing degree of provision with equipment, production begins to decline sharply. What is to be expected of our peasant, whom we gave a piece of land and whom with delight and an expectation of gratitude we ejected from the former agro-industrial complex? He is no longer in a position to feed not so much several dozen people, as the farmer of developed countries is, but even the requisite dozen people, given the current ratio of the population of town and country. The disruption of the infrastructure and rural production has been the cause not only of a diminution in the volume of the agricultural product, but also of a considerable increase in its cost on account of the excrescence of intermediate service components. The farmstead cannot get the better of the middlemen fleecing it and is sliding toward subsistence farming. Last year, when the situation had become critical, the government was forced to take a step toward the former methods, making available to the countryside services at acceptable fixed prices. But in the program for 1994 it is proposing a directly opposite solution: the priority privatization of facilities of the agricultural infrastructure. It has to be assumed that this was more a political than an economic decision. With the alternative approach, the brunt of the servicing of rural labor is to be assumed by the state, the mistakes of the ill-considered privatization of the land being rectified hereby. Inasmuch as the peasant is now a proprietor, it is necessary to work out a form of settlement with him, making clearing on the strength of the actual or future agricultural product the basis. It is necessary to give thought to a series of measures for modernization of the countryside, create in vacant areas specialized farms, model animal husbandry and poultry-breeding units included, step up advisory services, and provide for material backing for progressive techniques on favorable terms. And the principal method of settlement between the rural worker and the state should be the product of rural labor in absolute or (in certain cases) relative values, what is more. Industry The slight stabilization of industry in 1993 was achieved thanks to centralized methods of management. Nonetheless, government policy, to judge by the program that has been presented, will be sustained in the previous reform style. It has been shown quite convincingly, it would seem, that the relatively developed industrial economic system of Armenia may function only with high organization linking all its components. Until self-formed internal relations have taken shape, they should be predetermined from outside, by central management. Otherwise, a collapse of the system affecting all its components will begin. But despite the obvious destructive phenomena, the policy of transformations remains invariable: On the one hand, the program provides for huge outlays on defense industry, the non-revenue-producing infrastructure, grants and subsidies to the countryside, loans to entrepreneurs, and on social needs, and, on the other, privatization and denationalization such as will ultimately signify a dissipation of resources and a further decline in production and, consequently, in receipts for the treasury will be undertaken. Such reform will also harm, for that matter, progress toward the goal for the sake of which it is being undertaken: the creation of a developed capitalist economy. First, the economic environment in which any enterprise, private included, can exist and operate will be destroyed. Second, funds that could be channeled into the allocation of credit to enterprise will be irretrievably lost. Third, the range of persons comprehending under the actual conditions problems of production and marketing will be limited. Instead of artificial "incubators" of business, the state has an opportunity to have a school of management at the enterprises themselves, attracting to them those who wish to show in business of what they are capable. The reform actions of the government amount mainly to privatization. It is notable that no document giving the go-ahead for privatization adduces economic justification of the benefit of this step or criteria of an evaluation of its consequences and the economic conditions and circumstances permitting or prohibiting the transfer of title of a specific facility. Merely a trend toward an order of priority of privatization is noticeable. Components of at times a global sector or sphere are being pulled into it, with a consistent switch from the lower stories of the economic system to the upper stories. Trade, agriculture, infrastructure, and small light industry enterprises, subsequently the rest also. In addition, it may be observed that preference in the order of priority is being given "weak," unprofitable enterprises, which is why the stimulus of a temporizing deterioration in their activity has begun to operate. Either the principle of easiness or of rapid turnover. A nonpoliticized attitude toward privatization should be based exclusively on the economic utility of each individual act. A set of criteria whose fulfillment could guarantee salutary consequences of a change in the form of ownership should be formulated. Specifically, inasmuch as the economy represents a multilevel interconnected system, from which it is impossible to remove in full any level without appreciable damage to the remaining and to the detached parts, it would make more sense to reduce the centralized pyramid system, severing it the length of the vertical line and thereby preserving the possibility of its stable operation. The principle of the redemption of the fixed capital only for the surplus product of an enterprise or for profit obtained thanks to the use of the production capacity granted its unrestricted enjoyment could be another criterion. Only the work force, management, or individual that by their labor, expanding and modernizing production, are able to show the prospects of the transfer to them of a given facility would deserve to become owners of state property. Several supplementary requirements would create an incentive to the labor, not the inaction, of the existing enterprises. In line with privatization, the public sector would be painlessly constricted, the sphere of market management being expanded. The transitional period could be considered complete when private capital investments cater in full for the further development of the economy--the level of self-sustaining growth. The adduced analysis of the government program has proceeded from the fundamental principles of the formation of an economic system and has attempted to reveal the strategy of the proposed methods. More than a year ago an author of these lines--then prime minister--raised before parliament the global issue of the direction of the reform policy. Unfortunately, the Supreme Council has not, evidently, deemed this problem of sufficient importance for its special study. This has enabled the government to continue unnoticed its former policy, hoping that the wood of shock therapy will not be visible behind the trees of specific decisions and, in this case, program measures.
