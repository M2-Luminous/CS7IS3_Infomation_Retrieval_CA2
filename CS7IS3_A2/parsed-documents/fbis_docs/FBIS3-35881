G. Andrejevs pointed out that this is "a speech that was thought over with great care so as to please everyone." Still, it has no direct link with the Baltic states and everybody can interpret it as they please. DIENA also interviewed leaders of several parliament factions, with the aim of discerning prevailing opinions in the Latvian parliament. Edvins Kide (Unity for Latvia) told DIENA that Kozyrev's statement was dictated by the existing state of affairs, because "Kozyrev has to show sternness to keep his post." As E. Kide saw things, the speech could also be explained by pressure from the Russian Liberal Democratic Party on foreign policy. Aleksandrs Kirsteins (LNNK) [Movement for Latvia's National Independence] told DIENA he would not pay much attention to what Kozyrev is saying because "at the moment, Russia has no government." In his opinion, A. Kozyrev is keen to keep his post in the Russian Government. A. Kirsteins was more impressed by DIENA's interview with Russian Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin, a deputy to the State Council from the Javlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc. The leader of the LNNK faction believes that the standpoints of Latvia and Russia could come closer together if Lukin became chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission in the Russian parliament. Filips Strogonovs (Equal Rights) told DIENA that Kozyrev's speech could be regarded from two points of view. He recalled that about 700,000 inhabitants of Latvia lack citizenship. "This gives Russia cause to speak in the name of these 700,000," said F. Strogonovs. Therefore, he thinks, it is important to resolve the problem of citizenship. On the other hand, the Russian geopolitical interests mentioned by Kozyrev are ungrounded because they reflect only Russian political ambition. "Our standpoint in this matter is the following: Latvia is an independent sovereign state, but we should not give cause, by way our policies, for other countries to interfere in our internal affairs," said F. Strogonovs. Aivars Kreituss (faction of the Democratic Party) confessed to DIENA that on the one hand, Kozyrev's utterances should not be treated seriously. He also saw the willingness of the Russian foreign affairs minister to obtain an important post. On the other hand, emphasized A. Kreituss, it is necessary to put in order and ensure Latvia's defense. "We should find twice as much money for its needs, at least to provide it with ammunition," said Kreituss. Maris Grinblats (Fatherland and Freedom) expressed his view to DIENA that A. Kozyrev's speech is somehow linked with the considerable influence of communists and liberal democrats in the Russian parliament. M. Grinblats concluded that Russian President Boris Yeltsin, as well as A. Kozyrev, are more inclined in the direction of these forces, to amortize the position of the more aggressive part of society. M. Grinblats said the policy of Russia during the last years indicates nonetheless, that the administration of B. Yeltsin prefers economic methods to keep the Baltic states in Russia's sphere of influence, rather than strictly military pressure. The leader of the Latvia's Way faction, Andrejs Pantelejevs, expressed his opinion to DIENA very laconically: "At the moment, we do not have sufficient information; it would be tragic if this statement was connected with the Clinton and Yeltsin summit; but it is not tragic if it is just a misunderstanding." Aida Predele (Union of Christian Democrats), in speaking to DIENA, deemed the statement by the Russian foreign minister as a high-level provocation.
