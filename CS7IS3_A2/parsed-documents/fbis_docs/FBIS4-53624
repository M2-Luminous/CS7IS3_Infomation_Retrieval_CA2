"Dango" [bid-rigging], a practice of coordinating the selection of contractors among construction companies, is going to be abolished. The construction industry, which has 530,000 firms and approximately 6 million directly employed workers in the country and shares more than 10 percent of Japan's Gross National Product (GNP), is now entering an unprecedented turning point in its history: a change in the 100th year. No Longer Involved in Coordinating Contract Winners "While we have no intention of stealing a march on other companies in the dango group, our main office directed us not to take part in coordinating the winner of a contract." The remarks of a person who is in charge of public works sales at Shimizu Corporation this year threw general contractors, who had been discussing the selection of a contractor for a dam construction project in the Hokuriku district, into an uproar. Three leading general contractors, Shimizu Corporation, Taisei Corporation, and Kajima Corporation, have already said that they will part with the bid-rigging system. Those companies retired from the frontline as agents for bid-rigging in the central construction industry, and the bid-rigging organization there has dissolved. In spite of all these changes, other contractors had assumed optimistically that the trend to eliminate bid-rigging was yet to affect the local construction industries, and that is why they are shocked. A medium general contractor which has been selected to be the winner for the dam construction project from among the firms in the dango group says, "We desperately tried to find out Shimizu's bid price." If Shimizu's bid price, decided independently by itself, is lower, the company selected in the bid-rigging will not be able to win the contract. The major premise of dango is that all the companies that are going to place a bid participate in it. Besides, the level of bid price can be very low if Shimizu, the top in the industry in terms of sales, is going to place a bid by its own criteria. This medium general contractor bid at the lowest possible price according to its financial strength and managed to win the contract. Shimizu's bid price was higher than previously expected. Although the person in charge of the project at the company complained, "We could have gained about 100 million yen more in profit," this is the result of the price competition between "bid-riggers" and "Shimizu." In face of the Fair Trade Commission, the construction industry has kept the practice of bid-rigging by going underground deeply. A person (deceased) in charge of bid-rigging at a major general contractor, who was once the secretary of the central bid-rigging organization, left the job of finding a place for the dango meetings to his son so as not to leave any trace. The chairman of the bid-rigging group at that time was Sukemasa Uera, former adviser of Tobishima Corporation, and the adviser of the organization was a prominent figure of a major trading company. Since a room at a hotel or a Japanese restaurant is not safe enough, a condominium was purchased under an individual's name, and remodeled so that a meeting could be held. [The secretary] even sent cooks from his home to prepare meals for the meeting in order to avoid the use of delivery services. Other Companies Will Follow Sooner or Later But all these efforts may end in vain. Shimizu is certain to go its own way in bidding on other public works projects, too. Some companies will follow Shimizu in the future. Bid-rigging, which was famous for its firm unity, has now begun to rust, even before the Fair Trade Commission begins to exercise its power. When the chairman of the central bid rigging organization changed from Uera to Kajima's Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama, the construction industry voiced concern if he "is all right." While bid-rigging had a function to control the selection of contractors so that contracts will not be monopolized by the major contractors, the people in the industry suspected that "Kiyoyama will always choose Kajima to be the winner for a contract." Leaving the discussion of whether bid-rigging is socially fair or not, the mechanism of bid-rigging to assure fairness within the industry was already collapsing during Kiyoyama's era. However, bid-rigging is not unique to the construction industry. The same kind of system exists among architecture companies. A major designing firm reveals that the "post office is the point." In bid-rigging, the dango chairman selects a company for a contract in a way that the awarding of contracts does not concentrate on a single firm by referring to past records. Nevertheless, there is even a better trump than the past records. A company which finds an unpublished project first has the priority in bid-rigging. In order to prove the date of discovery, "a post office is used." The location of the project is marked on a map, then the map is put in an envelope and sealed. After that, one rushes to a post office and simply has the envelope postmarked. At a bid-rigging meeting, the envelope is opened to claim the company's priority. The designing companies require much more time to change their consciousness. Favorable Argument Unjustifiable The head of a construction company of a South Korean financial cartel once said, "I envy Japan because bid-rigging is possible there. Since there is a company to steal a march on other companies, this practice is difficult in South Korea." This executive is in favor of bid-rigging for the following reason. While Western countries urge that "bid-rigging should be eliminated," their social structure is well prepared. On the other hand, in the developing Asian countries, the construction industry, which is responsible for improving infrastructure, will be impoverished by price competition and will not be able to accomplish its tasks unless the selection of contractors for public works projects is controlled by bid-rigging. Argument for bid-rigging does not hold water in today's Japan which has developed economically. But, the thought that "bid-rigging was necessary during the period when Japan was developing" still lingers at the hearts of the executives of Japan's construction industry. At a general meeting of the construction industry held at the beginning of this year, an owner-president of a semi-major general contractor blurted out, "Still, bid-rigging is necessary or we are in trouble." However, he retracted his words after he was severely scolded by other participants who said, "what if the Fair Trade Commission happens to learn your remarks?" The psychology of people in the industry has not changed since the days Japan was developing.
