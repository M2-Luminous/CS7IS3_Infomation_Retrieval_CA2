Following the congress, a new political entity should be established--the Democratic Union of Slovakia. We are going to discuss with Slovak Prime Minister Moravcik and Deputy Minister Roman Kovac certain aspects that proceeded this process. Both men also represent the leadership of the Platform of Political Realism. [Matejovic] Both entities are supporting liberal ideas. Why is the new party not going to assume a name like the Liberal Party or the National Liberal Party? What is the Democratic Union of Slovakia? [Moravcik] We have been contemplating for a long time what name to give to the newly established political entity. We have based our considerations on the fact that liberalism may not have strong traditions in Slovakia but is needed because it corresponds, to a certain extent, to the centrist thinking of the Slovaks who do not like extreme positions. We were afraid, however, that, if we called the entity "Liberal Party," people would not understand us. We want to convince people by implementing our policy program and not impress them by our name. We believe that in Slovakia we still have to constantly stress the democratic nature of the institutions we establish and that they are in harmony with the liberal program. This is why we, too, had to put the adjective "democratic" in the name of our union. [Kovac] We have founded the Democratic Union of Slovakia as a party of the center. We were slightly inspired by the French Democratic Union that developed, after several years, into a loose confederation of liberally oriented parties. Our original idea was to provide a space for an association of parties that would act as a union externally but internally would keep the structure of individual parties. We are open to fusion with other parties. [Matejovic] To what extent can the post-November syndrome based on political entities, which were established as various movements or unions involving a wide spectrum of opinions, pose a threat to the prospects of Slovak liberalism? Even the name of your organization indicates that this is an association of liberal streams and not a party that is a full and clear crystallization of the intensifying liberal tends in Slovak policy.... [Moravcik] I believe that the threat you indicated does not stem from the name of our party but from other facts. We have to eliminate it by presenting a clear orientation of our program that will be consistently implemented. The name "union" shows that all of the streams in the center should unite because they are scattered. We will try to persuade small parties to join us. [Matejovic] In the subconsciousness of the people, you are anti-Meciarites, who lay stress on the education and awareness of the nation. [Kovac] We have adopted the idea that educated people make an educated nation, which is very important, particularly for young people. Our concern is not to secure a large quantity of educated and qualified people but, rather, to properly evaluate their work. We are also embracing the idea that, in the 21st century, the most important ownership will be intellectual ownership, knowledge, and skills. If we do not set up this trend now and if the Slovak nation does not understand it now, we are bound to cut ourselves off from the European future. [Matejovic] Hagyari's Democratic Party is exerting efforts to establish something similar.... [Moravcik] I do not believe we are in a situation where we need to make it clear, as regards the Democratic Party, what the domain of our joint actions are. Their program is conservative, ours is liberal. [Matejovic] Apart from the Democratic Union of Slovakia, the Hungarian Civic Party is also supporting liberal ideas. This party has already become a member of the Liberal International. What kind of cooperation is there between the Slovak and the Hungarian liberals? [Moravcik] So far, we have not established contacts. I personally believe it is very important for the Hungarian political parties in Slovakia to integrate or at least cooperate more closely with the Slovak parties that have a similar program. It makes little sense to organize parties on the ethnic principle. [Kovac] Much will depend on what position the Hungarian Civic Party takes on the proposed triple coalition of Hungarian parties. We will certainly cooperate with liberals from the ranks of ethnic minorities. Among them, the Sub-Carpathian Germans are the closest to us.
