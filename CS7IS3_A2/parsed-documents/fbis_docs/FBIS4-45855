Interior Ministry spokesman, Chiyakon Sesawet, said there are as many as 1.3 million HIV infected people according to the Public Health Ministry's statistics for February. He described the figures as "very alarming." [passage omitted] Chiyakon believed that the number of HIV cases is rising because 75 per cent of Thai men sleep regularly with prostitutes. In addition, 44 per cent of teenage boys have their first sexual experience with prostitutes. Chiyakon said that the Interior Ministry has set up four committees in response to a request from the National Aids Committee for a coordinated campaign to try to redress the alarming spread of the deadly disease. The committees will take responsibility in planning, budgeting, public relations and analysis to ensure that the campaign is effective. Chiyakon said the Interior Ministry has also approved a plan to set up Aids- free clubs in some government and state enterprise agencies nationwide. "If the clubs prove successful in the fight against Aids, the ministry will expand the idea to cover all government and state agencies" he said. Chiyakon said the statistics released yesterday show that there are 5,215 Aids patients in Thailand, 85.3 per cent of them men and 12.7 per cent women.
