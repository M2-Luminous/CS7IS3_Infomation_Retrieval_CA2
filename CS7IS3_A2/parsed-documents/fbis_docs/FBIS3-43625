In response to this message, the Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC] and the coalition of forces of democratic change -- commonly known as the Allied Forces of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [FAUSOR] -- met at the People's Palace for the signing of the protocol agreement. The ceremony was to have taken place this afternoon at 1600, but it was not until later this evening that the two parties met at the Banquet Hall and the document has just been signed. Tumba Matulu, you have just arrived straight from the People's Palace. Tell us how things went there. [Matulu] It must be stated, Kabamba Kasongo, that things went on smoothly. At 1850, Messrs. Nguz A Karl-I-Bond of the FPC and (Simba-Wudu Ngwake Duntube) of the FAUSOR signed the protocol agreement. This document was also initialed by all the negotiators who were at the People's Palace for the ceremony which is still going on at the moment. As you know, the first consequence of the signing of this protocol agreement is the formation of a national reconciliation government. As was stated by the head of state, the new government to be formed will function in line with the spirit and letter of the People's Palace accords, particularly the special arrangement on the fair and balanced sharing of power.... [Kasongo, interrupting] Tumba Matulu, without interrupting you, you are talking of allies who have just signed the protocol agreement. Now, what has become of Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR]? [Matulu] I stress that it was (Simba-Wudu) who signed on behalf of the FAUSOR. You know we are in a democracy. There were the FPC and the USOR and Allied Forces. And, while the USOR did not turn up at the People's Palace the allies on the other hand were there. You will understand that we are in democracy. At any rate, since all the reports were also signed by the two main political groups, it was the majority that emerged, in spite of USOR's absence this evening. In other words, this protocol agreement which was laboriously negotiated by members of the FPC and those of USOR and Allied Forces will be binding virtually everyone. [passage omitted] [Kasongo] Apart from the people who normally turned up for the negotiations, were there some foreign personalities in the hall today? [Matulu] I would say no. At any rate, this is how things will go: As it was stipulated in the protocol agreement that foreign witnesses -- e.g. the OAU, the UN, Belgium, France, and the United States, the chairman of the High Council of the Republic [HCR], and the president of the Republic as he announced himself -- these personalities will be present at the second stage. So you understand that a solemn ceremony will now have to be organized -- this is (?a purely) protocol matter -- for the head of state to also sign the document. [passage omitted]. [Kasongo] Tumba Matulu, a last question, perhaps. Going by the president's speech, the idea was that the future prime minister come from the ranks of the opposition. Now, you have just said the opposition was absent. I am referring here to USOR. So does this now mean that the head of government will come from USOR's allies? [Matulu] Well, the allies are not in power. They belong to the opposition. The allies belong to the opposition. It is good you were with me at the People's Palace. The allies did not sit on the same side as the FPC. They, indeed, posed a great deal of problems to the FPC negotiators. Therefore, they belong to the opposition. They are people fighting against the government of the day and, to arrive at elections, it was said that we needed to play down our differences and go through this transition together, after which we will together take... [pauses]. The president of the Republic wished that the prime minister come from the opposition. The allies belong to the opposition, and they too have a lot of qualified people. If they agree and put up a highly competent person to the head of state... [pauses]. First of all, what are the criteria. A candidate to the post of prime minister must be someone who brings people together. In other words, he should be a person on whom there is consensus. Let us assume, for instance, that this very evening the allies appoint a candidate accepted by the FPC, you will understand that the head of state will have no option but to endorse this appointment in line with the spirit of these accords, and such a man will belong to the opposition. [Kasongo] And, Tumba Matulu, what do you say is the next stage? [Matulu] At the next stage, as I said, this protocol agreement will have to be signed by the head of state. The HCR chairman also has to sign it, because that is what the protocol agreement says. That will be the second stage. So it is a purely protocol matter and those responsible for organizing it may provide further information on the matter shortly.
