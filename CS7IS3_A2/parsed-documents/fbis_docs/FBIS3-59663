Expanding the use of national research facilities can benefit corporations. The world is looking for international contributions such as original research from Japan. Cooperation between the industrial world, academia, and national laboratories is one element that is lacking. A survey conducted by the Science and Technology Agency pointed out the lack of progress in shared use of advanced research equipment and facilities owned by government laboratories. The needs of industry and academia which would like more use of the advanced facilities at national laboratories have increased. If plans are devised to maintain the research environment to address this need, major contributions would be made to the development of leading-edge basic technologies along with the acceleration of basic research. Revised plans based on these survey results must be quickly reflected in policy. Many of the latest facilities and human resources are needed to advance the frontiers of basic technological development and basic research required in the rapid development of society. However, the facilities are expensive and too risky economically and in terms of research for corporations to individually acquire this equipment. If shared use is advanced in government laboratories, in addition to preventing duplicate investments of research funds, we could expect more activity in research exchanges with the government laboratories, in effect, killing two birds with one stone. However, the connection has only been opened between university and government lab as in Tsukuba City in Ibaraki prefecture. According to the survey, the need for various types of high performance analysis equipment and special test facilities has increased. This is because they can be used as tools in a wide range of research from basic to applied. Corporations, in particular, wish to use non-destructive test equipment, wind tunnels, earthquake-proof test equipment, while universities would like to use radiation test equipment and accelerators. According to a survey conducted around the beginning of July by Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun Ltd. of leading corporations (189 responses received), the total amount of investment in research and development for fiscal year 1993 was ¥6.3 trillion, a ¥3.1 billion increase over the previous year. Although the investment in equipment has decreased significantly due to the depressed economy, maintenance of R&D funds at a high level was reported. R&D funds, however, are only squeezed out of sales, thus affect research and development for discovering the seeds for future businesses given the protracted stagnation, and are not connected to the provision of an uninterrupted research environment. Neglecting the provision of research environment misses the chance of launching new businesses or frustrates the establishment of basic technology. The objective is the shared use of government laboratory facilities. The obstacles to joint research uncovered by the Science and Technology Agency survey were access difficulty by corporations, such as "difficulty in finding research partners" and "not obtaining information on research themes," as well as problems associated with handling the results, such as reverting patents. Although solutions and obstacles were summarized, their reflection in specific policies is the first manifestation of the report's significance. Cooperation between industry, academia, and government has already been established in the Research Exchange Act and must be promoted in the current stagnant economy. The fiscal year 1994 opening of the large-scale radiation facility in Hyogo prefecture currently under construction by the Science and Technology Agency is a facility planned in the Act and the provision of research environment for industry, academia, and government has been decided.
