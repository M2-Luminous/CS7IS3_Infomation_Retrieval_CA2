The rate of decline was the greatest since the ministry started the annual surveys in 1961. Ministry officials attributed the plunge chiefly to a 24.1 percent fall in construction orders from the private sector to 12.11 trillion yen -- the third straight yearly drop. Orders from the manufacturing industries, centered on the automotive and food businesses, posted a 37.1 percent decrease, and those from the nonmanufacturing industries a 21.3 percent fall. Orders from the public sector totaled 6.38 trillion yen, down 7.1 percent for the first fall in eight years. Authorities placed more orders with medium-sized and small construction companies and fewer orders with major firms following the uncovering last year of a series of bribery scandals involving general contractors and local government chiefs.
