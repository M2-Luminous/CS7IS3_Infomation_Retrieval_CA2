In the same breath people are saying that it was dictated by the expectations of West Berliners, who retain feelings of gratitude to the countries which supported the city materially at the height of the Cold War. Just who in particular "expects" this is impossible to determine, of course. It all reminds you of the well-worn cliche: "The general opinion is that...." Meanwhile, questions are being asked. Why, for example, has a decision on such an important matter, which should certainly not be "kept within the family," been made by the Berlin authorities? Why was the decision not made by representatives of the governments of the countries of the former anti-Hitler coalition in conjunction with the German Federal Government? Why are attempts being made to split reunited Berlin again by artificially resurrecting these old antagonisms? After all, whatever reservations may surround the aforementioned "policy decision," it is basically a discriminatory measure against our victorious army, our country, and our people. This is how things look: At the time when the vast machinery involved in withdrawing the Western Group of Forces had only just begun to roll and nothing but hard work could be seen on the road ahead, Russian servicemen were buoyed up by speeches about a new era and a new partnership. Now, however, when all that was needed was a kind and sincere word of farewell, they are having to look awkwardly over their shoulders and scrutinize those gloomy times in search of reasons to justify their own inconsistency. And all this at a time when a joint ceremonial send-off would appear to offer the most natural ground for strengthening the partnership, mutual liking, and personal contacts that are being established. A failure to take advantage of this event just to pander to someone's nearsightedness and capriciousness would be unpardonable.
