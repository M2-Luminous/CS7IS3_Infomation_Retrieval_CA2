Last week, this so-called third prime rate was still 5.58 percent. Shortly afterwards the Belgian National Bank announced a reduction of its money market rate from 5.7 to 5.6 percent. Experts consider it likely that over the next few days other central banks in Europe will also slightly reduce their interest rates.
