The winds, unexpected and violent, ushered in the issue of the official war declaration on the "currency hoarders" -- the local nickname given to speculators. Forty-eight hours after the closing of a special session of the National Assembly of the People's Government (Cuban Parliament), the Council of State complied with its first mandate -- to take strong action against those who have an illegitimate patrimony, be it the result of robbery, speculation, or the diversion of public funds. Other measures, which will affect the entire population, will be announced more calmly and in no more than 18 months. Cubans are currently concerned over a prospective rise in the cost of living, but they are willing to face it so long as the national economy and their own living standards improve in the long run. For over three decades, Cubans have lived under nearly absolute state protection. They did not have to worry about paying taxes or any other fiscal obligations, but the days of the paternalistic state seem to be drawing to a close. The shortcomings resulting from the collapse of Cuba's leading commercial partner in the former socialist bloc contributed to the shortcomings prompted by the U.S. blockade, internal deficiencies, and the absence of fiscal obligations to the depletion of the Treasury. Now, without any more delays, the country will proceed to restore order to its internal finances. With this objective, the National Assembly met in a special session on 1 and 2 May. According to the figures revealed by Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister president of the State Committee for Finance, at the end of March, currency excess in the population's hands amounted to 11.636 billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official Cuban exchange rate) while the budget deficit amounted to 4.2 billion pesos. Cuban academic sources are of the opinion that the excess money in the hands of the population -- equivalent to approximately 15 months of wages for all the workers in the country -- is unequally distributed. Therefore, out of the 59 percent of this amount deposited in banking accounts, one-fourth corresponds to only 1 percent of savings accounts. [sentence as received] The situation became difficult in 1987, the last year in which the budget was virtually balanced. Since then, in the first measures implemented to correct the imbalance, the state assumed the weight of the adjustment, by issuing currency without compensatory backing. Between 1989 and 1993, the country's import capacity fell from more than $8 billion to only $2.2 billion. This had a multiplying effect on domestic agriculture and industrial production, which were virtually paralyzed for lack of fuel, fertilizers, and other materials. The main effects of the crisis on the population were a decrease in food, scarcity of medicine, and a severe reduction in electricity and urban transportation. Besides that, most Cubans had to turn to the black market to obtain basic products such as soap, detergent, and cooking oil. The reform was begun without a set model. In what were the first firm steps, on 14 August, the Cuban Government decriminalized the holding and use of dollars and other strong foreign currencies among the population. It also changed a large part of the agriculture sector, which had been government-managed up to then, into cooperatives. This was followed by an in-depth reorganization of the state apparatus in April 1994, which reduced ministries and payrolls. According to specialists at the Center of Cuban Economic Studies (CEEC), the increase in tourism -- the second most important foreign exchange generator after sugar -- the increase in the production of nickel and domestic oil pointed toward the initiation of a partial recovery at the end of 1993. This prompted the government to find the necessary national consensus for the adjustments required to stimulate the incipient improvement. This was how a process called "the workers parliament" started and the country's problems and the possible solutions were studied in 80,000 assemblies held at work centers. The common denominator of those assemblies was the unanimous demand for the government to act against the people who profited from the country's shortages. The country's finances, however, require something more than the elimination of "money hoarders." In this sense, the corresponding minister proposed that tax revenues be increased and that savings and economic efficiency be encouraged. He also proposed that several subsidies be eliminated and did not deny the possibility of a future currency replacement. Jose Luis Rodriguez recommended that currency be collected by increasing the prices on fuel, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages. Also, that electricity, postal, and telephone rates be augmented, dependent on the improvement of those services, which are currently deficient. In an effort to promote economic efficiency, several months ago, material incentives were given to workers in priority fields such as in the sugar, mining, nickel, and electricity sectors. This measure has resulted in important production advancements. Another of the proposals to obtain revenues was through taxes. The taxes applied to persons who have been self-employed for the past year will be increased and it is estimated they will contribute not less than 126 million pesos to the 1994 budget. The elimination of subsidies is expected. This includes charging for sports and cultural events, as well as school lunches, school supplies for junior and high school students, and some medicine such as Neovitamin -- a vitamin supplement distributed without cost to the population since the outbreak of the optic neuritis epidemic in 1993. Regarding the replacement of the currency, economists such as Osvaldo Martinez, the president of the Economic Affairs Committee in the parliament, believe the measure would not have a lasting effect on the reappearance of the black market. Its defenders, however, claim the change attempts to achieve other financial control objectives. The measures, which are still not all known, according to the parliament's final resolution "will lead to gradually being able to surmount the current difficulties" and will ensure the protection of the low-income sectors. Despite all the foreseeable difficulties, the truth is that Cuba is launching an independent development, which foreign specialists and investors consider to be more advantageous in the long term.
