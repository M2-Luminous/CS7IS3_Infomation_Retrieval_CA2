FR941216-1-00051 FR941216-1-00010 (ii) Fixed but deferred contingent payments. This paragraph (b)(9)(ii) provides rules for computing interest accruals and adjustments under paragraph (b)(3) of this section when the amount of a contingent payment becomes fixed more than 6 months before the payment is due. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a payment is treated as a fixed payment if all remaining contingencies with respect to the payment are remote or incidental. (A) Determining adjustments. The amount of the adjustment attributable to the payment is equal to the difference between the present value of the amount that is fixed and the present value of the projected amount of the contingent payment. The present value of each amount is determined by discounting the amount from the date the payment is due to the date the payment becomes fixed, using a discount rate equal to the projected yield on the debt instrument. The adjustment is treated as a positive or negative adjustment, as appropriate, on the date the contingent payment becomes fixed. See paragraph (b)(9)(v) of this section to determine the timing of the adjustment if all remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument become fixed substantially contemporaneously. (B) Payment schedule. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the contingent payment is no longer treated as a contingent payment after the date the amount of the payment becomes fixed. On the date the contingent payment becomes fixed, the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument is modified prospectively to reflect the fixed amount of the payment. Therefore, no adjustment is made under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section when the contingent payment is actually made. (C) Accrual period. Notwithstanding the determination under ยง1.1272&hyph;1(b)(1)(ii) of accrual periods for the debt instrument, an accrual period ends on the day the contingent payment becomes fixed, and a new accrual period begins on the day after the day the contingent payment becomes fixed. (D) Basis and adjusted issue price. The amount of any positive adjustment on a debt instrument determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section increases the adjusted issue price of the instrument and the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument. The amount of any negative adjustment on a debt instrument determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section decreases the adjusted issue price of the instrument and the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument. (E) Special rule for certain contingent interest payments. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(9)(ii) (A), (B), (C), and (D) of this section, this paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(E) applies to contingent stated interest payments that are adjusted to compensate for contingencies regarding the reasonableness of the debt instrument's stated rate of interest. For example, this paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(E) applies to a debt instrument that provides for an increase in the stated rate of interest if the credit quality of the issuer or liquidity of the debt instrument deteriorates. Contingent stated interest payments of this type are recognized over the period to which they relate in a reasonable manner. (F) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section. In this example, assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. Example. Fixed but deferred payments_ (i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, B, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument at original issue for $1,000. The debt instrument matures on December 31, 2001, and provides for a payment of $1,000 at maturity. In addition, on December 31, 1998, and December 31, 2001, the debt instrument provides for payments equal to the excess of the average daily value of an index for the 6-month period ending on September 30 of the preceding year over a specified amount. The two contingent payments are substantially similar to options on the index. Assume that the two contingent payments are quotable contingent payments, and that, on the issue date, the forward price of the option that is exercisable on December 31, 1998, is $250 and the forward price of the option that is exercisable on December 31, 2001, is $440. Assume that B uses annual accrual periods. (ii) Interest accrual for 1996. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the debt instrument's projected payment schedule consists of a payment of $250 on December 31, 1998, and a payment of $1,440 on December 31, 2001. Thus, the debt instrument's projected yield is 10 percent, compounded annually. B includes a total of $100 of daily portions of interest in income in 1996. B's adjusted basis in the debt instrument and the debt instrument's adjusted issue price on December 31, 1996, is $1,100. (iii) Interest accrual for 1997_ (A) Adjustment. Based on the projected payment schedule, B would include $110 of total daily portions of interest in income in 1997. However, assume that on September 30, 1997, the payment due on December 31, 1998, fixes at $300, rather than the projected $250. Thus, on September 30, 1997, B has an adjustment equal to the difference between the present value of the $300 fixed amount and the present value of the $250 projected amount of the contingent payment. The present values of the two payments are determined by discounting each payment from the date the payment is due (December 31, 1998) to the date the payment becomes fixed (September 30, 1997), using a discount rate equal to 10 percent, compounded annually. The present value of the fixed payment is $266.30 and the present value of the projected amount of the contingent payment is $221.91. Thus, on September 30, 1997, B has a positive adjustment of $44.39 ($266.30&hyph;$221.91). (B) Effect of adjustment. Under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(C) of this section, B's accrual period ends on September 30, 1997. The daily portions of interest on the debt instrument for the period from January 1, 1997 to September 30, 1997 total $81.49. The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and B's adjusted basis in the debt instrument are thus increased over this period by $125.88 (the sum of the daily portions of interest of $81.49 and the positive adjustment of $44.39 made at the end of the period) to $1,225.88. For purposes of all future accrual periods, including the new accrual period from October 1, 1997, to December 31, 1997, the debt instrument's projected payment schedule is modified to reflect a fixed payment of $300 on December 31, 1998. Based on the new adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and the new projected payment schedule, the projected yield on the debt instrument does not change. (C) Interest accrual for 1997. Based on the modified projected payment schedule, $29.55 of interest accrues during the accrual period that ends on December 31, 1997. Because B has no other adjustments during 1997, the $44.39 positive adjustment on September 30, 1997, results in a net positive adjustment for 1997, which is additional interest for that year. Thus, B includes $155.43 ($81.49 + $29.55 + $44.39) of interest in income in 1997. B's adjusted basis in the debt instrument and the debt instrument's adjusted issue price on December 31, 1997, is $1,255.43 ($1,225.88 from the end of the prior accrual period plus $29.55 total daily portions for the current accrual period).
