Bolskiy and Vladislavlev, are able to ascertain "who is the most valuable from a historical standpoint." Meanwhile the leader of the association of goods manufacturers, Yuriy Skokov, expresses his presidential aspirations, while the producers themselves presented the president and the government with a package of 10 proposals, after which the financial crisis, in their opinion, vanished as if by magic. As expected, they are raising as a matter of priority concern for politically oriented people, the development of an economic program and a strategy for structural reorganization that is "coordinated with the goods manufacturers." The allergy to all types of programs, declared earlier by them on more than one occasion, it turns out is rooted in the absence of a visa for the goods manufacturers for developed programs. With the removal of this ommision and "having assigned priorities and outlined effective methods for supporting them," the country can look boldly into the future. Their advice is to slash the producers' nonpayments in a manner such that the government returns the debts to the rural areas -- whether or not the products were ordered by the state or they constitute a line in the budget is of little importance: the chief concern is whether or not the guns and butter are in the homeland's storage facilities, in accordance with the producer prices. The producers supplement the return of debts with a proposal to free the enterprises from bank credit interest rates, that is: in early 1993, the director seized 300 million rubles and, taking inflation into account, can pay out 40 million rubles. But this is not a limit for the "traders": they insist that they be granted two years of interest-free credit for augmenting their working capital. Meanwhile, no provision is made for such "ceilings" and if one recalls that commencing 1 January the balance value of the fixed capital of enterprises was increased on average by a factor of 25, then it becomes clear that such credit will prove to be very costly for the state. The subject of taxes, which suppress production, and the instincts of entrepreneurship are found throughout the document of the goods manufacturers. A reduction in the total amount of tax to 35 percent is being proposed. Although wise in principle, this measure is long overdue. According to data supplied by Minfin [Ministry of Finance], in 1993 the proportion of taxes amounted to 23.4 percent of the VVP [gross domestic product], a reduction of 2.7 percent compared to 1992. With regard to the almost mandatory requirement of the producers, to release from taxation in 1994, with no restrictions or reservations, all resources actually intended for investment in production, it is appropriate to cite here an evaluation provided by the chairman of Goskomnalog [State Committee for Taxes]. Vladimir Gusev stated that enterprises make only weak use of the benefits allowed by law for taxing the profits used for production development, preferring to increase wages or to spend for social assistance. And the directors themselves, according to Minister of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan, are "taking advantage of the legal chaos and rapidly increasing their own wages." It would seem that monthly earnings ranging from 2 to 7 million rubles can furnish some comfort to a plant administration that is oppressed by reforms. But no, today their state of well-being is low. They think about the future, proposing to raise export duties such that energy carriers generally will not be exported. A similar thought prevails with regard to import rates -- to protect themselves from foreign competitors, although a flowery proposal is being developed: on the one hand, the duties must ensure a "sensible priority for domestic goods manufacturers and, on the other, they must destroy monopolism in the internal market." The proposal "to introduce temporary state price regulation for primary energy resources, after first ensuring financial support for the extractive enterprises of initial processing," contains much that is interesting although high-sounding. That is, in all branches with the exception of TEK [fuel and energy complex], the prices are free and for TEK -- temporary subsidies, with the time period to be established later by the producers. It appears that they refer to these as "reforms -- for the people and not at their expense." In their present form, according to Yuriy Borodin, the general director of "Mashpribor" AO [joint stock company], the reforms pose a threat to the very existence of the nation and state." Hence the tenth point of the Proposal by the goods manufacturers is quite logical "to restore the thoughtlessly destroyed economic contacts with the republics which comprised the Soviet Union." It is doubtful if the manifest of economic outsiders was adopted by the government as a guide to action. But it is interesting as an indicator of the frame of mind of a considerable portion of our domestic directorate.
