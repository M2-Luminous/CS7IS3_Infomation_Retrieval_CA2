We cannot go without each other," said Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, speaking at the opening ceremony of the 19th World Gas Congress here on Monday. The premier stressed that Moscow is waiting for concrete proposals from the G7 countries on cooperation in regulating investment flows and on development of adequate and specific mechanisms for their encouragement and insurance. "Russia wants that the partners in the coming Naples summit should recognise it as `a country with a transition economy' and made new concrete moves to improve conditions of access of its goods to foreign markets," Chernomyrdin said. "I'm sure that the turning of the G7 into a G8 will bring about basically important and positive changes in the geopolitical balance and create new favourable conditions for Russia's full-fledged participation in the world economic system."
