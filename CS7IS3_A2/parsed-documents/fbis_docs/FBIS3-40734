He began his career in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine with George Habash, the faction that the farthest to the extreme left in order to restore Palestinian rights. He dealt with and struggled with its slogans and ambitions and nearly paid the price of his life. Through his confrontation with the Arab and western press and media, however, he learned the difference between slogans and reality, between politics and dreams. Al-Sadat and his peace with Israel were a reality the day Bassam Abu-Sharif shook his hand; he was disqualified from the Popular Front and joined 'Arafat's wing, believing in the steps that 'Arafat would take towards peace. There is a great controversy over Bassam Abu-Sharif: the puzzles, quotations, and contradictions. In its interview with him, AL-MAJALLAH tried to shed light on the puzzle and the contradictions. ['Abd-al-Karim] We often listen to your fiery statements, then find PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat and other senior PLO members denying them, some saying that these views do not represent the organization. A short time later we discover that what you said was true, and that it is as if their denial never was. Are these the roles you are assigned? You make a statement, they deny it, then they accept what you said? [Abu-Sharif] You have answered your own question. Media work and credibility are a sensitive and delicate balance, and it does not come in a night or an afternoon. Credibility is built over years, by relying on the truth that one says, and one does not necessarily say everything. I built my media credibility by telling the truth, but not, as I said, the whole truth. A media person does not say anything erroneous, because that hurts his credibility, and I built this credibility over the years, especially with the global media and the wire agencies. It has been proved to everyone, despite all the denials, that what I was saying was the truth. ['Abd-al-Karim] Why did the PLO recently issue a statement that made it sound as though you were being thrown out? [Abu-Sharif] I don't know what statement you're talking about. I haven't read any statement criticizing me. What has come up recently are the rumors of the media services because of the phone lines being cut in my office. I am telling the truth when I say that the sole, solitary reason for the cutting of the phone lines is that we had no money to pay the phone bills. ['Abd-al-Karim] Some people see this matter of not paying those bills as an excuse, and say that it was the PLO that cut off your lines, to say that Bassam Abu-Sharif has nothing to do with the organization, and so may not speak in its name. [Abu-Sharif] That is not true. The reason for cutting off the lines was lack of money. In spite of all that has been said in the press, these were the bills for the past four years. They piled up, and the telephone company moved slowly, though now it has cut off the lines, just as they cut off other lines in Tunis because the bills were not paid. I would like these lines to be restored at the first possible opportunity. ['Abd-al-Karim] Including 'Adnan Yasin's--which was open to the Mosad (the Israeli intelligence agency)? [Abu-Sharif] Well ... ['Abd-al-Karim] Can we talk about it? [Abu-Sharif] Telephone lines! ['Abd-al-Karim] Not 'Adnan Yasin's open lines to the Mosad? [Abu-Sharif] The story of 'Adnan Yasin should not be either minimized or exaggerated. Not minimizing this story is that it is a gravely serious matter, as 'Adnan Yasin held a post that enabled him to be in contact with all members of the leadership, to go into any office, and look into many matters. I believe the Palestinian leadership is now in the process of interrogating him and opening files that could lead to heads rolling! I don't know what has gone on in Tunis in recent days, but I believe that President Yasir 'Arafat has formed an investigative committee with honest people to clear up the matter Al-Hasan and Qari' ['Abd-al-Karim] What is the meaning of Hani al-Hasan's being appointed to post belonging to Qari', and making four official trips with President 'Arafat? He is the one who made the decision to expel him from the Executive Committee after going to Damascus and agreeing with ten organizations to adopt a stand against the agreement. How do you explain this move? How do you put it in perspective? Were these assigned roles too? [Abu-Sharif] The perspective is simple: this is Palestinian democracy. The views of the minority are respected, and no decisions are made against them, against the minority, depriving them of their jobs. After the decision was made to sign the agreement, President Yasir 'Arafat asked everyone, whether dissidents or supporters of the move, to enact this agreement and proceed on the road to peace. Hani al-Hasan is a member of the Palestinian organizational and legislative institutions, and a member of the Central Committee of Fatah; he has an active role. As to his being appointed chief of the negotiating team in the multinational talks, this is a sign that Hani al-Hasan, despite his dissident stance, has embarked on action to get the agreement enacted. ['Abd-al-Karim] I think the Palestinian democracy you are talking about is different from the political corridors, which go on in their normal fashion. There are those who talk about you yourself, when you were a member of the Popular Front, and when you suddenly joined the ranks of President 'Arafat. We don't know why you made the move: was it ideological, or was it a search for a niche for yourself? How do you explain all this? [Abu-Sharif] Let us begin with the end of the question. For my part, my leaving the Popular Front was the result of political positions. I am convinced that the political line of President Yasir 'Arafat is sound, and that the Palestinians are entering a new phase that requires them to review their position in the world, and to know that the contradictions of this world are no longer contradictions based on the balance of military power. This world is seeking stability based on economic competition; for the first time the interests of the world are in line with the establishment of a stable Middle East. In order for it to be established, the Palestinian problem must be solved. My political difference with the authority was what made me leave the Popular Front, and led the Popular Front to expel me openly when I shook hands with President Husni Mubarak at the African summit in Addis Ababa. As to Brother Hani al-Hasan, his meeting with the ten organizations, and the issuing of the declaration--we had invited all of them, including the Doctor [Habash], the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Democratic Front, once again to join the institutions of the PLO, in order to rebuild the infrastructure of Palestine, and to develop the economic state of Palestine. We are beginning with a first step, i.e., Gaza and Jericho, because the road is a long one, and we have no illusions. The thing is for everyone to work on rebuilding, and on ending the occupation of Palestinians in the occupied territories. Gaza-Jericho ['Abd-al-Karim] Are you one of the optimists about the Gaza-Jericho agreement? [Abu-Sharif] The truth is that I have criticisms of the agreement, and voiced them in the proper forums, but in general I am optimistic about the general course I see clearly coming from the Middle East. It is the most sensitive region of the world, with the strategic interests of the West and the vital interests of the peoples of the Middle East. There is a congruence, at this very moment, the historic moment, between the vital interests of the world in the Middle East, and the establishment of a stable Middle East. Now, they are not maintaining these interests just because they love the Arabs and the Palestinians. The West is seeking to create a stability in the Middle East that will prevent explosions, prevent wars, and so that the global groups involved in the Middle East may benefit from its resources and markets. The Middle East problem has also become, for the first time in 50 years, clearly linked in the mind of the West, and in the mind of the United States, with a solution for the question of Palestine, and an end to the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories. How can stability take hold as long as Israel has not withdrawn from the territories it occupied in 1967, without, in Reagan's phrase, "land for peace," first stated in 1982, and subsequently reaffirmed by President Bush when he announced the initiative that led to the Madrid peace conference, and the acceptance of the peace process so far. I am optimistic about the general course, starting with the congruence of the world's interests around the stability of the Middle East. On the other hand, I believe that Israel is in a very tight spot, perhaps a tighter spot than many of the Arabs. It is a difficult spot economically, spiritually, and strategically. I believe that the new generations in Israel are now convinced that there is no alternative to ending the occupation and getting rid of the Judaea and Samaria ideology which in itself has been an obstacle for long years. A step forward to ending the occupation and establishing peace with the Arabs enabling Israel to live in a world of big fish and little fish. As long as the little fish stick together in a school that cannot be swallowed by the big fish, they go, and they go like the wind. Israel, too, is defending its interests, and not because it loves the Arabs, or is giving in to the wishes of the Americans. All these factors have convinced me that we must seize this historic moment, from its circumstances, and take a step forward. Gaza-Jericho is a first step on the road to the establishment of a Palestinian national authority in the territories occupied in 1967, then confederation with Jordan, and these will be followed by many developments in the Middle East, leading, perhaps, to the establishment of a common market to protect the interests of the peoples of the Middle East. ['Abd-al-Karim] This is the political strategy you are discussing from one position; the matter would move smoothly according to your ambitions as Palestinians. But will the Israeli side think the same way? Or will it go the same way with you? [Abu-Sharif] I see the general course just as clearly as I can see you. At the same time, I have no illusions about this course being an easy one. There will be difficulties. There is an opposition in Israel, and there are extremists, just as we have an opposition and extremists. There are countries in the Middle East opposed to this course, though the majority, of course, support it. But we have no illusions. If the thing were easy, then why negotiate? The negotiations have one justification, which is to solve the problems pending between the two sides, and to reach compromises. I believe that this process will gradually build its inner dynamic. ['Abd-al-Karim] For you or for the Israelis? [Abu-Sharif] For all the sides, like a snowball: the farther it goes, the bigger it gets. Everyone will be persuaded by the start of the economic wheel and the building, or rebuilding process. Everyone will be persuaded that peace means economic development, that peace means wide-ranging prosperity; that peace means a morsel of food. Edward Sa'id's Opinion ['Abd-al-Karim] Edward Sa'id wrote in THE GUARDIAN of Britain that "secret negotiation between strong and weak is often at the expense of the weak, and in the interest of the strong. When the PLO went to Oslo and consented to secret negotiations, it contented itself with the weaker position." What do you think about that? [Abu-Sharif] I salute Edward Sa'id, the intellectual and writer, who is as far as possible from politics and political thinking. If Germany had refused to negotiate its surrender, we would not be seeing a strong Germany now. Political thinking is one thing, theories about weak and strong are something else. The strategic dimension of the Palestinian question will continue to exist. Had the Palestinians been weak, the Israelis would have put an end to them and to the Arab organizations over the last 45 years. They have waged wars against us that might have eliminated some other peoples. It is enough for me to remind Edward Sa'id of the battles in Jordan and the battles in Lebanon, of the PLO's other battles against Palestinians! Of the starvation in the camps, the destruction of the camps, of Israel's 27-year occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. I would also remind him of the 900,000 Arabs still in Israel as Israeli citizens, who are still Arabs who speak Arabic, who are proud of Arab poetry, and who give their children a good Arab upbringing. So we are strong; had we not been strong, Israel would not have sat down to negotiate with us on the basis of ending the Judaea and Samaria ideology--all their generations have been brought up to believe that [Judaea and Samaria] are an inseparable part of Israel. ['Abd-al-Karim] What concerns the Americans and the Egyptian mediators now is Syria's position, which rejects the secret agreement. Do you expect success on the Syrian front? [Abu-Sharif] The Syrian-Israeli axis is progressing. I expect the signature of an agreement in the near future; I also expect a Jordanian-Israeli agreement to be signed in a few days. And, of course, a Lebanese-Israeli agreement. It would be a mistake, however, to imagine that our problem, us, the Palestinians, is the problem of the occupation of the Golan or the occupation of the border strip [of Lebanon]. Syria is a fully existing state, with its people on its territory, its sovereignty in force over its land; there is a piece of occupied Syrian territory called the Golan. The issue between Syria and Israel is the schedule of Israel's withdrawal from a piece of land belonging to an existing country that has its own institutions, its people on its land, and its sovereignty in force. The same is true of Lebanon. The issue between Lebanon and Israel is the occupation of the border strip. Us, we have two issues; the first is actually Israel's withdrawal, and the second is the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and the establishment of institutions and sovereignty over the land which had heretofore not existed. Since 1948, the Palestinian people have lived under an Egyptian mandate in Gaza, and attached to Jordan in the West Bank. So we have two issues, and a solution to our problem will come in two phases. This has been agreed upon. On this basis, all of the Arab negotiating sides have participated in 10 rounds of negotiations. What we advanced in the declaration of principles was a first step on the road to finding a solution to one of the two questions, and the two questions together: as a first step, Israeli withdrawal from these areas and giving the Palestinian people the rule of a national authority throughout the territories. It is not true that the Palestinians isolated themselves or were isolated. The only peace with Israel that has any value for us is a comprehensive peace. That means a peace in which all the Arabs meet to sign on the basis of land for peace with Israel. The Economic Aspect ['Abd-al-Karim] In your interview you are focusing on the economic aspect. Don't you agree with me that the statements of Peres and Rabin call for a Middle East economic policy that would mean prosperity for everyone, including Israel? [Abu-Sharif] Don't you agree with me that such talk of a Middle Eastern economic market are premature? There can be no real progress at this level until a comprehensive peace has been realized. The Arab position here is absolutely clear, both in terms of the multinational meetings, and when the United States asked the Arabs to annul the Arab boycott resolutions. There can be no cooperation so long as there is no comprehensive peace, and comprehensive peace means the return of all the territories occupied in 1967, giving the Palestinian people its total right to self-determination. At that time, discussion of the establishment of a common market in the Middle East will become not only possible but, in my opinion, natural. ['Abd-al-Karim] Did you know about the accord or the secret talks going on in Oslo? [Abu-Sharif] I had absolutely no idea. I was like many of the members of the leadership: in the dark about it. This was clear, with the use of staff that was not very well known to negotiate with the Israelis, so that it would remain quiet and hidden. ['Abd-al-Karim] It's as if in this interview you want to grant legitimacy to the Israeli presence in the region, even though we were brought up to believe that the Zionist state had stolen part of Arab territory. [Abu-Sharif] Facts are facts, whether we like it or not, both for those who still call for the liberation of Palestine from the river to the sea, and those who signed the land-for-peace agreement. Israel is a fait accompli, and it is practical and necessary for our minds to deal with this; otherwise our people will remain under occupation, and we will remain in this miserable condition. The agreement that was signed is a declaration of principles and a first step on the road to establishing a Palestinian national authority in a Palestinian state on all the land occupied in 1967. It is based on the initiative established by the Palestine National Council [PNC]. It is the PNC that established recognition of Resolutions 242 and 338, and the recognition of Israel in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the land occupied in 1967. These are the facts; this is what those who do not want to remain in dreams and illusions must deal with. But the signature of this agreement does not prevent those who want to dream or imagine or continue in the strategic defense of the historic right of the Palestinian people, from doing so! I must say that it is not only the right but the obligation of our writers and intellectuals to keep on talking about this. With politicians it is different: they are dealing with it with the freedom of a people being crushed under occupation, with a morsel of food for these people, and their future. Regarding Acceptance ['Abd-al-Karim] We rejected Resolution 181 in 1947, and we rejected the proposals of the Palestinian Communist Party, which called for keeping the partition. We did not listen to Bourguiba's appeals, and Resolutions 242 and 338 were rejected. Al-Sadat was killed because of his visit [to Israel]. You were one of the rejectionists in all these things. What new factor came along for you to consider a policy of accepting reality? [Abu-Sharif] This is true. It is also true that there were resolutions adopted after all those you listed. There is--on 15 November 1988, the PNC resolution to build a new strategy. There is the declaration of a Palestinian state; there is the consent to Yasir 'Arafat's initiative, plus the decision to go to Madrid. These too are resolutions, and if they prove anything, it is that the Palestinian mind is not rigid, but flexible. Every resolution must be assessed at its time, and in the circumstances in which it was adopted. For example, today we cannot judge a decision made by Palestinians 40 years ago in their own circumstances. These developments show that the Palestinians, and Arabs, too--because the Palestinians are not going it alone--have received the news in this world and been able to learn the facts of the matter and the conditions the world is going through. The Middle East is part of the world, and they were able to draw a new political line; not one that would remove them from the political map, but to put them at the heart of the political map. I say this is a healthy sign. It indicates that the Arabs know what is going on around them and have become capable of defending their interests, instead of being unaware, as McMahon and British and French colonialism, and even the Israelis, made them in the past. They--the Israelis--fooled numerous Arab organizations, who cooperated with them to impose suffering on the map of the Middle East. ['Abd-al-Karim] As long as we are talking about regimes, permit me to point out that you in the PLO were dealing with most of the regimes, and with their diverse ideologies, in a balanced fashion. With the exception of the Kuwait affair, that is, because your tilt towards the Iraqi regime cost you the balance you had had. [Abu-Sharif] Frankly, I believe that there is a muddle and a mistake. The muddle is in interpreting the Palestinian position. The Palestinian position was clearly against the occupation, for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, for the withdrawal of the foreign forces, and for avoiding war and the calamities of war. The mistake was one of expression; a great many expressions from some Palestinian leaders made our position seem as though it supported the occupation of Kuwait. No, we did not support the occupation of Kuwait. Naturally, there were some who supported it, just as in the Arab world there were some for and some against, but the Palestinian position was against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. ['Abd-al-Karim] So, what do you call some Palestinian military units that were in Kuwait, with some of them questioning Kuwaiti citizens in interrogations? [Abu-Sharif] I don't think there were any Palestinian military units in Kuwait at all. ['Abd-al-Karim] Some people say that there were Palestinian forces side by side with the Iraqi forces. [Abu-Sharif] There was the Arab Liberation Front, and the Arab Liberation Front, as you know, is a branch of the Ba'th Party in Iraq, not a Palestinian organization. Here I am not denying that some Palestinians took a certain position, but it was not the official one. The official position was clear, and I am aware of the details due to the letters sent to numerous Arab and international figures. Our position, in its first paragraph, called for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the formation of an Arab political committee to find a political solution to prevent war and spare the Arabs its calamities. Persuading Saddam Husayn ['Abd-al-Karim] Is it true that Salah Khalaf (Abu-Iyad) clashed with Iraqi President Saddam Husayn during the invasion? [Abu-Sharif] The fact is that the Palestinian leadership's meetings with Saddam Husayn were for the most part attempts to persuade him of a political solution, attempts to convince him that it was essential to withdraw from Kuwait, attempts to convince him that the war would bring destruction upon everyone. Unfortunately, all that was shown on television was Abu-'Ammar embracing Saddam Husayn, and this image was put to evil uses, to harm the Palestinian position. Regarding the assassination of Abu-Iyad during that crisis, it had no connection with what you mention. Another Palestinian faction assassinated him. ['Abd-al-Karim] How will you confront Hamas inside the territories? They oppose the agreement. [Abu-Sharif] Hamas is against it. They have the right to express their view, and we respect their opinion, but we demand that they go along with the majority decision. The majority decision is the Palestinian decision, and internal conflicts will not be solved by the use of violence. That much is agreed upon: freedom to express opinions and the democratic struggle. ['Abd-al-Karim] What about the intifadah? [Abu-Sharif] The intifadah is the popular resistance to occupation. If the occupation ends, there is no need for resistance! ['Abd-al-Karim] But large areas of national territory are still occupied. [Abu-Sharif] No, this is a first step. The first step is Gaza and Jericho, and within nine months from this step, according to the agreement, come the rest of the West Bank territories. The question of Jerusalem remains to be negotiated in the next phase. I bid Bassam Abu-Sharif good-bye, convinced that he had not said everything, and we agreed to meet again when the first and genuine step is made: the day of the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho in a few weeks.
