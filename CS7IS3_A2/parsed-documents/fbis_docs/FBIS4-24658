They mainly employ the following tricks: They use deceptive methods to raise the price of equipment when submitting quotations. Under the pretext of "joint purchase and each having a share of the stock," they ask the Chinese side in the joint venture to remit foreign exchange to overseas bank accounts. Not knowing about their foul play, the Chinese side is cheated into remitting foreign exchange out of the country. They use intangible assets for investment and raise prices by introducing a no-price reference system and taking advantage of the Chinese side's difficulty in carrying out accurate appraisals, thus holding the stock of the joint venture and sharing its profits. By investing technology and equipment, they control the supply of materials needed for production and the right to purchase outside the country. They devour the Chinese side's foreign exchange outside the country by submitting high price quotations. Taking advantage of the Chinese side's eagerness for "more foreign exchange," they monopolize overseas sales channels and rights and cut off the link between Chinese enterprises and the international market. They lower the export price of commodities and raise the selling price of these commodities in foreign countries to make exorbitant profits abroad. They establish enterprise "groups" with "key enterprises" (enterprises with 50 percent or more of the stock in the possession of the foreign side) as their core and turn other enterprises in these "groups" into processing factories of the "key enterprises," thus controlling domestic sales of products manufactured by other enterprises. These "key enterprises" purchase other enterprises' products at low prices and thus make exorbitant profits through domestic commercial channels. Not long after investing, they withdraw their investment capital under false pretexts and allow production to continue with the Chinese side's capital or domestic bank loans. They participate in profit sharing by illegally obtaining qualifications. By taking advantage of policy differences between regions, they transfer their income to other tax-rate regions (usually low-tax regions) by irregular financial means, thus creating a false loss-making situation. They transfer cost expenses from an enterprise where they hold a high percentage of the stock to an enterprise where they hold a low percentage of the stocks or else they shelve the expenses to form a large "expense pending apportionment." In enterprises where they hold a low percentage of the stock, they shift the burden to the Chinese side. They make one investment and then repeatedly spirit it away to form capital with multiple registration. In this way they get profits from various aspects by illegally obtaining qualifications. They rent out or sell duty-free goods and equipment to others to receive exorbitant profits. They illegally engage in business operations which are prohibited by the state. By deceptive means, they cheat a large amount of capital out the Chinese side and deposit it into their accounts to obtain interest. They mix this interest with their business profits and remit it out of the country. When a joint-venture enterprise winds up due for certain reasons but has a surplus at liquidation, the foreign side will use diluted stock to participate in the distribution of the remaining assets. These tricks can be summed up in four types: Submitting high price quotations, occupying diluted stocks, taking advantage of price differences, and false accounting. Each trick manifests itself in the different development periods of joint-venture enterprises. These tricks by law-breaking foreign investors have caused losses of state assets, as well as the results of introducing foreign capital. Effective measures must be taken to stop them.
