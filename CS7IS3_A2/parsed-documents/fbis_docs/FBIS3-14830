This idea took shape during the party's first congress which ended its work in Moscow on Sunday. The congress drew party representatives from Russia's 64 regions. "We understand conservatism as something resting upon spirituality, morals, family", Shakhray told a news conference after the congress. He said "the Party of Russian Unity and Accord aims to restore upset ties with the tsarist Russia without totally repudiating the Soviet times". He told reporters the party did not yet have any programme, it "is expected to be adopted at the party's second congress this coming autumn". Participants in the first congress took a decision to publish a party newspaper. Among his potential allies, Shakhray listed the Yabloko (Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin) Bloc, entrepreneurs' movement, as well as organizations of social democratic orientation, while the party's main opponents are Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. The party leader did not rule out the possibility of tactical coordination of activities with the Russia's Choice bloc. However, he stressed that "we cannot regard them as our allies".
