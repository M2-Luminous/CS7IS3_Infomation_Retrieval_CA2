Laboratories, research personnel -- everything that was in place, says Professor Lars Olaf Kallings to TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBURO. Now the Belgian, French, and U.S. physicians, as well as other experts who were responsible for the project, have departed the area. Rwandans who were involved find themselves in flight either inside or outside the country. Rwanda has been hard hit by AIDS. A study conducted two years ago found that 45 percent of pregnant women in the country were infected with HIV. Rwanda at the AIDS Catastrophe's Epicenter "Rwanda, Burundi, and the Kagera area in Tanzania, and a part of Zaire comprise the epicenter of the African AIDS catastrophe," says Prof. Kallings, who is part of the international effort, but is on the the staff of the Swedish Public Health Institute in Stockholm. The UN World Health Organization (WHO) had selected Brazil, Uganda, Thailand, and Rwanda for the vaccine project. The research station and laboratory located in Kigali, the capital, had already produced good results before the appearance of any vaccine that could be tested on a large scale. "What we know about how the infection is spread from mother to child, and especially about the role of breast milk, has often come from studies in Rwanda, just as understanding of how a noninfected partner in a marriage can be protected," says Kallings. He emphasizes that WHO's Rwanda project was not tainted by colonialism. It did not operate by having foreign exports come to an underveloped country in order to demonstrate how things were to be done. The Rwandan authorities and Rwandan staff personnel played a large role, he stated. "It is tragic that this is now all destroyed. Moreover, Rwanda is a country that in general has great need of the results from the vaccine project," he says. Enormous Streams of Refugees "We don't know how the institutions that were responsible for the project have been impacted by the war. But we can fear the worst." In Kinshasa, located in neighboring Zaire, is found a good AIDS laboratory with significance for the entire region. Riots a couple of years ago led to plundering of the building. The refrigerator was lifted out and all tests destroyed, states Kallings, and he now fears the same sort of thing is now happening in Kigali. Enormous waves of refugees have fled from Rwanda over the past month, especially into Tanzania. "We know that war and fleeing of people leads to spreading the infection," asserts Prof. Kallings.
