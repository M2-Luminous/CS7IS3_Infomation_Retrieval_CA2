Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said in a statement today that this aggression is part of the ethnic cleansing that the Serbs are carrying out in Bosnia, describing it as a criminal aggression. Musa added that reluctance in halting the Serbian aggression against Gorazde again raises the question of how the influential countries and NATO stand on these attacks. He called for adopting immediate, deterrent measures against the Serbian aggression and to save the city's residents from the continuing bombardment. He also called for trying those responsible for the ethnic cleansing.
