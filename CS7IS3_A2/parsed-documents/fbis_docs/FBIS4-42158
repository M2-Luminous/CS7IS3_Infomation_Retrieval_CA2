In an interview with CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] correspondent Apostolis Zoubaniotis, Lamb said that he has the impression that the UN secretary general's report will be very harsh and that to all appearances, he will terminate this round of talks on the CBM's. The United States, Lamb added, will not waste its time if one of the parties is not interested in negotiating in goodwill. According to our correspondent, Lamb who would have retired at the end of May, was asked to remain in his duties for one more week. Our correspondent also reports that in the next couple of days the State Department leadership will make known its position on the developments in the Cyprus issue. According to a U.S. official, very few expect Denktas to give a positive answer on the CBM's.
