Habibie here Monday. "Taiwan has no experience in producing such type of aeroplane, so that it would like to learn from Indonesia which has 18 years of experience in non-military aircraft production," he told the press after meeting with Germany's junior minister, Ursula Seiler Albring, of the German Foreign Ministry. [passage omitted] Habibie quoted Taiwan President Li Teng-hui as saying that Taiwan would like to learn from Indonesia in manufacturing non-military aeroplanes in line with the country's effort in demilitarization. [passage omitted] At the meeting, Habibie urged Taiwan to increase its investment in Indonesia. Taiwan's direct investment in Indonesia in 1993 was recorded only at U.S. $124.6 million or a sharp decrease from U.S. $1.06 billion in 1991. "Taiwan pledged to muster its enterpreneurs and business sector to invest in Indonesia," he added. Habibie, who made clear that he met the Taiwan president in his capacity as a scientist, said that he learned much about issues on village development from President Li Teng-hui who is an expert in agronomy and village development. "Indonesia would also like to explore the possibility of establishing cooperation with Taiwan in the development of villages," he said, adding that Taiwan has suceeded in industrializing 70 percent of all its villages. We can take, as an example, Taiwan's experience that if the villages are integrated into the industrialization process of the country, the village community will also be able to transform themselves into becoming industrial technocrats," he said.
