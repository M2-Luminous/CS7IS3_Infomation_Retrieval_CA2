Sawr 8th, which corresponds with the victory of the Islamic revolution in our country, revives the memory of the great resurrection of our nation and of more than 14 years of jihad and liberation struggle by every compatriot. On this very day two years ago the sound of God is Great [preceding three words spoken in Arabic] echoed far and wide in this land of heroes and the splendid flag of monotheism was unfurled. On this day the mojahedin of Afghanistan and the entire warrior and believer nation saw for themselves the fruit of jihad and the promise of God, and our people were freed from the degrading communist culture and from ideological and social degradation. On this occasion I would like to present my cordial congratulations to you, the free and heroic nation which demonstrated steadfastness, fortitude, and resistance and which eventually bravely achieved the victory of the Islamic revolution. Sawr 8th opened a new chapter in the ancient history of Afghanistan, and without doubt future generations across the Islamic, free, independent, united, and unified Afghanistan will celebrate this day as the dearest blood-price of the fighters on the path of righteousness and monotheism with jubilation and enthusiasm. It is appropriate that on such a day we should mark the second anniversary of our Islamic revolution, to honor the victory of the revolution as the blood-price of the martyrs of Islam and freedom in their tulip-colored shrouds and pray for the souls of those brave free men of this land who raised the flag of monotheism and guarded our independence and national sovereignty with their pure blood. We pray that God will make paradise their abode and residence. There is no doubt that the Afghan jihad brought great changes in the world in the interest of peace and freedom. One result of this is the independence of many countries who lived, directly or indirectly, for many years under [word indistinct] of the former Soviet Union. The international system of communism as a base of [words indistinct] terror and colonialism disappeared. The Berlin wall in the heart of Europe fell, [words indistinct] and the period of the cold war ended, and a new era of understanding among countries and continents began. The 14-year jihad of the people of Afghanistan and its great international impact, which is called [words indistinct] of the century, cost our nation very dearly. With the victory of the Islamic revolution the jihad leaders and the Islamic state declared a general amnesty -- the greatest example of Islamic and humanitarian forbearance and forgiveness. It was thereby decided that clashes and hostilities -- created by looting aliens and their uncultured servants -- were to be ended for good and replaced with Islamic fraternity and cooperation. As for the living standards of state employees, despite budget restrictions the salaries of state employees have been doubled and the overdue allowances of civil servants and other state employees have been paid. It must be mentioned that despite the fighting and its huge costs, the state has been able to pay the salaries and other allowances of state employees up to the month of Hamal 1373, and to pay about seven billion afghanis to the families of the martyrs, the wounded, and those whose property was damaged. Steps have been taken to eliminate the atheist communist culture which was inculcated in certain circles of our society under the atheist regime, and a program of economic, social, and cultural policies of the Islamic state has been initiated within the limits of high national interests and lofty Islamic teachings. In the international field, efforts have been made for the country to emerge from diplomatic isolation and to enter a new stage of constructive diplomacy in the interest of peace, the reconstruction of the country, and relations [words indistinct] with neighbors and all nations of the world. Dear compatriots, the list of measures and achievements of the Islamic State of Afghanistan would certainly have been much longer but for treacherous conspiracies and ruinous battles waged by the traitorous elements against the achievements of jihad and the national interest. We mark this great victory at a time when, unfortunately due to the power-seeking of known groups and agents of the aliens, a bloody and ruinous war has been imposed on our nation, especially on the oppressed residents of Kabul. In this bloody hostility, the Islamic state has no goal but defense of the oppressed people. After the victory of the Islamic revolution no armed clash inside the country has an Islamic and sharia basis. Yes, after 14 years of jihad and after enduring enormous hardships, the people of Afghanistan were expecting that with the establishment of the Islamic State an epoch of order, tranquillity, stability and good intention and welfare would begin. They hoped that no pain, and that too from the side of the jihadi ranks, would threaten their individual and social life. But because of the fiendish and opportunist forces,inside and abroad, who preferred their personal and group interest on the interests of Islam and national interest and who could not bear a powerful, united and developing Afghanistan in the heart of the continent of Asia, as a foundation of freedom and justice, embarked on sabotage and destruction. As a result of those bloody conspiracies our material and morale forces, which should have been employed for the reconstruction of the country and for the repair of damages caused by the war, have been, unfortunately, used for further destruction and the killing of our defenseless and innocent compatriots. Those hostile acts began as from the first days when state power was handed over to mojahedin. When the gang-leaders of this catastrophe [words indistinct], and sometimes under the pretext of opposing the militia and sometimes opposition to some heroic personalities of jihad fanned the flame of war of [word indistinct] and fratricide. And thereby not only did they embark on killing and destruction in the country but also made questionable many years' prides of the mojahedin in and out of the country. In pursuit of a peace-seeking policy and observing the strategy of understanding and talks for the solution of problems, the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan] entered negotiations patiently and even ignored their organized conspiracies for the sake of the high national interests and the urgent realization of peace and security and resorted to the solution of problems through peaceful means when the ruthless warmongers embarked on chaos and destruction, and went anywhere possible in search of peace. But the other side did not adhere to any treaty and agreement. Their last treacherous attempt, in the form of the 11th Jadi [1 January] coup d'etat of the sinister triangle, occurred only three days after the signing of an agreement which had been initiated by the peace delegation of the cabinet. The coup d'etat plan was executed on a day which corresponded the date of the establishment of the infamous Khalq party [People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]. In the incongruous composition of the putschists, known atheists, national traitors, and hypocrites have gathered in the form of a shameful coalition against Islam and Islamic sovereignty and against the people and the interests of the Afghan nation [37-second break in reception]. When the [word indistinct] of the coup d'etat were frustrated in their action, they embarked on retaliation against the afflicted people of Afghanistan and the residents of Kabul, and closed the road for the people whom they claim to be ruling, embarked on the intensification of war and rocket launching and the destruction of private and state property. It had not been seen in the history of the world for the prime minister of a country to commit such crimes against the residents of his capital, and it has nowhere been seen for a prime minister, who had been disappointed to seize power in a monopolized manner, to announce if he did not accede to power in a desired way, I would continue the killing of the defenseless nation for another 25 years. It is interesting that they call elections a solution, and still think that they will be winners in elections, and expect that the people of Afghanistan will vote the killers of their children and the destroyers of their homes and those who strangulate them every moment by the imposition of famine and high prices of primary goods. The people have recognized their enemies. Dear compatriots, we are of the opinion that the principled way of the solution of the current crisis of the country is the creation of an effective electoral mechanism for the appointment of the future leadership of Afghanistan. As in the past, war cannot resolve the smallest of problems but it adds to the hardship. In the opinion of the ISA, talks and understanding for the cessation of war and bloodshed and for the joint search for solution of the problems of the country are preferable and have priority. Now the time of the rejection of the mojahed forces and their upstaging in the process of determining the fate of the country has passed. We should all jointly participate in the cessation of the disputes in the high interest of the country. Our faithful and patriotic people are seriously in need of peace and security. They should practically condemn these warmongers, and should not allow any person or force to obstruct the tranquillity of our people and the stability of the situation. The homeland is the common home of all of us. All son of this land, belonging to any nationality or tribe and living in any part of the country and speaking any language, are equally responsible before the country. The defense of its independence and honors, effort and striving for its construction and prosperity are of the common responsibility of all residents of this land. Defense of independence and its honor and work for the country's reconstruction are the common duties and responsibilities of all who live in this country. Another most important duty of our people is to foil and repulse the (?enemies) [words indistinct] who are causing sedition and disorder in their own self-interests or on the instruction of groups to whom they are attached. We believe that the faithful and honest sons of this country are able to resolve and to end the present crisis and any other crisis in their country without foreign interference. I believe that the people of Afghanistan themselves are confident arbitrators and judges with the right and authority regarding the national issues of Afghanistan. The people must have the opportunity to use this right and to decide about their homeland and its future, its political system, and its organizational structure. Respecting the will of the people is an Islamic command and an accepted international tradition. Therefore, with regard to the solution of current problems, we believe that a council [shura] representing the will of the people should be set up. Whatever this council is called or whatever name they give to it -- great council [loya jerga], constituent council [shura-e hal wa aqd], grand council [grand majlis], or any other name -- all nationalities, clans and tribes, religious sects, and the country's various regions are to have proportionate representation in this council. A nongovernmental and competent commission named the Preparatory Commission for the Formation of the Shura is to be set up in order to prevent and to eliminate every possible kind of pressure likely to be exerted on the work of this council or to prevent any question about its work. This commission will be tasked with preparing the draft for setting up this council and determining the procedure for the election of council members and candidates for the country's leadership. This commission will have [word indistinct] executive authority and its expenses are to be paid by the conference of foreign ministers of the Islamic countries and the United Nations. These two international organizations can supervise the work of setting up this council. [words indistinct] I call on the esteemed arbitrator delegation and all those who are working for peace to take action as soon as possible to set up this Shura. As soon as this work is completed I am ready to hand over all power immediately to this council. I declare clearly and earnestly to the brave people of Afghanistan that I personally do not wish to shed even one drop of blood of our persecuted people for whatever reason or objective. We have already shown the necessary readiness, and in the future too we are ready to take every beneficial action on this path. After this council has been set up, as pointed out, state power will be handed over. This council will elect the future leadership in conformity with the will and wish of the entire people. The council's decision must be respected by all. It is my duty here to express appreciation for the work and earnest endeavor of the peace delegations inside the country and the esteemed ulema from the Islamic countries, as well as for the work and efforts of the United Nations (?and the UN peace delegation) led by esteemed M. Mestiri who have been working very hard. I hope that as a result of the efforts of the caring people inside the country and the cooperation of the friendly and neighborly countries and international organizations, especially the OIC and UN, the current problem in our country be resolved and peace and security be restored. Pursuing the principle of positive nonalignment and noninterference in the internal affairs of countries near and far, the Islamic State of Afghanistan is loyal and interested in the consolidation of peace and stability in the world and does not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. The Islamic State of Afghanistan is the serious supporter of freedom, justice, and the observance of human rights, and consider respectable and observable the Charter of UN, the principles of Nonalignment Movement, and all international conventions which are not against Islamic values. While remembering with appreciation the support of the neighboring, Islamic, and other peace-loving countries during the righteous struggle of the people of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan once again asks all those countries to render sincere cooperation with our people in the process of the ensuring peace and security and the reconstruction of the ruined Afghanistan. Dear compatriots, congratulating you once again on the second anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution, I wish that almighty God makes the third year of the victory of the Islamic revolution, in whose first days we are now, a year of peace and calm and [words indistinct] in order that we shall celebrate other anniversaries of this historic day in an atmosphere of peace and fraternity across the Islamic, independent, and free Afghanistan, God willing. Peace be upon you.
