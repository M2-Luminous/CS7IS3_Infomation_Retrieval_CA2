"The ban on flights over the F.R.Y. is still in force for some Turkish airlines, but the talks are underway and we hope the matter will be resolved to mutual satisfaction," said Branko Bilbija, the director of the Federal Flight Control Office. He said that several national airlines tried to avoid paying the office's service fees by invoking international sanctions against the F.R.Y. In the overall debt of millions of dollars incurred to the Federal Flight Control Office, Macedonia's share is said to amount to 2.5 million dollars. Bilbija underscored that no U.N. Security Council's resolution banned flying through the F.R.Y. airspace, using or paying for the services of the Belgrade flight control. He said that charging the airlines for their services was the only source of the office's income, which they spend on equipment and wages. Owing to that, he added, they maintained very high technical, technological and security standards. The Federal Flight Control Office report said that during 1993, 150,000 aircraft owned by 150 world airlines had used the F.R.Y. air routes. In May 1992, the U.N. Security Council banned international flights of the Yugoslav JAT Airlines.
