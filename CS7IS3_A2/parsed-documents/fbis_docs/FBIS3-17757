This is how some White House officials, who preferred to remain anonymous, have described the present state of relations between the two countries. They held a briefing for a group of Russian journalists on Monday. The officials stressed that normal relations, and this is how, in their opinion, the current level of the Washington-Moscow dialogue can be described, do not exclude difficulties and problems. Moverover, the number of such problems and difficulties has lately increased. Asked by ITAR-TASS about the reasons behind these difficulties, one of the White House officials said that he could only repeat what was already said in Moscow and Washington -- the "honeymoon" in American-Russian relations is over. This "honeymoon" began after the end of the "cold war", he stated, and America's assessments of Russia then differed sharply from its assessments of the Soviet Union. In his opinion America had then established excessively close relations with Russia which could not be kept up. Speaking about the end of the "honeymoon", the official said he was not referring to any crisis. Normal relations envisage differences too, he said. In solving its domestic political problems Russia is again beginning to play an active role on the world arena -- in Europe and the beyond its bounds. He said he believed some differences between the two countries were quite normal in these conditions. It is an open secret that the results of the parliamentary elections in Russia were a surprise for the United States, another White House official said. The administration had closely followed the developments in Russia, but it did not foresee such an outcome, he added. The resignation of two main architects of the Russian reforms -- Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov -- were a shock not only for many officials of the administration, but also for the congress, the press, and the American public at large. The official said that this shock was explained by the fact that America had cultivated its relations with Russia largely relying on the presence of reformers in the Russian Government. Analysing the latest events, the American side has arrived at the conclusion that strong American-Russian relations should be developed irrespective of personalities, on the basis of the mutual understanding of bilateral interests. The results of the parliamentary elections and of several events that have occurred lately on the international arena have, without doubt, increased differences in America's and Russia's approaches, but have not unsettled their bilateral relations.
