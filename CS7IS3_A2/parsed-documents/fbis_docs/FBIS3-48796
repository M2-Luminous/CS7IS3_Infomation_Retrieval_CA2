Takemura, who has been noted for being at odds with Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], over political stance and strategies, intends his new book to be an antithesis to Ozawa's "ordinary country" [futsu-no kuni] argument on which the latter elaborates in his book entitled "A Plan To Rebuild Japan" ["Nihon Kaizo Keikaku"]. Takemura's book will be a follow up to a magazine article published early this month in which he unfolded his "anti-Ozawa declaration." In the backdrop of expected political turmoil with the rejection of the political reform bills at the upper house plenary session, there have been rumors that Ozawa plans to "remove Takemura." Under such circumstances, Takemura's book is expected to create new ripples in political circles. Takemura directly challenges Ozawa's assertions in the fifth chapter of his book where he explains his views on where Japan ought to be in the world. Here, Takemura does not mention Ozawa's name, but says: "It has been argued that to preserve world peace, Japan should make military contributions appropriate to its national strength. To state my conclusion first, I do not agree with this idea." He also says: "I believe what the world earnestly desires of Japan is its active participation in nonmilitary contributions." He thus challenged Ozawa's "futsu-no kuni" argument. As concrete ways in which Japan can make nonmilitary contributions, Takemura proposes a "green peacekeeping operations" project in which young Japanese can serve to work on "covering the earth's continents once again with greenery." In so saying, he stresses Japan should strive to become an environment-oriented nation. Meanwhile, regarding the ruling coalition government's internal situation, Takemura says: "Discussion is openly held on a major portion of the policy area." However, he adds: "Personal relations cannot necessarily be judged on what appears on the surface. It is quite possible that antagonism, discord, and internal strife could occur due to conflicting interests and emotional troubles." Thus, Takemura's book draws attention as it gives a gloomy forecast of Japanese politics in view of a further regrouping of the political parties.
