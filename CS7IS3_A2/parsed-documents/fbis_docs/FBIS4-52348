[Murayama] In dealing with each and every issue, we will take a free and unbiased approach. Since the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has had a part in drawing up the fiscial 1994 budget, we have our responsibilities toward the people. Therefore, we will cooperate with the cabinet in enacting the budget and other relevant bills. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The idea of forming a parliamentary group with Sakigake [Harbinger] and other parties has been mentioned. What do you think of it? [Murayama] I would give a positive consideration to the idea. I would like to have formal talks with Sakigake when the long consecutive holidays are over. Topics to be discussed will include holding party heads' talks and forming an organ for consultations. SDPJ-LDP Cooperation Is Different From Realignment [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] In organizing a parliamentary group, will you also consider inviting political parties other than Sakigake? [Murayama] We would like to cooperate with anyone, and it does not matter whether they belong to the Japan New Party or the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. We have had troubles with the DSP but we were orginal partners in working out plans to get all the liberal Social Democrats together. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How about your relations with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]? [Murayama] I think we should cooperate with each other in promoting the Diet operations. However, it has to be separated from the issue on regrouping of political parties. In other words, the point at issue lies in how various political forces will be regrouped. And in actually promoting the Diet operations, we will cooperate with the LDP on all the issues on which we can cooperate with each other. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Following the enactment of the budget bill, the LDP may call for a no-confidence vote in the cabinet. In that case, will the SDPJ act in concert? [Murayama] It would be desirable to make the decision depending on the actual political situation at the time. At present, Japan is suffering from economic stagnation and we have various serious problems in both domestic and foreign affairs, with the major one being our relations with the United States. Therefore, it is preferable not to create a political vaccum at the moment. However, if the new cabinet should come to a deadlock and the only alternative left for the cabinet to break the deadlock is to dissolve the lower house, then I would say there is no other choice. Having Signed the Policy Accord, SDPJ Still Has Its Responsibilities [subhead] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Among the major policy tasks, how do you intend to tackle the tax reforms issue? [Murayama] Since the SDPJ did sign the policy accord in forming the new coalition government the other day, we still have our responsibilities. Our activities will no longer be restricted because we are no longer a member of the ruling coalition. However, it does not follow that we will start anew with a completely clean slate. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You will not change your position of tolerating an increase in the indirect tax rate. Is that right? [Murayama] It should be based on the drastic revision of inequalities in the tax system and on reduction of the government expenditures. However, if the government should clearly indicate the amount of funds needed for promoting welfare measures for the country's aging population in the future, and then explain that revenues gained from increased indirect taxes will be used for this purpose, then I am sure it will be able to win the people's understanding about the tax reform. The point at issue lies in abruptly starting to increase the current consumption tax rate. No opposition has been voiced within our party to efforts to correct the ratio between direct and indirect taxes. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] When will the SDPJ work out its final conclusion? [Murayama] Since the party's tax system research council has already worked out guidelines, we would like to conduct full-scale intraparty discussions on the basis of these guidelines. I think our party plan will be worked out as early as in June when the ruling parties are going to work out their conclusions. SDPJ Split Is Impossible [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How does the SDPJ plan to deal with the issue of suspected nuclear arms development by DPRK (North Korea)? [Murayama] What is most important is to resolve this issue through talks. If there is anything that the SDPJ can be of service, we will do our best. Depending on the situation, a delegation may be dispatched to the DPRK. When we were a member of the ruling coalition, our activities were restricted. Now, we can act on the basis of our independent decision. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] In the course of regrouping political parties or in dealing with major policies, is there any possibility that the intraparty confrontation between the rightist and leftist factions will become intensified? [Murayama] There are various policy groups within the party. In the sense that they contribute to promoting the party's vitality, it is most desirable. However, it will be undesirable if their activities should go beyond the party's framework and lead to the split of the party. It should be noted that the whole party has taken concerted action in seceding from the coalition this time. Therefore, it is impossible for the SDPJ to split. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Have you been considering any measures to increase the strength of the party executives? [Murayama] We intend to give a briefing on the future course the party should take and once again call for achieving party unity at the Central Executive Committee session scheduled for late May.
