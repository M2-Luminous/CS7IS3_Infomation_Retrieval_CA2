At least until now. Because of the affair surrounding Eurometal, this reputation has been somewhat damaged. Because the artillery shells supplied to Turkey by this company are suitable "against soft and hard targets." And the latter means human flesh. More striking power for less money. That is the idea behind the plan to produce weapons jointly within NATO. One of these plans involved a joint Netherlands-British-Turkish artillery shell factory. This is advantageous, thanks to the reduced wage costs in Ankara, but sensitive, because of the ever greater grimness of the war violence perpetrated by the Turkish Army against the Kurds in the southeast. In spite of that, in the late 1980's the Netherlands Government did make a choice in favor of this cooperation. NATO even considered the transfer of the ammunition production to their southern allies as a kind of development assistance because it involved industrializing countries. The Netherlands partners included, among others, Philips, which helped the Turkish Aselsan plant develop its own production line for military communication. And Daf was involved in the production of Turkish armored vehicles. In exchange, when the Netherlands purchased rocket launchers in America in 1987, the then-Secretary of State Van Houwelingen tried to bargain for participation by Netherlands arms manufacturers in Turkish-American projects. Since 1980, the United States has given Eurometal an exclusive license to manufacture artillery shells for M-483 model Howitzers, and to this effect a cooperation agreement was concluded with British and Turkish companies. This project was fully supported by the authorities involved. Since 1987, the Netherlands Government has even held negotiations with Eurometal in the name of the British and the Turkish Governments about the production of the artillery shells. Yet, until now this had really been only a British-Netherlands business with a slight German coloring; the shell casings came from the Netherlands, other parts from England, and the assembly took place at the German branch of Eurometal in Liebenau. But it was agreed that as of 1993 this assembly would take place in Turkey. There were only two problems: until that time, the Turks had to continue purchasing their artillery shells from Eurometal (in Germany). And the assembly line of the Turkish company in Kirikkale had to be set up with the help of Netherlands personnel. No export license is required for the latter, at least as long as it remains limited to verbal support. It is hard to believe that not a single piece of paper or photocopy was involved, but a year and a half ago, in response to questions raised in parliament, Minister Van den Broek stated diplomatically that "no permit had been granted, however," for the concrete transfer of technology. But the German Government did not dare to grant an export license for the artillery shells coming off the assembly line in Liebenau, even though the main contractor, Eurometal, had committed itself through contract to supply a first 18,000-unit shipment to Turkey. The Bundessicherheitsrat, which includes the chancellor and the Ministers of Internal, Foreign, and Economic Affairs and of Defense, prohibited the export. Meanwhile, it appeared from a German television broadcast (on 23 November 1992) that the majority of the 18,000 artillery shells were already completed in Liebenau. The shipment was to take place before Christmas. During the week before Christmas, while Germany continued to say "no," Van den Broek did grant Eurometal ("after careful checking of the applicable criteria") an export license for the shell casings related to the Turkish shipment. Apparently the equipment standardization within NATO had progressed further than the policy standardization between the Netherlands and Germany. For a while, the matter ended up in an impasse. A year ago, Van den Broek's successor, Kooijmans, claimed in the Second Chamber that the assembly of the 18,000 artillery shells in Liebenau had not taken place and that hence there had been no export to Turkey. The German Government continued to refuse the delivery and that was painful for the Netherlands, because it apparently did not have matters in its own hands in terms of its cooperation projects within the context of NATO. It was also annoying for Eurometal because it could not meet its commitment to the Turks. The only thing Eurometal could do was to ask the Turks for understanding, to close the assembly line in Liebenau as soon as possible and to ship it (via the Netherlands) to Istanbul. Then the problems could be solved as soon as possible in Turkey itself. The Germans also asked the Turks for understanding and admitted that it might be possible to find a way out, if only to save less eye-catching German-Turkish contracts. According to a spokesperson for Eurometal, the 18,000 artillery shells completed in Germany will return to the Netherlands. In order not to make the matter too sensitive, Minister of Defense Rulus ter Beek will probably purchase the shipment. Because as soon as the Netherlands engineers in Turkey are ready, the Turks will be able to manufacture their artillery shells (a total of 206,000) themselves. Although with parts from the Netherlands and England. The closing of the production line in Liebenau did not do Eurometal in Germany any good . The Landesregierung of Lower-Saxony (a coalition of Greens and the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]) and the opposition (CDU-FDP [Christian Democratic Union-Free Democratic Party]) are both furious, albeit for different reasons. The Left feels that it is incredible that the German Government's refusal to allow the export of the artillery shells is being circumvented by and via the Netherlands. The statement was made in the Bundesrat (the German First Chamber) that by granting a permit to export the factory to "the Netherlands," Minister of Economic Affairs Guenter Rexrodt is waging war against the Kurdish people. Rexrodt's ministry initially defended itself by stating that nothing was known about the actual final destination: the Netherlands was the culprit. But the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hague does not accept this charge. It has a copy of the permit application made by Eurometal, which shows that the Germans knew that the Netherlands was only an intermediary stopping point. And it is making this known. Furthermore, the transaction "came up" at the ministerial level, although it was agreed not to make this matter public. The level of pain had to be kept low, but given the veiled accusations this did not quite succeed. "We are curious to see how the German Government will react to our response," was the reserved comment made by one diplomat. An insider in the Hague blames the German behavior primarily on domestic pressure rather than ethical purity. Reference was made to a German-Turkish cooperation project whereby Germany is helping Turkey with the modernization of old 155mm Howitzers. Following modernization, the guns are particularly well suited for the M-483 artillery shells. Incidentally, two years ago the Germans offered this kind of artillery shell to the Turks. The words unfair competition are even mentioned: it was not due to moral correctness that the Germans were not cooperating with the artillery shell exports, but because they would have preferred to see their own Rheinmetal rather than the Netherlands Eurometal export the artillery shells. The much less famous German-Turkish Howitzer project is still on track, but the artillery shells have been politicized to such an extent that not a single individual wants to continue burning his fingers on them. The CDU-FDP opposition also sees it this way and they are furious because the hypocrisy of the German Government is providing money to the Netherlands and costing jobs in Liebenau. Based on the responses given by Minister Kooijmans in the Second Chamber there also appears to be something strange. Up to now he, as well as his predecessor Van den Broek, had always talked about setting up a final assembly line in Turkey. What was meant was a line like the one which up to now existed in Liebenau. But Turkey will receive two assembly lines. The Liebenau line is intended for the assembly of components, and now, according to the Netherlands Government, the final assembly line is to come from the Netherlands. On this subject, Eurometal refuses to "make any comment." But it is enough to know that Minister Van den Broek did not provide correct information to parliament on 12 October 1992. It is a fact that the reputation of the Netherlands as a relatively well behaved arms exporting country has been somewhat damaged by the affair. When even the Bundessicherheitsrat feels that the artillery shells and heavy artillery could be used in the struggle against the Kurds, it is a little strange that the Netherlands considers this "less probable, given the condition of the relevant terrain." After Sarajevo, they really ought to know better here. Eurometal itself has not operated skillfully either. Even the respectable DIE ZEIT has noted that the company, of which the Netherlands is still a major shareholder, has placed advertisements in the Turkish defense press for these artillery shells, which are so suitable "against hard and soft tar gets." The latter words do not refer to tanks but to human flesh. "You obviously mean the Kurds," company spokesperson Weenink responded helpfully when asked about this. "Those artillery shells are far too good for that."
