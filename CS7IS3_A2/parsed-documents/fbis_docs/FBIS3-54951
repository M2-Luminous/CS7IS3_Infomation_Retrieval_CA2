Moreover, documents registered by the Ministry of Justice but not published in our newspaper do not entail legal consequences and are deemed not to have come into legal force. The reader of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI can find in the pages of the KURYER weekly supplement normative acts of Russian Federation ministries and departments which have undergone state registration. Before all other newspapers KURYER notifies Russians of the most recent changes to tax legislation, informs them of the procedure for floating shares, privatizing, and buying and selling private and state property, and publishes banking regulations, customs tariffs, and examples of departmental documentation. Economic leaders, jurists, representatives of commercial structures, employees of financial and tax establishments and law enforcement organs, and also ordinary citizens whose rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests we are entrusted with representing by presidential edict can find in KURYER the answers to many topical questions, particularly those concerning the regulation of market mechanisms. KURYER has become their reliable guide in the legal and economic area which changes rapidly day by day. KURYER also ensures very prompt access to the "hottest" exclusive information from the norm-creating kitchen of ministries and departments. In short, those people who have not yet made out their subscription have an opportunity in the new year to think once again about their choice of publication. Those who have not had time to do this today will not be too late to do so tomorrow.
