Elias] [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- Voting in KwaZulu/Natal has been extended to midnight on Friday, the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said early on Thursday. A decision was taken at a Joint Operations Committee meeting on Wednesday afternoon that polling stations remain open through the night on Thursday and up to midnight on Friday if they have the necessary ballot forms, Inkatha Freedom Party stickers and if there were voters still in the queue. The IEC has also asked the National Peace Secretariat [NPS] to help with the election due to the problems experienced by the IEC on Tuesday and Wednesday, NPS Chairman Dr Antonie Gildenhuys said. The decision to extend the elections followed a number of serious failures in effectively operating some of the 9,000 polling stations. The failures led to the Inkatha Freedom Party on Wednesday threatening to withdraw from the elections. The second day of general voting, hastily declared a public holiday, will determine the fate of the election. It will be decisive in the question of whether or not the election period should be extended. IEC promises that polling stations would remain open for as long as queues determined the need were largely not fulfilled late on Wednesday night as long suffering voters had the doors shut on them at many locations. Simultaneously, IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johan Kriegler once more expressed his confidence that matters would improve. But the serious failure of the polling machinery, particularly in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area, has cast a shadow on the election outcome. Observers expressed doubts of sufficient improvement. The worst performances of polling stations were in areas where the IFP has its strongest potential support: KwaZulu/Natal and the PWV. Talks between the IFP, the IEC and Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte led to a special operations centre being set up in Ulundi to sort out election problems as they crop up while a special plane and two SA National Defence Force Puma helicopters would be put at the disposal of election officials in the region for logistical purposes, Home Affairs Department spokesman Niel Dubois said after the meeting on Thursday morning. He said 4-million extra ballot papers, with the IFP strip printed and not stuck on, were being rushed to the region and will be at polling booths by 7AM on Thursday. The moves are a result of an urgent meeting between Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi which was held in Ulundi early on Thursday to iron out voting problems experienced in KwaZulu/Natal on Wednesday. Mr Justice Kriegler told the press there was little chance of an IFP withdrawal. The race was on, its horse was in, and withdrawing it would only result in it running last. Earlier on Wednesday Mr Buthelezi said the lack of IFP stickers at many polling stations countrywide meant the elections would not be free and fair. He said the IFP had never agreed to an IEC instruction to electoral officers that the party's name be written by voters at the bottom of ballot papers if stickers were in short supply. About 60 per cent of rural Natal voters were illiterate, he pointed out. Secrecy of the ballot would be affected by the provision. The necessity for the stickers arose when the IFP entered the electoral process at the 11th hour. The first two days of voting, Tuesday and Wednesday, were marred by shortages or a total lack of ballot papers and other voting materials in many parts of the country, leading to calls by several political leaders for an extension of the voting period. Pan Africanist Congress leader Mr Clarence Makwetu accused the IEC of inefficiency and "conniving" to rig the elections. He said his party might contest the freeness and fairness of the elections. Mr Justice Kriegler said the South African Police were investigating the ballot paper debacle, although there was as yet no evidence of any crime having been committed. He admitted the IEC had underestimated the size of the electorate. The IEC gave orders to unnamed private firms for the emergency printing of 9.3 million extra ballot papers, and made plans for private and South African Air Force aircraft to fly them to polling stations on Thursday. State President Mr F W de Klerk said extending the voting period in areas where people had not had a proper opportunity to vote could be considered, but every effort should be made to avoid it. He declared Thursday a public holiday to enable people to vote. He said he thought the IEC had made "major mistakes" in planning for the elections, but it was pointless to "rave" about those mistakes. "We must ask ourselves how we can solve these problems," he said. Mr Justice Kriegler said if the poor performance of polling stations in the PWV region was repeated on Thursday, he would seriously consider declaring the elections in the region unfree and unfair. "It will not be a disaster for the whole country," he said. The elections in the region would be re-run within 12 weeks. However, he said he did not foresee a repeat of Wednesday's 30 per cent failure rate in the region. Millions of voters streamed to the polls on Wednesday and the IEC said about 2,000 reports of problems at polling stations had been received. It said voting effectiveness had been 84 per cent in the Western Cape, 80 per cent in the Eastern Cape, 100 per cent in the Northern Cape, 75 per cent in Natal, 87 per cent in the Orange Free State, 80 per cent in the Eastern Transvaal, 75 per cent in the Northern Transvaal, 95 per cent in Northwest Province and 70 per cent in the PWV. There were several bomb explosions on Wednesday and reports of violence at some polling stations, but no deaths were reported. Eighteen people were seriously injured in the morning when a bomb exploded at Jan Smuts International Airport at Kempton Park, near Johannesburg, apparently the latest in a bombing campaign blamed on right-wing extremists opposed to democracy. Bomb attacks on Sunday and Monday, including massive car-bombs in downtown Johannesburg and nearby Germiston, claimed 21 lives. Thirty-one people have been arrested in connection with the blasts, including members of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement]. In other incidents on Wednesday: - Two houses were damaged by an explosion near Postmasburg in the Northern Cape; - The National Party's [NP] offices in Newcastle, Natal, were damaged by a petrol bomb. Two men were arrested; - Police defused a homemade bomb set to explode against a water tower outside Soutpan, about 50km west of Bloemfontein; - An NP agent in Port Elizabeth, Mr George Holmes, was abducted by a group of men who left him stranded at Summerstrand after tearing up his electoral report; - An IEC vehicle transporting ballot papers to a polling station in Eldorado Park, southwest of Johannesburg, was hijacked by four men. It was later found by police, with many of the ballot papers missing; - Telephone lines were cut between Three Sisters and Victoria West in the Karoo, but communications in the area were restored; - Border peace committee monitors were sent to Middledrift in Ciskei, where IEC monitors were held hostage for a time by a mob angry about the non-delivery of ballot papers; - Police were called to disperse 150 angry Muslim residents who were prevented from voting when the Marlboro Gardens, Sandton, polling station closed 20 minutes before the 7PM deadline; and - Angry voters broke down the doors of a polling station in Mdantsane, Ciskei, when it shut after apparently running out of election supplies in the morning.
