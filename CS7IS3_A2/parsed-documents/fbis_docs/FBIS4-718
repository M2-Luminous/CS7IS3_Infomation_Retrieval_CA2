FBIS4-718 "drafr073_a_94015" FBIS-AFR-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda MDR Leader Issues Statement MDR Leader Issues Statement EA1404161994 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in Kinyarwanda to Rwanda 1015 GMT 14 Apr 94 EA1404161994 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura Kinyarwanda BFN [Communique issued by Faustin Twagiramungu, prime minister-designate and president of the Republican Democratic Movement on 13 April; place not given] [Excerpts] Members of Republican Democratic Movement [MDR] and Rwandans. Peace be with you and continue to trust God, as the truth will finally win out. Rwandans, the death of His Excellency President Juvenal Habyarimana has not yet been explained. Some continue to say, without evidence, that he was killed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], while others are saying that enemies of the country were responsible. Let us hope that the truth will finally be known. [passage omitted] How can we hold talks with the people who killed Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who was the president of the MDR in Butare, who was the people's mother, an intellectual, a nationalist? How can we hold talks with these killers? How can we hold talks with the murderers of Frederic Nzamurambaho, the minister of agriculture and livestock and the national president of the Social Democratic Party, a father of all who was a peace-loving person. How can we hold talks with those who killed Felicien Ngango, the first vice president of Christian Democratic Party [PDC] at the national level, an intellectual, and a Rwandan who knew the law. [passage omitted] We shall never hold talks with those who killed Faustin Nucogoza, who was the minister of information and president of the MDR in Byumba. He was a fearless man who loved democracy. All those who were killed joined others who were killed earlier by those murderers. They took the lives of Mayuya, Gapyisi, Gatabazi and others. The killings show and identify who is Rwanda's enemy. The ethnic war that the killers wanted to launch in the country is not acceptable to us. Were all the above-mentioned people who died killed by Tutsis? One cannot say that the RPF waged a war because of the killings. We should understand and explain to the people that the RPF did not attack, but came to the rescue of the people to stop the killers from shedding blood.
