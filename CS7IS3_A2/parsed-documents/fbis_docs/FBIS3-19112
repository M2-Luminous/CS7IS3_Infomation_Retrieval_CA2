Ballardin report: "Martinazzoli: Forza Italia's Leader a Megalomaniac"] [Text] Rome -- "There are indeed some strange coincidences -- the timing, the investigation right before the election, the threat of recourse to precautionary detention: All this prompts [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi to imagine that there is a political struggle behind it, but nevertheless we must have confidence in the institutions," the Popular Party's Giuseppe Gargani said. "I have been saying for some time that the magistrates are going too far and that justicialism does not pay," Giovanni Pellegrino -- senator and representative of the PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] extreme moderate wing -- said. Liberal Alfredo Biondi urged Minister Conso to open an inquiry in order to dispel any suspicions of interference in the conduct of the elections. "A few days ago," Biondi said, "Attorney Spazzali asked to have [PDS Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema called as witnesses in a matter that needed to be clarified, but the court turned down the request," deeming it "irrelevant." Now, however, the threat of arrest is brandished even in seeking to discover on what terms a football player has been bought and sold. The charge is leveled that justice is being conducted by "alternating current." The Liberals' Raffaele Costa, a Forza Italia candidate, also condemned the judiciary, talking about "inquiries conducted according to the clock." Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli, another Forza Italia candidate and former member of the CSM [Higher Magistrates Council], said: "The judiciary has decided to enter the arena in this election campaign, and it is clear in favor of whom. The rules of the law-based state are being destroyed: An inquiry lasting over 16 months and referring to events in 1990-91 is reaching its final stage, just three weeks before the elections." All this, while the Milan court considers the evidence of Occhetto and D'Alema "irrelevant" in the Cusani trial. According to Gianfranco Miglio, the Northern League's ideologue, "there is undoubtedly a tenacious attitude on the part of the judiciary in pursuing certain individuals involved in the political struggle," while National Alliance's coordinator Gianfranco Fini criticized "sectors of the judiciary closely associated with the left." In Genoa Bossi thundered: "Bribe City is a sham; we have seen no proper sentences" (and he repeated that the League represents the new and Forza Italia, the old.) But not everyone is attacking the judges. Some people defend them, such as Communist Renewal Secretary Fausto Bertinotti or former magistrate Giuseppe Ayala (Democratic Alliance): "It is entirely untrue that the magistrates take orders from Violante [anti-Mafia committee chairman], as is being whispered in parliament. I am well acquainted with the world of the Italian judiciary and I can assure you that such a hypothesis lies beyond the realm of possibility." According to the PDS' Nicola Colajanni, a former magistrate, Berlusconi is leveling charges at the judiciary "because he confuses his economic enterprise, Fininvest, with his political enterprise, Forza Italia, and this prompts him to consider that a search carried out at his offices constitutes a political attack; but it is not so." Massimo D'Alema, PDS lower house floor leader, said: "The Fininvest inquiry? I hope that there will be a sense of proportion on the magistrates' part. I believe in the judiciary," Italian Popular Party Secretary Mino Martinazzoli said. However, he then made the following cutting remark about Berlusconi: "In an attack of megalomania, he asked us to dissolve ourselves. He may be confident that we will not do so." Former President Francesco Cossiga cited [former President] Pertini, pointing out that judges, and especially prosecuting attorneys, "must not only be independent but also be seen to be so."
