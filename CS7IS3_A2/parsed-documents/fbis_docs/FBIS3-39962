According to an article by Ewa Stenberg in the 3 February DAGENS NYHETER on page 9, the kickoff of the Social Democratic campaign for membership ends what some SDP [Social Democratic Party] members had criticized as a period of passivity in which the party left it to the conservatives to argue for membership. Anders Lindstrom, a member of the group's board, said that this passivity gave many Social Democratic voters the impression that "the European Union is a rightist project that will require reduced social benefits in Sweden." The manifesto tries to convince voters otherwise, arguing that EU membership is necessary to maintain the welfare state. Sweden can only take measures to stimulate the economy and eliminate the high unemployment that threatens the welfare state in the context of a larger market; the massive speculation during the 1992 currency crisis showed that a small country cannot keep the economy in balance by itself. The manifesto also cites a common security policy and joint action on the environment as benefits of membership. Lindstrom believes that if Europe had had a common security policy, "the war in the former Yugoslavia could have been prevented." Even the liberal DAGENS NYHETER praised the Social Democrats' manifesto. In an editorial on 4 February on page 2, the paper said: "The program is aggressive and modern. It focuses not on the Swedish exception but on a radical ambition to join in and improve Europe's employment situation, welfare, environment, and security together with other countries and parties."
