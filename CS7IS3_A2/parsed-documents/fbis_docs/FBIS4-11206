It should be noted the United States has a lot of influence in the aforementioned multilateral institutions. The Foreign Ministry sources, however, explained the $57-million aid package for the 1995 fiscal year is not definitive, but responds to tentative programs. The Nicaraguan Government has reiterated the country will not live eternally on international aid, adding that is why it is necessary to increase production in Nicaragua.
