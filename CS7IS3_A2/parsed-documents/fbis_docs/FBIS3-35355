An Iranian diplomat serving in Khartoum and two Lebanese were arrested and held until the end of an Islamic conference, during which they planned to kill 'Arafat, the leftist opposition weekly said, without citing its sources. The three were later expelled. Al-Ahali said they were found in possession of pistols with silencers and poisoned knives. Khartoum was tipped off about the plot by non-Sudanese sources. The paper also said most of the 1,900 Egyptians who volunteered to fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s were currently in Yemen and Sudan. The Egyptian Government holds the veterans of the Afghan conflict responsible for fomenting fundamentalist unrest in Egypt, in which more than 300 people have died since the violent anti-government campaign started in March 1992.
