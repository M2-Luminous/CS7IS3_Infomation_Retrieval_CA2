FR940607-1-00015 FR940607-1-00003 III. Background on Annual Filing of Amendments to Registration Statements of National Securities Exchanges, Securities Associations, and Reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Section 5 of the Exchange Act 22 generally prohibits securities transactions on a national securities exchange unless the exchange is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 6 of the Act. 23 Section 6 sets forth the conditions for exchange registration and requires that an exchange file an application for registration under Rule 6a&hyph;1 under the Act. 24 That rule requires an applicant for registration, or for exemption from registration, to file an application on Form 1, 25 together with accompanying exhibits containing, among other things, the rules of the exchange, its financial statements, and its various forms, schedules, and membership lists. 22 15 U.S.C. 78e. 23 15 U.S.C. 78f. 24 17 CFR 240.6a&hyph;1. 25 17 CFR 249.1. Pursuant to Rule 6a&hyph;2, a registered or exempted exchange generally must update its registration annually by filing amendments on Form 1&hyph;A to reflect any changes in specified information contained in the registration statement of the exchange or its accompanying exhibits that were not previously reported in an amendment. 26 The Commission adopted amendments in 1983 to permit exchanges to update exhibits containing the constitution, by-laws, and rules of the exchange and its affiliates only once every three years. 27 The Commission believes that it can streamline the requirement to file annual amendments for certain exhibits to exchange registration. This information is either publicly available, becomes available to the Commission through other means, or is not useful enough to justify the burden placed on the exchanges in collecting and filing it with the Commission each year. The Commission notes that for certain of these exhibits, Exchange Act rules will continue to require national securities exchanges to provide the Commission with prompt notification after any action that renders those exhibits inaccurate. 28 In addition, Rule 17a&hyph;1 will continue to require exchanges to maintain and preserve for prescribed periods all documents and other records made or received by it in the course of its business and in the conduct of its self-regulatory activity, and upon request of any representative of the Commission, to promptly furnish such documents. 29 26 Exchange Act Rule 6a-2, 17 CFR 240.6a&hyph;2. 27 The Commission found the annual submission of these exhibits to be unnecessary, particularly because Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act requires exchanges to submit all proposed rule changes to the Commission. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19814 (May 26, 1983), 48 FR 24663. 28 Rule 6a&hyph;3 requires each exchange to notify the Commission within 10 days after any action that renders inaccurate its registration statement or any exhibit except exhibits E, F, L and M. 17 CFR 240.6a&hyph;3. 29 15 U.S.C. 78q(a)(1); 17 CFR 240.17a&hyph;1. For the same reasons, the Commission proposes to amend the analogous rules and forms applicable to national securities associations (namely, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'')) 30 and the MSRB. The NASD has similar requirements to update and file certain information annually, although the form used for this purpose differs significantly from that used for exchanges. 31 For example, the registration and amendment forms used by the NASD are organized along the lines of rule categories, whereas the format for exchanges focuses on exhibits and lists. The MSRB also has an annual reporting requirement. 32 The Commission believes that it would be appropriate to streamline the reporting requirements for these SROs as well, and to the extent the reports concern matters analagous to those applicable to exchanges, to conform them with the requirements for exchanges. 30 Currently, the NASD is the only national securities association registered with the Commission. 31 See Exchange Act Rule 15Aj&hyph;1, 17 CFR 240.15Aj&hyph;1; Form X&hyph;15AJ&hyph;2, 17 CFR 249.803. 32 See Exchange Act Rule 17a&hyph;21, 17 CFR 240.17a&hyph;21.
