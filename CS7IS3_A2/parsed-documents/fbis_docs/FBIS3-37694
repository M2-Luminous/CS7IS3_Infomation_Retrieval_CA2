"This decision was made in answer to Slovakia's request," a senior member of Russia's Foreign Ministry told Interfax. The coalition government of Vladimir Meciar "is going through a crisis", he explained. "Evidently this is not the best time for a visit," he added. According to the diplomat, initially the capital of Slovakia was to be the first point of Kozyrev's European tour. However, because of the aggravation of tensions in and around Bosnia-Herzegovina, Russia's foreign minister began his tour with Athens, to confer with the European Union's "group of three": the foreign ministers of Greece, Belgium and Germany -- the European Union's current, previous and subsequent chairmen. As Interfax's interviewee noted, from Athens Kozyrev went to Prague, and, on Monday morning, to Budapest. The head of Russian diplomacy is expected to spend two days (Monday and Tuesday) in the Hungarian capital. The next point of his tour will be Krakow, where Kozyrev and his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Olchowski, will attend a conference on the Russian-Polish relationship on the road to a new partnership. Kozyrev is expected to return to Moscow on Wednesday. "However Kozyrev may make some changes in the program of his tour. It's quite possible that he will suspend it in order to visit Bonn, where consultations on the ways to reach a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be held on Tuesday," the diplomat said. The foreign minister's secretariat confirmed that Kozyrev had postponed his trip to Bratislava. "As for Bonn, his deputy, Vitaly Churkin, who was in Sarajevo, went there on Monday. So far Kozyrev is not expected to pay a blitzvisit to Bonn," a member of his secretariat said.
