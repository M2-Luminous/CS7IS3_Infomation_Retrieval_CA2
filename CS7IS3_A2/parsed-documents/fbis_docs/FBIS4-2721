FBIS4-2721 "drchi071_q_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-071 Daily Report 6 Feb 1994 Southwest Region Sichuan Procuratorate Work Report for 1993 Sichuan Procuratorate Work Report for 1993 HK1304002694 Chengdu SICHUAN RIBAO in Chinese 6 Feb 94 p 2 HK1304002694 Chengdu SICHUAN RIBAO Chinese BFN [Report by Gong Dulun (7895 6236 4858), chief procurator of the Sichuan Provincial People's Procuratorate to the Second Session of the Eighth Sichuan Provincial People's Congress, 22 January 1994: "Work Report of the Sichuan Provincial People's Procuratorate"] [Text] Fellow Deputies, Since the First Session of the Eighth Sichuan Provincial People's Congress, the procuratorates at all levels throughout the province, under the leadership of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and under the supervision of the provincial people's congress and its standing committee, have seriously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the directives of the central authorities on combatting corruption. They have firmly implemented the law, firmly handled cases, strengthened their various legal supervisory functions, investigated and dealt with large and serious cases of graft and bribery, struck at the various types of criminal activities, and made obvious achievements. In promoting the building of clean government in our province and the building of socialist democracy and the legal system, and in guaranteeing the smooth development of our province's reform and opening up and economic construction, they have made positive contributions. I. Placing Stress on the Investigation and Handling of Major and Serious Cases, While Continuing To Strike Firmly at the Various Types of Criminal Activity A. Taking the investigation and handling of large and serious cases as the focal point and deeply developing the struggle to combat criminal activities involving bribery and corruption. Investigating and handling bribery and corruption and other such economic crimes is a major function of procuratorial organs. Since last year, the procuratorates at all levels throughout the province have strengthened their investigation and handling of large and serious cases. Particularly in August last year, after the central authorities issued the directive on further grasping the struggle against corruption properly and realizing first-stage achievements within a year, we made emergency mobilization arrangements in the procuratorial organs throughout the province. We also adopted a series of measures such as implementing chief procurator responsibility systems for the handling of cases and the measure whereby grass-roots level organs grasped the investigation and handling of large and serious cases after the provincial and city procuratorates have decided on the division of the cases. Unified command and coordination have also been strengthened. We have done well in internal mobilization and the procuratorate heads at the provincial, city, and county levels have sent circulars to the leading cadres within the party at their respective levels, details of the situation in the struggle against graft and bribery. The "100 Day Anti-Graft and Pro-Clean Government Publicity Activities" were carried out throughout the province and the procuratorate report center telephone numbers at all levels were again publicized to encourage the people to make reports. We have stressed policies and tactics and handled cases in a firm, cautious, and correct way, to guarantee the healthy development of the struggle against graft and bribery. By the end of last year, the procuratorates throughout the province had jointly received 20,446 reports of graft, bribery, and other economic crimes, 59.9 percent up on 1992. A total of 4,472 cases of graft, bribery, and embezzlement of public funds were filed and investigated. Of these, 2,445 major cases, or 54.7 percent of the total, involved amounts in excess of 10,000 yuan, an increase of 43.8 percent over 1992. Sixty-nine serious cases involving cadres at the county and office level were investigated and handled (including two cadres at the department level), a 27.7 percent increase on 1992. Of the major cases investigated and handled, 280 involved 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, a 76.1 percent over 1992; 233 involved 100,000 to 500,000 yuan, an increase of 1.5 times; 27 involved 500,000 to 1 million yuan, an increase of 92.8 percent; and 23 cases involved amounts in excess of 1 million yuan, an increase of 10.5 times. Through handling these cases, over 150 million yuan of state and collective economic losses were recovered. Under the influence of laws and policies, 100 criminals gave themselves up. The general situation of cases in the various sectors handled by the various levels of procuratorate throughout the province were as follows: 1. Criminal cases were filed and investigated against a total of 631 personnel from party and government organs. This was 12 percent of the total number of persons involved in the cases registered, a growth of 16.8 percent over 1992. Over the period from September 1992 to April 1993, Gao Wancheng [7559 8001 2052], a government inspector and Liu Jiehui [0491 2638 6540] the city financial bureau director, both of Hechuan City, improperly lent out more than 23.4 million yuan in funds. They extorted 740,000 yuan as "service charges," of which over 400,000 yuan was shared between them and over 300,000 yuan was used for offering bribes. Liu Jiehui also engaged in real estate business through companies under the financial bureau and, together with others, accepted bribes of 270,000 yuan. Two deputy bureau directors from this bureau, together with the head and deputy head of the bureau's rural finance section, embezzled over 220,000 yuan in public funds. During the investigation of this case, other cases were also successively investigated, including the one where Lai Zhaofen [6351 0340 5358], the head of the comprehensive department under the Chongqing City Financial Bureau and Xu Yijian [6079 0110 6432], the deputy head of the central district financial bureau of this City, had received bribes; as well as cases whereby the managers of the securities companies under seven district and county financial administrations had engaged in graft, received bribes, and improperly used public funds. The funds involved in these crimes totalled 1.8 million yuan and a total of 28 major cases involving amounts in excess of 10,000 yuan were pursued against 36 people. Of these, six were county- or office-level cadres. Shi Renfu [4258 0088 1381], the deputy head of the student enrolment office of Luzhou City had, since 1989, made use of his position and on pretexts such as helping examinees to contact tertiary institutions and gain entry and arranging study opportunities, he successively extorted 323,000 yuan from 415 examinees and their parents in six counties and districts. He also held a further 321,000 yuan of unexplained origin. After the procuratorial organs filed a case, completed investigations, and brought charges, the Luzhou City Intermediate Court tried the case and sentenced Shi to death. 2. Graft, bribery, and other economic crime cases were filed and investigated in respect of 61 justice administration personnel, an increase of 84.4 percent compared to 1992. Wang Xingbin [3769 5281 2430] of the People's Armed Police under the Fengjie County Public Security Bureau, collaborated with other people in using measures such as falsely recorded expenditure and fraudulent checks to illegally obtain 208,000 yuan. He has already been tried and sentenced to death by the Wanxian City Intermediate Court. The cases investigated and handled also include: One wherein an assistant procurator, Zhang Weilin [1728 4850 2651] of the Qingyang District Procuratorate in Chengdu City, accepted 130,000 yuan in bribes while handling cases; another in which Guo Xuegang [7559 1331 0474], the deputy president of the Yuqi Court under the Zizhong County Court, extorted and accepted bribes; and a case wherein Zhong Zhengping [6988 2973 1627], a lawyer from the Luzhou Lawyers Office, while handling a case, embezzled 10,000 yuan of recovered funds from an enterprise. 3. Criminal cases were filed and investigated in respect of 115 administrative and law enforcement personnel. From 1990 to January 1993, Shuai Xinglong [1596 5281 7127] secretary of the party group and Li Tingjun [2621 1656 0971], the deputy bureau head, both of the Santai County State Land Administration Bureau, used their positions and, through the printing of land-use certificates, the examination and approval of land requisition, the payment of wages to temporary workers, the purchase of goods, the holding of meetings, and so on, they raised prices and submitted false expense claims, thereby corruptly obtaining 160,000 yuan through bribes and the embezzlement of public funds. In December 1992, Tang Xinguo [0781 2450 0948], the deputy bureau head of the technology supervision bureau of Chenghua District, Chengdu City, together with Zhao Yong [6392 0516], the head of the investigation team of this bureau, while investigating and handling cases involving fake and low-quality products being handled by individual operators, sold off the illicit goods and divided the 20,000 yuan obtained between themselves. Liu Guangquan [0491 0342 2938], the head of the commercial inspection bureau in Neijiang City, used the convenience of his office to embezzle 22,000 yuan and accepted 7,000 yuan in bribes. 4. Close to 400 cases of graft, bribery and other economic crimes were filed and investigated within the banking system. Those who received bribes generally used their privileged positions to lend out state funds as interbank loans and to issue credit in violation of regulations. This greatly disturbed the state's normal financial order and resulted in it being impossible to recover a great amount of the funds. In September last year, the Chengdu City Procuratorate investigated and handled a case in which five section-level cadres of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Sichuan Province used their positions and colluded with other people. Under the pretext of interbank lending, they used the credit for personal gain and the individuals received "benefits payments" from this. Thereby, they lined their own pockets with public funds. Zhong Nianlin [6988 1819 2651], the deputy section head of the commercial credit section of this branch received 144,000 yuan in bribes. Tang Anwei [0781 1344 0251], the deputy head of the planning section received 60,000 yuan in bribes. Zhou Xin [0719 2946], manager of the Industrial Bank Company under this branch, received 150,000 yuan in bribes. Ran Longlin [0373 7127 2651], the deputy head and others, a total of three people from the Bishan County Construction Bank, while issuing credit, used the pretext of "consultancy fees" and demanded bribes from those obtaining credit. The bribes totalled 220,000 yuan. Xu Yuelin [1776 1471 2651], a business operator in the securities business section in the Jiangbei District Branch Office of the Agricultural Bank, received 310,000 yuan in bribes through the issuing of credit. Yi Bingqian [2496 4426 6692], a worker in the Chongqing City Branch of the Communications Bank, colluded with financial personnel in an enterprise and changed the enterprise's 24 million yuan savings account into a trust account. Thereby, from the interest differential, they criminally obtained 700,000 yuan, of which Yi Bingqian received 400,000 yuan. The illegally obtained booty has all been recovered. The Chongqing City Intermediate Court has already sentenced him to death, suspended for two years. From June 1992 to April 1993 Zhang Gefei [1728 2706 7236], a teller at the Central District Insurance Office in Leshan City, embezzled 679,000 yuan. He fled after the offence but was subsequently apprehended. On 27 September, the Leshan City Intermediate Court tried Zhang and sentenced him to death. The head and deputy head of the accounting and finance section who bore major responsibility in this case were sentenced to prison terms for dereliction of duty. 5. A number of major cases were also discovered in some enterprises. Hu Changxian [5170 2490 0341], the chief engineer (deputy office head level) of the Chongqing Special Steel (Group) Company took advantage of his position in wholesaling steel products to accept bribes of 50,000 yuan. The courts have sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment. Su Yuxiang [5685 3254 3276], of the Yonghong Real Estate Development Company of Mianyang City, and Chen Qiuju [7115 4428 5468], the deputy general manager and cash handler from the same company, while engaged in real estate business in Hainan in April last year, embezzled 1.08 million yuan and absconded with the money. The procuratorial organs, after receiving the case, immediately organized the pursuit and apprehension of these persons and recovered all the booty. On 14 September, the Intermediate Court of Mianyang City sentenced Su Yuxiang to death and also sentenced Chen Qiuju to death, with the sentence suspended for two years. Qu Kaijun [4234 7030 6511], the Hailande Commercial and Trade Department manager and Qin Gesheng [6009 7245 0524], the business manager of the overseas enterprise branch of the Chongqing International Company, embezzled 690,000 yuan. The court tried them and sentenced the two criminals to death, with the sentence suspended for 2 years. 6. Over the year, 338 cases of tax evasion and tax avoidance were filed, investigated, and handled. Of these, 20 were major ones involving over 100,000 yuan, a 66.7 percent increase over 1992. Two cases involved amounts over 1 million yuan. The crime of defrauding the state of export drawbacks is a new one which has appeared in recent years subsequent to the reform of the taxation and foreign trade structures. Since 1992, throughout the province, nine such major cases have been detected involving a total of 20 million yuan. In March and April last year, Dai Fuquan [0108 1381 0356] and He Kai [0149 0418], both working in the Kaijiang Branch Office of the Zhongjiang County Industrial and Commercial Bureau, as well as Lin Xinquan [2651 0207 0356], an official from the county taxation bureau, improperly used operating licenses, tax registration certificates, fictitious factories, fake receipts and fake tax completion certificates to faudulently obtain 1.94 million yuan in state export drawbacks. Tan Qikun [6223 0366 0981], the head of the office of the Deyang City Taxation Bureau, Li Biyou [2621 4310 0645], the deputy head of the Deyang City Demobilized Military Cadres School, and Li Fumin, [2621 4395 3446], a purchaser for the Shoufeng Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the city's central district, colluded with each other to obtain by deception 1.84 million yuan in state export drawbacks. A total of 181 cases of fake trademarks were filed, investigated, and handled, an increase of 33 percent over 1992. Of these, seven cases involved over 1 million yuan in illicit funds. In October last year, on the basis of reports by the masses, the Yibin Branch Procuratorate investigated and dealt with a case involving a conspiracy by the managers of the Dalian Glass Factory and the Beijing Xiangxue Seafood Products Factory whereby they illegally produced 300,000 fake crystal bottles for Wuliangye wine. The Chongqing City procuratorial organs also apprehended six illegal producers of, and dealers in, imitation brand-name cigarettes, seizing over 3,000 cartons and over 240,000 counterfeit brand labels. They detained 19 people involved in these illegal activities. Wang Tianfu [3769 1131 4395], the manager of the Jiangjin Branch of the Bank of China, and others, used bank funds to assemble 226 fake Chongqing Jialing motorcycles, the illicit amount totaling 1.4 million yuan. The Shifang County Procuratorate investigated and arrested Liu Bangyun [0491 1620 0061], an employee of the Fangting Grain Station under the county grain bureau who, in collusion with the unemployed Huang Kaihong [7806 7030 3163], leased a disued wine cellar and used industrial alcohol to manufacture fake wine which they sold. This resulted in 13 persons suffering severe alcohol poisoning after drinking the wine. Four of those persons died and seven lost the sight or most of the sight in both eyes. The Deyang City Intermediate Court tried them for the crime of selling poisonous and harmful foodstuffs and both Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong were sentenced to death. The successes achieved in fighting graft and bribery were mainly realized following the increased attention given by the party and the people after the issuing in August of a party central committee directive on further properly grasping the struggle against corruption. Party committees at various levels gave attention to and strengthened leadership over the investigation and handling of major and serious cases. The broad masses warmly supported and actively participated in making reports against criminals, while the province's procuratorial personnel impartially implemented the law, did everything they could, and went all out in their work. This provided a clear contrast with the first half of the year when reports from the people declined, as did the number of cases filed. We need to draw experiences and lessons from this and carry forward the struggle against corruption in a deep-going and sustained way. We cannot allow laxity at any time. B. Actively developing the struggle to firmly strike at and seriously punish crime. Last year, the province's procuratorate actively coordinated with the public security organs and the courts and, in a planned and focused way, launched various specific struggles provincewide to "oppose theft," "strike at robbery," surround and annihilate "road and railway criminals," strike at the abduction of women, prohibit prostitution, eliminate the "six evils," and so on. After August in particular, with the unified deployment and leadership of the provincial party committee, the procuratorial organs actively participated in the unified provincewide struggle to rigorously strike at crime. As a result, there was a great increase in approvals for arrests and prosecutions. Over the year, requests were submitted by public security organs for approval to arrest 62,072 persons. Of these, 57,537 requests have been dealt with and the arrest of 53,317 persons was approved. This was an increase of 40.2 percent over 1992. Requests for transfer to prosecution and exemption of prosecution for 56,250 persons were received from the public security organs. Of these, 50,483 have already been handled and 48,183 persons have had public prosecutions initiated against them. This was 15.3 percent up on the 1992 figure. During the struggle to rigorously strike at crime, the procuratorates at all levels throughout the province took as their striking focus crimes such as murder, robbery, rape, hoodlumism, the abduction and sale of women and children, crimes involving serious violence, and gang crimes. Priority deployment of forces was made against vicious crimes which had major influence and presented a great danger to society. In such cases, there was advance intervention, firm handling, and timely examination of arrest applications and the examination of prosecution applications. The number of persons for whom arrests for serious crimes were approved was 16,104, or 30.2 percent of the total number of persons arrested. At Spring Festival last year, there was a very major case of robbery and murder in Chengdu City. The criminal brothers Zhou Qiang [0719 1730] and Zhou Tong [0719 1749], using the sound of the Spring Festival firecrackers as cover on two occasions, armed with guns, they entered houses and robbed and killed people. They killed six people and stole 600,000 yuan in property. The procuratorate organs engaged in advanced intervention and twodays after the public security organs had requested permission to arrest them, the permission was granted. Within four days of the transfer prosecution application, the prosecution was being pursued in court and, as a result, the criminals were firmly punished in a timely way. On 4 May last year, the Fengshan Cultural Troupe from Dianjiang County performed at Gaofengzhen in that county. Hong Kang [3163 1660], Chen Jiankang [7115 0256 1660], Chen Tao [7115 3447] and others, a total of six people from the county, did not buy tickets but forced their way into the theater, rushed onto the stage, and assaulted a male performer. After the performance was over, they also subjected the performers to indignities and seized and raped three female performers. This had an extremely odious effect and the cultural troupe was forced to disband. After the public security organs had investigated this case, the county procuratorate sent personnel to provide advance intervention and the arrest permission was swiftly given. On 13 October, the Fuling District Intermediate Court sentenced Hong Kang, Chen Jiankang, and Chen Tao to death for rape and hoodlumism, while the other three criminals were sentenced to prison terms ranging from eight to 12 years. The masses were extremely pleased by this. C. Seriously investigating criminal cases involving violation of citizens' democratic rights and crimes of dereliction of duty. Over the year, 897 criminal cases involving violation of rights and crimes of dereliction of duty were filed and investigated. Of these, 104 were major cases and and 53 were extremely serious cases, representing increases of 33.3 percent and 29.2 percent respectively on 1992. In April last year, Bai Tianliang [4101 1131 0081], deputy secretary of the Daqi District CPC Committee in Youyang County, together with the deputy district head Peng Defu [1756 1795 1381] and Li Maohong [2621 5399 4767], the acting party secretary of the Daxiang Township CPC Committee, engaged in the arbitrary collection of charges and the levying of fines. If the masses did not obey, these officials adopted various modes of punishment, including public parading in the streets, forcing people to kneel for long periods, forcing people to stand for long periods, and binding and beating people. They also took 21 peasants into custody illegally. The reaction of the local masses was extremely intense. With the support of the county party committee, the county procuratorate filed and investigated charges of illegal detention against Bai Tianliang and the others. In another case, the Hanyuan County Procuratorate investigated the extremely serious 12 July fire and found that it was an incident involving criminal culpability. The procuratorate filed and investigated a case against the person who caused the conflagration, the petrol station supervisor Gao Jun [7559 6511]. From this case it was discovered that Li Keping [2621 0344 1627], the deputy section head of the planning section of the county branch of the People's Bank of China had received bribes. In August 1993, the Sichuan Meishu Publishing House published the Taiwan children's comic book "An Abrupt Turn in Thinking." In this book, two pictures and associated texts seriously harmed the feelings of Muslim people, leading to demonstrations and sit-down protests by tens of thousands of people in several provinces, and the seeking of audiences with higher officials to lay complaints. This had serious political effects and harmed social stability. After the provincial procuratorate received the matter, it swiftly filed cases and commenced investigations against Li Kanglin [2621 1660 2651], the deputy head of the provincial Meishu Publishing House and others, a total of three people who had been negligent in their duties. The procuratorate also collected together copies of "An Abrupt Turn in Thinking" and burned them, to guard against the incident from expanding further and to bring stability back to social order. In other cases, 57 justice administration personnel were investigated for the crimes of self-serving misconduct, extorting confessions through torture, and illegal detention. Zhou Zhaofu [0719 2507 1381], a judge in the Ziyang City Court, while hearing a case of robbery, absolved the offender from guilt. On many other occasions while handling cases, Zhou used his position to extort bribes and he thereby received a total of 18,000 yuan. The procuratorial organs filed a case charging him with self-serving misconduct and carried out an investigation. II. Strengthening the Consciousness of Supervision, Strengthening Supervision of Law Enforcement Since the beginning of last year, the procuratorates at all levels throughout the province have seriously implemented the spirit of the 14th Party Congress and the First Session of the Eighth NPC, have firmly implemented law supervision responsibilities, and have realized new advances in various aspects of law supervision work. The strengthening of supervision over investigation has mainly involved the supervision and prevention of mistakes and leaks in investigative activities through the examination of the arrest approval and prosecution approval functions. Last year, the procuratorates at various levels throughout the province decided not to allow the arrest of 4,343 persons whose arrest was unnecessary or against whom a case could not be built. They also made decisions in accordance with the law, not to allow the prosecution of 206 persons who should not have had criminal responsibility assigned to them. During investigations, they also pursued and captured in a timely way, 540 criminal elements who had slipped through the net and prosecuted 355 persons. In respect of illegal activities which occurred during investigation activities by the public security organs, they put forward 331 ideas on redressing the problems. In strengthening supervision over the administration of justice, the various levels of procuratorate have, in response to illegal activities which have occurred during trials in the people's courts, put forward 64 suggestions on redressing the problems. In investigating the 112 appeals which held that court decisions and rulings were erroneous, courts have heard 28 of these appeals and in 17 cases the decisions or rulings were changed. There has also been strengthening of supervision over prisons and detention centers and over enforcement. Last year, in response to some prisons and detention centers not firmly enforcing the law, taking money to offset punishment, and arbitrarily levying charges, a special investigation was carried out. The problems noted in the investigation report attracted great attention from the provincial people's congress and the NPC Standing Committee. This led to the judicial organs rectifying the unhealthy trend in levying charges. Supervision over the implementation of reduced sentences, release on parole, and release from custody to obtain medical treatment was strengthened, while improprieties were swiftly discovered and redressed. When crimes were discovered they were swiftly investigated and dealt with. Zheng Wanming [6774 8001 2494], head of the Mianzhu County Detention Center, by illegally arranging for 27 criminals to be released for medical treatment, extorted over 14,000 yuan cash and a pair of gold earrings from the family members of the criminals. He also privately released two offenders. Zhang Wanming has already been tried and sentenced to 9 years imprisonment. Over the year, through examination of prisons and detention centers, a total of 33 cases were filed and investigated against 38 prison and detention center staff for crimes such as graft, bribery, corporal punishment, cruel treatment, and the private release of prisoners. At the same time, the procuratorates conducted activities by which they struck at those personnel who committed crimes while engaged in administering reform through labor and education through labor. Over the year, the arrest of 61 persons was approved and public prosecutions were initiated against 916 persons. This safeguarded order during the transformation of prisons and detention centers. The examination of complaints and petitions was strengthened and there was reexamination of cases against which petitions were lodged. In this way, if there were cases they were examined and if there had been mistakes they were redressed. Over the year, 585 cases were filed for the examination and handling of petitions which came under the jurisdiction of the procuratorial organs. Through investigation, 226 verdicts were sustained, 73 were corrected, it was suggested that the courts reexamine 10 cases, and one application was rejected. By handling these cases, the supervisory restraints within the procuratorial organs were strengthened and the solemnity of the law was maintained. In order to raise the quality of work in receiving the masses, the procuratorates throughout the province developed reception activities in a civilized way. Fifty-three civilized units were recognized and it was decided to confer the title "Civilized Reception Hall" on 32 reception halls. Of these reception halls, those of the Chengdu City Procuratorate and the Bazhong City Procuratorate have been awarded the title "Civilized Reception Hall" by the Supreme People's Procuratorate. Civil and administrative inspection was also strengthened. Protests were lodged in accordance with the law against civil and administrative decisions and orders which had been put into effect but which were obviously erroneous. We upheld the policy of "positive, earnest, and stable" actions. With one hand, we grasped basic work while, with the other we grasped the handling of cases and thereby developed supervision through the handling of cases. Throughout the year, 1,258 petitions against civil and administrative decisions and orders made by courts, and which had already been put into effect, were accepted. Of these, the handling of over 1,038 has already been completed and in 371 instances, cases were filed. In 75 of these, it was suggested that the court redress the matter, while in 18 cases appeals were filed in court. By the end of the year, three judgements had been revised and the legitimate rights and interests of the party's concerned had been maintained. Strengthening railway supervision work. In the struggle to combat graft and bribery, the Chengdu Railway Bureau Branch Procuratorate and the procuratorates at the six branch railway bureaus, centering around the rectification of railway practices and with the work focus placed on investigating the use of railcars and tickets for private gain, put all their efforts into investigating and handling large and serious cases. Over the year, they filed and investigated 70 cases relating to graft, bribery, and other economic crimes. Of these, 29, or 41.4 percent of the total, were large or serious cases. An amount in excess of 1.31 million yuan in economic losses was recovered for the state. In the struggle to "seriously strike" at such crimes, the railway procuratorates at both levels actively participated in various specific struggles and improvements. The focus was placed on striking at a group of "railroad robbers," to safeguard railroad order. Throughout the year, the arrest of 1206 criminals was approved and public prosecutions were launched against 1103 persons. III. Opposing Corruption, Promoting Clean Government, and Doing Well in Building a Procuratorial Contingent From the beginning of last year, under the new situation of establishing a socialist market economy structure, the procuratorates at various levels throughout the province strengthened ideological and political work. They earnestly arranged for the police to study the spirit of the documents of the 14th Party Congress and the First Session of the Eighth NPC and of a series of speeches by General Secretary Jiang. They used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to unify understanding. They educated the police in strictly implementing the law, in observing discipline, in opposing corruption, in promoting clean government, and in rectifying the irregular practices within the procuratorates. In a situation where the tasks are onerous and the conditions arduous, the procuratorial police throughout the province maintained high morale, devoted themselves to the service of the public, struggled hard, carried out their duties tenaciously, and manifested the characteristics of procuratorial police. In accordance with the central directives and provincial committee's deployments, we strengthened our own work of opposing corruption and promoting clean government. In response to problems existing in our ranks whereby the law is enforced insufficiently rigorously, where violations of the law are not investigated, where there are instances of exceeding authority in the investigation of cases and of arbitrary levying of charges, in July and August procuratorial organs throughout the province carried out education and a readjustment in respect of strictly implementing the law. Since September, the leading cadres at and above the county and office levels have carried out a clean government self-discipline inspection and, at the same time, further rectified unhealthy trends within their own systems. 1. The procuratorial organs throughout the province ferreted out 180,000 yuan in arbitrarily levied "prosecution and examination exemption fees," "nonarrest and nonprosecution education fees" and so on, returning the money to those who had originally paid such fees. They investigated the "bail by which one obtains a guarantor and awaits trial out of custody," which was being levied by departments and, in July, in accordance with a directive from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, stopped the levying of this bail. 2. Since the beginning of last year, procuratorial organs throughout the province have, in accordance with relevant stipulations from upper levels, been engaged in sorting out 123 companies of various sorts which have been established. 3. The provincial procuratorate, in accordance with stipulations by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, issued timely circulars prohibiting procuratorate staff from intervening in economic disputes and from exceeding their powers in handling cases. In respect of those few procuratorates and procuratorial policemen who intervened in economic disputes and exceeded their powers in investigating cases, firm examinations and rectifications were carried out. 4. Throughout the province, 38 cases were filed and investigated in respect of violations of law and discipline by procuratorial policemen and in eight cases, criminal charges were laid. In opposing corruption and promoting clean government, in accordance with the stipulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and in the light of reality, two sets of "eight prohibitions" disciplinary rules for procuratorial organs and officials were formulated and it was required that the procuratorates and their staff throughout the province observe and implement these. In looking back at work over the year, the main problems which have existed in procuratorial work have been as follows: 1. In the struggle to combat graft, insufficient stress has been placed on investigating and handling large and serious cases in key sectors, while in leading the organs in investigating and handling there has been the fear of difficulty. During the handling of such cases, investigators have thus shrunk back and been overly cautious. 2. Supervision of problems such as cases which are not investigated, people paying fines rather than undergoing imprisonment, and money being used to pay off prison terms, has been insufficiently strict. Further, phenomena such as enforcement of the law being insufficiently rigorous and violations of the law not being investigated occurred frequently. 3. Some procuratorates pay insufficient attention to policies and tactics during the handling of cases, their work is crude and simplistic, and they sometimes violate the law in handling cases. 4. Many district and county procuratorates are seriously lacking in funds for handling cases and their equipment is backward. This has seriously hampered the strict enforcement of the law. Fellow deputies: The "CPC Central Committee Decision on Certain Questions Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy Structure" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the building of the legal system and of clean government and to firmly and unyieldingly carry out the struggle against graft. The central political and law conference pointed out that it is necessary, while accelerating the pace of the reforms by which we are establishing a socialist market economy structure, to safeguard the state's political and social stability. In 1994, the tasks of procuratorial work throughout the province are as follows: We will uphold guidance by the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; firmly uphold the policy of "grasping with two hands and ensuring that both hands are tight"; strengthen legal supervisory functions; strictly enforce the law; vigorously grasp the handling of cases; centralize strengths in investigating and handling graft, bribery, and other large and serious cases; strike at various types of criminal activities; protect the legitimate rights of citizens; safeguard political and social stability; create a fine legal environment for reforms, opening up, and modernization; and guarantee the establishment and development of a socialist market economy structure. We must develop the struggle against graft in a deep-going and sustained way; centralize our strengths in investigating and handling the large and serious cases which occur in party and government organs, judicial organs, administrative law enforcement departments, and economic management departments; and we must investigate and handle crimes involving legal personnel engaging in bribery, tax fraud, use of false trademarks, and smuggling. It is necessary to strike at serious criminal activities in a sustained and unwavering way, to actively participate in the various specific struggles and improvements in "seriously striking" at such activities, and continue to strengthen examination and handling of crimes such as "violation of rights" and dereliction of duty. It is necessary to employ the principle of "seriously enforcing the law and firmly grasping the handling of cases" in handling overall procuratorial work and to strengthen the various types of legal supervisory functions. In supervision of investigations, we must strengthen supervision over situations where cases exist but have not been investigated and where fines replace imprisonment. In the supervision of trials, we need to improve the level of public prosecutions and increase the strength of appeals. In supervising implementation, it is necessary to strengthen examination of the way in which cases of reduced sentences, parole, and allowing prisoners to remain out of custody to receive medical treatment are handled and also to investigate cases where persons are held in custody beyond the period of their sentence. When the law is broken or perverted and a criminal case has been demonstrated, it must be firmly investigated and handled. Civil and administrative supervision involves appeals in accordance with the law against civil and administrative judgements and rulings made by the people's courts which are already in effect but which are obviously erroneous. It is also necessary to pay full attention to the examination and handling of judicial officers who are corrupt or who have perverted the law. It is also necessary to do well in terms of the dual internal restraints and in guaranteeing the quality of cases. We must continue to do well in the self-strengthening of the procuratorial contingent and raise the political quality and law enforcement level of the enforcement personnel. They should seriously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, more strongly uphold the party's basic principles, uphold the idea of "grasping both types of work simultaneously," and uphold the firmness and consciousness of the struggle against graft. It is necessary to do well in the ideological construction of procuratorate leading groups at all levels, to increase their cohesiveness and their fighting strength. It is necessary to continue to carry out education in opposing graft and promoting clean government and to correct the various unhealthy trends. It is necessary to continue to perfect the target responsibility systems and case-handling responsibility systems and we must actively explore measures for reforming the procuratorial cadre personnel system to encourage the procuratorial police to exert themselves and be zealous in their work. We must also continue to do well in professional training and raise the level of law enforcement. We must build procuratorates in accordance with the law, carry out examinations strictly, implement the law firmly, and establish strict discipline. We must consciously and actively accept supervision by the people's congresses and their standing committees and handle matters strictly in accordance with the law. At set intervals we must, in accordance with the law, report on our work to the people's congresses and their standing committees and fully respect their deliberations and opinions. We must warmly accept examination of law enforcement work by the people's congress standing committees and handle those cases handed over by people's congresses. We must actively and responsibly deal with proposals, suggestions, criticisms, and ideas put forward by people's congress representatives. It is necessary to strengthen links with local people's congress representatives and open-mindedly listen to their suggestions, criticisms, and ideas on our work, so that we can continually improve procuratorial work.
