He criticized yesterday's statement by Boris Yeltsin on Russia's military bases on the territory of other states. Russia has started an aggressive economic policy toward the Baltic states. The Lithuanian prime minister cited as an example a 15 April decision to increase customs duties. Russia is introducing strict limitations on the import of some goods. Therefore, Adolfas Slezevicius said, we will be compelled to discuss and adopt reciprocal measures. Negotiations with Belarus on the delimitation of borders are also at a standstill. The Lithuanian prime minister links this with the political situation in Belarus. Sea borders with Latvia have been agreed in principle, and coordination at parliament level between the two countries is now taking place. Describing the situation, the prime minister noted that the establishment of sea borders both with Russia and with Latvia will not be to Lithuania's advantage, but such is the geographical situation of our republic. The prime minister announced his forthcoming visit to Kuwait this coming weekend. Two agreements are to be signed there -- on the protection of investments, and a document on a $50 million credit. A plan for using these funds already exists. Adolfas Slezevicius called the small state of Kuwait one of the largest donors in the financial world. If our first experience of cooperation is successful, it is possible that we will arrange a permanent credit line. Describing documents adopted at a government meting on Wednesday, the prime minister noted a decision which regulates the mechanism of declaring especially expensive property items. A decision was also adopted to double the taxation on wholesale imports of alcohol to Lithuania. If in the past a wholesale trade license cost 150,000 litas, now it will cost 300,000.
