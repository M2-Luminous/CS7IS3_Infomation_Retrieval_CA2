Moreover, it would only send its men on peacekeeping missions, and not into conflicts such as that in the former Yugoslavia. This is how Swiss Federal Councillor Kaspar Villiger countered the arguments of opponents of the blue helmets. He was speaking in Bern on Monday [18 April] in a debate organized by the Swiss radical press association. The head of the Federal Military Department (DMF) expressed his concern that attention had been focused on the three most spectacular operations involving UN blue helmets, namely, those being carried out in the background of the wars raging in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Rwanda. These cases are exceptions overshadowing the 14 other operations currently being implemented successfully, for example in Cyprus, the Golan Heights, and Cambodia. No Swiss Sent to War Mr. Villiger stressed that Swiss blue helmets would not be sent to war and would only participate in operations where their independence was guaranteed. It would be wrong to claim that sending out a force of blue helmets is incompatible with Swiss neutrality. The blue helmets are precisely neutral intermediaries between opposing forces, there to "give peace a chance." Other neutral countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and Austria have had blue helmets for some time. Switzerland benefits from external security, if only by avoiding being submerged by requests for asylum. The DMF head stressed that the issue of possible NATO membership, if it ever came up again, would have to be put to a vote of the people of the Swiss cantons. It is therefore wrong to claim that the creation of a troop of blue helmets would automatically lead to membership. Bosnia Is a Bad Example Austria's Major General Guenter Greindl, who headed the UN forces for 13 years, also participated in the debate which was organized in the light of the upcoming vote of 12 June. He emphasized that Austria considers the blue helmets to be an important aspect of its active neutrality policy. In his opinion, the Bosnia example gave a deformed view of reality. The radical national councilor Oscar Fritschi (ZH) also condemned the "dangerous method" of showing just the negative aspects. It was even possible to speak of success in the former Yugoslavia, since blue helmets have saved hundreds of lives there. Peter Vollmer, the Socialist national councilor from Bern, claimed that by participating in the UN peacekeeping missions, Switzerland would make a major but insufficient contribution. This was just a first step toward a more open and solidarity-minded policy. For Mr. Vollmer, it is time to redefine Swiss neutrality. No "Lack of Solidarity" The only opponent invited to speak in the debate, National Councillor Walter Steinmann of the Automobile Drivers' Party, pointed to the distress of the blue helmets in the former Yugoslavia. He considered that Switzerland would not be able to pull its troops out of a war zone if the situation deteriorated rapidly. Switzerland does not have a "lack of solidarity" it has to make up. In addition to its financial support through humanitarian and development aid, the was already showing its solidarity through the Red Cross and the Swiss Disaster Assistance Corps.
