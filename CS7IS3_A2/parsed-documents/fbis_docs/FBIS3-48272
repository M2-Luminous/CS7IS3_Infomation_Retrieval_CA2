And some paid media of the United States urge the DPRK to accept a special inspection, spreading the rumor that it agreed to accept routine and ad hoc inspections at the New York contact. This is an act of throwing a wet blanket over the solution of the nuclear issue the way of which has been paved with so much efforts; it cannot be construed otherwise than a folly of those who do not know the essential nature of the nuclear issue or the direction of its solution but seek other purpose, says NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. The news analyst notes: The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula was caused by the introduction of nuclear weapons into South Korea by the United States. It is also the United States which complicated the situation by bringing forward "suspected nuclear development by the North". Thus the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a matter to be solved between the United States and the DPRK in view of its origin and background of its complexity today and the DPRK and the United States have the authority to solve it. For the United States to remove the nuclear threat to the DPRK and renounce its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK is the precondition for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue and a matter of clearing the debt owed by the United States to the DPRK down through history. The DPRK agreed with the United States on the matter of inspection because we took into account the fact that the U.S. side accepted our formula of package deal and proposal for both sides to move simultaneously and manifested its willingness to discontinue the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises this year and hold the third-round DPRK-USA talks. As for the inspection we intend to allow this time, it is an inspection needed merely for the guarantee of the continuity of safeguards according to the promise we made to the United States when we suspended temporarily the effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] for the solution of the nuclear issue through negotiations. The conception of the inspection for the continuity of safeguards is a new one that originated from our special position in the state of temporary stop of the effectuation of the withdrawal from NPT. The inspection for the continuity of safeguards is, therefore, quite different from the routine and ad hoc inspections pursuant to the obligation under the NPT and, moreover, the "special inspection" cannot be an object of debate. The DPRK is in a state of temporary suspension of the effectuation of its withdrawal from the NPT. Therefore we are not under obligation to implement the safeguards agreement like a full-fledged signatory. This notwithstanding, the anti-dialogue forces of the United States, setting in motion intelligence plotters and paid trumpeters, are painting an exaggerated picture of the fact as if the U.S. side has made a unilateral compromise and crying that the DPRK must be made to undergo the routine and ad hoc inspections and "special inspection" of the International Atomic Energy Agency first. This is an imprudent act that does not hold water. That the rightwing conservative forces of the United States are crying for pressure by demanding even the "special inspection" cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to bring the situation to a catastrophe by totally driving the DPRK out of the NPT. This real intention is to break up the DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and persistently pursue the hostile policy to stifle the DPRK. We will counter toughness with toughness and our tough will will be manifested more strongly in practice than in word. If the U.S. hard-line conservative forces do not want to regret for their act tomorrow, they should act with discretion before it is too late.
