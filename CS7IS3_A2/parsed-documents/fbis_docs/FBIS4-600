The effect of the additions to the emergency regulations would be to empower the Independent Electoral Commission to conduct elections in the territory in the face of kwaZulu government and Inkatha Freedom Party opposition to the poll. TEC delegate and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo introduced a resolution which he said would remove the element of discretion from the kwaZulu authorities in deciding on what facilities it would make available for the elections. He said the kwaZulu government could not be allowed to exercise its discretion because it had not displayed goodwill towards the elections. The exact nature of the additions to the regulations was left to the TEC's structures to decide. Mr Slovo said the new regulations would empower the Independent Electoral Commission further. TEC Chairman Dawie de Villiers said in a briefing after the TEC meeting that the purpose of the new regulations was to promote an atmosphere conducive to the elections. The new regulations would be released on Wednesday.
