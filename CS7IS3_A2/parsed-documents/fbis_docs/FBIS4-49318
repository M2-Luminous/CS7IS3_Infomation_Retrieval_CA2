The birth of a new South Africa with racial equality is the beginning of a new era in South Africa.

The ANC and other liberation organizations of black people have played their key roles in bringing about this historic change in South Africa.

After the founding of the new South African Government, China is ready to establish and develop friendly relations and cooperation with South Africa on the basis of the five principles for peaceful coexistence. The spokesman expressed the belief that the traditional friendship forged between the Chinese and South African peoples during the protracted struggle certainly will be consolidated and developed on a new basis.
