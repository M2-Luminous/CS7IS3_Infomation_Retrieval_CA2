Voronin, Chief Designer of Nuclear Charges and Munitions of the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, by Aleksandr Nezhnyy, date and place not given: "The Bomb" -- first two paragraphs are editorial introduction] [Excerpt] In 1927 Soviet power sealed the Sarov monastery, renowned for the spiritual deeds of the venerable Serafim, once and for all. One year later an NKVD child labor colony was housed in the monastery buildings. In 1933 the colony was replaced by a camp where not only criminals but also Article 58 victims served their time. In 1938 a small plant was built there which produced iron bedsteads, kitchen utensils, and skates, and it was from this latter product that the plant derived its nickname. During the war the "skate" plant manufactured howitzer shells and later produced Katyusha rockets. On 8 April 1946 a three-man commission arrived at Sarov: One member of that commission was Yu.B. Khariton, now a successful academician and three times a Hero. Within a year a special secrecy regime was introduced here and the city disappeared from the maps. In present-day Arzamas-16 little remains of the Sarov monastery. Only the bell tower and the guest buildings escaped destruction.... In addition to the municipal museum and the "Sarov Monastery" museum, founded by local history enthusiasts, the city also has a most unique museum of nuclear weapons. Here you can touch the first Soviet atomic bomb with your own hands, reel in horror at the appalling dimensions of the thermonuclear bomb, see fragments of once top-secret films on atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, and hear the stern but, at the same time, exultant voice of the announcer saying: "A blinding flash! The raging elements destroy all the test installations within a radius of 4 km." When describing the super-bomb tests a kindly woman says, not without a note of pride, that the explosion produced a shock wave of such force that it would have gone round the globe three times. There used to be a monastery here -- it became a vast workshop producing weapons of awesome force. That is one image of the 20th century. Nezhnyy: Stanislav Nikolayevich, a man in your post is something of an unknown quantity in a society like ours. So would you be so kind as to tell us a little about yourself. Voronin: With pleasure. I am 63 years old, I was born in Yaroslavl, and in 1942 my brother and I were left without a father, our mother without a husband. It was wartime. After secondary school in Yaroslavl I studied at the weapons department of the Leningrad shipbuilding institute, where I received my diploma in 1954, specializing in torpedoes. I came to Arzamas-16 right away in order to make the bomb. As you can see, I am still here. I got married here and our children were born here... I have met and worked with some very interesting people here and learned a lot from them. Let me mention two names: Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov and Yuliy Borisovich Khariton. Yuliy Borisovich is 90 years old but he is still working hard; you can find him at the institute on weekends and late in the evening. Nezhnyy: What does it mean to create a nuclear weapon? Voronin: First of all it is a very complex process. We are dealing with the very small segments of time in which the high precision mechanism of the charge and the munition operates, very high temperatures and very high pressures, which do not exist in practice in laboratory conditions. That is why experiments are very important for us.... Nezhnyy: Nuclear tests? Voronin: Yes. The magnitudes which we work in can only be calibrated by experiment. Nezhnyy: Otherwise, the result is failure? Voronin: We may not achieve the expected result. There were quite a few instances of that kind, and this makes us come back to the question of nuclear tests. Without them we cannot improve our weaponry. We can make minor improvements but there will be no major progress. Nezhnyy: You say that tests are necessary, but the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of our planet would say if asked: To hell with you and all your explosions! Isn't that so? Voronin: Do not portray us as some kind of monsters burning with a desire to carry out one test after another, ad infintum. No! Nevertheless, since life has forced the country to equip itself with its own nuclear weapons and since we have had to constantly improve them, they must be under reliable control. Control is all the more necessary in the conditions of our industry today, with its severed production ties and changes of suppliers and materials. After all, the replacement of materials could influence the characteristics of our product. Meanwhile we give a guarantee for the whole sequence of operations, as it were. That is why we simply have to check the condition that the products are in, whether they are still in a high state of readiness and reliability, and so forth. Otherwise they could become a threat to their owners. It is not only our specialists who adhere to that view but the Americans, too. We believe that as long as nuclear weapons exist they must be tested. In limited quantities and with very rigorous conditions regarding ecological cleanliness and safety -- but they must be tested. There is no other way. Nezhnyy: So the aim is, on the one hand, to guarantee the reliability of the existing nuclear weapons arsenals and, on the other, to make progress in improving them. Is that why tests are necessary? Voronin: Yes. Nezhnyy: You have undoubtedly been present at nuclear tests? Voronin: I went to Novaya Zemlya virtually every year from 1969 through 1989. Since 1963, as you know, testing has taken place exclusively underground. This costs more than testing in the atmosphere, of course, but it is ecologically cleaner and safer. They drill a well or, in mountainous locations, they cut a gallery, lower the charge into it... Nezhnyy: Deep down? Voronin: That depends on the yield. But as a rule it is usually deeper than 500 meters -- to prevent any discharges. Nezhnyy: How do you feel during all this? Voronin: Please do not think that I am saying this for effect, but you await an explosion with a tension which is really hard to describe. And then.... Then the ground begins to move under your feet -- and we are 10 km from the site of the explosion, sometimes closer. A roar begins. It is probably somewhat like an earthquake. Nezhnyy: Does your institute conduct tests here around Arzamas-16? Voronin: Yes. At sites a long way from the city. This is essential. Then you need a conventional explosive. We do not work with fissile materials here. Nezhnyy: So the talk that everything here in this district is contaminated with radiation is.... Voronin: Nonsense. We have a special service which monitors the air and the water. They are cleaner here than in Moscow. Nezhnyy: That is fine. But then what you call a new product is created here. How long does that take? Voronin: From conception to the completion of research work -- 5-8 years. The product contains the achievements of virtually all sectors of science and technology. Our institute is a multidisciplinary scientific center where all the spheres of physics, mechanics, mathematics, physical metallurgy, chemistry, and electronics are represented... It has one of the most powerful computer centers in the country. Nezhnyy: Is the quantity determined by the state order? Voronin: We have nothing to do with that. The client orders as much as he needs. For our part we monitor every product from beginning to end: manufacture, operation, dismantling, and recycling. [passage omitted] Voronin: You want to ask me what my feelings are? Nezhnyy: Yes. Voronin: I always tell my colleagues: We make our weapons so as not to go to war with them. I do not think that intelligent people can ever use them. My whole life I have worked to ensure that this weapon makes it impossible even to contemplate the idea of beginning a war! In 1945 the Americans were able to drop "Little Boy" and "Fat Boy," but very soon even they had to think about the possibility of a retaliatory strike. Since then the task has been to preserve a balance of forces which makes it impossible to use nuclear weapons under any conditions. In this regard, admittedly, we and the United States overdid it and stockpiled vast nuclear arsenals. Now it is time to sort things out. Living alongside yields of this magnitude is inconceivable! Reduction is a noble cause. Nevertheless I do not think that the 20th century will see a final end to these weapons. Our children will still have to rack their brains to decide how to get rid of these weapons once and for all. Nezhnyy: Stanislav Nikolayevich, what is the average age of staff at the All-Russia Experimental Physics Scientific Research Institute? Voronin: Forty-two. Nezhnyy: Is that high? Voronin: Yes. But the average age of workers in science is 46. That is really high. The problem is that now we have virtually no young specialists coming through to replace them. In the past our work had prestige, and here at Arzamas-16 the young specialist could enjoy a series of social benefits that were difficult to obtain back in European Russia, such as apartments, good medical services, recreation -- but now things are not only no better here than elsewhere, they are even worse. So no one comes out here to join us. Nezhnyy: Yet the Federal Nuclear Center is Russia's national asset. Does the government really not understand that, does the president not realize it? Voronin: Destroying a center is easy, creating one is incredibly difficult and nowadays I think that it is simply impossible. Just recently, it is true, things do seem to have happened. I told you that it takes us eight years to create a new product. That means that it needs a program. We proposed such programs long ago but they were ignored. Now interest has been shown in them, the government is creating the corresponding structures, and I am confident that in the end everything will work out right, these political games will end, and people will get down to work. Nezhnyy: Does the brain drain not worry you any more? Voronin: There are people who worked with us and who left for other republics of the CIS. They number just a few. No one, as far as I am aware, has yet gone further afield than that. In the main this brain drain is toward commercial structures, and these are good people who are leaving. Generally speaking if the economic situation gets worse the danger of the proliferation of nuclear technologies will increase. The state's duty and paramount obligation is to do everything it can to prevent this.
