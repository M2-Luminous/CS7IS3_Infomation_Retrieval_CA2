FR940919-0-00078 FR940919-0-00016 C. Treatment Standards for New TC Organic Constituents (D018&hyph;D043) 1. Nonwastewaters The Agency is also promulgating concentration-based treatment standards for TC organic constituents in nonwastewaters, that are identical to the levels promulgated as UTS in a separate section of this preamble. These standards are based on treatment data that were used to establish UTS for these same constituents in listed wastes. These standards are primarily based on incineration data and are presented at the end of this section. EPA believes that a variety of treatment technologies, combustion and non-combustion, can achieve these treatment standards. EPA reiterates that any technology that does not constitute impermissible dilution can be used to meet these concentration levels.
