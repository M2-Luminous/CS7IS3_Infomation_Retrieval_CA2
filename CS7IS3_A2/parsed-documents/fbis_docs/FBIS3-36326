He reported plans to pay 3 Tn rubles over the first four months of the year towards the state debt to enterprises, this is only one-third of the state's total debt. According to his forecast, inflation would mount at a rate of under 20% over 8 months of this year. In January, inflation growth was about 25%, which the minister blamed largely on last year's decisions to index amortization deductions and raise a number of tariffs, as well as on inflationary expectations. By the end of the year, inflation is to be curbed "down to 7-9% and may be down to 3-5%," Shokhin said. In his words, the government will pursue a tough fiscal line, will oblige enterprises to account for all their expenses, and will provide funds only for concrete projects. The minister believes that this could keep taxes under control. He spoke in favor of selective structural policy and remarked that over the 10 days as economics minister he could not be proud of the fact that centralized funds had not been spent where they might have done the best good. In regard to social security, Shokhin stressed the need for effective help to the poor. He recognized as fair the IMF's criticism of Russia for its neglect of social security. He spoke in favour of fixing an official unemployment limit. Official statistics put the number of unemployed at 1 Mn, but by other estimates, there are 4 Mn without work plus 4 Mn unregistered jobless. On economic cooperation with CIS countries, Shokhin wished that cooperation with them to be closer "but not at the expense of our interests." In his words, negotiations are still under way with Belarus on how to integrate the monetary systems of the two countries. This mechanism, he said, is to be ready by the week-end. Although Russia has a positive balance of trade with its CIS partners, Shokhin spoke with anxiety about the flow of capital out of Russia. He voiced hope that better legislation could return this money to Russia. In foreign trade, the government will continue the course toward liberalization, including the reduction of a number of quotas and the abolition of export tariffs. Shokhin on the whole rejected the proposals carried in the report on the social and economic situation in Russia, drawn up by three noted economists Leonid Abalkin, Nikolai Petrakov, and Stanislav Shatalin. The paper "is appealing from the point of view of what should not be done," Shokhin said. But the proposals are too general by nature, he added. The Economics Ministry will formulate a more detailed view on the report after its discussion by the ministry's board next week, Shokhin said.
