At today's scheduled news conference, Saeima Associate Chairman Aivars Berkis gave the following account of the session: [Begin Berkis recording] I have not seen such a dramatic situation since the August coup of 1991 as that experienced by the Latvian Parliament last night. The extraordinary session was convened at the request of deputies of the radical right, For the Fatherland and Freedom and the Latvian National Independence Movement [LNNK], in order to block the signing of any of the agreements initialled on 15 March with Russia, and to form a new delegation for the talks. Only 26 deputies, however, voted for this bill, for the individual paragraphs; there was no (?vote) for it as a whole. Thereafter, with the deputies of the Fatherland and Freedom and the LNNK, together with Equal Rights deputies and Popular Harmony Party deputies not taking part in the vote, the version favored by the state president and supported by the Latvian Way and Peasants' Union factions -- wanting the signing of the first three draft agreements and favoring clarification of the agreement on retired military personnel and its corresponding with the norms of international law -- was also rejected. Therefore, on an issue of great importance to Latvia, its security and future, the Saeima was at the same time both against signing the agreements and against not signing the agreements. In such a situation the state president was entitled to propose the dissolution of the Saeima, which would mean a referendum, new elections, and a whole string of unforeseeable complications. Or else the simpler way out -- to raise the question of confidence in the government on its handling of foreign and security policy. Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs proposed such a vote of confidence. In my opinion this was an (?impetuous) decision, because most of the deputies in the governing coalition were not at the plenary session. However, the result was positive: Of the 87 present, 51 supported the government's course. I believe that if all those deputies loyal to the government had been present, then (?69) of the votes would have been in the government's favor (?against 30), which would be more than in the autumn, when the Saeima voted for the then newly formed government of Valdis Birkavs. In my opinion this vote is sufficient proof that the state president, together with the prime minister, can continue its dialogue with Russia. [end recording] So, today, in the Saeima, the government received a vote of confidence. [passage omitted]
