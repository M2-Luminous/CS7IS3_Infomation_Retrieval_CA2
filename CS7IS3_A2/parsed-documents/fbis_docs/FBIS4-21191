FBIS4-21191 "jptdd017__l94034" JPRS-TDD-94-017-L JPRS Narcotics 9 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA Arrieta Calls on De Greiff To Stop Making `Isolated' Arrieta Calls on De Greiff To Stop Making `Isolated' Decisions PA1604222294 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 5A PA1604222294 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Spanish BFN [Text] Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has described certain decisions by Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff as being ``isolated,'' and he said such decisions generate reactions that make people question their institutions and their coworkers. ``I am respectfully calling on the prosecutor general to stop making isolated decisions that can adversely affect the country's criminal policy,'' Arrieta said. The attorney general also referred to Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez's position: ``I have observed with irony and sadness how, by way of a letter a few days ago, the justice minister has established conditions for subjecting drug traffickers to justice, even though more than a year ago the Attorney General's Office had requested the inclusion of these same conditions in the Criminal Code.'' Arrieta spoke to journalists yesterday to explain his views regarding the controversy that has emerged in the relations between U.S. officials and the Colombian Prosecutor General's Office, and he called on De Greiff to act in harmony and to cooperate with other institutions. He added: ``Serious harm will be done to Colombia and all of its citizens when, by way of isolated decisions, certain reactions are generated that make people question their institutions and their peers, because for every criminal there are thousands of decent citizens who are demanding respect for their dignity and rights.'' According to the attorney general, the prosecutor general's isolated statements and decisions should not be allowed to endanger the state's criminal policy, because ``no institution can claim for itself the exclusive handling of the state's criminal policy.'' He added: ``There is a constitutional mandate that calls for harmony and cooperation among all branches of government. It is necessary to understand that the legal strategies of prohibition and prevention should parallel one another and be harmonious within the state.'' The attorney general added: ``I do not want this statement to be interpreted as if I am supporting someone. I simply want to make a constructive contribution toward resolving a national problem that has resulted in serious consequences, such as the labeling of Colombia as a narcodemocracy.'' Arrieta admitted that the current Criminal Code is a failure because of all of its legal flaws and contradictions. He said the drug traffickers' lawyers have taken advantage of these shortcomings. Arrieta said: ``The lack of standards has prompted attorneys for drug traffickers to try to obtain more favorable conditions for their clients.'' The problems with the code, according to the high-ranking official, can be summarized this way: ``There are confusing standards in terms of protocol, advantages and benefits of the law, and the application of differing views, and these eventually lead to lenient decisions.'' Arrieta also said there are documents that prove that since February 1992 the Attorney General's Office has been insisting on the need for a tougher Criminal Code. Another Criminal Code Arrieta said: ``It is no secret that the Attorney General's Office was the only office that originally opposed the reform of the Criminal Code, because it believed the discretionary powers given to prosecutors in doling out benefits were too broad.'' The attorney general said there are 60-70 criminal policy standards, but he added that all of these are confusing and contradictory. ``This is why, according to the Attorney General's Office, as far as the struggle against drug trafficking is concerned, it is important for the government, the Congress, and the judicial branch to assume the challenge of issuing as soon as possible significant procedural standards that reflect a clear-cut criminal policy.'' The attorney general said the new criminal code must include guidelines for meting out sentences that correspond to the seriousness of the crime. He said: ``They should offer viable judicial alternatives that will generate neither impunity nor a sense of impunity.'' While waiting for these kinds of reforms, Arrieta promised ``to proceed forcefully and seriously in such a way that those guilty of crimes receive punishment that correspond to their acts.'' He also said he will continue to work within the framework of the legal and constitutional responsibilities the Attorney General's Office has in criminal cases. Arrieta added: ``If, as a state, we are unable to promote a comprehensive Criminal Code which features sentences that are proportional to the crimes, and which establishes clear criteria for the application of benefits, then something seriously wrong here.''
