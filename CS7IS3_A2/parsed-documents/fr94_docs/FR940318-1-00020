FR940318-1-00020 FR940318-1-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94-AAL&hyph;02] Proposed Establishment of Class E Airspace; Saint George Island, AK AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Saint George Island, AK. A standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been recently developed at New St. George Airport, and controlled airspace starting 700 and 1200 feet above the surface, a 700 and 1200 foot transition area, are needed to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) departure and arrival operations at the airport. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the terms ``700 foot transition area and 1200 foot transition area'' and in its place use the term ``Class E airspace'' for 700 foot and 1200 foot transition areas. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR departures and IFR operators executing the recently established SIAP. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Manager, System Management Branch, AAL&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;AAL&hyph;02, 222 West 7th Ave. Box 14, Anchorage, AK 99513&hyph;7587. The official docket may be examined in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel for the Alaskan Region at the same address.

The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Saint George Island, AK. A SIAP based on the Pribilof (SRI) non-directional beacon (NDB) has been established. Controlled airspace from 700 feet above the surface within a 6.6-mile radius and from 1200 feet above the surface within a 10-mile radius, 700 foot and 1200 foot transition areas, are needed to contain IFR operations at the airport. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``transition area'' and in its place uses the term ``Class E airspace'' for 700 foot and 1200 foot transition areas. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the NDB/DME&hyph;A SIAP at the New St. George Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as 700/1200 foot transition areas are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1(58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for 14 CFR part 71 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1348(a), 1354(a), 1510; E.O. 10854, 24 FR 9565, 3 CFR, 1959&hyph;1963 Comp., p. 389; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 11.69. §71.1 [Amended] 2. The incorporation by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 of Federal Aviation Administration Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, is amended as follows: Paragraph 6005␣Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth. * * * * * AAL AK E5 Saint George Island, AK [New] New St. George Airport, AK (lat. 56 ○34 ’42 ’ ’N, long. 169 ○39 ’42 ’ ’ W) That airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface within a 6.6-mile radius of the New St. George Airport; and that airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface within a 10-mile radius of the New St. George Airport. * * * * * Issued in Anchorage, AK, on February 23, 1994.
