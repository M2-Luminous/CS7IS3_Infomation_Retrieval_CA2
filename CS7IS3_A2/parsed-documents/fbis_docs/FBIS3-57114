Clearly an important precedent has been set, and henceforth the majority of the most fundamental questions, including those linked with legislative work, will be resolved in the State Duma in a similar comprehensive manner. In this case the deciding factor determining the content of decisions will be the "weight" of the factions holding the preliminary consultations. Now the main internal drama in the general development of the Duma will consist in the factions' battle to preserve and increase their size, insofar as it is the number of votes which a faction has at its disposal on each specific question which will determine its capacity within a specific bloc to influence its ultimate solution. By definition, there can be no objection to political methods of struggle for votes on the part of factions: This is the normal mode of operation for a parliament. At the same time, apart from political means, apparatus means, which are concentrated in the hands of elected leaders (as we have already observed in the example of Khasbulatov's Supreme Soviet), may also be drawn into this battle. In principle it is possible to entice deputies both by creating and distributing material privileges, and by creating advantages in work, including information advantages. For instance, Vladimir Isakov, who heads the key Legislation Committee in the Duma, can organize its work in such a way as to afford any deputy equal access to draft laws, or he can create effective advantages for members of factions close to him while impeding access to information for "outsiders." In his election speech to deputies, and later in his "inauguration speech" to journalists, State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin stressed that he will try not to reveal his own political partialities in the post of speaker. He will deserve a medal if he manages to resist the temptations facing him and the pressure which will certainly be put on him, but the strength of such temptations goes without saying. Meanwhile, Vladimir Shumeyko, his colleague from the "House of Lords," has demonstrated quite frankly that he does not intend to ignore apparatus methods of struggling for influence over members of the Federation Council. This has already been demonstrated in the story of his election, in which backstage talks with regional leaders played a significant role. And one of Shumeyko's first steps in his new post, according to information from well informed sources, was an appeal to the president to review his earlier guideline on creating a unified Federal Assembly apparatus. At present this apparatus serves both chambers. Since according to the Constitution the main concern of the Federation Council is to be to approve (or reject) laws adopted by the State Duma, it can hardly be deemed useful or efficient to establish for the two chambers two completely autonomous bureaucratic apparatuses including duplicate expert departments, information services, libraries and codification departments, personnel departments, and, of course, economic administrations in charge of official apartments and dachas, cars, and luncheon vouchers. On the other hand, the whole of Soviet history is in fact a history of the transformation of control over the apparatus into supreme state power and of the absorption by the apparatus branch of power of all the other traditional "branches," and in Soviet history purely distributive, bureaucratic functions triumphantly dominate legislative, executive, and judicial functions. Of course, it is difficult for Vladimir Shumeyko and other leaders who passed through the Soviet apparatus school to renounce this means of holding sway and these stereotypes. In the light of such demands already stated by the Federation Council, the State Duma simply has no option but to put forward similar demands and to set about the de facto division of the unified Federal Assembly apparatus which has only just been hastily set up, beginning with the unique body of experts and ending with the auto mechanics. The first round of rivalry between the chambers for possession of the apparatus will probably lead to rivalry between the parallel apparatuses that are set up, and a war between the apparatuses may serve as one reason for a future war between the chambers. Since the proposal on division is directed to the president, let's look at the situation as if through his eyes, or rather, the eyes this time of the presidential apparatus. On the one hand, "divide and rule" is an old apparatus principle proven throughout the centuries, and there is a not unfounded assumption that the initiative for division emanates not so much from Shumeyko as from the presidential administration. On the other hand, the presidential administration, which still retains the ability to monitor compliance with proprieties in a unified Federal Assembly apparatus to some extent, will probably lose this ability in the event of division. This option for the organizational structure does, of course, have its advantages, which are that deputies will be more independent of the whims of the presidential administration. But as payment for this independence, they will immediately become dependent on their chambers' divided apparatuses, and this is clearly capable of inflicting significantly greater damage on the normal legislative process. At the same time, this will mean that Russians' longstanding dream of a civilized parliamentary speaker who merely chairs sittings neutrally and properly and is relieved of any kind of tiresome organizational or economic hassle can be written off. However great the desire of Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin in particular to distance himself from intrigues and politicking, he will inevitably be drawn into this by the apparatus that clings to him -- it is beyond the strength of any human being to resist this on one front while simultaneously resisting political pressure from his own faction on a second front. It is unlikely that the deputies will want to heed the advice of journalists, but it seems to me that the most sensible thing for both chambers would be to decline to have their own individual apparatus and to leave the solution of the bulk of organizational, information, economic, and purely everyday problems to representatives of the presidential administration monitored by them. There are also significant inconveniences and obvious risks in this, but at the same time it is, in my view, the only way to guard against the apparatus-distributive virus.
