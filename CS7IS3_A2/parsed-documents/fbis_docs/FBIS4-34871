Tension mounts as a list of the names and addresses of about 300 people, including minors in some big families, who are being targeted circulates throughout the capital. "My granddaughter is on that list," a well-known attorney says indignantly. "It is madness," says one banker. "I have nothing to do with those friends right now," he adds. One citizen believes that Clinton has gone too far, while an attorney denounces the arbitrary nature of the executive order the U.S. head of state signed late on 21 June. "It is the strong hand in its greatest splendor." This U.S. measure reminds him of the practice under the Duvalier regime of a whole family being punished for the actions of one. It is funny to hear the international community talking about rights considering that relations with the international community have been based on force since 30 September 1991, he said. Boomerang Effect It is a cold shower: Many of those who are penalized do not show any sign of turning on the military authorities, as the United States expected. "I will turn on them if they were wrong at 10 percent," says this banker, who thinks that the protagonists on both sides should resign. [sentence as published] He deplores the embargo and does not seem to agree that those who staged the coup d'etat are responsible for it. "They are wasting their time because we have not forgotten Aristide's `stones in water' and `give them what they deserve' statements." A young professional, furious at being penalized, shouted: "If it's a matter of money or my life, I prefer my life; if it's a matter of money or Cedras, I prefer money." He is not ready for upheaval, however. He rages, jumping on the first foreigner he meets. More coldly, his father points out that Clinton's measures "increase the hate for Americans." Reconciliation is impossible with such measures, measures that only serve to set Haitians against one another to the point of civil war. American Banks Can Just Pack Up To make things worse, the two U.S. banks in Haiti -- Citibank and Bank of Boston -- closed their doors today, some observers feel to avoid pressure from their customers. U.S. Marines have reportedly helped secure Citibank. It has already been rumored that the Bank of Boston will reopen its doors on 24 June. It is said that the Bank of Boston has a strong Haitian clientele now at bay. More than one person wonders: Will the checks be cashed? People are preparing to take legal action to force Citibank and the Bank of Boston, subject to Haitian law, to refund their assets. This possibility was raised in the 14 November 1980 decree, modified by the 14 July 1984 decree, on commercial banks. Article 71 authorizes the Bank of Haiti to relinquish them, especially when they suspend payments. Relinquishment means the state can assume the bank administrators' authority. Article 26 allows the finance minister, on the Bank of Haiti's request, to revoke the authorization under which these banks operate. One businessman is pleased that he withdrew his assets from the Bank of Boston two years ago. "Both banks can just pack up and leave. Not one lucid Haitian will deposit his money there anymore." U.S. financial institutions also take a risk. "The U.S. banks are certainly going to lose their customers," an attorney asserts, convinced that the "great fortunes" were safeguarded a long time ago. One analyst points out: "The United States has lost its chance to be considered a land of investment."
