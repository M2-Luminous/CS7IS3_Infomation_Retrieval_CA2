Surely, the NP regards Natal, with about 25 percent of national votes, as crucial for the April 27 elections. Therefore its Natal list of candidates is the best the NP can offer. If the best that can be fielded by the NP includes people like George Bartlett, Con Botha and Valentin Volker, then the NP is the party of yesterday. The people of Natal in particular and those of the whole country in general cannot forget the mess that was caused by Bartlett in the Department of Transport and the recent petrol increases. The people of Natal will not forgive Con Botha for refurbishing a beach front apartment for himself at Addington hospital at an exorbitant price using taxpayers' money when thousands of patients were without hospital beds and sufficient medicines at the hospitals. The corruption of some of the people appearing in the NP list is the mirror of the corruption of the NP as a whole. The list is conservative and Afrikaner male dominated. That is the true character of the NP which is conservative and male chauvinist. The NP excuse that the reason that the few blacks appearing on its list is because of intimidation in the black areas is a big lie. The NP does not trust blacks and conversely the oppressed masses cannot trust the NP -- the party of apartheid. What intimidates blacks from the NP is its apartheid policies which caused and still cause havoc among black communities. Anyway, it was the Group Areas Act of the NP that forcibly separated residential areas along racial and ethnic lines. Those few token NP black candidates appearing in the list are not even known in their communities. Obviously, a party of apartheid cannot hope to attract oppressed personalities of any substance. The NP can only rely on those elements who benefitted from apartheid. The ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme is aimed at reconstructing the economy which was destroyed by some of the very people appearing on the NP list. The people of Natal dare not vote these forces of destruction.
