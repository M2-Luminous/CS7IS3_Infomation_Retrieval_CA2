The discussion has been planned for 2 July. In this situation, a vote will most probably be held during the nearest Sejm session in order to reschedule this date. [Unidentified correspondent] To justify its motion, the SLD quotes the civil rights ombudsman who has written to the Sejm Speaker saying that the ratification of the concordat before the adoption of the new constitution will lead to discrepancies in the regulations defining the relations between the state and the church. In this situation, according to the SLD, the new constitution should be adopted first, and the concordat should be dealt with afterward. [SLD Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski] "This is a better solution. It will avert the reservations that the concordat is arousing today, and it will give priority to the basic law, which the constitution is. At the same time, all of this may happen according to realistic deadlines. In not more than a year, we can have both the constitution and, later, a serious debate on the concordat. We do not want either a religious or an ideological war. We simply want to dissuade doubts that the people in Poland have, and we need time to do this. I think this procedure will be better." [Correspondent] The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] believes that the issue of the ratification should be dealt with as soon as possible, and it intends to vote against the proposal put forward by its partner in the coalition. [Janusz Dobrosz, chairman of the PSL parliamentary floor group] "We are in favor of making a decision on the issue of the concordat by the Sejm. This is a democratic choice: Either we are for the ratification of the concordat, or we are against it. However, delaying the matter--and this is how the motion put forward by the SLD can be understood--will not benefit anything but will arouse emotions and result in other important issues being treated as secondary." [Correspondent] The SLD's motion will most probably be supported by the Union of Labor. One can expect that, apart from the PSL, also the Confederation for an Independent Poland and the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms, as well as an overwhelming majority of deputies from the Freedom Union, will vote against the postponement of the debate on the concordat. In the Sejm, the number of opponents of the concordat is almost equal to the number of its supporters. Thus, it is difficult to predict the outcome of the vote on the postponement of the debate.
