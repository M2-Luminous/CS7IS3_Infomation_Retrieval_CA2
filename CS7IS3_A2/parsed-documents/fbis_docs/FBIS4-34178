Should this happen, however, it would be a grave mistake, affecting a country trying to consolidate its democracy, Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal said upon arriving in Cartagena de Indias to participate in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Although the aid has been objected to by Republican congressmen due to unresolved claims for property indemnification filed by U.S. citizens, Minister Leal said the Helms-Gonzalez Amendment has been misinterpreted. He added that when a country has an adequate indemnification system, as in the case of Nicaragua, there should be no major problems.
