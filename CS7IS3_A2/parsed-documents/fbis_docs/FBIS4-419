Alhaji Koromah, whose ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction in Liberia has been torn by splits between him and another faction based in Freetown, has now taken on the RUF as well as Nii Nartey Allison reports in this telex from Monrovia. It was confirmed here today that ULIMO is engaged in fighting inside Sierra Leone against Foday Sankoh's rebels. ULIMO leader Alhaji Koromah said today that his forces, under the command of Loseni Yamah, have set up a command post at the Sierra Leone border and are advancing toward Kekema, 10 miles inside Sierra Leone. This, said Koromah, was to open a security corridor so that Liberian refugees in Kenema could return home. Koromah said: It is a full- scale operation, and we have informed the government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations of our battle in Sierra Leone. But the situation remains confused, because later today, the Lofa Defense Force, a new faction fighting ULIMO for control of Liberia's northern Lofa County, said here that their forces have successfully dislodged Koromah's units and have secured control of the territory stretching from the Saint Paul River Bridge bordering Lofa and Bong counties to the Foya District on the Sierra Leone-Guinea access. They boasted in a statement of being in control of the administrative seats of Voinjama and the towns of Golu, Salaye, Zosa, and Konia.
