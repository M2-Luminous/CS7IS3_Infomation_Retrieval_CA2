FR940711-1-00062 FR940711-1-00017 Where the ranges of the two subspecies come into contact there are numerous individuals having characteristics intermediate between the two subspecies. These individuals are referred to as intergrades. There are also localized populations which are largely composed of intergrades known as intergrade populations. Some of the concerns that were expressed during the comment period dealt with two inter-related issues: (1) the merits of including intergrade populations and/or intergrade individuals in the listing and thus giving them protection as threatened, and (2) the insufficiency of currently available information on the locations of boundaries between intergrade populations and ``pure'' populations of N. e. neglecta. These concerns are particularly acute in southern Illinois where the Department of Conservation believes that additional surveys are critical to an adequate understanding of the status of N. e. neglecta and its relationship to N. e. flavigaster. Results from these surveys are expected to be placed on review at the Service Office listed in the ADDRESSES section, when they become available. The Endangered Species Act allows an extension of the normal 1-year deadline for taking final actions on a proposal to list a species for up to 6 months when there is a ``substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the determination.'' The Service believes that there is substantial disagreement regarding the status of N. e. neglecta. In order to collect additional data on the extent and locations of intergrade populations, to resolve questions regarding the most appropriate taxonomic entity to protect under the Act, and to obtain current data on the status of N. e. neglecta in Illinois, the Service is extending the deadline for the listing determination until February 18, 1995. The comment period on the proposed rule originally closed October 18, 1993. It was reopened March 22 and closed April 22, 1994. The Service is reopening the comment period until November 1, 1994. Written comments should be submitted to the Service office in the Addresses section. Author The primary author of this notice is Ronald L.
