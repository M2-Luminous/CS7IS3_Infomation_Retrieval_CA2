That interval also coincides with a period of relative peace on Armenia's borders, the recapture of Maghavuz and Martakert in Artsakh and the success in Kelbajar. Evidently the work that [Manukian] started has continued in the same direction: As encouraging news reported by the NOYAN TAPAN news agency on 17 December suggests, problems associated with antagonisms that could be caused by the formation of the Armenian army have been set aside. A meeting was held at the conclusion of the fall conscription campaign to tally up its results. Vazgen Sargsian, a former minister of defense and currently the minister of state responsible for defense affairs, says that the conscription has concluded successfully everywhere except in the two large cities of the earthquake zone, Gumri [formerly Leninakan] and Vanadzor [formerly Kirovakan]. So far 511 conscripts are missing in Gumri and 244 in Vanadzor. The deadline for reporting to duty has been extended by 7 to 10 days in those cities. Problems associated with conscription were one of the principal reasons delaying the formation of the army for a long time. A not so insignificant proportion of the youth in cities tried every means to dodge the draft. Their parents also did everything necessary to make their children's task easier. Both the youth and their parents had forgotten the conditions of serving in distant locations in the Soviet army in the past. That led to demonstrations and hunger strikes on Yerevan's squares, with the demand that Armenian soldiers serve their terms in Armenia. Ironically, when those seemingly unrealizable dreams came true so suddenly, those subject to the draft sought ways of dodging it rather than rejoice. The report cited above does not offer details of the methods employed in the gratifying correction of this problem, but the important point is that a shameful and extremely dangerous situation has ended. That is affirmed most strongly by the following statement: "Incidents of administrative action to ensure the normal progress of the conscription campaign are becoming steadily rarer." Of course, all this does not mean that the process of building the army no longer faces any difficulties or that there are no deficiencies to correct. For example, sometimes it is difficult to determine the permanent residences of young men who have migrated from Azerbaijan. It is also said that barracks buildings are insufficient. V. Sargsyan says that a new census must be taken in Armenia. The last one, taken in January 1989, immediately after the [December 1988] earthquake, cannot be considered reliable because it could not provide a true picture of the population. The most rejoicing element of the said report is that the meeting underscored the following despite the complex problems facing the country: "The army is fully stocked with food and uniforms." The NOYAN TAPAN report provides other details also. Armenia's military academy will begin operating next year and will train officers. At present Armenian officers are trained in Russia. Some of the current conscripts serve in the ranks of Russian border forces on Armenia's borders with Turkey and Iran, as well as the Russian 127th division, which is based near Gumri. Despite the many positive signs, V. Sargsian is far from being fully satisfied. He says: "Although many observers consider the Armenian army the most combat-ready in the region, the Armenian leadership itself is viewing the national army critically, finding that much more must be done to consolidate the army's combat readiness and that the weakness of the armed forces of Azerbaijan and Georgia are temporary." It can be gathered from the report that there is something more than the statement that "the army is fully stocked with food and uniforms." The reality of a successful conscription is proof that the problem of authority has been resolved. Those two points are sufficient to confirm that the army of independent Armenia has successfully overcome the basic hurdles of the initial period.
