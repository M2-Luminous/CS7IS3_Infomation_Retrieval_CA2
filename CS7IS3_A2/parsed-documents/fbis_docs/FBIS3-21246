Geographically, it is positioned in the center of Tohoku Region facing the Pacific. It has been 10 years since Onagawa nuclear plant's Reactor No. 1 (520,000kW) began its operations. Reactor No. 2 (825,000kW) currently under construction is in its final stage, with its operations expected to begin July 1995. It will be followed by Reactor No. 3 (825,000kW) whose construction is scheduled to commence in November 1996. Thus the expansion of the plant facility will be carried out rapidly in succession. By the year 2002, when Reactor No.3 begins its operations, the total output of the plant will reach 2.174 million kW. The plant by then will be poised to play a central role in satisfying energy demand of the 21st century for Tohoku Electric Power. Tohoku Electric Power's first ``nuclear light,'' Onagawa Nuclear Reactor No. 1 (Boiling-Light-Water-type Reactor=BWR) at present is supplying approximately 30% of electricity used in Miyagi Prefecture. Reactor No.2, whose construction began in August 1988, also is a BWR. It is almost 85% completed. A building, which houses the main unit of the No.2 reactor, has 3 floors both above the ground and in the basement situated in the center of the building. It also has a nuclear reactor wing measuring approximately 66 meters by 55 meters in area; surrounding the wing is a two-story reinforced concrete annex building with a 3-story basement. The No.2 reactor power plant consists of three buildings, with the nuclear reactor building in the center, flanked by turbine and control buildings. In addition to the main nuclear reactor unit consisting of fuel and internal reactor structural elements and a nuclear reactor pressure vessel, the main system has a nuclear reactor cooling system centering around a recirculation-main steam system and a reactor core cooling system for emergency use. A turbine power generating facility is equipped with condensation and water-feeding systems, including a water circulation system designed to circulate main condenser's cooling water. Reactor No.2 has new features which are not offered in Reactor No. 1. For instance, in comparison with a flask-type containment vessel, the ``[marku] type,'' used in Reactor No. 1, the ``improved [marku] type'' allows sufficient space for carrying out work. This is designed to improve operational efficiency in conducting routine inspections inside the containment vessel. The condensate filter has been changed from the pressure-precoat type to the hollow-fiber-membrane type. When finished with the rotation of a turbine, steam will be cooled inside the main condenser and become condensate. The condensate filter, designed to remove the rust and other iron content cleanly and to prevent nuclear reactor cooling water from becoming radioactive. The pressure precoating method uses resin as an auxiliary filtering agent. The hollow fiber membrane method employed in Reactor No.2, on the other hand, does not use resin. This means that the hollow fiber membrane can be burned, thus drastically reducing the amount of radioactive wastes generated. Moreover, in order to improve thermal efficiency of the turbine, a ``free moisture separation heating method'' has been employed in Reactor No. 2. This method is designed to eliminate steam moisture with a moisture separator, while the moisture to be sent to a low-pressure turbine using a part of high-temperature steam, is being heated. This is just one example of the new technologies incorporated into Reactor No. 2. In July 1995, when Reactor No. 2 begins commercial operations, approximately 75% of electric power used in Miyagi Prefecture will have been supplied by Reactors Nos. 1 and 2. As for the additional installation of Reactor No. 3 (BWR), Tohoku Electric Power added this item to its 1993 facility plans and submitted an ``environmental impact survey document'' to MITI on 18 August. Having gone through informational meetings and a walk-through of the site, the company plans to hold the first official hearing on the first phase of the construction and to incorporate the basic power development plans of the second phase before the end of 1993. The company hopes to have the proposal put on the agenda of Electric Power Development Coordination Council, the prime minister's advisory organ, by the spring of 1994. In terms of the composition of the electric power source (volume of power generation), Tohoku Electric Power's 1992 record shows that the ratio of nuclear power was no more than 20%. In 1997, when No.2 reactor will be in full operation, the ratio will be increased to 24%, and by the year 2002, when No. 3 reactor will be used in commercial operations, the ratio will rise to 26%. This means that nuclear power can be regarded as the base electric source. By enlarging the role played by the nuclear power, the company will be ``opening up electric sources.'' Spend Time on Study Meeting As indicated by what thus far transpired at Onagawa nuclear construction site, Tohoku Electric Power spent 12 years from the time when the town had decided to invite the company to the region, to the beginning of the construction. However, once the construction had begun, it took both Onagawa and Ojika Town Assemblies only 2 years and 9 months to vote in favor of accelerating further buildup of nuclear power facilities. In the case of Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant, there was a clear difference in the willingness of the local community to accept the project during the first half(when construction of Reactor No. 1 was pursued) and the second half(when development of Reactors Nos. 2 and 3 are being pushed). Onagawa-machi even today is a ``fishing village,'' which, in terms of quantities of fish unloaded here, ranks fifth in Japan. Before the construction of Reactor No. 1 was undertaken, fishermen put up strong resistance to the nuclear power project. ``This was what delayed starting of plant construction by more than 10 years.'' (Zenjiro Suda, town manager of Onagawa-machi). However, a great deal of time spent to keep dialogue going between the company and fishermen, as well as study sessions, served to dispel residents' fear of nuclear power, enabling them to grasp the fact that nuclear energy can serve as a foundation for the development of fisheries and other regional industry. Once they understood this, the nuclear power project progressed rapidly. There is no question about the benefit brought to Onagawa by the nuclear power plant--it is considerable. The amount of subsidy received by the town under the provision of the three power-development-related laws, beginning with Reactor No. 1 and ending with trial calculations made in connection with Reactor No. 3 is approximately 짜20.2 billion. The municipal property tax (city, town, and village taxes; a trial balance at Onagawa-machi) is approximately 88 billion, and the nuclear fuel tax for Reactor No. 1 recorded up to now is approximately 짜3.8 billion. Moreover, according to the record of purchase orders sent to local and surrounding areas in connection with Reactor No. 1 is approximately 짜43.2 billion and for Reactor No. 2, it reaches approximately 짜32.1 billion. In order to give the benefit generated by the construction site back to the local community in an equitable manner, Onagawa-machi organized and operates ``Onagawa Commerce and Industrial Enterprise Cooperative (230 members).'' In ordering goods, including daily necessities, the company opted to use the cooperative as a window. This method is but one example through which effective cooperation is achieved between the region and the company in pursuing nuclear power development. Two Projects Planned Following Onagawa and Higashidori Projects As has been described, Onagawa nuclear power development is accelerating its pace of expansion. However, in addition to Onagawa and Higashidori, Tohoku Electric Power has plans for two more nuclear power development sites still pending. Of these, the site located at Namie-Kodaka (Fukushima Prefecture) was voted in by the town assembly. This took place 26 years ago; since then, however, no significant progress has been made. As for the other development at Maki (Niigata Prefecture). although the problem of compensation to the area's fishing industry has been resolved completely and the proposal was approved by the Electric Power Development Coordination Council in November 1982, there still remains the problem of private land to be resolved. However, recently, Maki Town Assembly adopted a ``statement of an opinion on having development project started as soon as possible,'' indicating that the town is ready to make a new move. In order to begin operations (825,000kW) by the year 2002, the company is developing a policy formulated to create close contact with the region. This project will become an electric power supply point following the Onagawa nuclear power plant. Interview with Mr. Zensaburo Suda, Mayor of Onagawa-machi NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: It was September of 1967 when both Onagawa and Ojika Town Assemblies made resolutions to bring Tohoku Electric Power into your region to build nuclear power plants, wasn't it? Suda: Although Southern Sanriku was Japan's foremost fishing ground, since the mid-60s, the region's fishing industry has been declining. It was back then that my predecessor began to use the word, a setting sun, to describe the state of our fishing industry. Certainly, there were a number of things which appeared to indicate that indeed we were heading in that direction. We began to hear about the prohibition of whaling; also Nippon Suisan had pulled out its entire operation from this region. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Then in December of 1979 that full-scale construction of Reactor No.1 began. Suda: Beginning in 1975, the 200-mile limit was imposed on fishermen, which pushed the fishing industry to the brink of collapse. This factor was directly responsible for our decision to pursue the plan for nuclear power development. For local residents, construction at Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant site ultimately meant the revitalization of the region. How Japan is going to secure energy is an extremely important question. Who are going to be responsible for securing it and how will this be accomplished? We believe that Tohoku as a region is obligated to do its part. It must take on this responsibility. Would it be possible for us to provide a site for power development, and, at the same time, link this to our regional development plans? All of us gave this matter a serious consideration. However, initially, some residents were reluctant. Since our town is a center of the fishing zone, fishermen put up a strong resistance. The voices of pros and cons whirled around us, each side fighting hard for its cause. It was a good thing we spent a great deal of time talking the matter over, until finally every one had a clear understanding of what the nuclear power development had to offer to the community. We used the means of persuasion and explanation. Because of what both sides learned in the process, we have chosen the course of action which is working well for the community today. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Recently, a theme of ``establishing symbiotic relationship with the region'' is emphasized by those constructing plants. Suda: Looking back, we feel that from the very beginning, our approach was symbiotic. Our role as an energy supply base was compatible with local industry and fisheries. This indeed must be an equal symbiotic relationship. No problem exists between the company and our community. The company and their affiliates are making every effort to be a part of the region by participating town's social work and social circles and they are succeeding. When necessary, I do not hesitate to speak up, and the other side does the same. This is what symbiosis is all about. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What about Three Laws concerning the development of power source? Suda: I feel that it would be better if some restrictions are imposed on them. The present national Three-Law system is too narrow. Although I have no intention of making a request outside the legal framework, since industrial structure and geographical conditions differ from region to region, the Three Laws must be able to accommodate these differences. Otherwise, it will be meaningless. It is nice that the Three Laws pay for costs of construction, but the constructed building must be maintained, and it costs money to do this. We will be very grateful if Three Laws takes into consideration operational and maintenance expenditures as well. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: It will be the 21st century (2002) when Reactor No. 3 becomes operative. What kind of buildup plans does do you have for the town? Suda: Our town has only sea and mountains. Although the local fishing industry has recovered from slump through the conversion to ``producing industry,'' it is dangerous to solely rely on fisheries. On the other hand, even if we want to invite businesses to this region, we don't have any land to build on. So we are considering the type of work in the information-oriented field. Using the energy supply base as a foundation, we want to combine our coastal fishing industry with tourism. Also under consideration is the use of the town as an information dispatch base. The communication industry will appeal to young people, and so we can make them settle down in this town. With respect to the information industry, 11 companies, consisting of those in the surrounding cities and towns and power-source-related companies, joined forces and established a third-sector information service firm, ``Otech.'' We want to show the world that in spite of the disadvantageous conditions in which the town finds itself, we can still be innovative, creating something new and worthwhile. NIKKAN SANGYO KOGYO: Looks like this will accelerate your efforts to create ``a new town,'' doesn't it? Suda: Our decision to offer our town for development of nuclear power has substantially increased the town's source of revenues. Other improvements are less tangible but they are there. The most significant improvement is the way in which residents now approach problems. Young people have begun to devote their efforts to build an attractive town. This indeed is the best thing that has happened to the town since the nuclear power development project began. Viewed from a total perspective, this is what symbiotic relationship between the town and the outside business firm has produced.
