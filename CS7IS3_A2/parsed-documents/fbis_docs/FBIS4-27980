"We are currently considering the convening of Japan-South Korea foreign ministerial talks," the top government spokesman said at a news conference. But Kumagai hastened to add that the schedule has yet to be fixed and the planned session does not necessarily aim to discuss the two countries' response to North Korea's alleged push for nuclear arms. It will be meaningful to exchange views at a high-level, he noted. Kumagai said he will discuss the planned talks with South Korea when he meets with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Kakizawa later Monday. Hata, Kakizawa and Kumagai meet on Monday night to listen to a report from Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who represented Japan at trilateral talks with the United States and South Korea last week. At that time, the three countries adopted a united front and urged the U.N. Security Council to take prompt action against North Korea, including the consideration of economic sanctions.
