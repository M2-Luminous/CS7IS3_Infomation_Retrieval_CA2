Tests on 42 samples, kept from a 5,000-ton shipment from China in early January, were free from mold and had a water content of only 13.1 percent, nearly 3 percentage points lower than what the contract specified, the INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS NEWSPAPER said. The samples were kept at the Tanggu commercial inspection bureau at the eastern Chinese port city of Tianjin and were tested on February 17, the paper quoted a person connected with the case as saying. The unnamed person also said Japanese officials visited and inspected the rice plant responsible for the shipment as well as storage facilities in Tianjin and concluded that "the cause of the mishap is not on the Chinese side." The paper accused the Japanese press of seriously harming the credibility of Chinese rice exporters. Other similar incidents have been reported concerning U.S., Thai and Australian rice, the paper said. "Concerning the difficulties and frustration of opening the Japanese rice market, the appearance of this type of incident is unfortunately not by chance," the paper said.
