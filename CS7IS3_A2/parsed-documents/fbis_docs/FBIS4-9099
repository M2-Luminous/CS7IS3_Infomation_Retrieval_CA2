The posts of almost half of the NCO's [noncommissioned officers] establishment and one in 10 officers are not filled. The National Defense Ministry [MON] has, for the first time, declassified the information on employment in the Armed Forces. [Correspondent T. Bialoszewski] There are almost 90,000 professional servicemen in the Polish Army. Half of these are officers. There are 26,000 warrant officers. The professional NCO's are the fewest in number; there are only 19,000 of them. [Major General Roman Harmoza, Defense Ministry head of personnel, identified by caption] "The Army is short of 46 percent of its NCO's. It is they who form the backbone of the Army because they work directly with the soldiers." [Bialoszewski] Signals services, commonly described as the neural network of the Army, are experiencing the worst personnel problems. The MON staffing command states that the problem can be resolved by contract service. Suitably qualified civilians are taken on by these services. [Harmoza] "We have 1,000 contract servicemen of different ranks. This year we have taken 270 servicemen into the services, and the limit has been exhausted." [Bialoszewski] There are almost 10 times as many people willing to do contract service as are taken on. The Army does not have enough money to employ all of the necessary people. The Army wants to rejuvenate itself. The principles of retirement of officers will be rigorously observed. The principles of promotion are also changing. [Harmoza] "We will only be able to promote people if there is a vacancy for the promoted person. If we want to promote one major, one major will have to go." [Bialoszewski] Professional soldiers constitute only 30 percent of the Armed Forces; the ministry has plans for half of the Armed Forces in the year 2000 to consist of professional soldiers.
