"The reports of our consent are the Georgian Interior Ministry's exercise in misinformation. I have no intention to go to Georgia because I have nothing to do with terrorists and murderers. I demand that the body be moved to Chechnya for burial," Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said. In her words, she was visited by Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, who told her that as a mediator he would insist on doing as the deceased's family desired.
