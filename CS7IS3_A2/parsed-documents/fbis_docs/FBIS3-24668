Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-17FEB94-PALESTINIANS Cairo Accord Generates Unenthusiastic Palestinian Response SUMMARY The 9 February agreement between Israel and the PLO on measures to implement the Gaza-Jericho plan has been received warily by many mainstream Palestinians, both within the PLO and inside the occupied territories. Apart from those PLO officials directly involved in the negotiations, monitored mainstream comment since the announcement of the agreement has ranged from open criticism to cautious neutrality. PLO leaders have launched an effort to rally mainstream support for the accord, but many Palestinians will withhold judgment until they see its practical consequences. END SUMMARY Within some PLO leadership circles, announcement of the agreement evidently rekindled both anger over PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's tight control over the negotiating process and concerns that he is making too many concessions to Israel because he has staked his political future on the success of the Oslo agreement. According to press reports, 'Arafat was unable on 13 February to muster a quorum for a meeting of the PLO Executive Committee, several of whose members have reportedly already been boycotting committee meetings since the signing in September 1993 of the Declaration of Principles negotiated with Israel in Oslo (London Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, 13 February). Three committee members (out of a nominal membership of 18) indicated explicitly their dissatisfaction in recent statements appearing in the Jordanian press: --In a statement reported by the daily Al-Ra'y on 14 February, Sulayman al-Najjab confirmed that he refused to attend the Executive Committee meeting called for 13 February "to protest the manner in which the Executive Committee was treated." According to Al-Ra'y, al-Najjab charged that committee decisions concerning negotiations "were not respected" and specifically that the Cairo agreement violated committee decisions. Al-Najjab went on to call on the Executive Committee to reject the agreement and to charge that the PLO leadership is conducting negotiations "without any terms of reference or any clear negotiating plan that is committed to the Palestinian understanding of the Oslo agreement." --'Abdallah Hurani also called for rejection of the Cairo agreement according to a report appearing in Al-Ra'y on the 15th. Apparently referring to the 13 February Executive Committee meeting, Hurani branded as "illegal" any committee meeting held without a quorum. The report said that Hurani called on Palestinians in the territories to engage in "assertive and vigorous popular action" to "call a halt to these concessions" [to Israel] and also called on the PLO leadership to "rethink" its position on the Oslo agreement. --Samir Ghawshah, though somewhat equivocal, complained about both the Cairo agreement and the nature of PLO deliberations in an interview. The Cairo accord, he said, is "not ideal," an "incomplete step," and "not a positive start for the resumption of negotiations on various issues." Elsewhere in the interview, he called the agreement a "possible step" but "not a step that responds to the minimum level of our demands." Perhaps referring to Egyptian efforts to bring about the agreement, Ghawshah said that the Palestinian delegation in Cairo was subjected to "tremendous extortions," even though it "resisted some of them." Nonetheless, he added, the delegation "could not impose its concept of the agreement in a manner that meets the minimum [Palestinian] demands." Referring to an Executive Committee meeting held prior to the Cairo accord, Ghawshah described the meeting as "incomplete"--apparently an allusion to boycotting members--and said that "many arguments took place." (Amman Al- Dustur, 16 February). Editorial Coolness The leading East Jerusalem Palestinian daily Al-Quds was strikingly reserved in its assessment of the Cairo agreement. Perhaps hinting at resentment of alleged Egyptian pressure, an editorial on 11 February said that the accord "was drafted with considerable help from our Egyptian brothers" and that its implementation "will require tireless and continuous efforts." Both conflicting Israeli and Palestinian interpretations of the Oslo agreement and the continued deterioration of conditions in the territories, Al-Quds argued, "have cast a dark shadow over any positive expectations during the past weeks." Although it acknowledged that the Cairo agreement "has somewhat restored momentum to the negotiating process," the paper warned that "this momentum has not yet been translated into reality." Citing the "theoretical nature" of the agreement, it said that "any optimism regarding the future would be premature" and that experience "has taught the Palestinian people realism." In a remarkably passive conclusion, Al-()uds said that "it is better for one to wait, be patient, and expect surprises." PLO Seeks To Rally Support In apparent recbgnition of mainstream Palestinian skepticism, PLO leaders directly involved in the negotiations have sought in recent days to justify their actions. Most notably, Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh offered a detailed defense of the Cairo agreement and appealed for popular Palestinian support. In an interview with Jordan Television--probably visible in much of the West Bank--'Abd-Rabbuh said that the agreement "has been an extremely important step" that "resolved a number of major issues." He promised that [Israeli] "withdrawal will take place and the dawn of Palestinian independence will soon arrive." PLO leaders, he said, "are aware that there is a feeling of frustration" among many Palestinians, and he acknowledged that "so many issues [remain] that require extensive negotiations." Nonetheless, he argued, "there is no such thing as a perfect solution" and critics of the accord do not understand "how much bargaining it took" to achieve it. "The most dangerous thing in this process, ' he warned, "is to lose patience," adding elsewhere in the interview that "quick solutions will not be sufficient and will be dangerous to our future." Palestinians, he argued, will get "better guarantees for our future" by reaching "solutions achieved through determination, patience, and perseverance" (12 February). Implications In the near term, 'Arafat has probably gained both time and maneuvering room through the Cairo agreement. He was able to ram the Oslo agreement through a disgruntled Executive Committee last September, and there is thus far little indication that the most recent grumbling of committee members cut out of the decisionmaking process will compel him to modify the PLO negotiating position. Nonetheless, long term implementation of any agreement with Israel, including the establishment of an effective Palestinian autonomy regime in the territories, will likely require more active mainstream support than is evident in the cool reception of the Cairo agreement. While concrete signs that implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord is under way would doubtless boost support for the PLO and the peace process, 'Arafat and his inner circle, who are effectively controlling Palestinian policy toward the peace process, have been less successful to date in bolstering confidence in their leadership among many mainstream Palestinians.
