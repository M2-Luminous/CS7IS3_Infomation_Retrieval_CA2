The two men took this opportunity to review the relations between Congo and France, said the French diplomat after his audience with the president. [Begin recording] [Michel] President Lissouba and I met to review the relations between Congo and France. Our discussions focused on cooperation in fields that could strengthen relations between the two countries. We also discussed development projects that could be implemented quickly to solve some social problems and benefit the most destitute of the Congolese people. We have already held an initial meeting with Congolese partners and foreign financial backers to associate them with the implementation of the first identified projects that will be launched in the next two weeks. That is the general outline of our discussions. [Unidentified correspondent] You said you reviewed bilateral relations between France and Congo. On this issue, Congolese are interested to know the nature of the relations between Congo and France. Are these relations excellent, or is something wrong with regard to what is happening in our country these days? [Michel] Our relations are excellent. From our point of view, there are no problems with Congo except those relating to the insecurity prevailing in the Congolese capital, and that is a subject of concern for the French nationals residing here. In addition, we should not forget the problem relating to the devaluation of the CFA franc and the ensuing economic problems. All these factors should be studied with utmost care and serenity, and we believe there are solutions to all these problems and that security should be ensured. We will contribute to its maintenance, as we have in the past through cooperation. As for the devaluation of the CFA franc, we are naturally very much alert to how the situation will evolve, to the cost of living, and to the price of essential goods. With the assent of the Congolese authorities, we will see if there is a need to facilitate things and help out in maintaining things in reasonable proportion for the Congolese people. [Correspondent] You are talking about insecurity. France should consider the fact that it is responsible for what is happening in Brazzaville, and the French Government has announced that the centennial of the Brazzaville conference will be finally celebrated in France. Why is this? [Michel] Listen, the centennial of the Brazzaville Conference is an important event that the Congolese authorities intend to celebrate in favorable and satisfactory security conditions. All Congolese, regardless of their political ideas, should associate themselves with this important moment in the bistory of Congo, Franco-Congolese history, and African history. Today, of course, we agree that serenity and security do not exist, and the Congolese authorities have wisely suggested that it should be postponed to a later date. France--which is celebrating a centennial, the liberation of France, the landing, and the Brazzaville Conference--will also commemorate all these important events on 30 January. This will not prevent the Congolese authorities from celebrating this anniversary. We will celebrate with them, and all the works we began on the occasion will continue and will be completed in time. [Correspondent] Speaking of insecurity, I wanted to say that France (?has its share) of responsibility in this. [Michel] France does not feel responsible for this situation. What is happening today in Congo is the responsibility of the Congolese people. I think they have some difficulties as far as internal politics is concerned, and these problems should be resolved through democratic practices and the Constitution. The country has institutions that are functional. We are saying today that if the Congolese institutions are functional, they should continue to be so that all the Congolese people should be able to express themselves through them. [end recording]
