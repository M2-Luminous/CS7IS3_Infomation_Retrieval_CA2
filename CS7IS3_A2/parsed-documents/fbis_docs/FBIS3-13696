In statements issued here, the al-Jihad (holy war) group said it would exact revenge for the death sentences passed on nine members of its military wing Tala'i' al-Fath [Vanguards of Conquest] Thursday by a military court in Cairo for a failed assassination bid on Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi last November in which a schoolgirl died. The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) vowed to overthrow the government of President Husni Mubarak following the execution of two fundamentalist soldiers in Alexandria Thursday for plotting to kill the Egyptian leader. Second lieutenant in the reserves Midhat al-Tahawi and conscript Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id Salih, both members of the al-Jama'ah, were sentenced to death by the Sidi Barrani military court on February 16. They were accused of having planned an assassination attempt against Mubarak, who was due to visit the Sidi Barrani military base near the Libyan border. A third soldier condemned to death, Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi, was still on the run. He was also a member of the al-Jama'ah. The group's statement said Mubarak's murder was "a duty laid down by Shariah (Islamic law)." It quoted al-Tahawi's "last wish," for Egyptians to become holy warriors and set up an Islamic state.
