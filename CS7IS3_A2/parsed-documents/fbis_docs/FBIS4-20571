Borides, especially transition metal borides, have intrinsic properties, i.e., high melting point, high hardness and electrical conductivity, hence they are promising candidates for the wear-resistant application. However, poor sinterability and extreme brittleness of borides have notorious disadvantages to form solid structures in spite of their excellent properties. One solution to the above problem had reached the combination of a boride with a tough metal matrix, namely a boride base cermet. But strong chemical reaction between a boride and a metal matrix failed in the fabrication of the cermet with satisfactory mechanical properties due to the formation of brittle third phases. By enhancing the reaction between a boride and a metal matrix instead of restricting it between them, a novel strategy to form a ternary boride coexisted with metal during the sintering process starting with a binary boride and a metal resulted in successful achievement of a cemented boride with excellent wear resistance and mechanical properties. This new sintering technique, named reaction boronizing sintering, has already developed three ternary boride base cermets; namely, Mo[.sub]2[/]FeB[.sub]2[/],[.sup]1[/] MO[.sub]2[/]NI- B[.sub]2[/],[.sup]2[/] and WCoB[.sup]3[/] base ones. These new ternary boride base cermets have been successfully applied to wear-resistant applications such as injection molding machine parts, can-making tools, hot copper extruding dies, etc. In this paper, criteria for the development of ternary boride base cermets and the characteristics of those will be discussed.
