Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Seimas opposition also gave his view on the signing of the agreement. Here is Audrius Baciulis with the details: [Baciulis] Brazauskas stressed that in the process of carrying out the Partnership for Peace program, the Lithuanian Armed Forces would grow stronger and come closer to NATO standards. The important point here is that the quality of the Armed Forces and not the quantity will change. At the moment it is too early to tell how much this will cost. Lithuania is receiving significant help from the Scandinavian countries. Britain has already undertaken the training of the peace-keeping unit. Of course, this is not a matter of one day but of a long period of time, Brazauskas said. It would not be serious to give you figures out of a hat, the president said, however, one must not forget that peace and stability involves considerable expense. Brazauskas stressed that finances for the formation of the peace- keeping battalion would not be taken from the education, culture, or social security budgets. Already this week experts from Denmark and Germany will arrive in Lithuania to discuss possibilities for Lithuania to practically participate in the Partnership for Peace program. Some NATO states will help to set up the Lithuanian national security doctrine. Apart from this, NATO countries will send their experts [to advise] in the negotiations on military transit to Kaliningrad. The possibility of signing a free trade agreement between Lithuania and the European Union this year and also the possibility of receiving the status of associated member of the European Union was discussed by Brazauskas during the meeting with Jacques Delors, chairman of the European Commission, in Brussels. Delors was in favor of such a possibility. During the president's visit to the Netherlands, agreements on maritime transport and investment inducements were signed. During talks with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene agreement was reached to accelerate the signing of such agreements between Lithuania and Belgium. Answering a question on whether the Partnership for Peace program guaranteed Lithuanian security, Brazauskas remarked that for some reason everyone wants security guarantees at once. Of course there are no specific security guarantees in the Partnership for Peace program as it would be in the NATO treaty. However, many important articles have been included in the program, for example, the possibility of inviting NATO consultants in the event of a threat, then there is joint military planning with NATO, and so on. When all this is put together you can see that the guarantees are given, Brazauskas said. Landsbergis also gave his comments on the Partnership for Peace documents at his news conference today. He noted that the Partnership for Peace program was a framework for all the states and not just Lithuania alone. It is important how this framework will be filled, he said. Because the agreement gives the right to hold consultations with NATO if danger arises, Landsbergis proposed that such consultants should be invited to Lithuania now. According to Landsbergis, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's latest statements, the events in Belarus and her statements with regard to Lithuania, already enables Lithuania to speak about a threat to the integrity of her territory. Landsbergis drew attention to the fact that Brazauskas spoke very cautiously in Brussels and that his statements there were very cautious and reassuring for Russia. He expressed concern about the protracted negotiations on military transit to Kaliningrad. Such military transit may involve Lithuania into the structures of CIS military interaction, Landsbergis said. At the same time he did not reject the possibility that military transit to Kaliningrad through the territory of Lithuania could exist, however, this should be carried out on one-off agreements only and not on agreements. The possibility of inviting international experts for the preparation of this agreement was regarded by Landsbergis as a shield and means for making the international community used to the idea of such an agreement.
