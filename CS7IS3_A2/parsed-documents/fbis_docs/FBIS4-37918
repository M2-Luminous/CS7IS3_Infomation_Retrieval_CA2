FBIS4-37918 "drnes123_k_94005" FBIS-NES-94-123 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 IRAQ Columnist Asks Authorities To Act on Exchange Rate Columnist Asks Authorities To Act on Exchange Rate JN2606195194 Baghdad BABIL in Arabic 21 Jun 94 p 12 JN2606195194 Baghdad BABIL Arabic BFN ["Above the Red Line" column by Fawzi Ibrahim: "The Central Bank and a Balanced Behavior of the Exchange Rate"] [Text] In their daily transactions, money brokers and traders have resorted to a serious course of action that greatly harms the national economy since the monetary authorities have fixed the exchange rate of foreign currencies, particularly the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. The dollar's exchange rate was set at 445 dinars against the dollar at licensed currency shops and companies and at 425 dinars at government and private banks. Thus, all transactions are carried out on the basis of this rate of exchange. But, what actually takes place has nothing to do with this exchange rate as the money brokers and traders continue to devise ways and methods to harm the national economy. The money brokers are adopting rates of exchange that exceed the fixed rates by 10 to 25 percent. This shows how harmful this is to national economy. The monetary authorities will be unable to readjust the declared rates of exchange with the actual rate the money dealers adopt. To be able to carry out such a readjustment, the monetary authorities are called upon to either float or rectify the rate of exchange. Such a step will enable the rate of exchange to be controlled. This will also ensure that many of those who were dealing with money brokers in the licensed or unlicensed currency shops and companies will now deal with the government and private banks. It is impossible to have different rates of exchange. The best rate of exchange is always offered by the private sector banks. This will make many of those who deal with currency or those who transfer their foreign currency savings go to private currency shops instead of the banks as the difference will be great and may reach 50 dinar for every dollar. Such a decision will further stabilize the money market and will benefit the national economy instead of benefiting the many clandestine and unlicensed currency shops and companies whose number exceeds by far that of licensed ones. At the same time, such a decision will make it possible to account for the transactions in the money markets for budget and taxation purposes, it will check any sharp drop of the rate of exchange in the parallel markets, and it will establish a sound behavior pattern for the rate of exchange that will be in line with the economic circumstances. Restrictions and too many regulations sometimes have a negative impact on the national economy. This is what actually takes place in the money market, in addition to the factors from outside. Many hostile parties outside Iraq resort to means and methods to influence the money brokers and traders. This actually took place. Some Kurdish agents resorted to tempting means to influence the exchange rate. Unfortunately, some of the money brokers and speculators fell under the spell of these gangs, which are hostile to the homeland and the people and which seek to harm the economy. They have renounced their patriotism and ethics and have become hirelings who implement enemy schemes to harm the national economy and exhaust its resources to have the Iraqi people suffer from the embargo and dampen their morale. The executive authorities cannot remain a bystander and apply a laissez-faire doctrine. No one accepts such a doctrine.
