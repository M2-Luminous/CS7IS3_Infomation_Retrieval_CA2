The Fatherland Party of Labor [OPT] and the Russian All-National Union [Ruskiyat obshtenaroden suyuz] (ROS) have informed the state leaderships of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Russian Federation that they will send volunteers to our western neighbor with a view to ensuring equilibrium. Anatoliy Dolgopolov, a Cossack from the Kuban and a parliament deputy of the Russian Path party, declared: I think that no state or parliament will forget about its peoples and fail to protect them. At the moment I have no troops, Dolgopolov said, but if anyone dares to encroach upon Bulgaria's interests...," suggestively failing to complete his sentence. Father Gelemenov told STANDART NEWS: "My lads (the 'skinheads' -- editorial note) say that it is quite easy to enroll as a volunteer in Serbia." Gelemenov said that last year he wanted to leave for Bosnia, but a woman called Petya had become very dear to him, and this stopped him from going. The leader of the unregistered National Socialist Party claims that Bulgarian mercenaries received 2,500 German marks a month. He said he know of special offices in Serbia that recruited volunteers and sent them for training. The nationalist parties do not intend to found a special union of volunteers, but they will encourage them, Gelemenov said. A source close to the Bulgarian "Blue Helmets" association declared that four or five former "Blue Helmets" from Cambodia are already on the territory of southern Yugoslavia. The source said they left on a trip abroad and, at the moment, are earning their livings as professional rangers. The Defense Ministry refused to make any comment, because it regards the statement issued by the OPT and ROS as a piece of utter nonsense. Nikolay Slatinski told STANDART NEWS: This is nonsense, and it repeats the incredible stupidity of those who applauded the bombing of the Serbian positions in Sarajevo. As chairman of the Parliamentary National Security Commission, he added, I am against the idea of sending volunteers to former Yugoslavia, although we are Slavs and Christians. The people who signed this document should be reported to the prosecutor, Zhan Videnov, leader of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], told STANDART NEWS. It is a technical omission that so far the PSSD [Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy] has not stated any official viewpoint on the fascist statements and activities of Father Gelemenov. Mr. Videnov considers that Bulgaria should reconfirm its stance of nonintervention in the Yugo-conflict. Yesterday the Socialist leader refused to have a meeting with the Russian Path party, which under the chairmanship of Sergey Baburin represents the ROS in the Russian Duma.
