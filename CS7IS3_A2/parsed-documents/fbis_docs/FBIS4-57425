FBIS4-57425 "drlat097_b_94010" FBIS-LAT-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Dominican Republic Trinidad and Tobago Refinery Expects Job Losses in Divestment Process Refinery Expects Job Losses in Divestment Process FL1805224294 Castries HTS Caribvision Television in English 1945 GMT 18 May 94 FL1805224294 Castries HTS Caribvision Television English BFN [Text] More job losses in the pipeline for Trinidad and Tobago, this time at (Petrotrin). Chief executive officer (Keith Owah) says the company's wage bill must be reduced from 47 percent of the company's operating costs to at least 35 percent. (Petrotrin) was formed last year by a merger of (Trintopec) and (Trintoc), and the new management is seeking to divest the nonpetroleum assets of the two companies. (Nicole Huggins) tells us more in this dispatch: [Begin recording] [(Huggins)] The refining operations of (Petrotrin) have lost as much as $15 million annually over the past seven years. Output stands at less than 50 percent capacity, and with international oil prices expected to remain soft -- between $15 and $17 per barrel -- (Patten C.U. Keith Owah) sums up the company's strategic plan in one word: survival. Part of the plan is the sale of the Point Fortin refinery. Mr. (Owah) says there have already been informal statements of interest, but serious offers are expected, maybe by the end of the month. Most refineries are running on technology that is 30 years old, but Mr. (Owah) says he is fairly optimistic that an interested party will be found. [(Owah)] In South America, you have countries with surplus crude and no adequate refining capability. Even in North America, you may find people, who are importing crude to process in the U.S., who might find Trinidad a good geographical location to begin investing in upgrading a refinery. So the point is that even though it is an old refinery, it is relatively safe in terms of refinery configuration. There is a good base on which to build an upgraded refinery. [(Huggins)] The company is also looking at divesting the nonetroleum assets of (Trintoc) and (Trintopec), from catering services and hospitals to agricultural holdings. The Point-a-Pierre refinery is in the process of being upgraded, at a cost of TT $1.5 billion, and a venture partner is now being sought. [(Owah)] I do not think today, we can say exatly what form that alliance will take, but it could be from one extreme -- an equity partner -- to another extreme, where you simply have an alliance with someone providing raw material and (?taking product), and that kind of thing. Our objective is to minimize our risk. [(Huggins)] The upgrade is scheduled for completion by the first quarter of 1996, at least. The divestment of assets and the restructuring of the company are expected to lead to further cuts in the workforce over 1994-95, and those who remain may not have to accept much less, but will have to produce much more.
