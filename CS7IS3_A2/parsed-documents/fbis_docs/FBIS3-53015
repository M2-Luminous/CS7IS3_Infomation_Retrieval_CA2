His Highness Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, also participated in the meetings. The ministers reviewed the Middle East peace process and discussed its developments since the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, considering it a first step that should be completed by steps on the other tracks in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region. In their deliberations, the ministers concentrated on the extreme importance of the anticipated summit meeting between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. They underscored the vital and important Syrian role in securing the success of the Middle East peace process and emphasized their states' strong support for President al-Asad. They expressed the hope that this meeting will lead to a just and comprehensive peace in the region on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and the land-for-peace principle in a manner that leads to the Israeli withdrawal from all of the Arab territories occupied in 1967, including Arab Jerusalem, and guarantees the Palestinian Arab people's national rights. The ministers have discussed the situation in the Gulf region. In this regard, the ministers reaffirm their countries' concern for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Iraq. They also hold the Iraqi regime fully responsible for the suffering being experienced by the Iraqi people. The ministers strongly condemn the Iraqi regime because of its pursuit of a selective approach in its implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy regarding its aggression against the State of Kuwait, because it has continued to threaten Kuwait, and also because of its hostile conduct toward Kuwait. Moreover, they reaffirm their full support for the State of Kuwait in the face of all these threats, and renew their demand that the Iraqi regime comply with the cease-fire terms and honor all relevant UN Security Council resolutions, particularly those concerning borders, the release of all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees, and compensation. The ministers reiterate that respect by Iraq for the sovereignty and independence of the State of Kuwait and its international borders, as approved by the UN Security Council per Resolution 833, is at the heart of the commitments enshrined in UN Security Council Resolution 687, and that its failure to do so would be a violation of the essence of this resolution. The ministers have also reviewed with interest the call made by His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE], urging the Islamic Republic of Iran to hold a direct dialogue with the UAE on its occupation of the three UAE islands of Tunb al-Sughra, Tunb al-Kubra, and Abu Musa. While commending this call, the ministers urge Iran to respond favorably to this call, particularly since it seeks to reach a peaceful settlement of this dispute in line with international law, international conventions, and the principles of good neighborliness, and mutual respect among states. The ministers reaffirm their support and backing for the peaceful measures and means the UAE may pursue to regain its sovereignty over these three islands. The ministers once again voice their grave concern over developments in Somalia. They appeal to all Somali leaders and factions to make the national interest outweigh all other considerations. They also urge them to comply with the UN Security Council resolutions, and cooperate with the efforts of both the United Nations and the OAU to ensure the achievement of peace, security, and stability in Somalia. The ministers voiced grave concern over the situation in Afghanistan and appealed to all the leaders to give priority to national interests to safeguard the Afghan people's interests. The ministers also voiced their deep concern for the failure of the influential world forces to take note of the tragic political and humanitarian situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina. They vehemently condemned the continued Serbian aggression and the Serbs perpetration of all kinds of crimes against humanity. The ministers called on the UN Security Council and the influential international forces to take all necessary measures, including the lifting of the arms embargo from Bosnia and Hercegovina, to end this people's tragedy. They also called for them to maintain the sanctions imposed on Serbia until it respects the resolutions and principles of international legitimacy, and halts its violations of the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Hercegovina and of its people's rights. The ministers noted with satisfaction the implementation of the recommendations issued at their previous meeting in Abu Dhabi on 12-13 June 1993, which seek to invigorate political and economic coordination and cooperation among the Damascus Declaration countries in a manner that will enable them to proceed with this march of cooperation in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Damascus Declaration. The ministers expressed their thanks and appreciation to the Syrian Arab Republic president, government, and people for hosting this meeting and for the warm welcome and the hospitality they were accorded. The ministers welcomed the kind invitation Kuwait has extended to host the next meeting of the Damascus Declaration states' foreign ministers in Kuwait. Faruq al-Shar' concluded the meeting of the foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration states with a speech in which he said: Your Highnesses and Excellencies, Dear Brothers: At the end of our meetings yesterday and today I would like, on behalf of the Syrian Arab Republic, to express great satisfaction with the results that we attained during our deliberations. I would like to thank you all for the cooperation we have sensed during our meetings and for the sincere spirit that prevailed among us enabling us to reach a common perspective on all the issues we have discussed and about which we have adopted the appropriate stands. Al-Shar' added: As I said in my opening speech, our stands toward the basic issues are identical or very close. There are no serious differences between us. Hence, we express our satisfaction as well as our thanks for all the efforts and pains you have taken to reach this satisfactory result. As I said a short while ago, the statement issued in the name of us all as eight Arab states contains the main topics discussed during your deliberations. The foreign minister added: We also agreed to hold the next meeting in the sisterly State of Kuwait and we are happy to do so at the appropriate time. Once again I thank you for accepting our invitation to participate in this important meeting, which came at a critical time in the region's life, hoping that our unified positions, joint concepts, and aspiration for a real Arab solidarity will deliver this nation from the setbacks to which it was exposed and help us all rectify the big imbalance existing in the Arab arena. Thus we can confront future challenges with sincere determination and unified opinion on whose basis we can restore our legitimate rights and occupied lands and achieve a just and comprehensive peace in this region on the basis of UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. In the meantime, we stress that realizing such peace will inevitably achieve security and stability in the region--a region that has suffered a great deal and offered many sacrifices. Our cooperation will, God willing, continue. The words we exchanged on our faith in cooperation and coordination among our states, our comprehensive Arab vision, and our desire to lay the basis of pan-Arab security will all place our march on the right track. We pray to God to grant us all success. I thank you again for taking the trouble of coming to Syria -- your country. I wish you success and a safe return home. Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, meanwhile, gave a speech, in which he said: My colleagues have asked me to speak on their behalf and extend our thanks to His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and his government, as well as the Syrian people for the hospitality and kind reception accorded us in this hospitable country. We are all extremely happy with the outcome of our meeting. We are equally satisfied with the progress the eight countries have made in their effort to advance their cooperation. We are similarly impressed by the course we have charted for our future action. I must thank the conference chairman for the wise way in which he conducted our sessions and for attaining the outcome we had set out to achieve -- results that matched our leaders' aspirations as the eight states proceed within the framework of the Damascus Declaration. On behalf of all of us, I would like to tell brotherly Syria that we fully appreciate its attachment to Arab causes, notably the peace process. In this regard, we were impressed by the Syrian official assertions, echoed by His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad to us this morning, that Syria will continue to work relentlessly to promote a just and comprehensive peace in the region. I take this opportunity to tell my brother [Faruq al-Shar'] and through him His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad, as well as the Syrian people and Government, that they can count on all of us supporting Syria until such peace that meets our interests and our legitimate demands comes to the region. Again, we thank the conference chairman for the successful way in which he conducted its proceedings. We hope the next sessions will be just as successful. We join you in thanking Kuwait for offering to host our next session. Thank you, Your Excellency Mr. Al-Shar'. Please accept our wishes of success and prosperity for the brotherly Syrian people. Farewell.
