Do you believe that it provides sufficient security, or do you expect more from the alliance? [Drnovsek] We are rather satisfied...no doubt because we are fairly realistic. We were not expecting more at this time because we know that the alliance is a complex organization, comprising a large number of members, and that there are questions of coordination to be settled for the implementation of the concept of enlargement. However, this flexibility is an advantage for us, because it will enable us to progressively become involved in the process of common defense and security. We have made a firm decision to continue in this vein, and we are sure that the final stage, in the years to come, will be full membership of NATO for Slovenia. [Van Velthem] At the same time, you are also asking for the arms embargo still imposed on the whole of Yugoslavia to be lifted... [Drnovsek] The embargo was imposed right at the start of the Yugoslav crisis, from which Slovenia escaped nearly three years ago. However, it was no doubt much easier for the superpowers and the United Nations to leave the decision in place, for any modification in terms of moving toward lifting the embargo threatened to snowball toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and the other war zones. Today, beacuse of such inertia, Slovenia remains a victim trapped by that measure for no reason whatsoever. However, we are pragmatic and do understand the actual state of affairs within the region. So we are waiting, confidently... [Van Velthem] Willy Claes and Alain Lamassoure have both successively visited Ljubljana: Slovenia is accelerating its rapprochement with the European Union (EU). [Drnovsek] The EU is a natural partner for us. Sixty percent of our trade is already conducted with the union. The cooperation agreement in application today was signed at the beginning of last year. It is satisfactory, but we intend to go beyond it in the very near future, all the more so since we believe we have already made much more progress than certain other countries which already benefit from associate status. The talks on this subject will start in May, and provided that everything runs as scheduled, it should be possible to sign by the end of the year. [Van Velthem] How did the Slovene economy transform itself following the dismantlement of the former Yugoslavia? [Drnovsek] The economy is making good progress. Admittedly, in the wake of achieving independence in 1991 we found it difficult to adapt after losing the domestic markets and experiencing a drop in industrial activity. However, since 1993, more rapidly than even we had predicted ourselves, we are once again experiencing positive growth, and have brought down inflation sharply -- indeed, it dropped from 270 percent when our currency, the tolar, was introduced to approximately 20 percent last year. We Will Pay Our Debts [Van Velthem] And tourism, formerly an appreciable source of revenue for Slovenia? [Drnovsek] It is starting to develop again. Above all for people from neighboring countries, such as Italy, Austria, or Germany, increasing numbers of whom are coming to Istria and the Adriatic coast. On the other hand, tourists from further afield are still more cautious, perhaps because they still picture Slovenia as being directly involved in the Yugoslav conflicts. [Van Velthem] Nonetheless, the republics have yet to share out the debts and assets of the former Yugoslavia... [Drnovsek] That is true. We are not at all satisfied with the slowness of progress on the question of Yugoslav succession at the Geneva conference. Admittedly, up to now most of the other republics have been saddled with other problems. Slovenia did not expect a definitive agreement on this question: We have already settled our financial relations with the IMF, the World Bank, or the Club de Paris, and we are negotiating with the international banks the share of the commercial debt of the former Yugoslavia that has been assigned to us. We want to present a very clear bill of health of our financial situation. So the only thing that will remain to discuss with our former partners is how to share out our common heritage, especially the embassies and other buildings that Yugoslavia had abroad. [Van Velthem] Do the Bosnian refugees who were flowing toward Slovenia at the start of the war still represent a major burden, both financially and socially? [Drnovsek] It is not as worrying a problem for us as some demagogues are attempting to make out. There are still something like 30,000 refugees, and we have done everything possible to ensure that they can lead as normal an existence as possible in terms of housing, food aid, and psychological support. It is our elementary duty to show such solidarity. Need for Domestic Stability [Van Velthem] The night before you came to Brussels, the Slovene Parliament dismissed Defense Minister Jansa from office. Is the coalition government, comprising your Liberal Democratic Party, the Christian Democrats led by Mr. Peterle, and the Social Democrats led by Mr. Jansa now threatened? [Drnovsek] I do not think we are heading for a domestic crisis. The defense minister was replaced in the wake of a specific incident, and if the Social Democrats leave the government, then we are prepared to continue with the Christian Democrats alone. Following this option would just enable us to retain the majority. [Van Velthem] So there are no plans to hold elections, which would plunge the country into a state of uncertainty? [Drnovsek] I do not think so. And I have good reason to believe that: If elections were held today, then the polls show that my own Liberal Democratic Party would emerge as the main victors. Consequently, the other political groups are in no hurry to return to the ballot box. Above all, the entire country first needs continuity and stability. After all, we are in a good position to know what a political crisis and power vacuum can mean....
