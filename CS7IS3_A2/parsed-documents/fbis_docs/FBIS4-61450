There is a slump in production. Those who talk of crisis are simply following fashion," Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said at a news conference today. He backed up his viewpoint with facts. Inflation, which last year took the catastrophic form of hyperinflation reaching 91 percent in December, was 5.7 percent in March of this year. Prices for basic foodstuffs are almost static. The gradual reduction of bank credit interest rates has begun. The decision that hard currency must be sold at a regulated exchange rate has made it possible for a proportion of subsidies and allowances which exporters received from the state to be recovered and for inflation on the domestic market to be curbed. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said that the government has moved away from general discussions about the need to return all hard currency earned from exports from Ukraine to specific measures. Checks have been carried out to ascertain whether the hard currency receipts of all exporters have been declared fully and promptly. A control system "customs-bank" has been devised and is being introduced. This gives a real picture of hard currency from exports coming into Ukraine literally every day. And we are doing this at accelerated rates, since Ukraine in January alone failed to receive more than $14 million, about 10 billion Russian rubles, and also large sums of other currencies, the acting Prime Minister stressed. But today we know by name everyone who failed to return currency on time, and we shall take the toughest measures against them. Measures are being taken to ensure complete and punctual payment of taxes into the budget. In January to April alone, evaded taxes were recovered and fines were imposed in the amount of 1.441 trillion karbovantsi. This work is continuing. In this way, one of the reasons for the delay in remittance of pay to the budget-financed organizations and in financing of social programs is being eliminated in particular. A fundamentally new mechanism of settling accounts with the producers of agricultural output has make it possible, without resorting to emission of money, to supply agriculture with fuel and lubricants, seed, and fertilizer at acceptable prices. This in turn has made it possible to carry out the spring field work without substantial disruption and lay the foundations of the future harvest. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy considers that these "measures are ensuring control of the economic situation not by means of vulgar administrative state interference in everything, but by means of economic levers." Now the opportunity has appeared to tackle nonpayments, one of the major problems to date. The main essence of these measures consists in lowering enterprises' tax burden, preparing for the transition to tax on profits and not on incomes, targeting support for those who produce output for which there is a market, liberalizing exports and the protection of home producers, and also lowering the bank rates. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy announced one other piece of news: The decision has been made to increase the regulated rate of the karbovanets to 13,100 karbovantsi to one U.S. dollar.
