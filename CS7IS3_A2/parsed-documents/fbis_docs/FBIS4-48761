IFP spokesman Hennie Bekker said his party would support the plan as far as it was practical and feasible, but there was cause for concern that expectations were being created that could not be fulfilled. Industry and commerce, as well as politicians across the spectrum, including the National Party, the Democratic Party, and the Pan-Africanist Congress, have already expressed their support for the president's vision. Others, like the Freedom Front, expressed guarded optimism.
