Compared with Helios I (two optical observation satellites, one of which will be put into orbit at the start of 1995), the Helios II program will develop higher-capacity satellites which will use infrared technology to see at night as well as during the day and even in bad weather conditions. They are due to enter service in the year 2001. The overall program will cost 10 billion francs [Fr] (for two satellites), including Fr770 million for the definition phase. The Helios I program, run jointly with Italy (14 percent) and Spain (7 percent), had been estimated at almost Fr8 billion. The Helios II program initially provides for the launch of a satellite in 1999, 2001, 2004, and 2006.
