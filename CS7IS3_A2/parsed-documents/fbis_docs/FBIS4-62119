As expected, the election of the chairman of the autonomous republic led to the first parliamentary crisis. The morning session discussed the election of deputy speakers of the Crimean Supreme Council. Sehiy [Sergey] Tsekov proposed Oleksiy Melnykov, deputy head of the Republican Party of Crimea and head of the party's Sevastopol branch, and Viktor Mezhak, head of the People's Party of Crimea, for this post. After a long and stormy discussion, Oleksiy Melnykov's candidacy was rejected; 44 voted in favor and 46 against. Viktor Mezhak's candidacy was also rejected (24 for and 53 against with 17 abstentions). The chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council announced a break until 1500 for consultations regarding new candidates. During an interval, deputies discussed the possibility of nominating Admiral Oleksandr Frolov, deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet responsible for combat training, and Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people and leader of the Kurultay's deputies group. Commenting on the situation, Leonid Hrach, first secretary of the Communist Party of Crimea, noted: "I did not expect such a level from our parliament. It is possible to have a middle or a low level but what I see is simply primitive. Progressive forces among the deputies will hardly make contact with the present leadership of the Supreme Council, or to be more specific, with the leader. Such a situation will, in my opinion, last for about another two months, until the next round."
