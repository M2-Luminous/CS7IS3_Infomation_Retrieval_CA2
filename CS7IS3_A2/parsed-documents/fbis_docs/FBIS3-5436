The latter has carried out all manner of the most poisonous activities against the sacred wish of diverse countries desiring to live with unity and in peace within their territorial integrity. Our nation and people were victims of the 1970 coup d'etat organized by the CIA, which has continued to destroy Cambodia's independence, peace, and neutrality. Now there are reports that the United States has decided to send a Peace Corps, which is a division of the worldwide notorious CIA to Cambodia to continue destructive activities against our nation and people. Our nation, people, and the patriotic forces will in no way remain idle and allow the CIA or its Peace Corps to do away with Cambodia at will. We will certainly continue our struggle to restore Cambodia's independence and peace within its territorial integrity.
