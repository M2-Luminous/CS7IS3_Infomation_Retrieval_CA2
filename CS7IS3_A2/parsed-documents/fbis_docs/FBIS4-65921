He gave the first insight into the radical reforms that Britain will seek at the 1996 inter-governmental conference on the future of Europe to try to hold back its centralising tendencies. Mr Heathcoat-Amory suggested that instead of a flood of often unwanted legislation from Brussels, the Council of Ministers should agree a programme each year based on suggestions from the Commission and after consultations with the European parliament. The Commission would then oversee its implementation in member states. He also questioned the proliferation of Commissioners, whose number is set to rise to 21 with the accession of four new countries to the EC, and urged the next President of the Commission after M Jacques Delors to place internal management and restructuring at the centre of his concerns. "This is not a suggestion made to try and weaken or derail the European Union or to deny the Commission the powers they need," Mr Heathcoat-Amory said. "The need is rather to recognise that the European Union has entered a new phase. There is now a substantial body of European law. The emphasis should be on simplification, respect for subsidiarity and ensuring compliance." Mr Heathcoat-Amory, addressing the European Policy Forum in London, said the case for a serious review of the Commission had been established. Like many governments, it had caught the bug of over-legislation . Although the Commission does not pass its own laws once it had made a proposal and launched a draft measure, it often became impossible to stop, only to amend and modify. "The legislation acquires a momentum of its own... Other considerations, like cost, intrusiveness, effect of other legislation and practicality, often take a back seat," said Mr Heathcoat-Amory. "Too much legislation of the wrong sort can weaken and discredit the European Union it is designed to promote."
