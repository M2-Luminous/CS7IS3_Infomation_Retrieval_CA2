A spokesman for the State Duma quoted Guliyev as saying that the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia cannot be solved without Russia's involvement. For his part, Rybkin said that even though Russia was criticized by many for "taking too much upon itself" in terms of settling ethnic conflicts, its efforts are "sincere and will be continued". Guliyev stated with regret that Russia was gradually losing its influence in Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan in Russia. This cannot be permitted, he said, since close economic contacts between Moscow and Baku will do more for strengthening the Russian influence in the East than "the use of force". Under discussion was also the problem of drawing closer the Russian and Azeri legislations, first of all, in the sphere of customs.
