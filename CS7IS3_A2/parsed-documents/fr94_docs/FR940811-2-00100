FR940811-2-00100 FR940811-2-00066 Antitrust Division Request for Comments on Draft Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing and Acquisition of Intellectual Property AGENCY: Antitrust Division, Department of Justice. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Antitrust Division has drafted proposed new Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing and Acquisition of Intellectual Property. The Guidelines, when adopted in final form by the Department of Justice, will state the antitrust enforcement policy of the Department with respect to the licensing and acquisition of intellectual property, and will supersede section 3.6 in Part I, ``Intellectual Property Licensing Arrangements,'' and cases, 6, 10, 11, and 12 in Part II of the U.S. Department of Justice 1988 Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations. Comments should be submitted in writing within 60 days of publication of these draft Guidelines. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Submit views to Richard Gilbert, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, Tenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530, 202&hyph;514&hyph;2408. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As announced by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, Anne K. Bingaman, in published speeches on January 10, 1994 and June 16, 1994, these proposed guidelines were drafted to state the current views of Antitrust Division with respect to the licensing and acquisition of intellectual property. The Guidelines are not intended to create or recognize any legally enforceable right in any person. They are not intended to affect the admissibility of evidence or in any other way necessarily to affect the course or conduct of any present of future litigation. Moreover, changes in the relevant statutory framework, legal precedent, and methods of internal Department analysis may occur over time, and these changes will not always be simultaneously reflected in amendments to the Guidelines. Parties seeking to know the Department's specific enforcement intentions with respect to any particular transaction should consider seeking a Business Review pursuant to 28 CFR 50.5. Dated: August 8, 1994. Richard Gilbert, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division. U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing and Acquisition of Intellectual Property 1 1 These Guidelines supersede section 3.6 in Part I, ``Intellectual Property Licensing Arrangements,'' and cases 6, 10, 11, and 12 in Part II of the U.S. Department of Justice 1988 Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations. 1. Intellectual Property Protection and the Antitrust Laws These Guidelines state the antitrust enforcement policy of the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the licensing and acquisition of intellectual property protected by patent, copyright, and trade secret law. 2 By stating its general policy, the Department hopes to assist those who need to predict whether the Department will challenge a practice as anticompetitive. However, these Guidelines cannot remove judgment and discretion in antitrust law enforcement. Moreover, the standards set forth in these Guidelines must be applied in unforeseeable circumstances. Each case will be evaluated in light of its own facts, and these Guidelines will be applied reasonably and flexibly. 2 These Guidelines do not cover the antitrust treatment of trademarks. Although the same general antitrust principles that apply to other forms of intellectual property apply to trademarks as well, these Guidelines deal with innovation-related issues that typically arise with respect to patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, rather than with product-differentiation issues that typically arise with respect to trademarks. In the United States, patents confer rights to exclude others from making, using, or selling in the United States the invention claimed by the patent for a period of seventeen years from the date of issue. 3 To gain patent protection, an invention (which may be a product, process, machine, or composition of matter) must be novel, nonobvious, and useful. Copyright protection applies to original works of authorship embodied in a tangible medium of expression. 4 A copyright protects only the expression, not the underlying ideas. Unlike a patent, which protects an invention not only from copying but also from independent creation, a copyright does not preclude others from independently creating similar expression. Trade secret protection applies to information whose economic value depends on its not being generally known. Trade secret protection is conditioned upon efforts to maintain secrecy and has no fixed term. As with copyright protection, trade secret protection does not preclude independent creation by others. 5 3 See 35 U.S.C. 154 (1988). In the case of process patents, the protection extends to importation of goods made by a patented process. See 19 U.S.C. 1337 (1988 & Supp. V 1993); 35 U.S.C. 271(g) (1988). 4 See 17 U.S.C. 102 (1988 & Supp. V 1993). Copyright protection lasts for the author's life plus 50 years, or 75 years from first publication (or 100 years from creation, whichever expires first) for works made for hire. See 17 U.S.C. 302 (1988). 5 The principles stated in these Guidelines also apply to protection of mask works fixed in a semiconductor chip product ( see 17 U.S.C. 901 et seq. (1988)), which is analogous to copyright protection for works of authorship. These principles also generally apply to licensing of know-how and other collections of information which may not be protected by intellectual property rights, but which may nonetheless have value to a licensee or transferee because of the form into which they are assembled. Although there are clear and important differences in the purpose, extent, and duration of protection provided under the intellectual property regimes of patent, copyright, and trade secret, the governing antitrust principles are the same. Antitrust analysis takes differences among these forms of intellectual property into account in evaluating the specific market circumstances in which transactions occur, just as it does with other particular market circumstances. The intellectual property laws and the antitrust laws share the common purpose of promoting innovation and enhancing consumer welfare. 6 The intellectual property laws provide incentives for innovation and its dissemination and commercialization by establishing enforceable property rights for the creators of new and useful products, more efficient processes, and original works of expression. In the absence of intellectual property rights, imitators could more rapidly exploit the efforts of innovators and investors without compensation, thereby reducing the commercial value of innovation and eroding the incentives to invest. The antitrust laws promote innovation and consumer welfare by prohibiting certain actions by firms that deter those firms and others from competing with respect to either existing or new ways of serving consumers. 6 ``[T]he aims and objectives of patent and antitrust laws may seem, at first glance, wholly at odds, However, the two bodies of law are actually complementary, as both are aimed at encouraging innovation, industry ad competition.'' Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 897 F.2d 1572, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1990). 2. General Principles 2.0 ‚ê£These Guidelines embody three general principles: (a) For the purpose of antitrust analysis, the Department regards intellectual property as being essentially comparable to any other form of property; (b) the Department does not presume that intellectual property creates market power in the antitrust context; and (c) the Department recognizes that intellectual property licensing allows firms to combine complementary factors of production and is generally procompetitive.
