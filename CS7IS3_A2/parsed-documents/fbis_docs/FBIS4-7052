Col Amnuai said he was informed by Cambodian representatives on the TCCO that their government had reinforced security and troops to ensure the safety of the refugees, numbering 958, once they return to their Beng Takuan village in Bantaey Meanchey province of Cambodia. During the battle between the Khmer Rouge and government forces on April 21-22, Beng Takuan was the scene of heavy fighting and the villagers fled their bomes and sought refuge in Ta Phraya district of Sa Kaew province opposite the Cambodian border. Bantaey Meanchey officials told Col Amnuai that most of the refugees wished to return to their homes and 7th Army commander Gen Kho Chea, in charge of government troops in the province, was prepared to guarantee their safety through additional reinforcement of men and heavy artillery. The Cambodian representative on TCCO also reiterated his government's promise not to engage Khmer Rouge guerrillas near the border to prevent endangering the lives of Thai people in the area. If Beng Takuan is attacked in the future, the villagers will be moved 20 kilometres deeper into Cambodian territory, he said. He also expressed gratitude to the Thai side "for having been a helping neighbour all along." Meanwhile, active troop movement on both sides--the Khmer Rouge and government forces--was seen aroun the area opposite Ta Phraya and severa clashes were reported about five to ten kilometres from the Thai border. The fighting is expected to continue into the rainy season which begins in June. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said his Cambodian counterpart Prince Norodom Sirivut called him up yesterday from Phnom Penh. Sqn Ldr Prasong said he briefed the Prince about his border inspection trip over the weekend and the Prince responded by saying that he hoped from now on the problem of misunderstandings between the two countries could be avoided. "I told him that if he has anything to say he should say it to us and not make allegations. "After talking on the phone I think that the situation will improve," Sqn Ldr Prasong said. The Prince and other high-ranking Phnom Penh officials have lately spoken to foreign news agencies accusing Thailand of aiding the Khmer Rouge. The Thai foreign minister denied the charge and filed a formal protest letter with Phnom Penh. The repeated accusations have soured relations between Bangkok and Phnom Penh to the point where both countries are talking about filing complaints with the United Nations. Asked if the Cambodian situation would not cause further confusion, Sqn Ldr Prasong said that this was true of all politics be it domestic or foreign. Asked about the Thai military's suggestion that Thailand protest to Cambodia every time artillery shells land on Thai territory from across the border, the Foreign Minister said every protest should be backed by reasons and evidence. The ministry has asked the military to gather information on all shelling incidents and the damage they have caused. Thailand could then pursue the matter throwgh diplomatic channels and could even file a complaint with the UN. Asked about peace talks between all the Khmer factions, Sqn Ldr Prasong said Prince Sirivut confirmed that they will be held on May 2 according to the wish of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. "Prince Sirivudh said that whether or not the the talks prove successful will depend on the Khmer Rouge," Sqn Ldr Prasong said.
