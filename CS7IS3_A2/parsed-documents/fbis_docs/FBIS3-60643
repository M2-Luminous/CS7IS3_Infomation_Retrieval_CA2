In this bellicose outburst, he said it is "important to make combat preparations" to attack the DPRK and "possibility of war cannot be ruled out". This is an exasperating remark that could be uttered by none other than a trigger-happy element intending to push the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. All the more serious is the fact that, as Woolsey said, "the President issued this instruction." We cannot but take a very serious note of the fact that U.S. President Clinton "ordered combat preparations" inwardly, not long after he threatened that any one who "venture an attack will have to pay dearly for it," obviously hinting at the DPRK, when he was announcing results of the U.S.-South Korea "summit talks" some time ago. Such remarks of the U.S. authorities are a crude breach of the DPRK-USA joint statement and perfidy against the dialogue partner. It cannot be construed otherwise than an act to block the third round of DPRK-USA talks. The recent powder-reeking, bellicose outbursts of the U.S. authorities suggest that their clamour about "preconditions" is motivated by a sinister political intention. This makes us wonder whether the United States truly seeks a negotiated solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula or persistently pursues a hostile policy for stifling the DPRK. The United States which has deployed many nuclear weapons in South Korea and is constantly presenting a nuclear threat to the DPRK, is now crying that the "possibility of war cannot be ruled out", provoking it which has neither intention nor capacity to develop nuclear weapons. This is really a shameless act reminding us of a thief crying "stop thief!" If the United States intends to bring the DPRK into submission in league with Japan and South Korea by means of pressure, "sanctions" and force of arms through the "international cooperation system," it is a big mistake. No coercion and threat can solve anything. The United States must discard the old conception of confrontation of the cold war era and promptly stop the foolish moves to contain the DPRK with strength. It must act properly, knowing well of its dialogue partner.
