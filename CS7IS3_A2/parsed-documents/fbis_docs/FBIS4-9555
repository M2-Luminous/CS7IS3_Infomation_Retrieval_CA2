FBIS4-9555 "dreeu082_i_94019" FBIS-EEU-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serb Communique Accuses UN of `Provocations' Serb Communique Accuses UN of `Provocations' LD2604171794 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1652 GMT 26 Apr 94 LD2604171794 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN ["Pool" item] [Text] Banja Luka, April 26 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) on Tuesday [26 April] warned it would `do everything to protect the lives' of its members and civilians if members of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) continued to open fire on Serb positions and settlements in northern Bosnia, as it said they had often done in the past ten days. A communique released by the VRS First Krajina Corps said that UNPROFOR provocations had been frequent on the Doboj front in the past 30 days, and that the UNPROFOR command had failed to take any steps to prevent them, that is, to prevent the direct siding of the international forces with the Muslims, although its attention had been drawn to the fact more than once. The communique said it was regrettable that the silence on the part of higher UNPROFOR commands meant their tacit approval of further provocations by UNPROFOR units. The failure of UNPROFOR commands to respond to the addressed warnings seems to have encouraged UNPROFOR units to continue staging military provocations, which have not been countered by the Serb side, the communique said. The communique said one had the impression that the direct goal of such UNPROFOR actions was to provoke a response from Serb forces and then accuse them of attacking U.N. peace-keepers, which could be used as a pretext for air strikes against Serb positions, the communique set out. The communique specified that an UNPROFOR helicopter flew over Serb positions in the area of Banovici several times on Monday and opened fire on them. The communique said U.N. peace-keepers in the occupied Serb village of Poljice, near Maglaj, had several times opened fire on Serb settlements and positions on the western slopes of Mount Ozren, and that UNPROFOR units in Zavidovici had opened fire from armoured vehicles on the Serb settlement of Dolac. Columns of armoured UNPROFOR vehicles coming from Lukavac practically daily demonstrate force only a hundred meters or so from VRS positions at Milino Selo, Sizje and Donja Brijesnica, the communique said. The communique recalled Bosnian Croat reports according to which U.N. peace-keepers are installing radar systems for the detection of Serb artillery positions in the area of Maglaj and regularly sending on the relevant information to Muslim units.
