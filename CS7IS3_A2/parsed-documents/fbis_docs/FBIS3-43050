Yurchak, Tayfun Scientific Production Association; UDC 551.501.89:551.510.42] [Abstract] Results obtained from the use of passive radar to study the physics of clouds and the diffusion of passive components in the lower part of the boundary layer of atmosphere are the foundation for the use of carbon and graphite chaff to track planned and accidental emissions of harmful substances by industry. The cloud of harmful substances is marked with chaff with a rate of sedimentation closely matching that of the tracked substance. Several materials with different rates of sedimentation may be used to track various components of the cloud.. The chaff is to be installed in the stacks, ventilators, and other structural elements of the plant and may be released on command or automatically when the maximum permissible concentration of a substance is exceeded in the emission. Figures show how this method was used to track the vertical and horizontal position and configuration of a cloud of chaff. A similar experiment conducted in the US with aluminized mylar chaff is noted. The maximum tracking distance for various diffusion conditions is determined.
