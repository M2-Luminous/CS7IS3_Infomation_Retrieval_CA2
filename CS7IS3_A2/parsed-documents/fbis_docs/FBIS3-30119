"I have not yet considered (the timing of a cabinet reshuffle). It is too early," Hosokawa told reporters at his official residence. Hosokawa said he will soon confer again with Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi, both of whose parties belong to the coalition. In a meeting Thursday, Murayama and Ouchi told Hosokawa that an immediate cabinet reshuffle is unnecessary. They renewed their opposition to a shakeup expected to center on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from his post. Hosokawa denied reports that he has asked Foreign Minister and Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata to assume the post of chief cabinet secretary and Hiroyuki Sonoda, a member of Sakigake (Harbinger), to take the post of deputy chief cabinet secretary. "I have never asked them, nor yet considered it. It's too early," Hosokawa said. Government sources said Hosokawa is likely to hear from the ruling party leaders separately sometime over the weekend or early next week. The cabinet reshuffle, if realized, will be the first since Hosokawa launched the coalition government last August after ousting the now-opposition Liberal Democratic Party after its 38-year rule. Ouchi, also health and welfare minister, told a regular press conference he is opposed to any early cabinet reshuffle that could "crack the foundations of the coalition government." Of the coalition's seven parties, the SDPJ, the DSP and Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger) have objected to the restructuring plan while Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito [Clean Government Party] support it. Takemura differs with Hosokawa on the blueprint for Japan's political future. Hosokawa has reportedly considered working toward the two-party system called for by Shinseito and Komeito, but Takemura has voiced objections. In Oita, southern Japan, Murayama said Hosokawa is likely to renew his consultations with ruling party leaders, including himself, in early March to discuss the possible cabinet reshuffle. Citing Hosokawa's remarks Thursday that he may consider a reshuffle after the Diet passes an amendment to the political reform package, Murayama said, "in case there is a reshuffle, the premier said he will surely consult (with us)." Murayama, who was speaking to a labor union's local convention, said that when he meets Hosokawa again he will repeat his stance of opposing an early cabinet shakeup. The chairman of the SDPJ, the largest among the seven ruling parties, also denied that he would enter a new cabinet, saying "the SDPJ is not in such a position now." Murayama said he supports labor leader Akira Yamagishi's idea of forming a new liberal party to compete against two conservative parties expected to be established before the next general election. Yamagishi, head of the eight-million-strong Rengo labor organization, reached a broad agreement on Thursday with Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi to aim at establishing a new liberal party. The new party is likely to be formed by uniting the SDPJ, the DSP and Sakigake, possibly under the leadership of Yokomichi, who once served as SDPJ's House of Representative member before becoming the governor of Japan's northernmost prefecture.
