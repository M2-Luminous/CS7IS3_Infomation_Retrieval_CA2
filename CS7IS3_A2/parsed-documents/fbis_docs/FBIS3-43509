Speaking on national television, Education Minister Djibo Garba also stated that 58 people were picked up for interrogation and "about 30" injured without specifying whether they were students or policemen. Eighteen vehicles were ransacked or burned down. A previous report of the police said that about 50 students were picked, including "some union leaders," and more than 40 slightly injured. The incidents started yesterday, late in the afternoon, when the police dispersed a demonstration of some 500 students in downtown Niamey. The demonstrators, who were demanding the payment of seven to nine months scholarship arrears and improvement of their working conditions, withdrew early in the evening to the campus, where they were surrounded by the security forces. At 2200, local time, that is 2100 GMT, about 500 policemen, gendarmes, and republican guards, were still near the university, according to an AFP correspondent. The minister of education further stated that the government was about to investigate the affair in order "to prosecute those behind the demonstration."
