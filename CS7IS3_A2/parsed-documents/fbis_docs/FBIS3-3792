His speech was well received by all of the NPC deputies. First of all, Lu pointed out: Since the breakdown of the Sino-British talks, the work of the PWC has become heavier. The PWC is divided into five groups, i.e. the political affairs group, the economic group, the legal group, the security group, and the culture and education group. For some time now, the five groups have practically held meetings once a month and have initially exchanged views on many issues, but no final conclusions have been made. The political affairs group has concentrated for some time on discussing the formation of the first government and legislative council, as well as the relationship between the executive and the legislature. On the formation of the first government, the first question is the chief executive. Candidates for chief executive will not and should not be discussed by the PWC, so this question has not been discussed at all. What has been discussed is mostly when the chief executive will be chosen. There are two views on whether the chief executive should be chosen sooner or later, and both have logic. Lu said: If a consensus cannot be reached, views will be submitted to the preparatory committee, which will choose. On the formation of the first legislative council, most are inclined to leave the existing 21 functional constituencies unchanged. There are differing views about which the nine new functional constituencies should be. A fairly unanimous view is that China-funded enterprises should be regarded as a functional constituency. The economic group is now divided into four special subgroups, i.e. the new airport issue, financial issues, issue of capital construction in the two places (how capital construction on the mainland and Hong Kong is coordinated), and the retirement insurance issue. The four subgroups are now working separately. The economic group will next study the issue of Hong Kong real estate policy. Prices of land and housing in Hong Kong have indeed reached a level that cannot be sustained by ordinary residents. Ordinary people virtually cannot afford to buy a flat. This is indeed a big problem. The legal group is now examining Hong Kong laws clause by clause. According to the provisions of the Basic Law, the existing laws are basically applicable and will continue to be valid beyond 1997. However, if some laws contravene the Basic Law, the NPC will declare them null and void. Some time ago, the law and order group focused on the right of abode and SAR passport issues. On the question of SAR passports, most people hope they can be issued before 1997 so that people can hold SAR passports to travel or discuss business abroad after 1 July 1997. As for those permanent Hong Kong residents who go abroad to gain foreign citizenship and then return to Hong Kong, Lu said his personal view is that this should be handled in a relaxed manner as far as possible. Specific measures to solve this problem are still being studied. The culture and education group is studying the issue of textbooks. This is because publishing circles want to have the relevant principles laid down early so that they are able to compile textbooks according to these principles and print them for selection and use by 1997.
