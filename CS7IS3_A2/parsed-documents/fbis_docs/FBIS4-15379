Over the last year, the share of the AES's in Ukraine's power engineering rose from 29 to 33 percent. However, unfortunately, alongside this, there also are other kinds of increase. Over 1993, at the Zaporizhzhya AES, for example, there were 79 cases of faulty operation of power units. Among other problems, there is the shortage of funds for purchasing nuclear fuel in Russia. As a consequence, the fuel could only be purchased for three out of five units, at which fuel must be reloaded this year. Specialists of the Zaporizhzhya AES themselves decided to tackle the problem of storing the used fuel directly in the plant's industrial area. A contract has been concluded between the "Zaporizhzhya AES" Production Association and the U.S. company "Duke Power" on constructing temporary dry-storage depots. Today, this is the safest and the most reliable design.
