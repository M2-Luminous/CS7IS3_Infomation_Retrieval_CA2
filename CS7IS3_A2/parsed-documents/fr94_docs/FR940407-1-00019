FR940407-1-00019 FR940407-1-00010 40 CFR Part 52 [LA&hyph;13&hyph;1&hyph;5940; FRL&hyph;4860&hyph;6] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan: Louisiana Emission Statement AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This action proposes to approve a revision to the Louisiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) to include revisions to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) Regulation Title 33, Part III, Chapter 9, General Regulations on Control of Emissions and Emission Standards, Section 919, Emission Inventory. These revisions are for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the ozone nonattainment areas. The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal requirements for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Louisiana. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by May 9, 1994. Comments should be addressed to the contact indicated below. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Mr. Thomas H. Diggs, Chief, Planning Section, at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations. The interested persons wanting to examine these documents should make an appointment with the appropriate office at least 24 hours before the visiting day.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The air quality planning and SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or ``the Act''), as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. The EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''), and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO X Supplement to the General Preamble'')). The EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed in this notice, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July 1992). The Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify 40 CFR part 40 to reflect the requirements of the emission statement program. Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out requirements applicable in marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph (3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements showing actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO X ). This paragraph provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992, establishing this emission statement program. Whatever minimum reporting level is established in a State emission statement program, if either VOC or NO X is emitted at or above the designated level, the other pollutant should be included in the emission statement, even if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs.
