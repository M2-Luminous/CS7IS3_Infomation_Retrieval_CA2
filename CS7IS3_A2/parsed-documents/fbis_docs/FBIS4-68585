Denationalization should be viewed as a process of transition to a variety of ownership arrangements, new forms of economic operations, and entrepreneurship, as a means to bring dynamism to our entire economy by enhancing labor incentives. Why did the trade sector advance to the forefront of privatization, where particularly decisive actions are needed? Because simply no advancement toward a market economy is possible until the system of bureaucratic distribution of the manufactured product is broken down. For many years there was concern about how to distribute "properly," from whom to take things and to whom to give them. It was precisely this system for distributing anything and everything that was one of the pillars of the command economy, and of the shadow economy that complemented it. Time has indicated the intrinsic inability of the state trade sector to provide real incentives to producers, to animate transactions between urban and rural areas, and to stimulate activities in the acquisition of goods. The economy was structured on the basis of the laws of direct distribution, without effective feedback for the entire set of parameters in the national economy. However, the quality of products, abundance of merchandise, and integrity of trade cannot be ensured by dictum but are rather shaped by economic conditions. The customer, the buyer has one eternal inalienable right--the right to choose in the marketplace by "voting" with his wallet. This is an important feature of the political freedom of the individual. At the same time, the distributive system turned out to be a quite costly activity associated with maintenance of a huge apparatus for the distribution of goods at all levels and within all organizations (within planning organs, ministries, soviets at all levels, and so on). It is proper to note that the distributive system is congenitally conducive to abuse, speculation, and corruption. Speculation itself is the blood child of the state monopoly on the production of and trade in consumer goods. It is also exceptionally important that a market economy make it possible for the country to become an integral part of the world economy and take advantage of a division of labor of this kind. To this end, common rules for entrepreneurship, the freedom to trade in goods, a stable currency, and most importantly, a rule-of-law civic society are needed. Along with other measures, privatization of the trade sector is called upon to change the situation fundamentally: to eliminate the administrative superstructure, to usher in competition, and to overcome merchandise shortages which, even if they did not occur naturally, were generated artificially. Shaping a social market mechanism and a free trade sector capable of keeping demand and supply on the market in balance is a means rather than an end. The social role of the trade sector is being enhanced. Defense of consumer interests is the strategic path of its development. Trade is the sector in which the quickest and most radical changes in ownership arrangements and a high degree of privatization can be expected. More than 90 percent of shops and public catering and consumer service enterprises have been privatized in Moscow. This is a lot, considerably more than in any other region of the country. The process of "minor" privatization has become irreversible; apparently, it will be virtually over shortly. As is known, Moscow proceeded to privatize enterprises in the service sector virtually from scratch: There was still no regulatory foundation. Much has been accomplished. It is never easy for the trailblazers. All aspects of "minor" privatization Moscow-style have drawn criticism: what has been accomplished hastily, what has not been accomplished yet, and the manner in which things have been accomplished. Have mistakes been allowed to occur? Yes, they have, and major, fundamental mistakes at that. However, the criticism that is still being leveled is not necessarily well-argued, substantiated, and convincing at all times. There is a lot of extraneous politicking in such criticism. It is written and said that privatization in the sector has accomplished nothing, that trade outlets are "getting fat," and that customer services have deteriorated. We learn by comparison. Let us recall the fall of 1991--complete disintegration of the market, empty stores, humiliating lines, a feeling of hopelessness. There were a great many predictions of famine, cold times, and rebellion. These projections have not come true; the market is being restored. It is an elementary truth that we should proceed from the fact that the daughter (the trade sector) is like her mother (the economy) in order to understand correctly what happened and is happening in the trade sector and to evaluate privatization in a substantiated manner. The trade sector is a snapshot of the condition of society, its barometer. There is no reason to attach hopes to a "correct" barometer when the weather is bad. Past ills and present-day miscalculations afflict the trade sector perhaps more than anything else. Now it is already possible to say that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. His Majesty the Merchandise is the main player in the market. A shortage of consumer goods was a "birthmark" of our entire history when the command-administrative system existed. In terms of theory and practice, dogma was adopted to the effect that consumer demand must continuously outstrip the production of goods and their supply to the population. In short, demand cannot be met under socialism, and the tired word "deficit" is eternal. The notion of "real income" has long become a convention because it is impossible to name a class of merchandise for which demand was met in full. According to approximate estimates, in the prosperous year 1970 (for which some people are still nostalgic) 20 percent of the increment of savings, and in 1978 as much as 53 percent--was generated due to pent-up demand. In the years that followed, the "infusion" of money not backed up by goods became cataclysmic and ultimately finished off the trade sector. The hope that the consumers would be able to buy inexpensive goods, albeit at the price of standing in lines, was less and less justified. Quite a few people could not buy such goods, and the money issued to the population was patently depreciated. The monetary income of citizens consistently exceeded the growth of the total volume of sales and paid services. At the same time, the hidden growth of state retail prices occurred and the quality of goods sold at old prices worsened. This entire shortage of products was not due to the poverty of the country: After all, the country was capable of being second to none in terms of military might. Those were the fruits of a certain choice, of an ideology, in a word--of the implementation of postulates to the effect that, unlike under capitalism, demand here should outpace the production of goods and push it along; such was, allegedly, the advantage of our state. The crisis of the system brought about a veritable free fall of production which made for the most acute shortage. As recently as one to two years ago the shelves of many of our stores were, as the saying goes, a wide open space. Although not everywhere, the counters are now filled with merchandise which the customers hardly saw as being available for unrestricted sale even in better times. Enterprises have appeared which are not inferior to the best contemporary models in terms of saturation with merchandise, techniques and organization of trade, and customer service. The following have become the most characteristic signs: full economic independence of enterprises, direct contacts with suppliers, abandonment of the practice of quota allocation with its paper trails and theft of funds and the time of a tremendous number of employees, and finally the emergence of new stores reaching the level of world standards. Look at GUM [Main Department Store], which recently celebrated its centennial. Its collective has taken the path of creating a world-class trading house. No, this is not an attempt to "sell GUM to foreigners lock, stock, and barrel," as some "specialists" maintain. The purpose is different: The shareholders are searching for and finding partners who will redouble their efforts to organize a modern trade enterprise. Large wholesale and retail associations such as Master-Leader, Olbi, Roditi, Office-Club, and many others have made their presence felt. Joint ventures with many countries are successfully operating in the capital, including the Moscow-McDonald's, the Moscow Pizza, the MOS-Dannone Russian-French joint venture, the Russian-German venture Taki-Moscow, and so on. The old-timer McDonald's restaurant and its two younger "brothers" are particularly popular. Interest in expanding joint commercial activities is apparent not only in the capital but also in other cities. An improvement in the standard of service and the introduction of new technologies--naturally, on the basis of mutual interest and advantage--are the fruits of such cooperation. Would you like to see the stores that are the jewels of the trade sector in the capital city on all scores? If so, visit the Novoarbatskiy Delicatessen and the Tverskoy Delicatessen. They have an extensive assortment of almost all fresh foodstuffs. The stores have been converted to joint-stock format and work without intermediaries. Therefore the proportion of the trade sector in the prices of goods, for example, at the Tverskoy Delicatessen is just over 11 percent--considerably less than anywhere else. Having embarked on leasing four years ago, the enterprise has been building up its sales, which amount to 1 billion rubles [R] per month at present. The delicatessen was paired up with a bank as its co-owner. One more sign: Suppliers from nearby and distant foreign countries trust the store with their goods. Products sold on consignment, that is with settlements with suppliers effected upon the sale of the goods to the population, account for about 30 percent of sales. There are many similar stores. However, there are still more that unfortunately are a pain to behold, which operate on the principle "I do as I please" and trample on the rules of trade. Drunk with the freedom granted and the opportunities for easy and quick profiteering, these trade "outlets," if you will, practice abuse, taking no care of their own development. One customer in two is cheated on weight or change at such enterprises. They often sell inferior quality foodstuffs or even those that pose a health risk. Of course, such are the drawbacks, and we will restore order in this area. However, let us go back to privatization. The picture would be lamentable at present had Moscow not hastened to make this effort and was still receiving goods in keeping with the "plan" and allocated "quotas." State deliveries which were planned last year and at the beginning of this year have, as the saying goes, failed miserably. The capital city received, and still receives, less than one-half of the promised deliveries. About 55 percent of the foodstuffs used by Muscovites have been purchased and already shipped in by new entrepreneurial structures. Almost 100 percent of the products are procured in this manner in the case of many manufactured goods. These are the first fruits of a pick-up in the trade sector, its contribution to provisioning this city of many millions. Let us look at another aspect of the issue--the social structure of sales. It is changing rapidly and quite substantially in terms of ownership arrangements. For the first time, the shoppers of Russia left less money at state trade establishments than at nonstate establishments. At present the former account for just 46 percent. The proportion of private trade comes to 40 percent, and that of consumer cooperatives to approximately 14 percent. Retail trade is the leader in the domestic economy in terms of privatization: At present 40,000 stores, stands, cafeterias, and cafes belong to private individuals. This accounts for just 8 percent and appears to be little. However, this small segment of privatized enterprises has the same volume of sales as the entire state trade, and even more if the sales of consumer cooperatives are taken into account. State shops are inferior in terms of not only merchandise sales but also profit margins: They are 1.5 times greater for private "outlets," and if measured by the effectiveness of outlays (the ratio of profits to the cost of distribution)--twice as large. Of course, retail prices charged by private operators are 1.5 times higher than those in state stores. However, let us repeat that the huge distributive apparatus associated with the practice of quota allocation, the issuance of requisition slips to pick up goods, and so on has been eliminated. As a result, the total volume of sales in 1993 exceeded that in the previous year by 4 percent. Please note that it went up rather than down. The use of food staples in natural units--meat and meat products, eggs, potatoes, vegetables, sugar, and confectioneries--also increased. However, let us be fair: Some problems are being solved, whereas others are at an impasse, and new problems are also developing. As a rule the former state and municipal enterprises have privatized in the capital city in the form of the property of labor collectives. At present, only 30 percent of them have sale-and-purchase contracts and certificates of property rights. This means that almost two-thirds of privatized enterprises are "suspended" between the earth and the heavens, between being state-owned and being private. Virtually not one of them has a legally valid land-use document (for the place where the trade outlet is located). Therefore, on one hand, most stores are listed as having owners while, on the other hand, their collectives, strictly speaking, act as hired labor. Naturally, such "owners" do not take the risk of investing funds in sales expansion and development of their physical plant. Their interest lies in pumping profits into their own wages as quickly as possible. Regulatory documents permit only two types of sales--at auction and through "rigid" competition in the form of tender by invitation. However, other more efficient techniques are known in world practice, for example, directed sales to those who will offer better conditions for the operation of a trade outlet rather than to the one who pays more. As we see it, it is feasible to incorporate a new notion into the state privatization program: public bidding with fixed conditions. This would become a formidable obstacle to those fond of behind-the-scenes deals. We can say that at present the most effective forms of sale fall outside the domain of our operations. Incidentally, it is worthwhile to mention that in the relatively well-to-do East Germany plants were frequently sold at the conventional price of... 1 mark, against an investment commitment. The federal government spent tens of billions of marks to upgrade enterprises to be sold instead of lapsing into rosy dreams about some kind of fabulous profits from the sale of its own losses. Analysis of the data on the progress of privatization indicates convincingly that enterprises of the former state trade sector are increasingly becoming the collectively shared property of the labor collectives. Such enterprises include the largest department stores, restaurants, shopping centers, self-service stores, and wholesale warehouses. Despite the short duration of operation after privatization, many of them have proven that, having become owners, they operate successfully and compete against private operators and commercial structures, retain the specialization of enterprises, boost sales volumes, and enhance the level of social guarantees for employees. Statistics that reflect the choice of a particular mode of privatization also merit some thinking. Auctions have not become very widespread, despite support for them from an unceasing propaganda campaign. To this day the practice of buying out leased property is favored, especially in the sphere of retail trade. On one hand, this is a concession to the interests of labor collectives. On the other, this is a statement of fact: Real competition in the market of trade-sector property is absent. It turns out that actually it is not all that easy to find other owners who are prepared to invest their money in primitive counters and dilapidated buildings with an engineering "filling" that has long since become obsolete. We cannot fail to notice a sad fact--a sharp slowdown in the development of the material and technical facilities of the sector. Auctions are the most common form of sale, but not the only one. An opportunity to conduct competitive sales is envisioned. The advantages of holding a competition are obvious. At issue are primarily the interests of the population. One owner will open a disco bar instead of a bakery, while another would also open a bakery at the Bread store. Besides, retention of specialization (commodity mix, level of sales, services) for three years is a compulsory condition for competitions. These commitments must be included in the contract during the subsequent resale of the facility if such occurs before the end of the three-year term. Unfortunately, "minor" privatization has its own problems, too. Profits received by trade enterprises do not ensure their financial stability. According to various calculations, the amounts of withholdings reduce eventual profits by one-half. Subsequent payments to the budget and the payment of numerous taxes and fees reduce the remaining one-half by that much again. The residual, which, as is known, is not necessarily "sweet," is very small: It is not even enough to buy merchandise. The federal budget does not envision funds for the existence of trade enterprises. Local organs of power are their only hope. The need for investment is vast in the trade sector. As it is, the spontaneous winding down of its material and technical facilities is underway. For example, in 1992 the number of stores fell by almost one-fourth. Support from the state is vital in the course of a transition to market relations, especially at the initial stage. For example, the upstart traders in foodstuffs are exempt from the turnover tax and the profit tax for two years, and those selling manufactures--for one year. Let us sum up what has been said. Privatization of the trade sector in Russia, including that in Moscow, is without precedent as to scale and not comparable to the experience of any other country of the world, even if we look at the enormous technical difficulties with its forms, the voucher system, and the appraisal of facilities to be privatized and their assets. The privatization program approved by the Supreme Soviet of Russia accords unjustifiably great preferences to labor collectives. Obviously, it hardly makes sense to change the rules of privatization while it is in progress at the risk of triggering major social conflicts. Apparently the current stage of privatization must be completed and the rules should be perfected gradually by mutual accord rather than by way of someone's dictate. The main difficulty is found in the fact that property has already been distributed, but active control over it by the new owners is absent. In this instance the role of both the management and the labor collectives is overstated. Therefore, the task is to create effective owners, and to devise rules and procedures for the redistribution of property, a system counteracting all attempts at squandering property. It is important to accomplish a transition from a system of handing out property almost free of charge to the sale of property, from unconditional privatization to privatization predicated on additional investment and conditions that protect consumer interests and rights. It is now equally significant to reinforce the accountability of those who buy privatized enterprises. The conditions of the purchase-and-sale contracts must be strictly complied with in this instance. To this end, contracts should envision all the necessary conditions for exemplary services to the population, and effective forms of monitoring compliance with them and harsh sanctions for violating such conditions should be envisioned on our part. The trade sector is called upon not just to sell goods. Serving customers in an exemplary manner is an equally important task. The lofty mission of the trade sector is to serve the people. This is what the meaning of privatization in the trade sector is all about.
