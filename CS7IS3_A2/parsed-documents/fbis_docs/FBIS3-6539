Sadatoshi Ozato, parliamentary strategist of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), spurned a demand made by his coalition counterpart Koken Nosaka to end the weeklong boycott of business at the House of Representatives Budget Committee, the sources said. Nosaka, chairman of the Diet Administration Committee of the Social Democratic Party, the largest force in the seven-party coalition, urged the LDP to put an end to its parliamentary walkout and rejoin deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget, they said. Debate on the 73.08 trillion yen budget is already two months behind and compilation of a stopgap budget to cover government outlays for the initial 50 days of the new fiscal year starting April 1 is now unavoidable. The LDP refuses, however, to budge unless Hosokawa agrees to submit documents that back up his assertion that he repaid a 100 million yen loan from a scandal-ridden trucking firm, they said. In past Diet sessions, Hosokawa has repeatedly said he took out the loan to help finance repairs on his residence in Kumamoto Prefecture and later repaid the loan to the Sagawa Kyubin network of trucking and parcel-delivery companies. On Friday, the LDP established a panel of legislators to investigate the premier's loan scandal, naming former International Trade and Industry Minister Hikaru Matsunaga as its chairman. The party says the money was actually an unreported political donation. LDP President Yohei Kono said, "the premier should take the initiative in clearing up suspicions over the loan issue, as the essence of political reform lies in alleviating public distrust in politics." Hosokawa told reporters at his official residence, "I have submitted to the Diet documents that can be submitted." "As I have responded (to the opposition's questions) on the issue very honestly, it is difficult to comply (with further demands for documents on the loan)," he said. Hosokawa also voiced reluctance to agree to the opposition's demand that his former Secretary Masatoshi Miyama testify before the Diet on the loan affair. "I question the wisdom of summoning private citizens to the Diet as witnesses. We have to refrain from setting such a precedent," he said. With the two sides adamant in their positions, next week's Diet session is expected to be contentious. "We will undergo very strained Diet business from next week," Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chief of the LDP's Political Reform Headquarters, told a meeting in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. "The LDP will continue to proceed for the time being by linking the submission of the documents and summons of witnesses" to starting deliberations on the budget, he said.
