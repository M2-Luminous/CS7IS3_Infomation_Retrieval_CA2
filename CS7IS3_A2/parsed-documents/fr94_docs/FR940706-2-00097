If judged irrelevant, the applications are returned to the applicants. Applications that conform to the requirements of this program announcement will be reviewed and evaluated against the criteria specified in No. 6(b) of this announcement and evaluated by Federal and non-Federal personnel. The results of this evaluation will assist SSA in selecting the applications to be funded. 5. Application Approval Grant awards will be issued within the limits of Federal funds available following the approval of the applications selected for funding. The official award document is the ``Notice of Grant Award.'' It will provide the amount of funds awarded, the purpose of the award, the budget period for which support is given, the total project period for which support is contemplated, the amount of grantee financial participation, and any special terms and conditions of the grant award. 6. Criteria for Screening and Reviewing of Applications (a) Screening Requirements. In order for an application to be in conformance, it must meet all of the following requirements: (1) Number of Copies: An original signed application and two copies must be submitted. Five additional copies are optional and will expedite processing of the grant application. (2) Length: The narrative portion of the application (Part III of form SSA&hyph;96&hyph;BK) must not exceed 20 single- or 40 double-spaced pages, exclusive of resumes, forms, etc., typewritten on one side only using standard size (81/2 ’ ’ × 11 ’ ’) paper. Applications should neither be unduly elaborative nor contain voluminous documentation. (3) Non-Federal Contribution (Match): Grant recipients must contribute towards the project costs (cash or in-kind). Generally, 5 percent of the total costs is acceptable. SSA will not provide 100 percent or total funding for any project grant. (b) Evaluation Criteria. Applications which pass the screening process will be reviewed by at least three individuals. Reviewers will score the applications, basing their scoring decisions on the criteria shown below. An unacceptable rating on any individual criterion may render the application unacceptable. Consequently, applicants should take care to ensure that all criteria are fully addressed in the application. Relative weights for the criteria are shown in parentheses. (1) Project Objective: (25 points) How closely do the project objectives fit those of the announcement? Is the need for the project discussed in terms of the importance of the issues to be addressed? Does it describe how the project builds upon previous research? What is the potential usefulness of the anticipated result and expected benefits to the target groups? What is the potential usefulness of the proposed project for the advancement of scientific knowledge? (2) Project Design: (30 points) Is the design of the project adequate and feasible as indicated by the appropriateness of the work statement and the technical approach, including: (a) a concise and clear statement of goals and objectives; (b) theoretical analysis of the problem and, if appropriate, hypotheses to be tested and/or parameters to be estimated; (c) specification of data sources; (d) plan for data analysis, including appropriateness of statistical methods to be used; and (e) scheduling of tasks and milestones in the progress of the project? Does the proposal describe specific plans for conducting the project in terms of the tasks to be performed, and how the approach proposed will accomplish the project objectives?
