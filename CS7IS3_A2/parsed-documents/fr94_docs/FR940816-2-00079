FR940816-2-00079 FR940816-2-00059 (x) The provision of employment opportunities that are an integral component of a community's strategy to promote spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income and minority families; (xi) The provision of assistance to business(es) that operate(s) within a census tract (or block numbering area) that has at least 20 percent of its residents who are in poverty; or (xii) Other innovative approaches that provide substantial benefit to low-and moderate-income persons. (4) Quality of the plan_(up to 45 points). HUD will consider the quality of the plan, including but not limited to the extent to which the applicant's proposed plan for the EDI grant/Section 108 loan guarantee will address its described need in the applicant's immediate community and/or its jurisdiction, and the extent to which the plan is logically, feasibly, and substantially likely to achieve its stated purpose. (5) The capacity or potential of the public entity to successfully carry out the plan_(up to 15 points). This may include factors such as the public entity's performance in the administration of its CDBG program; its previous experience, if any, in administering a section 108 loan guarantee; its performance and capacity in carrying out economic development projects; its ability to conduct prudent underwriting; and its capacity to manage and service loans made with the guaranteed loan funds or EDI grant funds. (6) The extent to which the proposed plan follows a comprehensive and coordinated approach in addressing the community and economic development needs of the public entity and furthers neighborhood revitalization_(up to 20 points). (7) Innovation and creativity_(up to 20 points). The extent to which the applicant incorporated innovation and/or creativity in the design and proposed implementation of the proposed activities carried out with Section 108/EDI funds. HUD, in its discretion, may choose to award EDI assistance to a lower rated approvable application over a higher rated application in order to increase the level of geographic diversity of grants approved under this part. Timing of grant awards_In most cases, EDI grants will be obligated contemporaneously with HUD approval of the related Section 108 loan guarantee commitment. However, the EDI grant may be awarded prior to HUD approval of the Section 108 commitment if HUD determines that such award will further the purposes of the Act. EDI funds shall not be disbursed to the public entity before the issuance of the related Section 108 guaranteed obligations. III. Technical Assistance To the extent permitted by law, HUD may advise applicants of technical deficiencies in the EDI applications and permit them to be corrected. Due to the requirements of the HUD Reform Act, HUD staff is limited in the assistance it is permitted to provide regarding applications for EDI grants. The assistance and advice that can be provide includes such activities as explaining and responding to questions about program regulations, identification of those parts of an application that need substantive improvement, the dates by which decisions will be made and procedures that are required to be performed to process an application. This term, however, does not include advising the applicant how to make those improvements. In addition, any information published in the Federal Register and in this NOFA and any information that has been made public through a means other than the Federal Register or NOFA, may be discussed. HUD staff will be available throughout the EDI application period to provide extensive advice and assistance, as is currently provided, to develop 108 loan applications since the 108 program is not subject to the HUD Reform Act. Staff providing such assistance may provide technical advice to the EDI selection panel but in no case will such staff participate in the panel's voting process for EDI awards under this NOFA. IV. Other Matters Environmental Impact. A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410. Federalism. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that this NOFA will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship with the Federal Government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government. While the NOFA offers financial assistance to units of general local government, none of its provisions will have an effect on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or the States' political subdivisions. Family. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the policies announced in this NOFA would not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being within the meaning of the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies and programs will result from issuance of this NOFA, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities. The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel. Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. HUD's regulation implementing section 13 is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. Appendix A of this rule contains examples of activities covered by this rule. Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD Office. Dated: August 10, 1994. Andrew Cuomo, Assistant Secretary for Community, Planning and Development. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19981 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;29&hyph;P
