Some experts are asking why the prosecutor general was not given these intelligence reports before the communique was issued by the Higher Council of National Security and Defense. Here is a report by Miriam Ortiz: [Begin Ortiz recording] The Security Council based its decision on intelligence reports to prohibit the transfer of some Medellin Cartel members to the maximum security section at the Itagui prison. According to authorities, Carlos Alzate Urquijo, a.k.a. Arete, is Roberto Escobar's successor. After the attempt on his life, Roberto Escobar, a.k.a. Osito, delegated to Arete all of the functions he inherited from his brother Pablo Escobar. Roberto Escobar did this because he felt that with Alzate's leadership qualities, his family ties, and the respect he commands among his cohorts, there was no one better than Alzate to recover lost ground, prevent front men from taking over their properties, and prevent the dominance of the Cali Cartel. According to intelligence reports, Arete is followed in the hierarchy by Luis Carlos Aguilar Gallego, a.k.a. Mugre; Jose Fernando Posada, a.k.a. Jaime Eduardo; and Gustavo Adolfo Arrula [name as heard], a.k.a. Maxwell. The intelligence reports add that there is proof of links between the Medellin Cartel and the guerrilla groups based in Antioquia Department, especially with the Urban Militias led by the ELN [Army of National Liberation]. According to a statement by Pipe Perez [not further identified], Alzate Urquijo was the direct contact between the cartel and guerrilla leaders. The state intelligence agencies also report that Otto [Ottoniel Gonzalez Franco] and Popeye [John Jairo Velasquez] have, for the time being, moved out of the organization's spotlight and now want to make peace with their enemies.
