When other CDU [Christian Democratic Union] politicians were still demonizing the alternative party as a threat to democracy and to Germany as a business location, the former secretary-general of the CDU, in his book "Zeitsignale," was already openly paying respect to the Greens: "Most likely it is precisely the radicalness of thought, this willingness to talk about the need for compromise only when the need has become evident and the idea as a whole appears to be unimplementable otherwise, which is the main reason for the attractiveness of this party among young people." Nor does the CDU free-thinker want to exclude a party such as this. In specific cases, he even sees proximities as far as content is concerned. And among the Greens, as well, Biedenkopf is one of the few conservatives who is held in high regard. Also within the alternative party, the politician [Biedenkopf], who, after all, was advocating the renunciation of the growth ideology before the Greens came into existence as a party, is a much sought after discussion partner. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that a black-green coalition following the Landtag election on 11 September is being discussed in Saxony, of all places--a land governed by Biedenkopf with an absolute CDU majority since the fall of 1990. The only thing surprising about this is that it is the Greens who are the driving force. While at the Federal level it is CDU politicians, above all, such as Environmental Minister Klaus Toepfer, for example, who are playing out the black-green card, albeit without having to take a trick with it, Biedenkopf is more laid back. He does, to be sure, in this or that meeting with journalists in Bonn, drop a hint that such a coalition would indeed have a certain amount of appeal, but officially he is "only amused" by the discussion. The reason for this is that the minister-president of Saxony is simply pinning his hopes untiringly on gaining an absolute majority--despite a headwind from Bonn and despite poll results, which give his CDU around 40 percent in the free state. Things are different with the Greens. Werner Schulz, representative of the Bundestag from Leipzig and whip of the Alliance 90/Greens group, has been beating the drums for months for "the enticing project." Although "the CDU is not exactly our dream partner," thus Schulz during an interview with the Berlin WOCHENPOST, "from the point of view of the creative possibilities, the science of colors really is different here in Saxony." While at the federal level no commonalities can be made out, he believes that he can "see first signs for a cooperation with the CDU" in land politics in Saxony. And it is unlikely that they are more than just first signs. Also in Saxony, there is more that separates the Greens and the CDU, contentwise, than what links them. It is true that, with issues which Biedenkopf views as especially important, the Greens are often closer to the CDU free-thinker as far as content is concerned than are his own party friends, particularly those in Bonn. This is always the case, for example, whenever "Wossi" [i.e. both Wessi and Ossi] Biedenkopf wants to discuss the future status of pet West German possessions. And so Heiko Weigel, chairman of the Greens party in Saxony and a Schulz supporter, "agrees in some ways" with Biedenkopf's ideas on the dismantling of the state administration system, the privatization of public services, and the reorganization of the social security system. In the domestic and education policy areas, however, which carry much more weight at the political land level, also during possible coalition negotiations, the CDU and the Alliance/Greens are worlds apart in the free state as well. The fact that, despite this, Schulz repeatedly calls on his party's land organization to support the black-green option has a lot to do with east German peculiarities and federal-level political considerations. Schulz sees the influence of the Greens dropping dramatically in the Bundesrat, now that the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] is able to rule alone again in Lower Saxony and the traffic-light coalition in Brandenburg has collapsed. According to Schulz, the Greens must "avail themselves of every opportunity" to increase their importance again in that body. He also feels that, with a black-green alliance at the land level, the status of CDU reformers at the federal level, such as former Secretary General Heiner Geissler, Environmental Minister Toepfer, or Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth, would be strengthened, and the Union parties' course to the right that caucus leader Wolfgang Schaeuble is pursuing could in this way be stopped or at least weakened. In the persons of the Saxon CDU reformers gathered around Environmental Minister Arnold Vaatz and Social Affairs Minister Hans Geisler, whose political molding process took place during the eruption period in the fall of 1989, Schulz sees possible alliance partners who could also make possible the success of a black-green coalition. There is no denying that the Christian Democrats in the free state are "an unusual conglomeration, personnelwise, the likes of which one finds nowhere else in Germany," Schulz says. There are in fact sympathies for the Alliance/Greens within the Saxon CDU, which on the one hand, as in Vaatz's case, stem from old attachments in the GDR opposition, and which find their definition above all in the mutual rigorousness with which the critical reappraisal of the GDR's past is conducted. Joining them are unorthodox CDU members in the west who are mourning the "missed opportunity" for a black-green coalition in Baden-Wuerttemberg. Interested also are CDU politicians such as [landtag] caucus leader Herbert Goliasch, who will see their influence grow in the event Biedenkopf does not govern in a grand coalition together with the SPD but instead only with a smaller and less influential partner. Schulz realizes that the black-green color games could make or break the land organization of the alternative party, but this apparently does not bother him. The Greens in the free state are hyperpragmatic to a man, to be sure. But an alliance with the CDU would not automatically be approved by a majority even among the 1,200 party members in Saxony. At the grass roots, the fact that Biedenkopf, contrary to initial assurances, does not think much of a politics of "round tables," is deeply ingrained. The Alliance 90/The Greens, who see themselves as the legitimate heirs of the civil rights movement in the GDR, would like to have been involved to a greater extent. And Schulz knows, therefore, that the Greens "cannot permit themselves to be sold for peanuts" in a possible governing alliance. At the Federal level of the Greens, the kaleidoscope of colors in Dresden is being followed without any great excitement. Hessen's environmental minister, Joschka Fischer, allegedly has no objections to an experiment such as this in "faraway Saxony." And his close associate Hubert Kleinert saw the value of such reflections already in connection with the exploratory talks on participating in the government in Baden-Wuerttemberg: "It brought the ecology party a sizable increase in public support." However, and of that too Kleinert is convinced, the lack of emotion with which the party's grass roots accepted the sounding-out talks following the landtag election in April 1992 would have "changed abruptly during a serious alliance discussion."
