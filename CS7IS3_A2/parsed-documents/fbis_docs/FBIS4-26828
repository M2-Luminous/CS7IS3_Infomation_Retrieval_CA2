These remarks run counter to historical facts, disregard the principles of international law, and completely conflict with the aspirations of compatriots on the two sides of the strait for the reunification of the motherland. As everyone knows, state sovereignty can be neither divided nor shared. Therefore, the PRC is the sole legitimate government representing the entire Chinese people and Taiwan is a province of China. This is a fact generally recognized by the international community. Li Teng-hui's attempt to use the view of a "division of sovereignty" to mislead the public and to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" can only be a vain one. Last year, the Taiwan authorities conducted activities around the world aimed at "dual recognition" in an attempt to force the question of discussing Taiwan's UN representative onto the agenda of the UN General Assembly, and openly declared that they had to pursue the "two Chinas as a phase" policy, but they only came to grief in the end. Since the beginning of the year, Taiwan leaders have been all the more unscrupulous in successively using "vacation diplomacy," "in-transit diplomacy," and "dollar diplomacy." All these activities only ended up with fruitless trips to and fro. Therefore, they lamented that "sovereignty is a dangerous word" and then changed to promoting "sovereignty rests with the people" instead, in an attempt to avoid the "legitimate central government," which is crucial to determining where sovereignty rests. They use the separation of the people between the two sides of the strait as an excuse to split state sovereignty in order to achieve the goal of splitting Taiwan from the mainland. Following the advocacy of such views as "one country, two governments," "political entities on an equal footing," and "two Chinas as a phase" by a small number of people in Taiwan, including Li Teng-hui, they have now put forward the "view of a division of sovereignty," repeating the old trick in a new way. Their real intention is to obstruct the process of the motherland's peaceful reunification so as to build a "small royal palace" in a peaceful corner. Safeguarding the unity and integrity of national sovereignty and promoting the realization of the reunification of the motherland are in the fundamental interests of the entire Chinese people as well as the common aspirations of compatriots on the two sides of the strait. Will one not bring disgrace and ruin on oneself if one acts against this great trend?! Taiwan leaders should have a clear understanding of the situation and should not continue to slide down the path of splitting the country and splitting the nation.
