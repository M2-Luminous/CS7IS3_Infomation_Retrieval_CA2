Fierce battles are going on in the governorates of Lahij and Aden, close to the economic capital. At the same time, heroic resistance is taking place against the aggression on land, by sea, and in the air in the Abyan Governorate, where the Armed Forces secured absolute control the day before yesterday. In the Aden Governorate, the al-'Amaliqah Brigade and the 2d Armored Brigade, along with the 2d al-Sa'iqah Brigade and the 56th Brigade, are continuing their advance and confronting the remnants of the forces of the secessionist, rebellious gangs entrenched in the east and north of the governorate, engaging them capably and bravely, positively absorbing all attacks and wearing out the aggression forces. The 2d Armored Brigade also managed to storm the defenses of the first and second lines of the forces deployed in the al-Dali' District, held by the forces of apostasy and secession, and seized large quantities of their weapons and military equipment, which were [word indistinct] by the secessionist forces that held sway in the Yemeni Socialist Party in secret depots and hideouts in this district to guard against their implementing their aggressive goals and their special designs. A large number of the forces that were positioned in that district joined the forces of Yemeni unity and constitutional legitimacy. A substantial amount of the ammunition and combat equipment was also destroyed. The land-based anti- aircraft guns managed to down an aircraft of the secessionist gang in the al-Dali' district this morning. In the meantime, the Air Force of Yemeni unity and constitutional legitimacy continues its attacks on the dens of apostasy and secession, completing its combat missions and [word instinct] the secessionist gang with complete collapse. Our aircraft returned safely to base, having accomplished their set missions. The fighters of the units stationed in the southern sector succeeded in storming the defenses of the first line of the [name indistinct] Brigade, that was misguided by the mutinous secessionist gang, inflicting on it heavy losses. The heroes of the brigades of al- Wahdah, the infantry, the artillery, and the armory executed the missions to which they had been entrusted with efficiency and high combat ability in the [name indistinct] district. The source described as baseless the reports propagated by the false separatist media and certain radio stations that Sanaa was the target of air raids this morning, adding that the objective of the statements and reports of the separatist rebellious gang on this and other nonexistent battles waged by units that were destroyed, units that surrendered, and units that joined the legitimacy and announced their loyalty to this legitimacy is to obscure the facts. These units are today receiving instructions from the higher political and military leadership represented by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. All the lies of the forces of apostasy and secession are aimed at deluding external public opinion into believing that they still exist in order to repeat their falsehood and lies, which are rejected by the facts on the ground and by the victories [words indistinct] the epic of great victory for unity, democracy, and entrenching constitutional legitimacy. There is also the victory of wellbeing and justice in the battle of life in which every citizen is participating with his heart, mind, and solidarity. For the officers and noncommissioned officers, this battle is greater than all else because it is the battle of the sacred defense of life, principles, doctrine, and the gains of homeland and people. In this battle, they are confronting all challenges of conspiracy, death, and fragmentation that the despotic elements of apostasy are [word indistinct] until they were defeated, or will be defeated soon. What affirms their frustration and failure is the fact that -- thanks to God's care -- all the [name of missiles indistinct] and Scud missiles, which these criminal forces fired last Thursday [5 May] on [words indistinct] vital and strategic facilities, failed (?to reach their targets) or to inflict any losses in the areas in which they fell. Some of them were even damaged in the air. We reiterate the appeal to the brother officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers in the military units under the control of the separatist clique to wake up and to free themselves from the dictatorship of the dominating elements in the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] to save their lives, because they will not be above the law or stronger than the anger of the people against their enemies [words indistinct] the enemies of unity, freedom, and democracy, because our valiant Armed Forces, which offered severe sacrifices, are determined to destroy all dens of treason and separatists one after another. Success comes from God. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you will aid the cause of God, he will aid you and plant your feet firmly.
