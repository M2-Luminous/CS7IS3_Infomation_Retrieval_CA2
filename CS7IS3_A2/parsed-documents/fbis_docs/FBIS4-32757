"I received the motion on the matter from (Finance) Minister (Grzegorz) Kolodko and it is him who should be asked," the prime minister told a press conference during his visit to Opole province. He added that the two dismissed deputy ministers would be able to continue their work in the public administration on other important posts, maybe in the economic sector. Asked to comment on the decision of the Union of Labour (UP) to be in opposition to the present government, Pawlak said this changes nothing in parliament. "Every party has its own strategy. If the UP had wanted the government to carry out a more leftist programme, it should not have withdrawn, but got engaged," Waldemar Pawlak observed. The UP accused the ruling coalition of shifting its policy towards the right. The prime minister also met on Monday with members of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) in Opole. Pawlak, who is PSL leader, asserted the PSL activists that the "Strategy for Poland" economic programme for the years 1994-1997 ensures the revival of the countryside and its development. The premier did not, however, reveal details of his own strategy for the agriculture due to the presence of journalists. "The conversation is being controlled. I will speak in general then. Our strategy means being present and participate in changes in all fields," he said. Earlier in the day, the prime minister opened the Opole provincial telecommunications centre. Its inauguration ended the first stage of modernising telecommunications network in the province carried out under a government contract with the South Korean Samsung firm. The contract worth 50 million dollars will make it possible to launch 150,000 telephone numbers, in the first two months - 100,000 numbers. At the moment, the Opole region has the smallest number of telephone subscribers. The opening ceremony was also attended by Communications Minister Andrzej Zielinski and Korean Ambassador to Poland Chong Kae-ok. Also on Monday, Waldemar Pawlak promised governmental support for building the "South" refinery-petrochemical complex in Kedzierzyn- Kozle, Opole province. The talks on this topic with foreign contracting parties will start on Tuesday.
