He is the leader, even though he is jailed. Luis Nascimento reports. [Nascimento] This is how the document reelecting Xanana Gusmao ends: on the mountains of the Maubere [Timorese] motherland, on 23 March. The document is signed by commander Konis Santana and Laren Sabalaio, the secretary of the resistance's clandestine front. It is a solemn declaration that almost ignores the fact that Gusmao is behind bars. Ramos Horta [resistance leader abroad], told Lusa that he welcomed this symbolic reelection because it is justified by the current political situation. Xanana had been deposed by his comrades after his arrest. Ma Huno replaced him but was himself captured shortly thereafter. The resistance said that it had deposed Xanana because it did not want to create any problems for him before and after his trial. This reelections points to the idea that Xanana might be seen as the new Nelson Mandela of the 90's --a human rights activist jailed by a ferocious dictatorship.
