This follows from intelligence reports for the Federal Government that were discussed at the cabinet meeting on 8 June, the newspaper writes. "There is the serious danger that criminal organizations could try to blackmail states by using such highly toxic radiation material. Therefore, it is time for us to act," the tabloid quotes Minister of State in the Chancellor's Office Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union) as saying. According to BILD AM SONNTAG, he also said that Western intelligence services are concerned that Mafia organizations before long could threaten to detonate smaller atom bombs or release highly toxic radiation material. The Federal Intelligence Service (BND) will take part in planned U.S.-Russian cooperation against the nuclear Mafia. Schmidbauer said that BND staff should in the future be permitted by law to examine radiation material or bring such material to Germany for examination. Exact analyses are the prerequisite for assessing and warding off dangers, Schmidbauer said.
