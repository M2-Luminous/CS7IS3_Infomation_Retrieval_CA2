(C) A vessel owner appealing under this part who cannot meet the criteria specified in paragraph (a)(9)(vi)(A) or (a)(9)(vi)(B), but who can establish through credible evidence, or NMFS records, that their vessel completed at least one trip, landing more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops, during 1991&hyph;1992, may fish under the Occasional DAS allocation, pending a final decision on the appeal.

Any such decision is the final administrative action of the Department of Commerce on allowable fishing activity pending a final decision on the appeal. The authorizing letter must be carried on board the vessel while participating in the DAS program. If the appeal is finally denied, the Regional Director shall send a notice of final denial to the vessel owner; the authorizing letter becomes invalid 5 days after receipt of the notice of denial. (b) General scallop permit. Any vessel of the United States that is not in possession of a limited access scallop permit, and that possesses, or lands per trip, more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) and less than or including 400 pounds (181.44 kg), of shucked meats, or the equivalent amount of in-shell scallops (5 and 50 U.S. bushels (176.2 l and 17.62 hl), respectively), except vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for scallops, must carry on board a valid general scallop permit. (c) Condition. Vessel owners who apply for a permit under this section must agree as a condition of the permit that the vessel and vessel's fishing, catch, crew size, and pertinent gear (without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, taken, or landed), are subject to all requirements of this part, unless exempted from such requirements under ยง650.27. The vessel and all such fishing, catch, crew size, and gear shall remain subject to all applicable state or local requirements. If a requirement of this part and a management measure required by state or local law differ, any vessel owner permitted to fish in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive requirement.

The application must be signed by the owner of the vessel, or the owner's authorized representative, and be submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days before the date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective.
