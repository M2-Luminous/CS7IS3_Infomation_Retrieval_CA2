This document confirms Moscow's readiness to continue rendering every possible economic assistance and support to fraternal Kyrgyzstan. During his talks with Akayev, Kozyrev described Kyrgyzstan as one of Russia's closest allies. "I've always said that we are not alien to each other, although many have accused me of imperialism for such words," said the Russian minister. "What can be more normal than stating that we are vitally interested in each other," he said. President Akayev said that the new program was aimed at checking the outflow of ethnic Russians from Kyrgyzstan. He believes that the Russian foreign minister's current visit will help support the industrial enterprises mostly employing ethnic Russians. Akayev also said that the Kyrgyz defense enterprises employing ethnic Russians and their Russian partners should have equal access to raw materials and equipment. "This is not going to be a one-way street," he said. "If large packages of Kyrgyz enterprises' shares go to Russia, these enterprises will carry on, providing thousands of people with jobs," he added. He also thinks that this would enhance ethnic Russians' confidence. As an example of the efforts to raise the ethnic Russians' status he referred to the establishment of a Kyrgyz-Slavic university in Bishkek which is training 200 students. To quote the Kyrgyz president, this university "is expected to calm the Slavic ethnic groups living in Kyrgyzstan, because their children will be able to receive an education in their native language." The program also contains measures to ensure that the teaching of the Russian language, the language of inter-state communication in the CIS, is not reduced. "The Kyrgyz people cannot neglect the great source of Russian culture," said Akayev. He is convinced that only jointly with Russia can Kyrgyzstan solve the problems facing ethnic Russians. "We can solve psychological problems and create an atmosphere of good will," he said. However, on its own Kyrgyzstan will fail to solve the economic aspects of this problem, he concluded.
