The 39-member coalition shadow government, whose composition was published on Tuesday and is to be put before President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, is headed by ex-prime minister Vazgen Manukian, formerly one of the leaders of Ter-Petrosyan's Armenian National Movement and today one of the leaders of the National Democratic Union. National Democratic Union member David Vardanian, head of the parliamentary Foreign Relations Commission, has become the shadow foreign minister. Vagan Oganesian from Dashnaktsutyun, the largest opposition party, has taken the defense portfolio. Ter-Petrosyan's former national security adviser Ashot Manucharian has been appointed interior minister, while the post of industry minister has gone to Karen Demirchian, former leader of the Armenian Communist Party. The cabinet also includes ten members of the present government. "The list is rather inconsistent, but the final version will appear after it is officially presented to the Armenian president," Ter-Petrosyan's aide Levon Zurabian told Interfax.
