The lawyer was picked up for counter-revolutionary offences according to a semi-official news agency. Zhou Guoqiang, 39, was held by public security officers for questioning over a series of alleged anti-government activities, the Hong Kong China News Agency (HKCNA) [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] said quoting sources from relevant departments in Beijing. Unconfirmed reports said three other dissidents were taken away by police in Beijing early yesterday morning, including a Beijing University scholar, Yuan Hongbin, and a Beijing-based labour activist, Qian Yumin. The identity of the other dissident remained unclear. Last night, Shanghai police picked up dissident Bao Ge "for a chat", his family said. The detentions raised fears of a fresh round of persecution of political dissidents to ensure stability as the annual session of the National People's Congress draws near. The action coincides with a series of high-level meetings between senior U.S. official John Shattuck and Beijing officials on China's human rights. It will provide new ammunition for US congressmen who are campaigning for Washington to place greater pressure on China to improve its human rights record in order to secure an extension of its trade privileges. Mr. Zhou is a close friend of Mr. Han, who was leader of the outlawed Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation, formed at the height of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations. Mr. Han, who was prevented from entering China from Hong Kong after his expulsion late last year, claimed last night a large-scale crackdown against dissidents was underway. "Although this is not the first time they have taken Zhou away for questioning...they may have decided to put him behind bars for some time." The unionist said the detention would cause a very bad impact on China's chance of renewing its Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status this year. "I am afraid the Chinese authorities do not really seem to care about the MFN now. It looks like they are rounding up people now so that they can release some when the time comes," he said. The HKCNA report said Mr. Zhou had been involved in "collaboration with hostile forces outside the country" and unlawful anti-government activities incitement and disruption of social order. Mr. Zhou is now the legal adviser at a audio-visual appliances company in Beijing. A member of the federation in 1989, he was detained from June to September that year. He was later freed after showing an attitude of repentance, the report said. But "relevant departments" told the news agency that Mr. Zhou had continued to forge ties with unnamed foreign hostile forces to engage in anti- government activities. It claimed that the dissident convened an unlawful meeting last October to compile an "anti-government article" and then held a press conference for foreign journalists. He was also accused of using an unregistered facsimile machine to send the article to Hong Kong, "creating a bad influence outside China", the HKCNA said. Mr. Zhou joined a group of lesser-known dissidents in publishing a Peace Charter last October, calling for an improvement in human rights and the replacement of one-party rule with a multi-party system. At least three of the nine signatories of the charter have been detained for questioning by police. Only Qin Yongmin remains behind bars. He was sentenced to two years in a reform-through-education camp outside Wuhan earlier this year. According to the HKCNA, Mr. Zhou had organised the production of a large number of "culture T-shirts" emblazoned with slogans. He had planned to distribute the T-shirts during the upcoming congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference annual sessions, it said. According to Mr. Han the T-shirts prepared by Mr. Zhou and his friends mainly carried slogans concerning the labour movement in the mainland and were not for distribution during the congress. "I understand they haven't yet printed those T-shirts. It's still cold in Beijing and they plan to sell them in the summer," he added.
