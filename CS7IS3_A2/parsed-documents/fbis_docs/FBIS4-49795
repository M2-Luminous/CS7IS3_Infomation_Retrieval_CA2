Hui Yongzheng, vice-minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, also said that China is researching and fabricating a new generation of satellites, including the large-capacity No. 3 Dongfanghong communications satellite and the No. 1 multi-use earth resources satellite. He revealed these plans at a news conference concerning the ministerial conference on space applications for development in the region of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, which is to open in September this year in Beijing. The official said that a series of China's Long March carrier rockets has been formed, and the type has been put into general use and become standardized. It has also gone into mass production. "China has recently successfully launched the Long March-3A carrier rocket, indicating the rocket not only can meet domestic demands, but can also provide a wide range of services for the international market," Hui said. He revealed that China has been entering a new stage in launching commercial satellites for foreign customers, with a series of launching contracts being carried out. He said that China will actively import foreign capital, technology and management experience in a bid to speed up the formation of the country's export-oriented space industry. The export of civilian space technology and products will be encouraged. As to China's international cooperation in the space sector, he said that China attaches special importance to developing countries. "China has signed governmental space pacts and key project contracts with Brazil, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Iran and the Republic of Korea," he said, adding that Sino-Brazilian cooperation on the research and production of a resources satellite is going smoothly. China has also trained more than 40 space experts for Ghana, Mongolia, Laos, Malaysia, Tanzania, Pakistan and Vietnam, he said. China each year invests about 400 million yuan in its civilian space projects, he added. Now China's space industry, with 100,000 staff involved, is available for research, design, experimentation and fabrication of various satellites, carrier rockets and other high-tech products. He said that the Chinese mainland wants to promote exchanges and cooperation with Taiwan in the space sector. The mainland is holding a positive attitude towards cooperation in satellite technology, ground systems, launch services and satellite applications. "However, up to now, there has been no substantial progress in space cooperation across the Taiwan Straits," he said. About sending men into space, he said that departments concerned are organizing experts for discussion. But they have to wait for a yes or no from the government.
