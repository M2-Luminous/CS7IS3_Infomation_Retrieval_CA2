FR941013-1-00008 FR941013-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;16&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Aircraft Limited (formerly British Aerospace, Regional Airlines Limited) HP137 Mk1, Jetstream Series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive that would apply to Jetstream Aircraft Limited (JAL) HP137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes. The proposed action would require repetitively inspecting the passenger/crew cabin door handle mounting platform structure for cracks, and, if found cracked, replacing with a structure of improved design as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. Cracks found on this structure on two of the affected airplanes prompted the proposed action. The proposed actions are intended to prevent the inability to open the passenger/crew door because of a cracked internal handle mounting platform structure, which could result in passenger injury if emergency evacuation was needed. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;16&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on JAL HP137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes. The CAA reports two incidents of passenger/crew cabin door handle mounting platform structure cracking.
