On Tuesday the parties adopted a joint statement on the necessity "to abstain from any actions able to aggravate the negotiating process" and "compiled" the agenda; this fact gives the ground for "a restrained optimism." Tajikistan's Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov voiced this statement in his interview with INTERFAX on Wednesday. In his words, "the warming-up" has concluded at the negotiations and "the major process" has started. "We hope for a breakthrough. Tajikistan's political leadership shows appropriate good will to solve all issues constructively," said Olimov. He indicated that Tajikistan's Government "has neither started nor initiated hostilities." "We expect that the armed opposition will demonstrate sound sense and will respond to good will," said Olimov. As he said, three major problems are covered in the coordinated agenda of the negotiations. "These are cessation of hostilities, granting of an additional impulse to the repatriation of refugees, and participation of all `Tajiks' in the constitutional process within the Republic irrespective of their political adherences. We hope for a constructive talk of these partners on these issues. Further negotiations will be devoted to this," said Olimov. He disagreed with the opinion that the delegations of the parties at the negotiations in Moscow "are inappropriately represented." "In any case, Tajikistan's governmental delegation has all necessary authorities and its composition corresponds to the frameworks of the preliminary agreements. As far as the opposition's delegation is concerned, it will participate in the negotiations in a reduced composition," said Olimov. At the same time he underlined that "it is not so important for Tajikistan's leadership who sits opposite but how the responsibility for the reached results will be implemented." "We do not need negotiations for the sake of negotiations. The main thing is that Tajikistan's citizens should feel themselves secure," stressed Olimov. Olimov highly appreciated activity of the Russian Foreign Ministry and of the special representative of the UN General Secretary Ramiro Piriz-Ballon in establishing the inter-Tajik dialogue. "As the hostess of the first round of the negotiations Russia has done its utmost so that they would be held in the atmosphere of constructiveness and the search for mutually acceptable decisions," said Olimov. As he said, it's early to speak about the time and place of the next round of the negotiations.
