A report published by the "Orphan Child Project in November 1993" indicates that the Muslim Brotherhood distributes some 12 million pounds annually. The project, which is reported to be the Muslim Brotherhood' new secret organ, covers 20 governorates, and their expenditures have risen by 300 percent over the last three years. According to the document, which bears the name "The Republic Report," the number of the Muslim Brotherhood's committees increased by 17 during this month. The committees are taking care of 154,043 orphans. Some 121,144 children receive a monthly payment of 10 pounds. The project is being implemented by the Muslim Brotherhood-controlled Shari'ah Society through official channels. Those following up the project said it will allow the Muslim Brotherhood to be associated with some 150,000 children, who will later become sympathizers of the group. [passage omitted]
