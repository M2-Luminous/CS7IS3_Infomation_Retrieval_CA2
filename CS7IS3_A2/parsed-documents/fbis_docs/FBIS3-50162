President Tudjman informed the prefects about the basic outlines of Croatia's policies, especially those conducted over the past couple of days -- the decision on the normalization of relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], and the talks on ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Addressing the prefects, President Tudjman stressed that they were the most important officials in Croatia's state system. Speaking about the historical significance of the present moment, and the decision to go ahead with the signing of the agreement on the normalization of relations with the FRY, President Tudjman underlined that this creates conditions for the fastest possible reintegration of Croatian territories under the protection of the peacekeeping forces, that is, under Serbian occupation, into the constitutional and legal system of Croatia. President Tudjman called on all prefects whose counties border on these regions to contribute to the creation of conditions for the implementation of these policies. [Begin Tudjman recording] As you have seen, the government has already reached decisions on the establishment of telephone links. You have heard [Tudjman laughs] that their [Serbian] representatives themselves said they would agree to the opening of the highway via Okucani [Serb-held town in Slavonia on the currently-unused Belgrade-Zagreb highway] and a railway line. They even mentioned the most sensitive issue -- the opening of the Zagreb-Split railway line via Knin [capital of Serb Krajina]. I will not go to any pains to emphasize this -- since they accept this themselves -- if a citizen of ours can feel free to travel via Knin by train, then the problem is 90 percent solved. If they [the Serbs] and their representatives -- who had boasted about Krajina being an independent state -- if they acknowledge this, then it is obvious that we are getting close to a peaceful resolution. Of course, we should not deceive ourselves into believing that things will go smoothly and we should not completely discount the possibility that we might be compelled to resort to other means. Nevertheless, I believe that we are on the right track, that we have found a way to solve our strategic problem, to liberate every square inch of Croatian soil, and to satisfy the demands of the international community, which had proposed that we refrain from the use of force at all costs. If we were to opt for the armed liberation of the UNPA [UN Protected Areas], the international community would seriously consider the imposition of sanctions. Therefore, those are our interests, those are the demands of the international community, this is a victory for our policy, this accelerates the return of our refugees, this opens up prospects for development in peace. [end recording] [Announcer] Pointing out that we are facing serious tasks at the beginning of this year, President Tudjman called on the prefects to fully cooperate with the Croatian Government. This major political victory should be translated into practice immediately, to the benefit of the Croatian people and the Croatian state, the Croatian president said. At the same time, we are trying to conclude an agreement with the Bosnian Muslims in order to end the war they are now waging against the Croats, with the intention of occupying Croat-populated territories, President Tudjman stressed. [Begin Tudjman recording] As serious people who must be informed, I can tell you that Izetbegovic proposed to me that, he said: Let western Herzegovina be immediately united with Croatia. But, he said, allow us to have central Bosnia -- those areas of central Bosnia which are envisaged to be part of the Croat Republic in the framework of the Union [of Republics] of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But they [Muslims] are undertaking large-scale offensives there. They hoped, even over the Christmas holiday, to conquer these areas -- Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak, Kresevo. But, you see, in these talks we agreed that of these areas, Kiseljak and Kresevo, although these are areas with a majority Croatian population, [they] would remain [as heard] in that Bosniak Muslim republic in order to satisfy international demands that this Bosniak Muslim republic -- in the framework of the Union or independently -- might have the territorial conditions for an independent existence. But we insisted, and we are insisting, that that area of central Bosnia -- Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca -- be part of the Croat republic, or if there is demarcation [between separate states] they could become areas within the Croatian state. [end recording] [Announcer] Noting that this is the beginning of a year that promises to be even more successful than the previous three, President Tudjman stressed that we would realize Croatian state objectives by our consistent policy. In implementing this policy, we must achieve the unity of the Croatian people, President Tudjman said. [Begin Tudjman recording] Let us be consistent in the implementation of state policy, and let us work for the unity of Croatian ranks. There may be political and party differences, but when it is a matter of state interests, there cannot be several policies but one policy. [end recording] [Announcer] Speaking about the success of the Croatian Government in wiping out inflation, President Tudjman said that this provides a basis for faith in future economic development. Analyzing the introduction of a new convertible currency, he recalled that the kuna -- which was the Croatian currency 10 centuries ago, and which will be something to take pride in because the people will know that for the first time in their history they will have their own currency -- is being introduced. Finally, President Tudjman wished the prefects full success in their work for the counties and the whole Croatian state. Also present at the reception were Nikica Valentic, the prime minister of Croatia, Josip Manolic, the speaker of the Chamber of Counties of the Croatian Assembly, and other high-ranking officials of the Republic of Croatia.
