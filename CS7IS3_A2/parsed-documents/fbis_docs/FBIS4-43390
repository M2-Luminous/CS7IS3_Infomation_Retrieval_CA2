Nicola Mancino, PPI [Italian Popular Party] floor leader in the Senate, is not opposed to Forza Italia joining the European People's Party [EPP] group in the European Parliament [EP], but believes that it would be better for there to be a prior understanding between Forza Italia and the PPI. While Pier Ferdinando Casini, encouraged by the CCD's [Christian Democratic Center] election results, is starting to think about the establishment of "a new moderate and modern popular party," the PPI, having gotten past the European elections, is introducing a policy of conditional -- and for the moment only external -- collaboration with Berlusconi. Mancino, explaining that he was speaking in a personal capacity, said: "Membership of a party is one thing, and membership of a parliamentary group is another. I would not oppose membership in the EPP for parliamentarians elected on Forza Italia's lists. The British Conservatives are in it; I do not see why the Italian conservatives should not be in it. However, Forza Italia cannot usurp the PPI's position; there would need to be a prior agreement...." "It seems a reasonable position to me," Buttiglione commented." The PPI's ideologue said: "Forza Italia is not fascist; nor can the National Alliance be described as fascist, plain and simple. A dialogue with the PPI could facilitate those forces' liberation from the vestiges of fascism...." He added: "If I were Kohl, I would ask Berlusconi to explain to me why he governs jointly with fascists or postfascists, rather than with the Popular Party. And, depending on his reply, I would express an opinion on Forza Italia joining the EPP group." Buttiglione, who is convinced that "the defects of Forza Italia will sooner or later turn into opportunities for the PPI," expects that the congress will not be an easy one ("there will be some fists flying, and I hope that none of them hits below the waist.") Rosy Bindi said she is convinced that Buttiglione will not be the next PPI secretary. Meanwhile she is organizing -- together with Giovanni Bianchi, Raffaele Cananzi, and Alberto Monticone -- a conference focusing on Catholic concerns. It will take place on Saturday [18 June]. "Guests" will be given a questionnaire consisting of 10 points. The last is the most difficult: "Do you still have faith in the future of the PPI, and if so, why?" Casini, the "cousin" in the government, issued an analysis that sounded like an appeal: "The elections have shown that there are centrist voters.... We shall have to see whether the PPI congress takes account of this development and expresses a preference for a moderate alignment or whether, on the contrary, it continues to conceal its preference for dialogue with the Left."
