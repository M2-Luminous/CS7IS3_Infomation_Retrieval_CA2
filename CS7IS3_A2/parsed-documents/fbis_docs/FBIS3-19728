[passage omitted] Speaking after his talks with Joe Clark, President Denktas said that he has received a new document, which contains certain changes in accordance with the views and anxieties the Turkish Cypriot side has expressed in the indirect talks. [Begin Denktas recording] Considering the work we have carried out with Mr. Feissel, we informed them that they should brief us on the points they have deemed as important in the talks we have had for so many days. We said that they should do so that we may be able to proceed. So, they have made certain changes to the document. We shall study them and meet again tomorrow. We have been informed that certain changes have been made to come closer to our position. However, we shall make an assessment to establish whether or not the changes will satisfy us. [end recording] A journalist asked the following: Is a deadlock possible at this point? We have asked Mr. Joe Clark this question. He said that a significant rapprochement has been achieved on basic principles. Denktas replied by saying that the new document has to be studied before that question can be answered. Regarding another question, Denktas recalled that the Greek Cypriot Administration has agreed to the establishment of two doors at Nicosia Airport and noted: The customs formalities behind the door open to the Turkish Cypriot side will be managed by Turkish Cypriot officials. Nothing can be achieved if this is not accepted. Denktas said that he has not received an invitation to visit New York and described each day and week in the talks as important. However, he also said that the talks have currently entered a very important week. Asked to comment on how a change in the Turkish Government after the local elections on 27 March may affect the talks in Cyprus, Denktas recalled that the talks are within the framework of Turkey's policy and noted that they cannot be suspended just because of a change in government in Ankara.
