He spoke with the Bratislava reporter of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY about how he envisions his management of the ministry. [Zabojnik] What were the conditions in the ministry when you took it over? [Janicin] I'll repeat what I already said in response to an American journalist's question: What I appreciate about my predecessors is the fact that they did not succeed in alienating or firing all the able people in this ministry. [Zabojnik] Have you also found some things about your predecessors that were on the borderline of legality, or even went beyond it in the feverish privatization before the change of government? [Janicin] They may have been on the borderline, but in Slovakia there is still concern that some residuals may be brought back to life. People are still afraid and do not want to testify on certain matters. For example, I know without a doubt that in the case of the Piestany Spa there existed or still exists a silent partnership agreement concerning two former members of the government and one high legislative official. But I cannot make their names public because they refused to turn over a copy of the agreement to me. [Zabojnik] What would give courage to people who have information not to keep silent and furnish the evidence? [Janicin] I am convinced that after the elections, when it will be clear to everybody that Meciar will not be forming a new government, the evidence will see the light of day. [Zabojnik] As far as methods are concerned, you took over as a kind of legacy the emphasis on employee-owned corporations and more or less a distaste for the voucher system of privatization. What concept do you intend to apply? [Janicin] The management in those enterprises established in some instances the so-called employee-owned corporations. With various promises and sometimes even with pressure they obtained signatures of the other workers in the enterprise. Following the political line of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and later also of the Slovak National Party [SNS] they made every effort to acquire the property. Then in the populist style "sold" it to the employees and these were the famous employee-owned corporations. As far as the voucher privatization is concerned, the method was declared marginal, because according to the HZDS the shares would have been sold below price in view of the weak Slovak resources, and according to that line of thinking foreign capital would easily gain control over the Slovak economy. Therefore, for example according to Mr. Huska, it is necessary to first and foremost enable Slovak entrepreneurs to acquire property in the privatization. I admit that for a certain time even I was, so to speak, blinded by such thinking. But when one ponders this matter, and most of all when one saw how it was being realized in practice, when for example the Vrutky Railroad Repair Shops with a book value of 950 million korunas were to be sold for 120 million to party followers of the HZDS and the SNS, one's thinking necessarily had to change. [Zabojnik] What conclusion do you draw from it for your specific course of action as minister? [Janicin] I came to the conclusion that for Slovakia coupon privatization is at present obviously the quickest method for transforming ownership. Moreover, credit resources here are so exhausted that it would not be logical to use them to change the ownership structure. And there are also the social aspects. Coupon privatization is a certain positive step toward the social sphere. It is also related to the need for political stability in Slovakia, without which we shall not be able to join the developed countries. Therefore we can no longer afford any more experiments a la the HZDS.
