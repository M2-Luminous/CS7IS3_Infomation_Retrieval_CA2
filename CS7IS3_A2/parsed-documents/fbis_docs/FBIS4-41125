Russia and NATO have a significant contribution to make to guaranteeing European stability and security. Constructive relations of cooperation between Russia and NATO, based on mutual respect, advantage, and friendship, are therefore a key element in security and stability in Europe and accord with the interests of all other states in the CSCE region. Russia and NATO welcome the progress that has already been achieved in their relations, including that within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and they will strive to strengthen it further. 2. Russia's signing of Partnership for Peace opens up big new opportunities for the development of relations by means of practical cooperation in spheres covered by the framework document of Partnership for Peace. Russia and NATO have agreed to prepare a wide-ranging, individual program of partnership, in keeping with Russia's size, importance and potential. 3. They have agreed to establish far-reaching Russia-NATO cooperation relations both within and outside the framework of Partnership for Peace. These relations, aimed at strengthening mutual confidence and openness, will develop to reflect common goals and supplement and strengthen relations with all other states. They are not directed against the interests of third countries and will be transparent. 4. Russia and NATO have agreed on broad and in-depth dialogue and cooperation in those areas where Russia can make a unique and important contribution commensurate with its weight and responsibility as a major European, world and nuclear power: -- by exchanging information on security policy problems of European dimension; -- by holding, as required, political consultations on issues of mutual interest; -- by cooperating on the entire range of security issues, including, as required, in the sphere of peace-keeping.
