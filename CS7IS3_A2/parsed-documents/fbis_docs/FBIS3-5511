Nakamura, 44, a House of Representatives member of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is suspected of taking a 10 million yen kickback from leading general contractor Kajima Corp. in January 1992, investigative sources said. Prosecutors applied for a warrant of arrest for Nakamura from the Tokyo District Court. Nakamura has repeatedly refused to voluntarily face questioning, the sources said. The prosecution's request for Diet permission to arrest a legislator is the 15th in the postwar period and the first since a 1967 case involving taxi operators in Osaka and a then LDP member. The cabinet approved the arrest permit issued by the Tokyo District Court. [passage omitted] The lower house will hold a plenary session to decide whether to give the go-ahead to Nakamura's arrest. Prosecutors of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' Office, meanwhile, raided Nakamura's office in Tokyo's Chiyoda ward and the head office of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, a major association of builders, on Tuesday afternoon to search for evidence, the sources said. Prosecutors have also rearrested Shinji Kiyoyama, a former senior vice president of Kajima. [passage omitted]
