Skokov, chairman of the Federation of Russian Manufacturers, by Aleksandr Gagua, under the rubric "Position"; place and date not given: "Manufacturing--the Last Line of Defense of the State: Yuriy Skokov Believes That Less and Less Time Remains To Rescue the Economy"] [Text] Yuriy Skokov, the former first deputy prime minister and subsequently secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, is currently chairman of the FTR [Federation of Russian Manufacturers]. The FTR consists of the League of Assistance to Defense Enterprises, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the Agrarian Union, the Union of Labor Collectives, the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Union of Oilmen, and more than 50 regional associations. The Federation of Independent Trade Unions and the Association of Russian Banks take part in the operations of the FTR on a permanent basis. [Skokov] Let us recall that reform, on whose account many a lance is now being broken, began after everyone came to the conclusion that the conditions of our lives had to be changed, and a new economic foundation had to be laid which would make it possible to guarantee some kind of social opportunity to all strata in a socially more equitable manner. The idea of economic reform appeared at that time. It has now been more than two years since the beginning of the reform was announced. What results have we achieved? Having discussed this problem at a recently held congress of the Federation of Manufacturers, we came to the conclusion that in reality there have been no reforms as such. A process of a kind of rearrangement in economic operations and economic management procedures has occurred in an absolutely spontaneous manner. As a result of this, we have not arrived at anything intelligible anyway. Indeed, we had one system of manufacturing which kept demand and supply, incomes and expenditures, in balance by command and administrative methods, and we wanted to live under a different economic system which would maintain the equilibrium of demand and supply by qualitatively different methods. Interaction should be different under this new system, enterprises should be managed differently. The role of the federal authorities becomes completely different, and the regional authorities get another role. The roles of the collective itself and the enterprise are new; mutual relations between individual participants in the entirety of the production process are different; the nature and principles of investment are different, as are the methods of assessing effectiveness--everything is different. All of these should have emerged in the process of reform. However, different in what sense? To date we do not have an answer to any of these questions. When discussing this topic, we also discussed another one: At present, no government is in a position to correct the situation by acting in isolation, as a separate entity. Processes have gone too far; old possibilities and methods for influencing the behavior of both enterprises and regions have been destroyed. If a reactionary government of some kind suddenly wished to go back, it would be fraught with serious dislocations, just as serious as the current ones. At the same time, if we fail to see clear-cut methods for reform we will be continuously wandering around in the dark, eating away at the national heritage we got from our fathers and grandfathers. At the congress we came to the conclusion that we should not wait for the government to resolve anything. We believe that at present the government is, in principle, not in a position to say how each element in the system should operate. We should do this ourselves. For this reason it was resolved that we should create a self-organizing, self-reforming system, but in cooperation with the government and other federal power structures. We resolved that we would support Chernomyrdin, that at present the head of the government should not be changed. We should help the prime minister and support the government at this difficult stage. Look at the programs of all the parties and movements. There is little difference between them. These are mostly declarations. This is why, no matter what new government comes along, it would hardly be able to put forth a clear-cut program of real actions. We agreed that in supporting the prime minister we will cooperate with the government in searching for solutions to our common problems. I was instructed to meet with Chernomyrdin and bring to his attention everything that we discussed at the congress. We agreed there that manufacturing remains the last line of defense of the state. If manufacturing is ultimately destroyed it will make no sense to talk about reforms because the form which is to be changed will no longer be there, nor will there be any economic foundation for advancement, for ensuring social guarantees, and, most importantly, for preserving statehood and society as such. There will be nothing to talk about as far as the defense of human rights in its broadest interpretation is concerned--that is, the very point in the name of which all reforms began. Therefore, the defense of manufacturers at present is, in essence, the defense of human rights, of society and the state. I brought all this to the attention of Viktor Stepanovich. We discussed possible forms of cooperation and methods of interaction. Our long discussion proceeded in an atmosphere of mutual understanding. We agreed to meet with him after the completion of the procedure of forming the government in conjunction with the appearance of a new parliament and to discuss the details of this endeavor. I would like to note at the same time that the New Regional Policy faction of deputies has been created in the State Duma (I think that about 70 people will belong to it). It is headed by Vladimir Sergeyevich Medvedev, president of the Union of Oilmen--one of the founders of the FTR; Medvedev personally is a member of the presidium of the federation. We want to cooperate with this group in developing and implementing the necessary regulatory acts to ensure the defense of domestic manufacturers. Incidentally, while opening the State Duma, Viktor Stepanovich put forward a thesis concerning support for domestic manufacturing. [Gagua] Many people attribute the recent leap in the exchange rate of the dollar to inflationary expectations associated with the promise of such support. [Skokov] We have gotten used to juggling words to such a degree that we have stopped pondering the essence of what we are saying. Many financial and economic programs have become a topic for politicking individuals attempting to solve their own problems by supposedly discussing financial and economic issues, rather than a subject for a search for professional solutions. As far as I understand it, Minister of Finance Fedorov, who is to a great degree to blame for the country ending up at such an impasse but who is quite ambitious and categorical in his judgments, is engaged in an active struggle with Chernomyrdin because he very much wants to become chairman of the Central Bank (as one of the newspapers justly said recently, he is one of the few ministers who ignore the edicts and decisions of the president, which is impermissible in a normal society). I think that this would bring about a catastrophe. I know Fedorov well; I worked with him in the Silayev government, and I can say confidently that he does not quite understand what the state budget is and does not know how to draw it up expertly. In talking about the exchange rate of the dollar, I would note that the exchange rate emerges in the following manner (this is a somewhat simplified pattern, but in view of the fact that we are talking for a newspaper, let us spend some time on it). My country trades with another country. In order to be able to trade I must have the currency of that country in order to buy its goods. The other country should have my currency to buy my goods. The essence of the exchange rate is found in the relationship of the foreign trade balance of your country to the 10 or 20 countries with which you trade. Indeed, currency markets exist in all countries; however, they appear on the basis of the need to service foreign trade, foreign economic activities, and the exchange rate on these markets evolves depending on the balance. In our last interview I told you that, for example, the gross product of 15 trillion [rubles] in 1992, if converted at the 1:650 exchange rate of the dollar at the time, made it possible to say that we produced a gross product of $23 billion. If we divide this by 150 million inhabitants, it will fall short of $200. This is less than Ethiopia. In terms of volume, it is less than all of our exports--$38 billion--and less than the volume of the natural production of coal, oil, and gas converted to world prices (more than $200 billion). This is what the exchange rate in our country is all about. Until recently, a game was on--systematic currency interventions were carried out (this was done by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance through their institutions) in order to artificially support the exchange rate and thus demonstrate the supposedly favorable state of affairs in our economy. Commercial structures engage in speculation on the currency market because playing on the exchange rates of currencies is the most profitable endeavor at present. All this is a very complicated process, but it has got nothing to do with civilized economics. We do not have regular foreign economic operations, and we absolutely lack a clear notion of the value of our currency against other currencies. This is why I would like to stress yet again that in our country the exchange rate of the dollar has become an instrument of politicos and a subject of very major, large-scale operations. This is a channel and an opportunity to launder dirty money both within our country and in the West, a bridge which may allow the economic expansion of any group from the other side here (time and technique are all it takes). Our rich have become rich not because they have created material production within the country. They purchased in the West, very cheaply, goods which for various reasons were not in demand there and sold them here at sky-high prices. The market is filled with these goods. Meanwhile, there are no domestic goods. In this situation the exchange rate of the dollar indeed becomes a weighty inflationary factor. However, this is an artificial situation, and I would not venture a judgment as to whether it was created out of confusion or purposefully. [Gagua] What do you propose? [Skokov] The FTR has developed quite a number of comprehensive proposals for overcoming the crisis in our economy and rescuing production. For the time being, before our second conversation with Viktor Chernomyrdin, I would prefer not to discuss it. However, after the meeting I will be prepared to share with the readers our plans--if it works out, joint plans with the government. [Gagua] However, support for manufacturers means new credit and, consequently, a new cycle of inflation, does it not? [Skokov] The proposals developed by our federation do not discuss massive injections of state credit. The government and the Central Bank simply do not have that kind of money. The discussion is about a system for interaction between enterprises in the regions and between regions, changes in the tax and, generally, economic environment which would make it possible not to drive up the price of domestic goods and, therefore, to contain the growth of prices for imported products which scares our consumers so much on a daily basis. After all, inflation expressed in the growth of prices is caused by a disequilibrium between supply and demand in the domestic market. The people do not even give a thought to how such inflation is evaluated. A basket of consumer goods is taken, and a price index is established on its basis. For comparison, in the United States a basket of 300 products is used. However, at present 30 percent of the population cannot afford to buy even our basket with 19 products in its entirety. Another 50 percent merely fit within the framework of this basket. At present, we do not have effective demand at all. The entire problem lies in the fact that domestic manufacturing has come to a halt; the market is barren--there are no domestic goods; our manufacturers cannot produce either cheap popular goods or goods competitive on the world market. After all, our economy was so designed that, in the environment of the decontrol of energy and raw material prices, no producer of ours is in a position to manufacture cheap goods. The resource market and the merchandise market have been severed. Meanwhile, in a market economy, this is the foundation for building the model of circulation of products, goods, and profits. [Gagua] In both our country and the West the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov is now being interpreted as a rejection of the reform course, which they symbolized for many people. What do you think about this? [Skokov] I very much regret that in my time I did not succeed in talking President Yeltsin into distancing himself from the government. When he assumed leadership of the government in 1991, he may have been right: It was necessary to "shield" a sharp change in the course with his authority. However, later, in November and December 1991, we had repeated discussions to the effect that the president should not head the government. The government may be changed many times, whereas the president is the head of state and leader of the country. However, it was very advantageous for the people in the government to hide behind the president. They did all they wanted while bearing no responsibility for it. Please recall this: If there is no Gaydar, there will be no $24 billion. So, they retained Gaydar at the Sixth Congress. Did the $24 billion come along? No, it did not. The next slogan was: The presence of these people is a guarantee of reform. However, everyone now understands that there is no way back. There is virtually no one who could say: I want to go back, to the old conditions. Even if they say this, it is just out of desire to regain the lost feeling of confidence, stability, and tranquility. Nobody wants to be ordered about, hurried along, or commanded. [Gagua] What do you mean by economic management? [Skokov] This question cannot be answered briefly or succinctly. Let us recall that previously the entire national economy amounted to something like a huge plant. The government operated on a certain pattern, saying who should produce what and how much, where to ship it, and who would get how much for it. In essence, the director of a plant had the same management structure. The government had the same functional and sectoral subdivisions and reception methods: which shop was to produce and what, and where it was to be built so that it would be able to fit into the general pattern of operation of the huge plant called the national economy. We did not have a regional policy as such because the entire structure of the national economy was patterned on the sectoral principle. Each region had up to 90 percent of purely sectoral enterprises reporting to the Union. When these industrial enterprises received something from on high for their development, the regions also got a cut for social programs. Previously, we had an industrial policy, and regional policy was its appendage. Under current circumstances, now that social responsibility in its entirety has devolved on the regions, regional policy is becoming the centerpiece, and industrial policy must be worked out in a very rigid correlation with regional policy. The sectoral principle for the formation of the economy has almost disappeared. At any rate, the possibility of handing down commands from the top has virtually disappeared. What does manageability of the economy mean? As defined by the originators of the theory of management, management is a command transmitted to the recipient with a view to effectively influencing him. Previously, I could give someone a command because I said in the process: There are so many goods in the oblast; to this end, you will receive this quantity of resources, an opportunity to draw wages and centralized capital investment for the construction, expansion, or upgrading of your plant, and this amount of funds for social facilities. Your region will receive this much. I cannot give commands like this anymore. How can I give an order to some plant? It will respond: Since you are giving me an assignment to manufacture this quantity of products, give me material resources. The government will say: I do not distribute resources at present. We have a market system now. Well, fine, give me credit resources based on 20 percent of the discount rate. The government will say: Of course, but only at 220 percent. But I can buy them at a commercial bank for 230 percent! It makes no difference whether it is 210 or 250. This is short money, which does not make it possible to do anything, to even exist--for a small business or any other. Just yesterday, licenses and quotas were sought. However, at present domestic costs denominated in rubles are so high that, according to the calculations of an institute of the Academy of Sciences, the cost of one tonne of oil in Tyumen comes to $95-96, and this is commensurate with the producer cost of extraction. In addition, there is transportation, taxes, and duties! Therefore, even selling raw materials is becoming unprofitable now. It turns out that only one thing is profitable now--stealing something and selling it. Therefore, the issue of manageability cannot now be restored in its old form. On top of this, regionalization ushered in a different situation whereby the federal government is running into a great many problems in each region. These problems were created by the Gorbachev-Pavlov government in its time when it proclaimed that all social programs should be solved at the regional level. However, the regions should have money and resources for that. Where are the regions to get this? Maneuvering begins, along with attempts to evade taxes, retain a considerable proportion of funds, and thus get an opportunity to influence the behavior of enterprises. After all, nobody knows now what to do about the social infrastructure "burdening" former state enterprises or the still surviving state enterprises. The problem of a transition from centralized management to complete decentralization is becoming fundamental. The war between the federal and regional authorities over whether the budget is to be relinquished or not is a nonsensical war. A fundamentally different pattern for the formation of manufacturing, merchandise-distribution, and financial-support structures should be sought. [Gagua] In other words, you believe that having destroyed the old system, we cannot obtain a new one by betting on it arising out of processes of self-organization? [Skokov] I can repeat my opinion: We cannot leap from one condition to another; it is impossible. We need to build a new system gradually. When I proposed the creation of state intersectoral industrial associations with their withdrawal from ministries in 1987-1988, it was, in essence, a timid attempt to create financial-industrial groups or financial-industrial corporations. At the time, the idea of the first commercial bank appeared; it was devised to be a hub, a center for external investment policy. However, this concept did not gain support. What was the idea of that period? At the time, we had approximately 200 different ministries and departments which turned to the government for particular types of resources. We calculated, proceeding from the number of enterprises and a certain model of such financial-industrial groups, that approximately 300-400 banking structures had to be created which could become the nuclei of financial-industrial groups. A few tens of thousands of industrial enterprises could be assigned to the banking structures for servicing, 10-15 enterprises to each. In this manner it would be possible to evade the direct administrative impact of ministries and to connect to the government directly, while not increasing the number of clients served by the government. They are now trying to revisit this procedure. There is discussion of creating financial-industrial groups or corporations. However, at present financial and industrial capital are isolated. For example, I have money and want to protect it. For this reason, when someone in possession of industrial capital says: Give me your financial capital, and we will unite, I say: Give me no less than 20 percent every month so that I will be able to protect myself against the 240 percent (the discount rate). I cannot do this in principle because, if I begin to manufacture and subsequently sell products, I need at a minimum three to four months, as dictated by technology. That is to say, I will generate profits in three to four months. Besides, taxes are so high that I will be left with nothing. Therefore, it is quite difficult to establish a management structure at present, but there still is a chance, if the government grasps that it should sit down with the manufacturers and agree on how to act rather than apply pressure, give orders, and smash heads. [Gagua] What does the federation you head mean by "protecting the rights of manufacturers?" [Skokov] Let us talk about rights. Yesterday, the right to work was laid down in our Constitution. At present, it is laid down that labor is free. You work if you want to, and you do not if you do not want to. The state guarantees nothing. It merely says that labor is free. How was the right to labor exercised yesterday? The state had the right to assign a plan to its state enterprise, and this plan was balanced. The enterprise received resources in keeping with this plan; however, at the same time it was obligated, having brought in the people, to provide work for them and guarantee the level of wages established by the state. Therefore, the right to labor was exercised through this complex chain. This is not the case today. At present, any director may, in principle, fire even the entire work force. If directors go for it, there will indeed be a social explosion. At present, there is a discussion about our people being patient. However, there has been no explosion also because the old corps of directors, which retains old notions of their ethical obligations and civic duty, is now dodging, hustling, and trying to pay so-called wages while enterprises are virtually not operating. These are not wages but rather unemployment benefits. This is hidden unemployment. The question is: Is the state currently in a position to absorb unemployment, which Fedorov advocates so much, reporting with pride that next year we will have 10 million unemployed? At present, the state does not have a system of unemployment benefits and social protection. After all, in the West this is a complex, well-conceived, and proven system. This is why protection of the rights of manufacturers is a quite difficult issue. What is "the rights of manufacturers" supposed to mean? All Western governments must protect their manufacturers, primarily by either allowing or not allowing outside goods onto the domestic market. The government assists its entrepreneurs in placing their goods on the foreign market through certain procedures, customs duties, taxes, and the like. Meanwhile, in our country the doors are wide open, and domestic manufacturers and the internal market have no protection at all. To be sure, some of our politicians are fond of saying that our people, supposedly, do not work properly, do not do the right thing, and so on. If so, let us ask the people in the government: Do they always do the right thing? What is the measure of their civic and legal accountability--accountability to society and the state for having brought the situation to its present-day condition through unprofessional management? Under the circumstances, why do they consider themselves entitled to tell a manager: You are working poorly? Indeed, he cannot work because these people have created such conditions for him. The environment in which domestic manufacturers find themselves has become hostile. It has become profitable not to work at all. What do powerful enterprises do at present? They lease their premises to real estate brokers in order to sustain their people, paying them hidden unemployment benefits. The people who lease out these premises, in essence selling and redistributing the national wealth, are paid a portion of wages out of the funds taken away from these same people. This is the highest measure of social injustice. Our economy currently reminds me of a cart sitting in the woods. The mare is no longer there, it has run away; the shafts are on the ground, and the cart itself has fallen apart. To be sure, the wheels are still in place. We are discussing the following issue: How are the ruts by which the cart will travel to be deepened? And who will get the cart moving? If it is moved, will this not end up with it falling apart completely? Who will pull it, who will ride in it, who will repair it as it moves, and, generally, where is the cart to be pulled? After all, we believed that we were moving along the path of reform toward a highway on which luxury cars were traveling, and as soon as we reached this highway, we would switch to such a car right away. So, are we to pull the cart toward the highway, modifying it en route, or are we to wait until someone builds a car for us? Nobody will build it for us. We should modify this cart ourselves en route, without stopping, because there is no opportunity to stop. When politicians begin to look for enemies of reform and blame "the working people of this country" for doing something wrong, let them ponder this question: Do they themselves do all of this correctly? Second, the working people are the nag who must pull this cart. One should not spit upon them, but rather help these people to figure things out, because everybody is already confused to the point of not understanding anything. Instead they steer the conversation from the area of economic reform and the search for ways and methods for such reform to the area of convenient political twaddle. It is much too convenient to say that he is an enemy of reforms, we must fight him. However, in ethical terms, lies about us living well as soon as tomorrow and everything stabilizing here are not far removed from thievery. After all, such lies rob the people of that which is most important, hope--the hope that there indeed might be some justice, that we will indeed live better. All our reformers should be grateful to our old system for conditioning a generation of people who trust, endure, and wait--and are sustained by the cherished hope that there are authorities that will take care of them, do the thinking, and make decisions. This feeling makes people patient. This vestige of the other, old system still prevents people from being openly indignant over the outrages and the conditions they find themselves in. For now, there is time to change something for the better, but there is less and less of it.
