FR940216-2-00044 FR940216-2-00026 10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in that condition. Applicants will take immediate corrective action if the Exert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports. 11. The prospectuses of each class of a Fund will include a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund. 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines to be furnished to the trustees. 13. A Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, CDSLs, and exchange privileges (if any) applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. A Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of the Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares of a Fund, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares of a Fund. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper, or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value or public offering price, will present each class of shares separately. 14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative net asset value of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. 15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan with respect to any class of shares (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a Shareholder Administrative Plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by that class under the Plan (``Class A Shares'' for purposes of this section), existing shares of another class (``Class B Shares'' for purposes of this section) convertible into Class A Shares will stop converting into Class A Shares unless the Class B shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Class B Shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Class A'' for purposes of this section), identical in all material respects to Class A as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Class A. If deemed advisable by the trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Class B Shares for a new class (``New Class B'' for purposes of this section), identical to existing Class B Shares in all material respects except that New Class B will convert into New Class A. New Class A or New Class B may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4 of this application, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Class A or New Class B shares shall be borne solely by the adviser and the distributor of the Investment Company. Class B Shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert to Class A Shares subject to the higher maximum amount, provided that the material features of the Class A plan and the relationship of such plan to the Class B Shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 16. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the requested exemptive order does not imply SEC approval, authorization of or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that a Fund may make pursuant to any Plan in reliance on the exemptive order. B. The CDSL Applicants expressly agree that they will comply with proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988, as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended in the future. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
