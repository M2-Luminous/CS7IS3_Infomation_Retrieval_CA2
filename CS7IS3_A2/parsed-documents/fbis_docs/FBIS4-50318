FBIS4-50318 "drchi096_w_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-096 Daily Report 18 May 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Official Says Civil Service Can Survive After 1997 Official Says Civil Service Can Survive After 1997 HK1805063494 Hong Kong HONGKONG STANDARD in English 18 May 94 pp 1, 4 HK1805063494 Hong Kong HONGKONG STANDARD English BFN [By Tonny Chan] [Text] The government would still be able to function even if China fired all 14 top officials after 1997, Secretary for the Civil Service Michael Sze said. He made it clear that the government would move alone to appoint people to the top posts if the worst happened and relations between Hong Kong and China broke down. Mr Sze's defiant remarks came after Chinese official Wang Fengchao, deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government would select its own officials to head the future Hong Kong administration. "If there's no communication (with China) in the runup to 1997, there'd still be the need to have people to do the job," Mr Sze said. "If the chief executive of the Special Administrative Region thinks he should change those officials, I believe the impact would not be great," he told a media reception. "This is because our civil service structure is stable and healthy. Every department knows its job." He pointed out that department heads had been reshuffled regularly and deputies took over a top post until an appointment was made. "After Mrs Anson Chan was appointed Chief Secretary, deputy Secretary for the Civil Service, Stuart Harbinson, acted as the secretary until I took over the post," he said. It would be irresponsible for the future chief executive to sack senior officials for political reasons even though he had the authority to do so as the SAR's chief, he said. Nine of the 14 secretary posts were occupied by locals without the right of abode in other countries and the remaining five--including the Secretary for Security--should be localised by 1996, Mr Sze said. He said the government would choose people who complied with the Basic Law requirements "on the surface". "The expression `on the surface' is a responsible remark. "I won't be able to know whether or not they will apply for a foreign passport in the future," Mr Sze said. When asked if he was referring to people hired on local terms, he said: "I mean people who look like you and me (ethnic Chinese)." But he said it remained the government's wish to discuss the transition of senior civil servants with the Chinese authority. Mr Sze said he knew that many civil servants had fears about the future. "They are not worried that they may lose their jobs but they are worried about the future as an ordinary person in the street," he said. "The worry is understandable. "They are also concerned whether there would be changes within the government."
