Phone: (202) 260&hyph;1339. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Authority This rule is promulgated under the authority of CAA section 308, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7608, and the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Public Law No. 103&hyph;182, section 104, 107 Stat. 2057, 2064 (1993). II. Background Section 308 of the Clean Air Act provides for mandatory licensing of patented technologies needed to meet certain CAA requirements. Under section 308, the United States can require the owner of a patented technology that is necessary to enable another party's compliance with certain limitations of the Clean Air Act to permit the other party to practice the patented technology in exchange for a reasonable royalty set by a Federal court. In order to compel the licensing of a patent under section 308, the EPA Administrator must ask the Attorney General to certify to a Federal district court that the following conditions are satisfied: (a) The patent must be necessary for compliance with the standards of the CAA sections 111, 112 or 202; (b) The patent right must be actively in use or intended for public or commercial use and not otherwise reasonably available; (c) No reasonable alternatives to licensing the patent can exist for meeting the specified CAA standards; and (d) Failure to license the patent may cause reduced competition or monopoly conditions in any area of trade. Upon certification of the above conditions to a Federal district court by the Attorney General, the court may then order the patent holder to license the patent under terms and conditions determined by the court after a hearing.
