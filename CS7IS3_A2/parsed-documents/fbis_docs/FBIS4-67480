The resolution will be proposed to environment ministers of Asean during the sixth ministerial meeting on the environment in Brunei's capital tomorrow. Representing Thailand will be Deputy Minister of Science, Technology and Environment Pricha Musikun. On the agenda are: -- The Asean plan of action on the environment; -- The launching of Asean Environment Year 1995; -- The quality standards for air and river water; and -- Regional cooperation for the management and control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes into and within the region. It was initially agreed that some significant framework and guidelines be established under the Asean strategic plan of action, the officials said. "The member countries are working to develop a common stand on some international forums like the biodiversity and Basel conventions," a Thai delegate said. The strategy encompasses such issues as the implementation of the so-called Agenda 21, the development of policy directions and the extension of operational and technical cooperation on the environment. At the same time, there will be a study on the implementation of the Asean Free Trade Area on the environment. Senior officials endorsed the Asean Environment Year -- Asean Green and Clean -- at the meeting. Asean Environment Year, which is the initiative of Thailand, aims to promote public awareness of environmental protection, according to a Thai delegate. He said the year would be officially inaugurated on January 1, with a wide range of regional and national activities in each member country. Promotion campaigns, however, will start this year. He said most regional activities would be held in the form of seminars or workshops while national activities depended on arrangements of individual countries. There will probably be a study camp for young people or a trade fair and an exhibition on green products. It was agreed member countries must achieve set air and river water quality standards by 2010. The standard for air in urban and industrialised areas must be lower than 200 on the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), one official said. The quality standards for river water, were set as follows: 6.0-8.5 for pH, two milligrammes per litre of dissolved oxygen or more, 10 milligrammes per litre of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or less, and 200 milligrammes per litre of total suspended solids (TSS) or less. The officials also discussed a proposal of the Philippine delegates that Asean adopt its own version of the Basel Convention which regulates the management and control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes. However, many delegates voiced disagreement with the idea. "Asean should adhere to the existing convention. Adopting a new one is time consuming," they said. One official said he thought the Basel Convention was comprehensive enough in controlling the export of toxic wastes from developed to developing countries. "I don't think we need another version." He said the issue would be further discussed at a meeting of the working group on the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes which will be held in Bangkok next year. Each country, he said, would work out its measures to deal with the issue before next year's meeting. "In fact, whether the toxic wastes will be a problem depends on each country's management and control system. The convention is just a broad outline," he said.
