S. Gurvich; Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences; manuscript submitted 15 July 93; UDC 551.596.9:534.222:537.874.4] [Abstract] A model of LAS temperature fluctuation field spectra and an analogous model of wind velocity fluctuation spectra were defined using parameters estimated from independent measurements. The two models were then employed to calculate the scattering of ultra-short and acoustic waves in the stratosphere at small angles, where 0 < _u_ << ï¿½/2. The calculations from these two models were then compared with those obtained from the model of scattering by locally isotropic turbulence with the Kolmogorov spectrum. This problem has a direct bearing on wave propagation over the horizon, in the shadow region, where the diffraction field is negligible. For both of the LAS models, the scattering cross-section increases proportionally to the wavelength of incident radiation. It was shown that accounting for actual temperature and wind velocity fluctuation spectra and anisotropy increases the scattering cross-section in the mirror direction in comparison with the locally isotropic turbulence model, for which this scattering value was -11/3. This increase is especially significant for long acoustic waves. It was also shown that the scattering of sound by wind velocity fluctuations plays a more significant role than scattering by temperature fluctuations. The potential increase in acoustic pulse length during scattering was estimated. It should be noted that the calculations of the effect of anisotropy and spectral behavior presented in the tables are extremely preliminary and require subsequent experimental refinement. The models described can serve as a basis for planning and interpreting experiments on the remote sounding of atmospheric structures. Figures 2, tables 2; references 21: 7 Russian, 14 Western.
