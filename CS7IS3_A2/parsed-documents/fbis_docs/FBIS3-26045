Wan Yueyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of Zhejiang, presided over the meeting. Chai Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and vice governor, transmitted the national economic work conference guidelines. Li Zemin, secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a speech on behalf of the provincial party committee standing committee to express views on how to implement the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decision and the provincial party committee's work in 1994. Li Zemin said: The next five years will be a decisive period for forming an operational mechanism for a socialist market economy in this province and fulfilling the second-step strategic goal ahead of schedule as well as a period for laying down a good foundation for realizing modernization by 2010. The new provincial party committee is formed in a critical period of accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, so it has a great responsibility. You members, especially standing committee members, must do your best to fulfill your duties, persist in serving the people wholeheartedly, study diligently, and constantly raise your ideological, theoretical, and leadership levels. You should promote unity, strictly implement the democratic centralism system, and consciously accept supervision from various sides. We must take a new attitude and a new style of work, concentrate all forces to accomplish various tasks set by the provincial party congress, be worthy of the trust of the people of the whole province, and never let the party Central Committee down. Li Zemin said: Next year will be critical for promoting reform in an all-round way and maintaining a fast and healthy development of the economy. It is extremely important to do well next year's work. The general demands for our work in the next year are: Firmly take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as our guidance; implement in an all-round way the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the Ninth Zhejiang Provincial CPC Congress guidelines; take advantage of current opportunities to speed up reform and development; correctly handle relations between reform, development, and stability; persist in "attaching importance to both spiritual and material civilizations"; maintain social stability; and promote a sustained, fast, and healthy development of the national economy. Li Zemin pointed out: Next year will be critical for promoting reform in an all-round way while centering around the work of establishing a socialist market economic structure. It will also be a year to deepen and expand the scope of reform with great difficulties. We must fully understand the complicated and arduous nature of promoting reform in an all-round way. Party committees and governments at various levels must make greater efforts and strengthen their leadership over the reform work, pay attention to solving key problems, plan and organize reform work carefully, insure stability, reduce risks, and strive to achieve success in the reform work. We should stress the following five points: 1) It is necessary to continue the work of changing the enterprises' operational mechanism and take the reform of the property rights system as the breakthrough point in experimenting with the modern enterprise system at selected units. 2) It is necessary to give prominence to establishing and developing various markets for the basic means of production while consolidating and improving the existing commodity markets. 3) It is necessary to continue the social security system reform. 4) It is necessary to promote comprehensive reform in finance, taxation, banking, and investment in a planned manner. 5) It is necessary to promote organizational reform and change government functions. Li Zemin pointed out: We must adhere to the main direction of taking advantage of the current favorable conditions to accelerate reform and development, and should follow the central guidelines of relying on reform in promoting development. We must not seek rigid uniformity in the speed of economic development. We should make the investment structure as effective as possible and increase the returns on investment. The general demand on economic work is to raise economic quality and efficiency through reform, reorganization, transformation, structural adjustment, technological progress, and improvement of enterprise management. We should stress four points: 1) It is necessary to strengthen leadership over agricultural work and give priority and prominence to the work. 2) It is necessary to further open up to promote reform and development. While increasing the total volume of export-oriented economy, we should also pay attention to quality. 3) It is necessary to adjust the production structure and raise economic results. 4) It is necessary to continue the speedy construction of infrastructure works and make great efforts to reduce the limits of "bottlenecks." Li Zemin pointed out: To accomplish next year's reform, construction, and other tasks, we must persist in paying attention to "both links" [liang shou zhua 0357 2087 2119] and maintain a stable social and political environment. We should promote reform and construction amid stability, and rely on reform and construction to insure long-term stability in society. This should be an important principle in next year's work. First, we should control the level of price increases and do a good job in improving people's living conditions. Second, we should do a good job in six things [liu jian shi 0362 0115 0057] solidly. Third, we should correctly handle various kinds of contradictions in society, and do a good job in the comprehensive management of public security. Fourth, we should promote socialist democracy and the construction of the legal system. Fifth, we should firmly unfold struggles against corruption and achieve effective results step by step. Li Zemin emphatically pointed out: To accomplish various tasks in the next year, the key lies in strengthening and improving the party's leadership. We should improve ourselves, have a new mental outlook and style of work, do things in solidly, and make actual achievements. To improve the party's own building, first of all, we must pay attention to improving the leading bodies at county and above level. We should consider the work of organizing the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping as a work of primary importance. Meanwhile, we should also study well the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Committee decision. We should train all leading cadres at and above county level next year. We must not slacken our efforts to improve the ideology and work style of leading cadres. Party committees at various levels must set strict demands on leading cadres, and train and supervise them strictly. We should attach great importance to the building of party organizations at the grass-roots level. In particular, we should continue to improve the backward party branches in rural areas and actively explore ways to improve party organizations in village and town enterprises and "joint ventures, cooperative ventures, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises." We should do a good job in admitting new party members from plants, rural areas, science-technology research institutes, and the education front. Leading cadres at various levels should conscientiously and honestly perform their duties and effectively improve their leading style. First, the provincial party committee should concentrate on discussing and tackling major issues, hold periodic meetings to analyze current situation, and have a good grasp of the trend of economic and social development. It is necessary to attach importance to investigation and study. Provincial party committee standing committee members should at least spend two months at lower levels and make one or two investigation and research reports according to their respective duties for reference when the standing committee makes policy decisions. Second, they should take the whole situation into consideration, coordinate the work of various sides, establish a responsibility system for their respective duties, and develop the role of the provincial party committee and its standing committee. Third, standing committee members should pay attention to supervision and inspection, and plan to carry out inspection work. They should timely supervise and check the implementation of provincial party committee arrangements. Standing committee members and concerned departments should report to the provincial party committee, and each level should check the work of the lower level to ascertain the implementation and results of various resolutions. Fourth, it is imperative to forbid formalism and reduce "documents and meetings" and various kinds of social activities. Meetings and speeches should be short, and things should be done in an effective manner with actual results. Those attending yesterday's plenary meeting were provincial party committee members and alternate members. Provincial discipline inspection commission members, leading party cadres at and above deputy provincial department head level, veteran party comrades, party committee secretaries of various cities (prefectures) and counties, various mayors, various prefectural commissioners, responsible members of the provincial people's congress and the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and principal responsible members of party committees (leading party groups) of various provincial level departments attended the meeting as observers.
