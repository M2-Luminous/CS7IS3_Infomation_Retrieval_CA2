The figure ranks the Agricultural Bank of China first among the four state specialized banks in terms of the personal savings each bank holds. According to an ABC official, the bank recalled some 5.8 billion yuan extended to non-financial institutions under the name of inter- bank lending by the end of last year, meanwhile providing 230 billion yuan in direct loans to agricultural production, representing a net increase of 30 billion yuan as against the previous year. And thank to the ABC's strict management of funds, there were much fewer cases of "IOU" reported throughout the country during the purchase of grain and other agricultural products last year. To help the growth of township enterprises, the bank made loans of over 335 billion yuan to the rural firms and a considerable portion of the loans went to the under-developed central and western regions. The bank official revealed that the central government has decided to increase the amount of loans to the agricultural sectors to some 10 percent of total bank lendings this year from six percent in 1993. This year, ABC's lending will mainly go to agriculture production which either has high economic returns or can earn more foreign currency. It will also support the technical renovation of some efficient rural industries so as to make their products more competitive, said the official.
