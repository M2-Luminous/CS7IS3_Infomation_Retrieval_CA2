They both delivered speeches at the luncheon and said that they would make common efforts to further promote the development of economic and trade relations between the two countries. At the beginning of his speech, Li Ruihuan briefed those at the luncheon on China's reform and opening up. He said that 1994 marks an important year for China's continued reform efforts. This year will see the concentrated introduction of the largest number of new reform measures. The new reform measures will be unprecedented in terms of their scale, scope, difficulty, and their being in-depth in nature. Our general policy is: seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability. With the advancement of reform and opening up, China's economy has made great strides and has entered the period of sustained, rapid, and healthy development, which gives foreign businesses a great opportunity for carrying out economic and trade cooperation with China. Li Ruihuan said that Finland is an industrialized and developed country and that it possesses advanced technologies in many economic sectors. Seen from the perspective of the complementary nature of the two countries' economies and from the respective countries' economic strengths, there are great potentials for cooperation between the two countries, and such potentials need to be further tapped. He added that he would like to take this opportunity to tell Finish business circles that the Finnish experience means much to China, that Finnish technology is useful to China, and that China is interested in and has confidence in expanding economic and trade relations with Finland. China welcomes more Finnish businessmen to invest in China, to trade with China, and to participate in China's modernization construction. (Numining) said that China's reform and opening up have provided conditions for expanding Finnish-Chinese economic and trade cooperation and have helped make it possible for the two countries to achieve marked progress in their bilateral economic and trade ties. The increase in the exchange of high-level visits in recent years has further promoted the economic and trade relationship between the two countries. He expressed the belief that Chairman Li's current visit would further promote the development of bilateral economic and trade ties. Li Ruihuan also fielded Finnish businessmen's questions at the luncheon.
