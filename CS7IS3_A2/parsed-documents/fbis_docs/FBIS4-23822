In his statement the minister said it had come to the attention of the government that the publication of news over the foreign radio stations and other media, in connection with the so-called task force coming to Lesotho, had again spread confusion in the ranks of some of the country's armed forces. The statement said, as previously, the issue of the task force, which resulted from the recent police strike, was a demonstration of the enthusiasm of SADC [Southern African Development Community] countries to help in the resolution through peaceful means, the difficulty of the lack of stability, not only in Lesotho but in other countries in the region, in the interest of bringing about peace and economic development in the region. He said the issue of the task force should therefore be understood as a group of people, in the present circumstances, foreign ministers who have been charged with the responsibility to make an in depth investigation into the cause of the lack of stability in Lesotho.
