After the report from the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group was read in the Majles on 11 and 12 Aban [2 and 3 November] an answer was presented by the Islamic Republic of Iran Voice and Vision organization, which was broadcast fully, yesterday by the national radio network. Printed below is a summary of the answer from the Voice and Vision organization: During the lifetime of the Imam (may Almighty God be pleased with him), his excellency gave special attention and favor to the Voice and Vision organization. Under the revised version of the Constitution it came under the supervision of the exalted leader. It has therefore always been the closest organization to the vice-regent and the leader. This report adds: As the voice of the Islamic revolution, the Voice and Vision organization has numerous supporters and opponents. Foremost among this media's supporters is His Holiness the Imam, may Almighty God be pleased with him, the exalted leader, the respected officials in the government, the hezbollah nation and the Muslims of the world. Foremost among the opponents of this media are the counterrevolutionary groups and groups who were damaged by the revolution such as the hypocrites, the leftist minigroups, the Hojjatieh Society, the supporters of America and Israel, and others who have tried repeatedly in various ways to destroy this organization. Likewise, part of this answer said: Although inquiry and investigation is among the duties of the Majles, this is a matter that is judicial in nature. In an Islamic atmosphere, the most important qualifications for a judge are justice and impartiality. Unfortunately, Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh, a member of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, has a previous record in the Hojjatieh Society. He has expressed opposition since the year 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] to Mr. Hashemi's management, and especially during the incidents at the Voice and Vision organization in the year 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984], which led to the dismissal of the executive director at that time by the Supervisory Council and the reappointment of Mr. Hashemi by the late Imam, Mr. Parvaresh and like-minded others said many things against the Imam's involvement and against his house, which displeased the Imam. In a written statement dated 4 Tir 1362 [25 June 1983], the Imam said: "It is necessary to mention that it has been heard that some people in my house are doing things against my wishes or without my knowledge. If this is not true, then the person who said this will be punished by God...." Mr. Hashemi added that the presence of Mr. Parvaresh with his record on the Inquiry and Investigation Group undermines the groups "neutrality." Here the members present at this meeting said they did not know about Mr. Parvaresh's past and the events of the year 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] in the Voice and Vision organization. With reference to the record, they promised to observe neutrality and not to allow anyone to influence their vote and their views. This answer also emphasized: Studying 1 million hours of programming and giving an opinion about it, and an official opinion at that, is something that is quite difficult. Considering the opponents and supporters of the Voice and Vision organization, the Inquiry and Investigation Group cannot base its judgement on hearsay. Rather it must conduct its own study and see the documented evidence for each instance where it wants to express an opinion. Another part of the report says: On matters of religious jurisprudence, it was announced that since the late Imam, apart from the fact that he was the owner of the revolution and the founder of the sacred government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, was the most knowledgeable theologian and the clear source of emulation, on matters of religious jurisprudence in the Voice and Vision organization such as the way women should appear on television or on the issue of music, we have acted in accordance with the Imam's theological views. In cases like this a council cannot judge according to its own views. Rather it must declare its view in accordance with the fatwas and the views of the late Imam concerning the aforementioned issues. In conclusion he announced that to avoid any kind of rumor about the organization not cooperating, which might be circulated by persons of ill will, or to allay any doubt, all the information and documents needed by the council should be requested in writing and the Voice and Vision organization will send you all the information in writing. The answer from the Voice and Vision organization says: In the report that the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group broadcast from the Majles on 11 and 12 Aban [2 and 3 November], they did not mention any of the documents sent except in one or two cases. Rather, those making the report were completely unfair and in several parts of the report they made the declaration "despite the organization's failure to cooperate" or "despite the organization's failure to cooperate...." The answer also adds: While reading the report Mr. Parvaresh announced that despite the organization's failure to cooperate, the Inquiry and Investigation Group obtained its information through sensitive and nonsensitive means! Another part of this answer states: During the year while the research and investigation was under way, a lot of information about the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group was given to the Voice and Vision organization. In obedience to guidance from the late Imam (may Almighty God be pleased with him) and the exalted leader, may his life be long, and in view of the belief and faith that we have, we will not disclose it. We will mention in general one or two points, which are very significant in analyzing the group's report, because failure to observe these points might do serious damage to the realities: Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh has a record of activity in the Hojjatieh Society, and brief reference has been made to his way of thinking. Some of the group's other members also have a record of cooperation and activity in the Hojjatieh Society. Likewise, another member of the group is married to the former spouse of an executed hypocrite as a second spouse, and he introduces her as the wife of a "martyr." Later it became clear, however, first of all that this person was the spouse of an executed hypocrite, and second that it was this very woman who drew her former spouse into the hypocrite group. The way of thinking of some of the nonsensitive members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group is thus clear, with the "Hojjatiyehs," "hypocrites" and the views of "Hojjatiyehs" and "hypocrites" concerning the late Imam and the exalted leader and their friends. However, it is completely clear and there is no need here for further explanation. The complete text of the answer will be published in a subsequent issue.
