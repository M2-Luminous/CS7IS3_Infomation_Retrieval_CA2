Ermita] [Text] Adjudication of cases involving violations of intellectual property rights (IPR) in the country has remained problematic because of numerous constraints, says a recently released study. According to the study, the country's IPR laws need strengthening and updating to become effective. While IPR complaints have been routinely filed with the Department of Justice, most IPR cases have not resulted in convictions of alleged violators. Most IPR cases have been settled out of court. In the few cases where the court has ruled in favor of IPR owners, the convicted were punished with a small fine, or put on probation without serving their prison terms. These are among the findings of a study commissioned by the Philippine Exporters Confederation (Philexport), through its Private Investment and Trade Opportunities -- Philippines (PITO-P) project. The SRI [Stanford Research Institute] International-Washington team conducted the study. Rico Domingo led the SRI study team. Other team members were: Carlo Carag, technical expert; Peter Boone and Ophelia Yeung, international economists. The study acknowledges the increasing international consensus about the need to protect intellectual property to encourage technological and artistic innovation. Indeed, the recently concluded Uruguay Round of the General Trade and Tariff Agreement's program to come out with a multilateral global trade framework has agreed for a stricter intellectual property protection standards. The study suggests several reforms to protect and enforce intellectual property in the country -- fully consistent with international standards. These reforms involve changes on the IPR regime itself, the streamlining of the IPR adjudication process and the prevention of intellectual property violations. According to the study, its survey of intellectual property owners and representatives has shown that the Philippine judicial system is not at all effective in enforcing IPR violations. The general constraints to IPR adjudication in the Philippines include the following: -- low priority given to IPR protection; -- inadequate resources and training for IPR enforcement agencies; -- possible judicial and government agency bias against multinationals; -- lack of information and knowledge on IPR laws among enforcement agents and judicial officers; -- public apathy or lack of awareness; -- lack of coordination among IPR enforcement agencies; -- overall inefficiency of the judicial system; and corruption. The study identifies these legal regime problems: -- overly technical and stringent evidentiary requirements; -- tenuous legal authority among enforcement agencies to expedite IPR violations; and -- inadequate fines and criminal penalties. The adjudication system is equally difficult, says the study. The investigation stage has the following problems: -- difficulties obtaining receipts to prove sale of counterfeit items; -- difficulties establishing identity of intellectual property violators; -- problems finding witnesses to sign affidavits; -- availability of judges, -- refusal by owners to allow entry during raids and in the serving of search warrants; -- "protection" offered to infringers by "influential friends"; -- and; lack of storage space for seized evidence (counterfeit and pirate goods). During the prosecution phase the following difficulties were identified: -- respondent's inability to answer subpoena and notices; -- liberal extensions granted by the prosecutor to the respondent to appear in preliminary investigation hearings.
