According to experts from Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, the slow-down is a result of failures by the Armenian Army in the north-eastern direction. Beginning with 1 May approximately 250 Armenian soldiers were killed and wounded and they also lost several units of military hardware. Having incurred many losses, Armenian troops have been compelled to regroup and strategise as they await extra military hardware as well as additional forces from Armenia. In addition to this, diplomatic sources told Turan that the Armenian Army is planning to launch a new large-scale offensive towards the Geranboyskiy (northern), Terterskiy and Barda (north-eastern) regions. The goal of attack is to occupy these regions and to reach the city of Yevlakh. The same source reports that Russian specialists are also involved in planning the offensive. As before, the Russian troops located in Armenia are expected to take part in the offensive. It is known that the Russian party provides Armenia with military intelligence from Azerbaijan. Some experts see this assistance as a reaction by Moscow to Azerbaijan's signing of NATO's programme "Partnership for the Sake of Peace" and the Azerbaijan's refusal to sign the Bishkek document which was proposed by Russia.
