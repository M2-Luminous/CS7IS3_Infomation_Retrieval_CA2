Joint efforts of state organs, collectives and individuals and appropriate competition among them have greatly invigorated the province's road transportation and provided a firm foundation for its economic development. The volume of Liaoning's road transportation last year reached 700 million tons and the number of passengers served topped 340 million. Communications and transport services in the province, as in the whole country, used to be totally under state control and were long haunted by such problems as insufficient carrying capacity and slack organization. Along with the country's reform of the transportation system, collective and individual sectors have begun to play an increasingly important role in both road construction and transport services. A decade ago, the number of trucks and buses for civil use owned by individuals in Liaoning was 4,279, with only 12 designated to carry passengers. That figure had grown to 51,600 by the end of last year, accounting for one-tenth of the province's total and nearly four times that owned by provincial transportation departments. In the year 1993, one-fourth of the province's total volume of goods delivered through road transportation were handled by individual sectors, which also served half of its 160 million passengers. The provincial government has also increased input in transportation. Last year alone, state investment in highway construction reached 1.1 billion yuan.
