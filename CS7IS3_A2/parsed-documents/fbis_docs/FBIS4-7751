In an interview with AFP, Melescanu said Russian peacekeeping operations should be carried out only in accordance with the United Nations and the countries involved. "The presence of Russian military forces in countries that have declared their independence is a principle that we cannot accept," he said. Russian troops are stationed in neighboring Moldova where separatists of Russian origin have declared a republic. Romania has historic and cultural ties with Moldova. Most of Moldova belonged to Romania until the area was annexed by the former Soviet Union in the 1939 peace pact between Stalin and Hitler. "We understand Russia's worry about the Russian minorities that live in former Soviet republics. But for their protection, European diplomatic mechanisms must be emphasized instead of military means," Melescanu said. There is to be a summit meeting between Russian and Romania later this year.
