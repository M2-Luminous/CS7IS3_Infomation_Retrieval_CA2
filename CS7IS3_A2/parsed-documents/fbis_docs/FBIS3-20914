The Minister of Higher Education and Research emphasized that "in Europe, France is the only country where the research budget is increasing, even if modestly. I can tell you that during my meetings with colleagues from neighboring countries, I learned that budgetary constraints were affecting their research much more severely than our own." The minister added that the national debate has been opened. It will continue with the organization of a series of six regional conferences, the first of which to take place in Le Mans on 14 February, followed by others in Marseille, Grenoble, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Lille before the concluding national debate scheduled for 9 April in Paris. Fillon further said that "the preliminary task force report being circulated since 26 November has already inspired some fifty responses, mostly but not exclusively from the major research institutions." The 30,000 copies of the final report will be mailed out beginning on 1 February so that in-depth institutional studies may get started. The six scheduled conferences will address research and innovation in PME-PMI (small and medium size enterprises), reports from the scientific and social communities, research and enterprises aimed at competitiveness, basic research, ways of enhancing "France's assets," advanced training and research organizations: structures and trades, and finally, the international scope of research. Fillon does not want these conferences, each of which will involve around 300 invited participants, to become "High Masses," but rather to generate "genuine dialogue." He expressed hope that they will result in important ideas from which the government will formulate the scientific and technological policies required by the country's development and by the international context. He did not conceal his support of proposals for a five-year or programming law as in the case of Defense, but he acknowledged that these proposals would probably have to wait until after the 1995 election. In response to some questions, Fillon said he hoped that the new French space policy "would be defined soon. My ministry has expressed its views on the subject but the Ministry of Industry is the one in charge of Space." The minister announced that the first contract between the government and research organizations would probably be signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), then with the National Institute for Computer and Automation Research (INRIA). With more specific reference to higher education, the minister restated his intention of initiating as of this year "a genuine technological track" and to intensify efforts to reduce the concentration of his ministry's departments toward colleges and universities, through the proven approach of decentralization. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agenda for National Debate on Major Objectives of French Research | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Summary of 1993 Agenda | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |September 1993 |Introductory session of task force (C-| | |hairman: R.
