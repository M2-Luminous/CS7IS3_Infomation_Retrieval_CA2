You have been elected president by the representatives of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and large parts of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. They represent one half of the republic. What are you going to tell the other half now? [Herzog] What I said in my brief acceptance speech: The president has the task of representing all parties, all groups of the population. I fully understand that one part of the Federal Assenbly did not consider me the most suitable representative of their views. However, as I have had to do and liked to do over the past 10 years as a constitutional judge, I will try to be there for everyone and, as it has been said, stand above the parties and establish understanding where it is necessary and possible, given the weak powers of the president. [passage omitted] [Siegloch] From politicians of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], one hears that the president has been elected against the desire of the population, which has been deduced from many polls. Is this irritating? [Herzog] It is indeed irritating, I must admit that. However, you know, on the other hand, I must say that if we had conducted a six-month presidential election campaign, I would have been just as well-known [as SPD candidate Rau], and if I had been as well-known as one of the leading SPD politicians without such an election campaign, I would not have properly fulfilled my previous office, whose main task it is not to constantly appear in public. This was included in the conditions, so to speak. [Bresser] This election was characterized by party tactics and power interests. This was the case already in past elections. However, today this is particularly true in view of the forthcoming Bundestag elections. If this election is now contrary to the wishes of the majority of the people, does this have consequences for you? For instance, if you run again for president in five years, would you then advocate a direct election by the people? [Herzog] I have always been of the view -- and this is not an ad hoc invention, as my latest comprehensive, printed statement on this matter dates back to 1985 -- that two things must be clarified if one wants to do that: First, the president would have to have quite different powers in this case. A president who conducts a six-month election campaign all over the country and is then supported by more than half of the people and their votes and who then notes that he has only the few powers that the Basic Law gives him would simply not be able to stand this psychologically. [Siegloch] But would you want it? Would you want to be the president elected by the people? [Herzog] Yes, I would very much want that, but not for the price that afterwards the powers are missing. [Siegloch] The example of Austria would not convince you? [Herzog] No, precisely that would not convince me. [Siegloch] Thus, powers first and then popular election? [Herzog] Yes, but I am not calling for the powers. [Siegloch] And, therefore, not for popular election? [Herzog] This is the essential point. Of course, one can topple the Basic Law and establish a presidential democracy, as in France or in the United States, but our parliamentary democracy -- regardless of the bugs it occasionally shows -- has basically worked well. Why should one now create a completely new constitutional structure? And then, think of one thing. If we four candidates had attacked each other in a real election campaign all over the country for the past six months, how would the person elected today by the people be able on 1 July to make it clear to the people that he is there for everyone. This is a completely different situation. [Bresser] But the past few weeks have shown that the people want such a popular election, that they do want it. Does one not have to draw consequences from that, at least think about whether one should change the Basic Law? [Herzog] One has to discuss this rationally, also with the people. I understand this quite well. [Siegloch] Thus, the last word has not been spoken, in your view? The matter must just be clarified? [Herzog] I repeat: powers and popular election or no powers and no popular election. At the moment, I really do not see any reason to turn our entire constitutional system inside out just because this is fashionable now. [Siegloch] Very different men have held this office: Theodor Heuss, Gustav Heinemann, and Richard von Weizsaecker. Whom do you think you are closest to regarding the way you will fulfill this office? [Herzog] These are all very great names and it would be difficult for me at the moment to compare myself with one of them. Probably, the situation that we are facing can be best compared with the one that Theodor Heuss was facing. [Bresser] Why? [Herzog] Under Theodor Heuss, the FRG was established anew; it entered a very difficult international situation, and now we are certainly in a far easier, but similar situation of upheaval, as well as at the international level. This large Germany is currently having problems, but must find a completely new role in the world as soon as the problems are overcome, which I do not doubt. I am not speaking about Bundeswehr missions -- this matter has been sent to Karlsruhe and must be decided there -- but I mean that quite in general. Of course, this Germany, which is watched a bit suspiciously -- and rightly so for obvious reasons -- currently needs a representative who, similar to Theodor Heuss, shows -- also with a certain bonhomie -- that Germany is now different than some textbooks say. I mentioned the term easy-going before. [Siegloch] Is this some kind of slogan for your office? [Herzog] This is very important to me. [Bresser] You are talking about being easy-going; you are talking about bonhomie. But do you not also want to utilize the leeway that the Basic Law -- and you participated in writing the comment on the Basic Law -- leaves to the president? And where would you prefer to use it? [Herzog] This will not change. There is not anything new in this field. The president has powers of decisionmaking in case of a permanent government crisis, if the Bundestag is no longer able to elect a chancellor with the chancellor's majority or keep him in office. In this situation, the president has a few powers of decisionmaking -- you know, appointing a minority chancellor or dissolving the Bundestag and announcing new elections, which cannot be repeated at will. [Siegloch] All this might happen on 16 October. [Herzog] Yes, of course, but all these are things that I hope will not happen. Then there remains the power to check the laws that must be signed as to their constitutionality. You know how this was done by the previous president. Everyone used this right once, if at all. This is quite correct because the president can sign only an entire law or not sign it at all. If he has constitutional reservations regarding one stipulation in a long law, he will not be well-advised to refuse to sign the entire law, but he will probably sign it -- as many of the presidents expressly stated -- to make it possible to go to Karlsruhe, because the Federal Constitutional Court can examine an individual stipulation and, if necessary, declare it unconstitutional and null and void. This will not change much, and these are basically the president's powers. Anything else involves representation, giving an example, and making speeches. This is, in my view, the attraction of this office. [Siegloch] Nevertheless, the relationship between the chancellor and the president is watched relatively closely. Helmut Kohl brought you into politics in Rhineland-Palatinate. Will it be easier for him with you than with Richard von Weizsaecker? [Herzog] We will have to wait and see. I never analyzed the relationship between Richard von Weizsaecker and Helmut Kohl so thoroughly as some of your colleagues. I will wait and see. In any case, I am my own man and no one's governor. [passage omitted] [Bresser] When you went into politics, you first went to Bonn for Rhineland-Palatinate and then to Baden-Wuerttemberg as cultural minister and later as interior minister. There you were considered a very tough politician. You advocated.... [Herzog] You are warming up this story again! [Bresser] Yes, this is part of your curriculum vitae. You advocated rubber bullets against demonstrators and also tear gas for the police as a weapon. Would you do that again today? [Herzog] I would do both again, because of the considerations I made at that time, which your colleagues did not believe. It was always said that using a baton is a milder method. If you have ever seen the use of a baton from both sides' perspective, this is hand-to-hand combat. There is real brutality there. In this case, the only way is to separate the groups involved, including the police. This was the point of this gas. The second matter was the rubber bullets. From the very beginning, their use was intended only in cases in which, according to police law, the police are permitted to use live ammunition. Now, I ask you whether it can be justified to use live ammunition in case of emergency, if there is a milder method, namely rubber bullets, even though they are still dangerous. I am still convinced that I was right about that. I just was misunderstood. [Bresser] You were understood as meaning that you wanted to use these means against demonstrations in general. Now you are obviously talking about people committing acts of violence. [Herzog] This was said in this way at that time; I just was not believed. This is really not my fault. [Siegloch] For the public, there was quite a different Herzog as a constitutional judge: Under your leadership, the ban of a demonstration against the Brockdorf nuclear power plant was lifted -- freedom of assembly also in those cases where there is the risk that some people might abuse this right. Have you become more liberal due to your experiences, or how would you interpret this? [Herzog] No one should rule out that a new task and a new office also give him a new view on some problem. However, what was decided in this ruling on Brockdorf was my policy as interior minister in Baden-Wuerttemberg, this was the so-called Stuttgart line, which consisted in not seeing a demonstrator as an enemy right from the start, which consisted in saying: If someone demonstrates peacefully, he has this right, even if others are not peaceful. I would like to put it as follows: As interior minister of Baden-Wuerttemberg, I would not have issued the comprehensive ban on demonstrations around the Brockdorf nuclear power plant in the way this was done. And I have witnesses to that. [Bresser] The liberals have recently criticized you with considerable harshness because of your attitude on dual citizenship. You retracted your statements afterwards. You said that those foreigners who do not want to become Germans may also stay in our country. However, then you stuck to your basic attitude, which is: no dual citizenship. Is this not also interference in politics, and would you continue this as president? [Herzog] Basically, no. These are statements that I made in the Bundesrat 10 or 12 years ago. I must admit that a sentence was left out in this interview because I was not paying attention. By the way, if you read this interview, the formulation of dual citizenship only in exceptional cases is correct, but the exceptional case is mentioned right afterwards, namely the second and third generation of foreigners. This is not an exception in terms of numbers [sentence as heard]. One must indeed discuss these matters. In my party, I have so far been attacked because I have advocated dual citizenship under certain circumstances. Of course, this must be discussed. Over the past few weeks, I have had a very lively correspondence with foreigners' associations and my attention has been drawn to completely new problems, which are linked with ius soli, for instance. I am quite open to that. However, I expressly repeat that, even though I did not retract anything, I should have noticed that this one sentence was missing. [Siegloch] Originally, an eastern German should have become president; a southern German, a Bavarian, now has become president. You like to talk about different German tribes. Is it not first necessary to have east and west grow together. You briefly mentioned that in your acceptance speech. Will you appeal to the west Germans' conscience more in the future? [Herzog] First of all, it must be clarified in a relatively broad discussion what must grow together and to what extent we must grow together. I have repeatedly said that the idea that there is a wall in the people's minds is partly linked with the idea that all people, all Germans, must be identical. They have never been that -- individuals have never been that nor have the tribes. One can certainly not demand -- even if this is done in the most intellectual newspaper articles -- of a group of 17 or 18 million Germans, like the ones in the new laender, who had completely different experiences of life for 40 years than we had, that they suddenly think in the same way as the Germans in the west. This simply cannot be and does not need to be either. This means, first of all, that we have to talk about the extent to which we should and want to come together. Second, of course, there are the basic problems that we have at the moment -- namely that it is made clear to the western Germans, who have to make great sacrifices for the reconstruction in the new laender, that this is just the compensation for a more fortunate fate that they had. For me it is very important that the citizens in the new laender see, as I said before, that we need them. They are contributing much of what we do not have in this way. I just want to mention the economic sector: They have an enormous knowledge of East Europe. Just think of their language skills. At the moment, we do not need that very much, but this may be different in two or three years. [Bresser] In this matter and in others the president mostly works through talking. Next year you will have to give a great speech on 8 May 1995. What will this day, the end of World War II, be for you: a day of liberation or a day of defeat? [Herzog] I will certainly not give you this speech today. [Siegloch] In your acceptance speech, you said that a casual word may allay some tenseness. Now you have an opportunity to do so. We would like to give you the beginning of a sentence and ask you to complete it quite spontaneously. [Herzog] Only if I can think of something. [Bresser] Loving Germany.... [Herzog] I love only people. I can love the German people. [Siegloch] A grand coalition in Bonn is.... [Herzog] ...probably the ultimate resort. [Bresser] That the Germans deserve a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.... [Herzog] ...we should not fight for it, but we cannot avoid our responsibility either. [Siegloch] That the people should have more of a say in the future.... [Herzog] ...I am for it, but one finally has to talk about the issues that can be subjected to a referendum. I mostly think of personnel decisions at the local level. [Bresser] That a Bavarian becomes president for the first time.... [Herzog] ...need not necessarily be bad. [Siegloch] Anyone who takes politics too seriously.... [Herzog] ...probably also takes the rest of his life too seriously and thus sometimes blocks his view of the truth. [Bresser] Really important for me is.... [Herzog] Really important for me is that I feel everyday that I have lived up to my tasks. [Siegloch] Anyone who thinks that I am sociable fellow.... [Herzog] ...is free to do so. [Bresser] I get quick-tempered if.... [Herzog] ...if I intend to do so. Normally, I am not quick-tempered. [Siegloch] Anyone who says that in the future, I have to beware of what I am saying.... [Herzog] ...is right -- and you have been trying do that, too -- but I am still rather satisfied with myself at the moment. It is inherent in the office that has been transferred to me today. This office must have a certain degree of dignity. [Bresser] However, who wants to be understood by the people.... [Herzog] ...who must speak quite clear German, in particular -- I quote Kurt Tucholsky -- main clauses, main clauses, main clauses. [Siegloch] Being in the limelight.... [Herzog] ...is something that I have not always wanted. However, I will manage. [Bresser] Anyone who says that I am cool right down to my heart.... [Herzog] ....does not understand me very well. [Siegloch] Thank you very much, Mr. Herzog. In conclusion, after such a day, are you a bit proud this evening? [Herzog] If I say no, you will believe that I am flirting with myself a bit. There is a certain satisfaction. Proud is not the proper word. There is a certain satisfaction, but, you know, it is an enormous challenge, and I must first see whether I can live up to it. [Bresser] Thank you very much, Mr. Herzog.
