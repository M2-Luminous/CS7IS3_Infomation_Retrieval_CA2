This violence has deliberately been directed against our students and children by the Israeli Army and armed settlers which has constituted a serious precedent especially after the signing of the Cairo agreement. However, in the same breath, we do not agree with and rather denounce the attack on women and especially the pregnant among them as happened recently in the killing of a settler, which is in contrast with Arab and Islamic ethics. This escalation harms the peace process. Self-restraint is required from everyone, especially toward the unarmed peaceful civilians.
