A recent press conference held at the Russian Space Agency was devoted to explaining the problems which have beset the multibillion industrial and scientific giant's 40-year history, and which are set to dog its present and its future. Baykonur started out as an isolated entity deep in the steppe heartland. Today, however, it is a whole state comprising impressive constructions, power-consuming plants, assembly buildings, and the city of Leninsk. Alongside the complex's famous No. 2 launchpad, the starting point for satellite launches, Gagarin's spaceflight, and indeed that of the cosmonauts currently in orbit -- that is, alongside this living legend other launchpads have been constructed, including sites for the Proton and Energiya rockets. Many kilometers of cable worth billions of rubles have been invested in this site. And state-of-the-art technology is used in the rockets, the payloads, in work carried out in orbit, and in the help proffered from Earth. So Baykonur's separation from Russia's multifaceted space sector would result in a loss of resources and a dissipation of personnel and profitable contracts. The point being that the new super-complex being developed on the basis of Plesetsk is going to take between eight and 10 years to build. [passage omitted] [132204] [Correspondent resumes over video of servicemen sitting on a bench] At the moment, Baykonur keeps going basically by dint of the fact that 28,000 Russian servicemen are there to operate it. For this reason it is hard to imagine any kind of commercial mechanism succeeding, be it a firm or a corporation. Frankly, to totally demilitarize Baykonur and replace military with civilian experts overnight would spell disaster. And talk of generating sufficient revenue on site for the giant Baykonur-Leninsk complex to pay its own way is little short of ridiculous. Russia is going to rent the entire complex from Kazakhstan, financially compensate for the ecological damage, and clear the 400,000 hectares of proving ground of scrap metal. However, this will not entail the billions of dollars which are being alluded to but will be done with due consideration for the overall state of accounts between Russia and Kazakhstan. Finally, at a time when 37 percent of Russia's space budget goes on maintaining the Mir space station, our participation in the new international space project -- the "Alpha" Station -- will create new jobs for tens of thousands of people and a billion dollars in profits in the next four years alone. Not to mention the production of new spacesuits in conjunction with the Germans, and of collapsible modules for India -- in fact, contracts have been concluded with 20 states in all. And all this represents technology, profit, and prosperity.
