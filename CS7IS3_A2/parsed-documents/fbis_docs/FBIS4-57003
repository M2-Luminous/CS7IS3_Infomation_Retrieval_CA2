FBIS4-57003 "drlat091_n_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-091 Daily Report 9 May 1994 Chile Cuban Foreign Minister To Be Invited To Visit Cuban Foreign Minister To Be Invited To Visit PY1005142694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1941 GMT 9 May 94 PY1005142694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Santiago, 9 May (EFE) -- Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza reported today that this week the Chilean Government will extend an official invitation to Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to visit Santiago. He said Robaina's visit will be part of a tour that the Cuban foreign minister will make of Southern Cone countries in the next few months, adding that the invitation "entails nothing special" within the relations between the two nations. Chile and Cuba broke diplomatic relations in 1973. Consular-level relations were reestablished in 1990 at the end of the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990, following the election of Patricio Aylwin (1990-1994) as Chilean president). Insulza said the Chilean Government considers an exchange of opinions with the Cuban foreign minister on the Cuban situation and the political situation in the hemisphere will be "very useful." He added that there is no specific agenda for Robaina's visit, but he emphasized, among other topics, the commercial blockade and the sidelining of Cuba from the inter-American system, a situation that has impeded official contacts with the Caribbean country, [would be discussed]. Other sources reported that the agenda will also include the signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement that Chilean officials announced last week, when Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa reiterated that the reestablishment of diplomatic relations is not a short-term objective of the Chilean Government. Concerning relations, Insulza said that even though some events in Cuba -- like the dialogue with exiles and the most recent economic measures -- are regarded as positive, the political regime continues "to pose substantive obstacles" to the reestablishment of relations. "We have no diplomatic relations with Cuba, and the decision to reestablish them should be made by the president (Eduardo Frei)," Insulza said. He added that the Chilean foreign policy "seeks to maintain relations with all countries," but this calls for "a political evaluation," because there must be a "consensus" among all sectors "with due consideration for the interests of the nation."
