That is one thing. As it happens, two theories can be considered. Either the increases were included in the budget, in which case the chapter on that subject was not visible to everyone. Or they reflected a decision anticipated by the government outside the strict framework of the budget. For another thing, it is undeniable that the system of transparence is still far from being the main concern of our decisionmakers. There was nothing to prevent either of the firms involved in those increases from informing the consumer ahead of time and providing the necessary explanations rather than suddenly slapping him with higher prices--which they did, moreover, with very poor timing. It needs to be remembered, first of all, that as far as fuel prices are concerned, Naftal [National Enterprise for Refining and Distributing Petroleum Products] could not have made the decision itself, since those prices are regulated by the state. Increases require an executive decree by the government, and that decree came early this week, followed by a letter from the Ministry of Commerce to Naftal asking the latter to raise its prices: to 8.50 dinars [DA] for premium gasoline, DA7 for regular, DA6 for fuel oil, and DA40 per bottle of butane (compared to DA30 previously). It will be noted that the sharpest increase involves fuel oil, and at Naftal headquarters yesterday, we were told that the charge for a 13-kg bottle of butane was still a long way from reflecting truth in prices. In the case of the other fuels as well, experts feel generally that current prices are too low, if only because fuel is considered a quality product. The theory that what this involves is simply an effort to bail out the state budget and make up the deficit does not hold up. The budget deficit borders on DA120 billion, and it would be hard to swear that that amount could be adequately made up by this means. It is also out of the question that these increases were included in the budget. Whether they may have been included in a supplementary budget bill is another matter. The government therefore must have made the decision regarding the measures in question, probably with an eye to the political effect such as step would have in Washington, where a financial bailout for our country is being negotiated. The gradual approach to truth in prices could be a sign intended for the IMF, which must see concrete evidence that the Algerian Government wants to pursue an austere and rigorous economic policy. The choice of fuels and cigarettes is probably not an accident. Because automobiles are considered a luxury in Algeria--partly because of the preoccupation with life's sordid aspects--and tobacco is a harmful product, the social effect of the increases is lessened. Other measures will follow, also with some flexibility, apparently, since some sources say that milk is going to cost DA5 and a loaf of bread DA2.50 after Aid el Fitr. That will not hit people's pocketbooks too hard. As far as the unions are concerned, the higher price of fuel and tobacco is not overly disturbing the morale of the workers' representatives. "It does not bother us," is the response we got yesterday at the People's Center, where people are happy that the increases are not affecting staples. It should be pointed out, however, that the price of fuel oil in particular is going to have an effect on bus and train fares and on other services where fuel oil is essential. But the toughest part may be still to come as far as the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers] is concerned, and the upcoming negotiations with the government are likely to be very stormy.
