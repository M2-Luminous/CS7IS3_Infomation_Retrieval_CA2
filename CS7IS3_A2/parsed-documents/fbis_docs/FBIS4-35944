Al-Bid asked the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to take a decisive stand. He declared that the people in the south are expecting their state to be recognized. In an interview with AL-KHALIJ newspaper today in the city of al-Mukalla, where he is currently residing, he said: I was expecting a decisive stand to be taken. The issue now is the security of the Gulf region, the stability of the people, and the interests of these two countries. Al-Bid affirmed that an effective cease-fire must be the priority. He said that continued fighting, which will go on for a long time, will not stop when Yemen is split in two. He also confirmed that he is ready to take up the issue of unity once again, build new institutions, and take new action, with wisdom and sanity this time round. Al-Bid said that unity is our right. It is not the unity of the House of al-Ahmar, but the unity of Yemen and the Yemeni people. We will continue our peaceful and democratic struggle for this cause. Al-Bid revealed that he has information regarding the delivery of eight Iraqi aircraft the day before yesterday to Sanaa via Tashkent. He believes the mediators are Iranian. He said that there might be Iraqi support for Sanaa through Iran. As for reports about Jordanian aid to Sanaa, al-Bid said: We have information that Jordanian planes are flying to Sanaa carrying ammunition and weapons. On the returns from the oil resources in the south, al-Bid said that Exxon has frozen the profits from sales and deposited them in a bank for both sides. Production, however, continues and is increasing. It has now reached over 150,000 barrels per day. Production in Hadhramaut has reached 130,000 barrels per day. On the reasons for his transfer from Aden to Hadhramaut, al-Bid said: I have come to al-Mukalla for organizational purposes. The region has oil and the people must know that someone is protecting it.
