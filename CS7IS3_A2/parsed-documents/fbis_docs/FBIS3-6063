Trade officials and industry sources said Saturday that major Korean companies have high hopes as they prepare to jump at wider Chinese investment opportunities created by the momentum of the Seoul- Beijing summit. Samsung Electronics Co. and Goldstar Telecommunications Co. have their sights set on Beijing's three-phase communications modernization plan, which is likely to adopt the Korean telecommunications exchange system, time division exchange, for its central communications network, and are poised to expand production at their joint-venture factories in China. Further encouragement comes from a recent visit to Beijing by a team of experts, who were assured by Chinese officials that serious consideration will be given to the TDX system for use in the communications network in the central mainland. One trade official who went with the team said China is disillusioned by the high cost of products from Japan's NEC and France's Alcatel, which are currently used in the network. As a result, they have tentatively decided to add the Korean system due to its price and quality, and are currently conducting a final screening, the official said. Seoul and Beijing are also near agreement on holding a large- scale exhibition of Korean electronic products, sponsored by the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry and Electronics Industry Association of Korea (EIAK), in China sometime before the summer. Hyundai Group Chairman Chong Se-yong and Hyundai Motor Co.'s vice president of exports, Paek Hyo-hi, visited China for four days from Feb. 27 and discussed exports of completed cars and possible joint ventures with senior Chinese officials. Daewoo Group Chairman Kim U-chung, who already visited China last fall, left on an American tour on Friday with automobile executives to sound out opportunities there and will stop in China for the same reason on their way home. Beijing is currently talking about allowing Korean auto exports in return for Korea purchasing Chinese auto parts: One Korean automaker is reportedly near a deal on joint manufacture of auto parts. China, which had stuck to a policy of allowing just eight foreign automakers access to its market to protect its own industry, recently became more flexible by permitting local joint-venture firms to acquire two or more foreign partners. Industry experts predict Beijing may allow more foreign firms to make inroads, citing recent plans to expand production of cars to 2 million units and of commercial vehicles to 1 million by 2000. Korean business leaders are expected to accompany President Kim on his visit to China or go there beforehand to promote their businesses.
