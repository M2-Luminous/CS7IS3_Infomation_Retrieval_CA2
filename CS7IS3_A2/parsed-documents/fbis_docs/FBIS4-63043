He told TASS on Thursday that he had forwarded the resignation to his chief Sergey Stepashin and the latter informed Boris Yeltsin about it. "The resignation was rejected", Savostyanov said. He categorically denied mass media reports that his resignation was prompted by contradictions with Stepashin. An engineer by education Savostyanov came to the counterintelligence bodies during Perestroyka years of Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991. He told TASS that he had offered to resign because he believes that he had fulfilled his mission of "depoliticizing" the counterintelligence agency which used to be a branch of notorious KGB which, in its turn, was controlled by the former Soviet communist party. Savostyanov said he simply wanted to return to public and political activities. Now he will "work with full strength, as far as it is necessary", Savostyanov said, adding that he believes it impossible to insist on his resignation after the president had turned it down.
