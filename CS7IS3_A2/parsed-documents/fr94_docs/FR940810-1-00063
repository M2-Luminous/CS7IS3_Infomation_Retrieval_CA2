(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Arizona which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. (b) Certain of the rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program rules in this chapter. The full text of a cross-referenced rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the Arizona Federal Program. (c) This part applies to all coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Arizona conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. To the extent required by 30 CFR Part 740, this part also applies to operations on Federal lands in Arizona. (d) The information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 in its approval of the information collection requirements contained in the permanent regulatory program. (e) The following provisions of Arizona law generally provide for more stringent environmental control and regulation of some aspects of surface coal mining and reclamation operations than do the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not generally be construed to be inconsistent with the Act, unless in a particular instance the rules in this chapter are found by OSM to establish more stringent environmental or land use controls: (1) The Arizona Commission of Agriculture and Horticulture has authority to abate public nuisances including noxious weeds and noxious weed seeds. A.R.S. Sections 3&hyph;231 to 3&hyph;242. Violation of this statute is a misdemeanor.
