FR941206-1-00065 FR941206-1-00007 In reviewing the data collected by the EPA from industry, industry representatives expressed concern that control devices were ``over-represented'' in the EPA's data base, which indicated approximately 5 percent of major sources were equipped with control devices. Industry felt that they knew of each control device used by the industry and based on their knowledge, they believed no more than 1 percent of major sources were equipped with control devices. The Committee agreed that approximately 1 percent of the major sources are equipped with control devices. While the Act states that the MACT floor analysis shall be based on sources for which the Administrator has emissions information, this does not mean EPA should not use the information it has appropriately. Given that the Committee believed that control devices were over-represented in EPA's data base, the EPA concluded that the MACT floor should be calculated from a population of facilities that includes only 1 (instead of 4) control device (equivalent to 1 percent of the major sources in the data base). The Agency specifically requests comments on this decision. Any supporting data that would justify additional sources or fewer sources with control devices being included in the MACT floor analysis would be welcomed. Using the approaches described above, the average HAP emission level achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources was determined to be 1.0 lb HAP/lb solids (1.0 kg HAP/kg solids), as applied. As discussed in IV.D, the format of the emission limitation was later changed to kilograms of volatile HAP per kilogram of solids, as applied, (kg VHAP/kg solids [lb VHAP/lb solids] as applied). Therefore, the MACT floor for existing sources is 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied. The EPA is considering two possible meanings for the word ``average'' as the term is used above in relation to determining the MACT floor. First, ``average'' could be interpreted as the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements in the set. The EPA has determined that the arithmetic mean of the emissions limitations achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources would yield, in some cases, an emission limitation that fails to correspond to the limitation achieved by any particular technology. In such cases, the EPA would not select this approach. The word ``average'' could also be interpreted as the median emission limitation value. The median is the value in a set of measurements arranged in order of magnitude below and above which there are an equal number of values (i.e., it is the middle value). This approach identifies the emission limitation achieved by those sources within the top 12 percent, arranges those emission limitations by magnitude, and takes the control level achieved by the median source. This is mathematically equivalent to identifying the emission limitation achieved by the source at the 94th percentile level of emission control. Either of these two approaches could be used in developing standards for different source categories. In determining the MACT floor for this source category, the Committee used the approach that interprets the average as the arithmetic mean. The median approach is not feasible for the proposed standards because it would defeat the purpose of having proportional representation of each industry segment. The median approach would select the level of control achieved by one facility, the one at the 94th percentile, and would only represent one industry segment. In addition, the arithmetic mean represents a technically achievable emission limitation for this industry. Of the 11 facilities in the floor, two have an emission limit of 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids. A range of options can be used to meet the 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids limit; the limit does not require the use of either a specific technology or a limited set of technologies. The EPA specifically solicits comments on its interpretation of average in general, and the use of an arithmetic mean for this rule specifically.
