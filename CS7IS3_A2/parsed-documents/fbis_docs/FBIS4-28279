At a Defense Committee meeting of the National Assembly held today, Minister Yi reported: Since 1989, the North Korean Army's military exercise was being continuously reduced but has been restored since the end of last year, and its ground troops' mobile exercise, joint exercise by the Navy and the Air Force, and Army- people cooperative anti-air-raid drill have been conducted very actively since the beginning of this year. In particular, Minister Yi said the Ministry of People's Armed Forces conducted an inspection to evaluate combat-readiness in mid- April and began to do follow-up inspections to confirm it in May. He also reported that North Korea carried out a test fire of a new-type ground-to-ship missile in May and has begun to make preparation for test-firing the Taepodong No. 1, 2, and 3 whose range is more than 1,000 kilometers. Minister Yi said: In summary, we have reached the conclusion [pyongga] that the North Korean Army has entered the highest-level war-readiness posture ever since 1990. As yet, however, there have been no inclination of specifically belligerent moves [kuchejogin tugi tonghyang]. In particular, Minister Yi noted that we cannot ignore the possibility of North Korea's sudden provocation relying on its military superiority in number [sujoguro usehan kunsaryokman midgo ubalchoguro tobalhal kanungsongdo paejehalsu optago] as the difficult situation makes it impossible for North Korea to maintain nuclear transparency while possessing nuclear weapons. He continued: Accordingly, our Army has strengthened its early warning posture and is making every preparation to immediately pursue strong, punishing, and retaliatory operations [chukkak kangnyokang ungjing pobok chakchonul pyolchil modun chunbirul hago idda] against international provocation by the North Korean Army [kukchejok tobal].
