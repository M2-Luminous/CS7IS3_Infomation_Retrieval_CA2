The plant is the only enterprise in Russia which produces fuel for water-moderated water-cooled reactors which is to be shipped to Ukraine in exchange for its nuclear warheads. The first batch of fuel assemblies was shipped to Ukraine in the end of March, deputy director general of the plant Vladimir Rozhkov told TASS on Thursday. The Finance Ministry had to pay for the fuel nearly 30 billion roubles, but the enterprise had received no money so far and cannot buy a number of accessories necessary for the production of nuclear fuel assemblies. Experts of the enterprise warned that reserves will last only for one month. If production stops many Russian nuclear power plants will remain without fuel as well. ``A disruption of nuclear fuel shipments to Ukraine is not ruled out because the state, which is acting as a contractor, does not fulfil its commitments in time,'' Rozhkov said.
