Czech President Vaclav Havel has invited the Central European heads of state to a two-day summit in the Renaissance palace of Litomysl in Bohemia. President Klestil defines his "summit position" for KURIER. [Klambauer] What do you expect of the Central European summit in Litomysl? [Klestil] Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, this area of Central Europe has again become the center of dramatic events in the world. After all, two world wars were caused by Central European problems -- and now we are witnessing the return of evil spirits in the Balkans. Last year, I myself extended the invitation for the first talk of presidents to that effect -- therefore, I am particularly happy about the present increase in the number of participants: It strengthens our efforts for a zone of stability and peace in Central Europe. [Klambauer] Regarding the future of Central Europe: Is the idea of Central Europe still alive -- or is it already nostalgia? [Klestil] President Havel recently talked of the "spirit of Salzburg," which also is supposed to be felt now in Litomysl. We Austrians are closely tied to our neighbors by history and culture. We have been and we still are a community of fate. Today we are unified by freedom, democracy, and a market economy -- but also the joint concern about instability. You see, the strengthening of comprehensive internal and external security is at issue -- this also includes the struggle against uncontrolled mass migration, crime, drug trafficking, and dangerous nuclear power plants. [Klambauer] How are the new democracies of East Europe to be involved? [Klestil] We belong to the explicit supporters of the European Union [EU]'s expansion to the East. And, in the event of a positive referendum in June, we Austrians will also advocate the entry of the young Central European democracies into the European Union as soon as possible. [Klambauer] What does the Austrian president say to the establishment of closer ties with NATO by our East European neighbors? [Klestil] Several Central European states participate in the NATO Partnership for Peace. This is sensible and we Austrians welcome it because it is promoting stability. [Klambauer] And how do you see Austria's role in this "new Central Europe" on the eve of the EU referendum? [Klestil] We Austrians have already very close economic ties with our Central European neighbors today. I would even go so far as to talk of a "docking platform" which we could serve as for our neighbors inside the EU This corresponds to our own interests, our old and new task in the Central European area.
