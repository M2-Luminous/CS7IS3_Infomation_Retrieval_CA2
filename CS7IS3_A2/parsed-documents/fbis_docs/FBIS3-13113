The delegation saw the remains of the savage destruction wrought by the Israeli occupation forces before the heroic town was liberated. The al-Qunaytirah governor briefed the delegation on the sacrifices made by the people of the governorate and the Syrian Arab people to defend the homeland, the Palestinian cause, and the Arab nation's causes. The governor said: Syria is working to realize the just and comprehensive peace expounded by President Hafiz al-Asad -- the peace of the brave. This will restore occupied Arab territories and return rights to their owners, based on UN resolutions. The governor also presented Mr. Darawshah with the shield of liberated al-Qunaytirah. Replying to the governor's speech, Darawshah said: We are pleased to arrive in this governorate, which is a dear part of Syria and the Arab nation. We look forward to the bright future when this part will be merged with the other side of the occupied Golan, which will have to be liberated and returned to Syria and the Arab nation. Darawshah conveyed the love of our people in occupied Palestine and the Golan to the sons of the Syrian Arab people and the wise leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad. Darawshah said: We bow our heads and pay homage to the Syrian people's sacrifices and martyrs for the sake of Palestine and the Arab nation. Concluding his speech, Darawshah said: Victory will inevitably be realized. Occupied Golan will return to Syria. This is the peace we understand, a peace that restores rights their owners and ends Israel's occupation of all occupied Arab territories. This is the cherished peace as described by President Hafiz al-Asad, the peace of the brave. In a statement to the SANA correspondent, Darawshah said: The destruction we have seen demonstrates the savagery of the occupation. This is a deplorable crime by the occupation against al-Qunaytirah. Other acts of aggression and savage practices have been carried out in other parts of Arab countries, especially inside Palestine. Hundreds of villages were destroyed. Thus, the Israeli occupation has added other crimes to its series of criminal actions. Darawshah called for Israel's withdrawal from occupied Golan and for its return to its Syrian owners so Syrians, under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, can rebuild al-Qunaytirah, return its inhabitants, who were driven out, and so it will return to its Syrian mother. Darawshah and his delegation visited the martyrs cemetery, placed a wreath on the martyr's monument, and read prayers for the martyrs' chaste souls. He wrote an article in the visitors' book in which he praised the heroic struggle of the Syrian Armed Forces supported by the heroic Syrian people in defense of Arab territory. Darawshah said: We are certain the darkness of the occupation will end and the Israeli occupation will leave occupied Syrian Golan and all occupied Arab territories.
