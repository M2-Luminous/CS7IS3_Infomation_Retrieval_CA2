FR941206-0-00080 FR941206-0-00011 (iv) The mass of ethylene oxide emitted from the control device outlet (W o ) shall be calculated by continuously monitoring the flow rate and concentration using the following procedure. (A) Measure the flow rate through the control device exhaust continuously during the first evacuation using the procedure found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Test Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate. (Method 2D (using orifice plates or Rootstype meters) is recommended for measuring flow rates from sterilizer control devices.) Record the flow rate at 1-minute intervals throughout the test cycle, taking the first reading within 15 seconds after time zero. Time zero is defined as the moment when the pressure in the sterilizer is released. Correct the flow to standard conditions (20 ○C and 101.325 kPa (68 ○F and 1 atm)) and determine the flow rate for the run as outlined in the test methods listed in paragraph (b) of this section. (B) The Tedlar bag sampling procedure in section 7.1 of Test Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A (hereafter referred to as Method 18) shall be used to collect samples of exhaust gas throughout the test cycle. Follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B)( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of this section. ( 1 ) Continuously sample a slipstream of the control device outlet into a Tedlar bag by having a Tedlar bag attached to the slipstream for the entire duration of the run for an integrated bag sample. Whenever a Tedlar bag is full, a new bag must be reattached immediately. Note the time the bag is changed so the sample time and corresponding flow rates can be determined for each bag. ( i ) Follow the procedures in section 6 of Method 18 and choose the appropriate column, analytical apparatus, and calibration gases for the analysis of the bag samples collected. The bag samples shall be analyzed within 8 hours of collection. ( ii ) Prepare a graph of volumetric flow rate versus time corresponding to the period each bag was sampled. Integrate the area under the curve to determine the volume. ( iii ) Calculate the mass of ethylene oxide for each bag by using the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER06de94.028 where: W b =Mass of ethylene oxide for each bag, g (lb) C=concentration of ethylene oxide in ppmv V=volume of gas exiting the control device corresponding to each bag sample corrected to standard conditions, L (ft3) 1/106=correction factor L EO /106 L TOTAL GAS (ft3 EO /106 ft3 TOTAL GAS )
