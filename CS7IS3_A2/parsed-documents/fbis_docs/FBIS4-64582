I received the mandate from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and from the voters, and I must carry out my duty. I will keep the allies informed," he stressed, "But I will act in accordance with Article 92 of the Constitution." Bossi did not attend the scheduled meeting with Berlusconi and Gianfranco Fini. Fini said that the League "is wrong to make conditions." The obstacle is still the same one: the Interior Ministry.
