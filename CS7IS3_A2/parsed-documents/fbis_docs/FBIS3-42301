But officials are declining comment on whether there was any evidence to indicate that a single group was behind the two blasts. Interior Minister Salamah Hammad confirmed the arrest of five people on Wednesday, one day after a bomb tore through the Salwa movie theatre in al-Zarqa, injuring two people, one of them seriously. The minister said investigations were continuing and that investigators were keeping all possibilities open. Other sources said more arrests were made but did not disclose any details. The Salwa blast followed a similar explosion on January 26 at the Rivoli movie house in downtown Amman which injured seven people, one of them seriously. The common features of the two bombings were that both occurred at establishments screening X-rated movies and the nature of the explosive devices were the same. In addition, the exact place where the bombs, described as crude homemade devices lacking any sophistication, was also the same--near the projection rooms. More importantly, however, according to sources, the bombs were of the same type as that of devices removed and defused before they exploded at two liquor stores over the past six months. In turn, those devices appeared to have been built with the same technique that was used by the extremist underground group called Jaysh Muhammad (Muhammad's Army), the sources said. "It is premature to point the finger at any specific group despite the common features of the explosive devices," said one source. "Anyone who ever worked with the Afghan Mujahidin could have learned the technique." [background passage on Muhammad's Army omitted] The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Brotherhood, has denounced the January 26 bombing, saying violence was not the means to prevent cinemas from showing films that many see as incompatible with the conservative Jordanian society.
