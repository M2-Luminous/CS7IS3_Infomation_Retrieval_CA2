FR940523-2-00045 FR940523-2-00025 [Project No. 2348&hyph;001 Wisconsin] Wisconsin Power & Light Comp.; Availability Of Environmental Assessment May 17, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a subsequent license for the existing Beloit Blackhawk Hydroelectric Project, located on the Rock River in Rock County, Wisconsin, in the city of Beloit, and has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project. On March 10, 1994, staff issued and distributed to all parties a draft EA, and requested that comments on the draft EA be filed with the Commission within 30 days. One comment letter was received for the draft EA and is addressed in the final EA. In the EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
