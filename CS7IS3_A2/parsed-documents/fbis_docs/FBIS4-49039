Speaking at a gathering in Washington D.C. at the invitation of the U.S.-China Business Council, Zou briefed leaders of the U.S. business community on China's reform, opening-up and economic development as they show strong enthusiasm and expectations for closer economic cooperation with China. Zhou said that through its efforts for nearly half a century, China has established a fairly independent and complete economic structure. Its economic success, especially since 1979 has drawn the attention of the world. Compared with 1978, its GDP in 1993 was nearly 4 times as large, showing an average annual growth rate of 9.3 percent over the period, making China one of the fastest growing economies of the world. After outlining a three-step strategy for China's modernization drive formulated in the early 80s, Zou described 1993 as a year which saw China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive move forward vigorously. The gross domestic product of the year was up by 13.4 percent over the previous year in comparable prices and it was the highest annual increase since 1985. High growth has driven reform and opening-up to speed up, two way trade to expand and overseas investment in China to soar. In 1992, overseas investment actually used increased by 160 percent and the figure in 1993 was up by 91.5 percent over 1992. By the end of 1993, China had approved 174,000 overseas invested projects with a contractual value of 217.216 billion U.S. dollars, of which 60.042 billion have been actually invested. The total volume of China's imports and exports in 1993 reached 195.8 billion U.S. dollars, of which imports accounted for about 100 billion dollars. Zou told the gathering that China is speeding up the construction of the Pudong New District in Shanghai in order to turn the city into an international economic, trade, and financial center and at the same time continuing to stress agriculture, basic industries, pillar industries and export-oriented industries and undertaking such large projects as the three gorges hydropower complex. "These no doubt will mean more and better investment opportunities for American businessmen," he said. The basic goal of China's economic restructuring as decided at the Chinese Communist Party's 14th National Congress is to establish a socialist market economy and this is a far-reaching step in the history of China's reform, he stressed. The Chinese vice-premier then turned to the major reform measures of the day, i.e., to transform the operational mechanisms of state- owned enterprises, nurture and develop a market system which will play a basic role of allocating resources under macro-regulation of the state, establish a network of macro-regulation taking indirect regulation as the principal means, and institute a multi-tiered social security system. He assured the American businessmen that China will keep unswervingly to the policy of opening-up to the outside world. He quoted Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform, as saying that "China's open policy will not change for this century, nor the first or second 50 years of the next century. It is hard for anyone to attempt at a change. China's door is sure to open even wider and we will do a better job." An all-directional pattern of openness linking the coast with the hinterland across China is taking shape, Zou said, and "we are ready to develop economic and technological cooperation and exchanges with all friendly countries and people from all walks of life on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." Cooperation can take many forms, he continued. "Trade with us is certainly welcome. But we also hope to see more business people with acumen come to China to invest and set up their own factories, to enter into partnership with Chinese enterprises, or to transfer technology and explore China's market." He listed energy, transportation, telecommunications, agriculture and water conservancy as the areas where China would like to see more investors put their money now and in the years to come. Referring to the problems which were created along with the economic boom, Zou stated that the Chinese Government introduced last June a series of measures aimed at tightening and improving macro-regulation. These timely measures yielded quick and positive results. The financial order and the order in the field of circulation improved markedly and the signs of an economic overheating have been brought under control. "At the present, our market is steady, society stable and people contented. We are convinced that with our efforts, socialist market economy will take root in our country and our economy will continue to enjoy a high and healthy growth for a considerably long time to come," he said.
