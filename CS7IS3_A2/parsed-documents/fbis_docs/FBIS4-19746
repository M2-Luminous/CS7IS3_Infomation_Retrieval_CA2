Durao Barroso met Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] leader Afonso Dhlakama earlier this afternoon. The former is concerned about the withdrawal of a number of countries from the UN contingent in Mozambique. It should be recalled that Italy recently withdrew half of its men. [Begin recording] [Barroso] We must draw attention to what is happening in Mozambique, because unfortunately there are cases where it is only when things go wrong that people remember. Recently we have seen tragic cases in Africa. The case now of Rwanda is a tragic case -- tens of thousands of deaths. Therefore, we think it is better to try to prevent things rather than to act a posteriori. Indeed, a contribution to the formation of the armed forces, and not just the armed forces but also the demobilized men, a contribution to social reintegration, even emergency aid in some areas, would be a way of consolidating this process. [end recording] [Announcer] Durao Barroso also presented a list of support measures Portugal is taking to help the Mozambican electoral process. The cost of maintaining the 4th Army battalion alone is estimated at nearly 7 billion escudos. Afonso Dhlakama will take back to Renamo about 50 million escudos for the electoral campaign, from the Lisbon government.
