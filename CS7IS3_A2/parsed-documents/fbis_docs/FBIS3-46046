Figures just released show that the province has used 380 million yuan loaned by the World Bank, and has since 1980 been aided by international organizations in the development of farm and irrigation projects in the plains and in helping areas hit by disasters. By now, many farm capital projects have been carried out and more than one million hectares of low-yield farmland transformed and improved. One example is a farm project in the plain north of the Huai River in the province, which was listed as part of the overall north China plain agricultural project. Through a ten-year effort with loans from the World Bank, farmers involved in the project have dug and dredged 7,500 kilometers of irrigation canals and ditches dotted with pumping stations; built more than 400 kilometers of roads; installed 1,168 kilometers of cables and planted 47 million trees around the farmland. They have also changed the production pattern, to develop quality and efficient agriculture and animal husbandry while setting up rural industrial enterprises. The work was highly praised by officials of the World Bank who visited Anhui last year.
