The third democratic Uruguayan Government to be chosen following the 12 years of the military regime (1973-1985) will be elected in this vote, which is scheduled for 29 November. The conflictive situation has placed Luis Alberto Lacalle's government in a difficult position, due to a constitutional clause that prevents the party in power from using demagogic methods, and so does not permit salary increases for public employees during an election year. The clause, which is traditionally respected by the government in power and by the labor unions, places obstacles in the way of any type of negotiation, and polarizes the sectors that are in conflict. The problems originated with the settling of increases that had been approved last year, and their updating every four months based on the rate of devaluation and inflation. The government has exerted strict financial control in order to maintain a fiscal balance, which seems to be far from what the public employees from some sectors, especially the judicial branch and the University of the Republic, expected. The stoppages have increased, and the judicial branch has not functioned properly since it reopened after the yearly January vacation closure. The employees are working "as a rule" no more than two hours daily, with continuous stoppages in order to participate in meetings. A meeting has been called for today, and the employees may decide to call an indefinite strike "in view of the insensitivity of the Lacalle administration in not wishing to grant resources to the judicial branch to pay improved salaries," it was stressed. In the university sector, seven colleges have been occupied for a week after professors, students, and officials called for an indefinite strike. The government refuses to hand over fresh resources to the university, and has asked it to reduce expenditures, or at least make the students who can pay tuition fees, as has been authorized, and take deductions from wages for the days employees have been on strike. The autonomous authorities of the university refuse to give up the traditional "free tuition" for higher learning. The strike is also affecting Montevideo's main hospital, which belongs to the university, and scientific research institutes. The conflicts have intensified as the political activities heat up in the search for votes in the national and municipal elections scheduled for November 1994. The last two remaining ministers from the opposition Colorado Party left the cabinet on 5 May in order to participate in the election campaign: Industry Minister Eduardo Ache and Tourism Minister Jose Villar, who were replaced by Miguel Galeano and Mario Amestoy of the National Party (Blanco), which is currently in power. Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle thanked a sector of the Colorado Party for its cooperation and "patriotism" in the government coalition, which was forged on 1 March 1990, but which slowly eroded after the resignations of two of the four opposition ministers in less than two years. The opposition has begun to attack the government, accusing Lacalle of having started the election campaign early with tours in the interior of the country in an attempt to improve the government's image. Lacalle's National Party is, for the first time in history, in third place in the polls, behind the Colorado Party and the leftist coalition Broad Front. The president defends himself in stressing that his government has always been close to the people, and that he has taken on only those tasks that he promised to before becoming president.
