During the attack, the fighters also fired on Iranian border villages, killing and injuring 28 Iranian nationals. The daily cautioned in its editorial that the Kurdish problem was becoming increasingly dangerous for the entire region. "In recent decades the `Kurdish' card has been used by the region's countries as a weapon to intimidate each other," it said. This policy would have worked for a short while, the daily added, "but the recent involvement of Western powers in this affair will inevitably endanger the territorial sovereignty of all the countries involved." The daily recommended regional countries to set aside their differences and work out a practical peaceful solution to this common problem "whose main victims are the Muslim Kurdish civilians." "When the Turkish Government issues diplomatic passports for Iraqi Kurdish leaders and supports them in their efforts to disintegrate Iraq, then it should not be upset when other countries help the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]," the daily said. It stressed that Turkey could not solve its Kurdish problem by "sending 50, or even 500 fighter bombers to massacre the Kurds." The editorial concluded by calling for an end to the "game of politico-military one-upmanship, played by the regional powers using the Kurdish card."
