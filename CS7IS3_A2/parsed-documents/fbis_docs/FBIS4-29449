He said the government will continue to come out with competitive strategy to further strengthen the domestic economy which will be the mainstay of the nation's prosperity. In addition, Singapore must create more economic space by becoming a partner of growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Mr. Yeo was speaking at the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce luncheon. He said given the abundant regional opportunities, Singapore's external economy should grow rapidly to match that of Switzerland and the Netherlands. At present, our level of private investment abroad is only about two-thirds of these two countries. However, Mr. Yeo stressed that Singapore must ensure a right balance between the domestic and external pressures. The growth of the external economy should complement and not fall out with the domestic one.
