Correspondent Viktor Siezieniewski reports: [Siezieniewski] Waldemar Pawlak and Viktor Chernomyrdin's talks lasted longer than scheduled. As both underscored later, it had been a very concrete dialogue of partners interested in breaking the impasse in economic relations. The heads of government did not conceal their satisfaction at the course of the negotiations. I asked Waldemar Pawlak for details. [Begin recording] [Pawlak] We focussed on actions that could bring quick and measurable advantages. Among the long-term actions, it is worth mentioning the prospects for signing a long-term agreement on economic cooperation. It might yield a protocol of agreements for 1994 even this year [as heard], including financial solutions for servicing our cooperation. In the more distant future, there are solutions that, through the activities of our governments, can contribute to the expansion of cooperation between specific enterprises and people, from cooperation in banking and finance, through the building of the infrastructure of transport, railways, highways, and communications, to cooperation concerning strategic raw materials, including the construction of a pipeline for transporting Russian gas to Western Europe. These are the big ventures on which the activities of the governments are to focus in order to create conditions for meetings and contacts at all levels. This would be the practical implementation of our idea, put forward at the beginning of this year, for the partnership for development and multidirectional foreign policy. [Siezieniewski] Did you find a partner in Prime Minister Chernomyrdin? [Pawlak] Yes. We have already decided on a concrete working schedule for particular ministries aimed at reaching practical decisions that will contribute to the expansion of cooperation. We both agreed that the time wasted could not be made up in the future. [Siezieniewski] When will the next meeting be held? [Pawlak] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin will visit Poland in May. Then we will take further steps to make our cooperation at all levels easier. [end recording]
