Kakizawa's remarks appear to contradict Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's statement Saturday that he does not think North Korea possesses nuclear weapons nor intends to build an atomic bomb. "Based on the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), there is no denying that North Korea has extracted some plutonium (from its research reactor in the Yongbyon complex)," Kakizawa told the House of Councillors Foreign Affairs Committee in response to a question. Kakizawa suggested that Hata's remarks expressed anticipation of the truth of claims by North Korean President Kim Il-song that North Korea has neither the will nor the ability to develop nuclear weapons.
