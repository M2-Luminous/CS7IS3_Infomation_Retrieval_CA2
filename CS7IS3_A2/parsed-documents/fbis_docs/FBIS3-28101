With regard to the tax reform, the ruling parities have today entrusted me with the task of working out measures to handle this issue. In this connection, I have prepared a program for an overall reform of the taxation system as stated in the press release that has been distributed among you, and I would like to submit this program to the Diet. Now, let me explain the major points of this program: First of all, the reduction of such taxes as the income tax and resident tax will amount to a total of 5.5 trillion yen, and this tax cut plan will be put into effect on 1 January 1994. Second, we will create a national welfare tax, though in only a small amount, and abolish the consumption tax. And this plan will be put into effect on 1 April 1997. The taxation rate will be set at seven percent. At the meetings of representatives of the council on economic issues and of leaders of both the government and ruling coalition that were concluded just now, I obtained their understanding that I am going to submit this program to the Diet as a government proposal. As a result of the implementing this program, revenue for the national finances will be reduced by 18 trillion yen in three years, In other words, the increase of income for the household economy in the amount of 18 trillion yen in three years will have the effect of an upturn in business. At present, Japan is becoming an aging society at a pace which is several times faster than in the United States or in European countries. And it is our responsibility to build our society into an affluent one that will never lose its vitality, even when becoming an aging society. On New Year's Day, I announced a vision for greeting the 21st century, and I would like to build an affluent society with vitality by promoting this vision. And in the course of promoting this vision, I will take measures to ensure social security and improve our living environment and social infrastructure. And it goes without saying that it will take an enormous amount of expenditure to carry out such a vlsion. In studying the existing taxation system -- in other words, the framework as to how our people share the burden of taxes -- it is noted that too much emphasis has been imposed on income taxation, and too much of a burden has been imposed on those who are in the prime of life. This fact has been pointed out frequently, and if such a situation were left as it is, more and more of a burden would be imposed on those who are in the prime of life, and as a result, they are bound to lose vitality. And I have been repeating that this [current] system will certainly result in such a situation. To support the aging society, we must somehow reduce the burden imposed on those who are in the prime of life. In other words, I feel that we will have to reduce taxation on incomes but raise the rate of taxation on consumption so as to work out a framework based on all the people sharing the cost of supporting the aging population. Since we will be asked to take responsibility for the future, I believe that when viewed from the standpoints that I have just stated, we should never leave the existing taxation system as it is now. And since I delivered my policy speech to the Diet, I have persistently stated at the Diet sessions held so far that it Is necessary to promote an overall tax reform based on the Tax Commission's recommendations so that a system of well-balanced taxation an incomes, assets, and consumption can be worked out. With regard to the issuance of deficit-covering bonds, for which no sources of repayment can be secured, I have repeatedly stated that it must be handled with the greatest caution. I have made such remarks repeatedly because I feel that our future generations, who will support the aging society, should not be asked to pay for this burden. At the same time, it goes without saying that the top priority task for the cabinet is to eliminate an idea that future prospects for the economy still remain opaque, and also to ensure that economy will recover in fiscal 1994. Based on these views, I have just obtained an understanding at the meeting of representatives of the council on economic issues and of leaders of the government and ruling coalition that the government will submit the program, a copy of which has been distributed among you, to the Diet as an official program. And I would also like to seek the understanding of all our people. This Is the report I wanted to make to you.
