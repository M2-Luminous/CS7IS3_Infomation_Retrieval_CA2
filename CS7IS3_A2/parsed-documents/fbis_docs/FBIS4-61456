Republic's Leaders Think This Will Help Fight Crime"] [Text] One more nightmarish novelty -- seeing executions on your home television -- may soon be added to the horrors taking place in the post-Soviet space. The news agency POSTFACTUM has learned from unofficial sources close to the president's staff that the public relations department has "for a long time and seriously" been discussing the possibility of such broadcasts on the Republic's television. Should this rather extravagant idea be approved by the Republic's parliament, the department's staffers would begin drawing up corresponding documents. Local observers believe such broadcasts would prove to be the biggest "box-office" shows. Major General Sutalinov, the Republic's minister of internal affairs, has stated in this regard that in a civilized state such educational measures are unacceptable, but "in our bleak living even the impossible is possible." "Neighboring Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] went for it but it has hardly improved the crime situation in the fraternal republic," the general pointed out. This is essentially simply savagery, and it is not going to help combat crime a bit. On the contrary, having grown to be a customary sight, death would erode the principles of humanism in people's minds because violence, even in the form of punishment, only breeds violence.
