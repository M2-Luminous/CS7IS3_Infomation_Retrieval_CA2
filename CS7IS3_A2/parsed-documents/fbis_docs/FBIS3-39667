"We want funds to set up a food inspection system, but the EU Commission doesn't want to use funds for this purpose, and so all payments to our public health sector have been halted," says Dr. Tritan Shehu, Albania's health minister. The EU Commission has earmarked DKr48 million, which has simply not been touched. In addition, another DKr160 million for renovating hospitals is untouched, because the Commission is requiring Albanian economic participation. Altogether over the past three years, Albania has been granted DKr1.2 billion for EU programs, and the two largest grants totaling DKr560 million were outright gifts for this poor country. EU Parliament member Freddy Blak, who has investigated the catastrophic conditions in Albanian institutions, is meeting today with Commission officials to ask for help.
