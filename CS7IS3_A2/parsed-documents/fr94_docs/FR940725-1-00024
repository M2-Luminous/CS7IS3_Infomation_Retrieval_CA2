FR940725-1-00024 FR940725-1-00005 The principal objective of the Further Notice is to promote vigorous competition in the CMRS marketplace through the development of attribution rules that prevent any CMRS licensee from gaining an unfair competitive advantage. C. Legal Basis The proposed action is authorized under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;66, Title VI, §6002(b), and Sections 3(n), 4(i), 303(r), 309, 332(c), and 332(d) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. §§153(n), 154(i) and 303(r), 309, 332(c), and 332(d), as amended. D. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements The proposals under consideration in the Further Notice may impose certain new reporting and recordkeeping requirements on mobile services licensees. E. Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate, or Conflict With These Rules None. F. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved Many small entities could be affected by the proposals contained in the Further Notice. Dependent on the final resolution of the issues, regulations affecting the licensing, recordkeeping, and reporting obligations of numerous mobile services providers may be changed. The full extent of these changes cannot be predicted until various other issues raised in the proceeding (e.g., whether a CMRS spectrum cap will be established by the Commission) have been resolved. After evaluating the comments filed in response to the Further Notice the Commission will examine further the impact of all rule changes on small entities and set forth its findings in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. G. Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent With the Stated Objectives The Further Notice solicits comment on a variety of alternatives. Any additional significant alternatives presented in the comments will also be considered. H. IRFA Comments We request written public comment on the foregoing Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. Comments must have a separate and distinct heading designating them as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines provided in paragraph 13 of the Further Notice.
