An AVF statement condemned what it called, "the one-sided imposition of the state of emergency on kwaZulu/Natal by (State President) F W de Klerk on the instructions of the African National Congress". It said the state of emergency was an act of aggression against the Zulu nation and, in particular, the king and Mr Buthelezi. The state of emergency was also a sign that negotiations had failed. The election now needed to be postponed, the statement said.
