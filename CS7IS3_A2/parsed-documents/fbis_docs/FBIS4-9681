FBIS4-9681 "drlat062_n_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-062 Daily Report 21 Mar 1994 Chile Interior Minister Correa Interviewed Interior Minister Correa Interviewed PY3003203094 Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 21 Mar 94 pp 30, 31, 34 PY3003203094 Santiago ESTRATEGIA Spanish BFN [Interview with Interior Minister German Correa by unidentified reporter in Santiago; date not given] [Text] [ESTRATEGIA] As a militant Socialist Party [PS] member, what significance do you give your appointment as interior minister from the personal and political point of view? [Correa] It is a great responsibility, a great challenge. I hope to do a good job because this position exerts major influence on the progress of the government. As a PS militant, I can say that President Eduardo Frei's gesture to appoint me to this post when I was PS president is a very clear sign of his strong inclination for consensus and the consolidation of this coalition [Coalition of Parties for Democracy, CPPD] that has been so beneficial to the country. Therefore, my appointment to this position also has a very important political and symbolic value. [ESTRATEGIA] Does your appointment signify official recognition of the socialist world? [Correa] I believe so. This brings an end to a very traumatic phase not only of disagreements and conflicts that culminated violently in the 1973 military coup but to all that happened during the 17 years of the military regime. It shows our determination for not only analyzing, even to a heartbreaking point, our past but also our contributions to this process. It is also evidence of our ability to govern responsibly and seriously by giving guarantees to all Chileans without any distinctions. My appointment has finally vindicated our capability to have a serious government in this country. [ESTRATEGIA] Would it have been the same if a Christian Democratic Party [PDC] member was appointed interior minister, for example? [Correa] From the point of view of the interior minister's functions, it is inconsequential who is exercising these duties because we must abide by what is established in the Constitution, which is the institutional order that establishes the duties of this post within the framework of the government and society. This is inconsequential from this point of view. I will be exercising this post to the best of my abilities and strictly adhering to the Constitution and the established institutional order. [ESTRATEGIA] From the CPPD point of view, what is the significance of the appointment of a Socialist to this cabinet post? [Correa] The CPPD has worked well. It has clearly shown its coherence in how it governed the country during the Aylwin administration. This coherence also will be clearly evident during the Frei administration because there is major consensus regarding what we want to achieve in the country. [ESTRATEGIA] During the previous administration's first stage, when you were a cabinet member, Senator Ricardo Nunez (PS) charged that the government was isolating itself. Did you agree with this assessment? [Correa] At the time not only I but also several administration members agreed with this PS criticism. There is an inclination to isolate yourself, to enclose yourself in government offices and internal government mechanisms that are very demanding. This is why we made some self-criticism at the time. We held several meetings in the Prieto room in this regard. As a result, we were able to overcome this isolation and achieve more fluent ties with people outside the government and have greater contact with people. [ESTRATEGIA] How will you keep this from happening, because President Frei has stressed the idea of governing in the field? [Correa] We are aware of this constant danger, but in this case we have anticipated events. Moreover, we have a president whose style is to work in the field, and very soon he will be putting this into practice. But of course one has to follow the boss because he is the leader. Realistic Agenda [ESTRATEGIA] As chief of the political cabinet, given that the Socialists wanted to stress the political-institutional calendar, up to what point do you agree with the preestablished agenda? [Correa] President Frei has been very clear about this. That apparent controversy among some CPPD member parties was solved when we all agreed to prioritize economic and social subjects. In this field we have the Aylwin administration's experience that clearly shows that the right firmly opposes certain kinds of reforms. What we must do is feel the water before jumping into the pool of reforms; we must first work and seek a point in common with the opposition, establish a dialogue, and discuss things. Some other reforms, like to again allow the president of the Republic to appoint Armed Forces commanders, are very controversial. There is no agreement about this, and we will have to work more slowly and with more patience on it, seeking a consensus. The issue here is rhythm and strategy in order to make progress toward objectives that are not shared by all. [ESTRATEGIA] Minister, don't you think that by postponing such subjects we are running the risk that something similar to what happened with the Senate president election might happen again? [Correa] No. The decision is not to postpone the issue but to begin working on it now, in a manner so as to obtain results. Because what could we do now? Send the same draft bills that were rejected by the right and put them on Congress' agenda, perhaps with some changes, and then go to the fight? We will not gain anything from such a position. The most important thing is to establish a dialogue with the opposition, see what country we want from the political and institutional point of view, without seeking advantages, within normal democratic dynamics between government and opposition. [ESTRATEGIA] From your point of view, what reform do you consider the most urgent one? [Correa] There is a package of four very important reforms connected to the National Security Council's composition, the Constitutional Court, and the president's ability to appoint the forces of order and Armed Forces commanders. Public Security [ESTRATEGIA] What is the meaning of the interministerial committees that will be created, as announced by the government, and specifically what will be the differences from the former administration's work? [Correa] The former government had experience with interministerial committees. They are institutions that allow mutual dialogue and knowledge among the ministries, and they also allow the coordination of projects and the collective adoption of decisions so as to establish priorities in public investments in different fields; besides, they allow better administration. We will continue with that positive experience and make some changes to it to guarantee greater efficiency and continue making progress. An important concrete change is the division of the social-economic committee into a social committee and an economic committee. The interministerial social committee will concentrate mainly on poverty problems. It also has a very important characteristic because it is directly presided over by the president of the Republic. This shows the importance the government assigns to a frontal confrontation of the country's poverty problem. [ESTRATEGIA] In addition to poverty, citizens also are greatly concerned about an issue handled directly by your ministry: public security. What measures will be adopted to improve public security? [Correa] We will start by studying the important measures we inherited from the previous administration on an important work they achieved: the proposed social safety plan... [ESTRATEGIA] Excuse me, sir, but when did the past administration achieve this? [Correa] Quite a lot of progress was achieved but there is obviously much more to be done. Much progress has been achieved by increasing police personnel and equipment but a lot remains to be done in this field. We must continue the training programs for police cadres, and achieve greater community involvement in public security activities not merely by establishing private guard groups but by adopting a different attitude toward citizens' participation in social safety. There are many undetected social attitudes that promote crime such as the lack of preventive measures, and inconsiderate common behavior encouraging criminal activities that increase the job of the police, thus making it very difficult for them to perform well. There is a major task regarding the activities to be carried out by police and by society in general if we are to achieve a safer and more peaceful society. [ESTRATEGIA] As for the terrorist issue, what is the government's assessment in this regard? [Correa] The government's assessment is positive. A lot of progress was made in this regard during the previous administration. There was coordinated work among police institutions and the government itself. This resulted in the dismantling of violent groups, which today are in precarious shape. Nevertheless, no one can declare victory because all these groups need to be active is a small armed group of daring individuals and the element of surprise to cause a tragic incident. At any rate, these groups have experienced a major diminishment of their capability to undertake action. Nevertheless, we must always be alert and continue consolidating democracy. Ultimately, what matters is to prevent these groups from spreading in our society. This will be achieved through growth and development, the creation of jobs for the young, giving more opportunities to people, and the defeat of poverty. [ESTRATEGIA] Some sectors believe that the granting of pardons is synonymous with impunity. Can the granting of pardons harm the fight against terrorism? [Correa] I don't think so. We must not overlook the fact that the CPPD as a whole -- not only the Aylwin administration and now the Frei administration -- at the proper time clearly established the differences between a political prisoner and terrorist violence. The ruling party coalition unanimously agreed by consensus that as 11 September 1990 -- when, as is the case of President Aylwin's election, a Chilean Government elected by the will of the people in a democratic election was installed -- democracy was fully restored in Chile with all its shortcomings. Therefore, these actions cannot continue to be portrayed as political crimes as such but as outright terrorist actions. In view of this, President Aylwin implemented these pardons. It must be noted that during the authoritarian regime these people were treated with an absolute lack of respect for their basic rights. Many of these prisoners were incarcerated for prolonged periods without due process, virtually condemning them before the issuance of a valid court sentence. There are dramatic cases in which, after spending years in prison, those involved were acquitted because there was insufficient evidence to punish them for their behavior, that is, no crime was ever committed. In many instances, the accused served a kind of anticipated sentence. Now many people will issue their opinion on this matter. As President Aylwin has always maintained, this is a matter of conscience in the end. In one way or the other, a very tragic chapter in the history of Chile is closing with this issue. Nevertheless, part of this chapter is still not closed because the trials on serious human rights violations during the military regime, which have been confirmed by all Chileans, still are pending. I believe that instead of harboring resentments from such a harsh and traumatic period for our country, all this should be part of a past we must try to overcome so we can restore the proper guidelines of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect. [ESTRATEGIA] Minister, do you think the prisoners President Aylwin pardoned recently were political prisoners? [Correa] That is the way the coalition as a group defined them. Their actions were politically motivated. They were wrong in my opinion, as I made clear in my capacity as a political leader. At the time of their crime I was president of the Popular Democratic Movement, which was defined by the military regime as the group making the harshest opposition to their continuation in government. In that capacity, I was also a strong critic of the attack against General Augusto Pinochet. I was a member of Clodomyro Almeyda's Socialist Party and that was not our line of action. We promoted mass mobilizations and incorporating millions of Chileans in the democratic struggle. This struggle finally and happily materialized in the plebiscite. We participated in the plebiscite actively. We did not support any direct action like the attempt to assassinate Gen. Pinochet. [ESTRATEGIA] Do you think the president's decision to pardon political prisoners was correct? [Correa] I share his decision. We must remember that his pardon only changes their imprisonment to exile. We all know what it means not to be able to live in the fatherland. It means not to share in the cultural and human essence of Chilean society. The many thousands of exiles during the military regime know very well what it means to live outside of the country without the possibility of returning for many years. [ESTRATEGIA] Do you agree with the pardon as a presidential prerogative? [Correa] Yes. The pardon must exist as a prerogative. There are always special cases. The prerogative must be used in exceptional cases. It must be so as a matter of principle. I have no doubt that presidents will use that prerogative after carefully analyzing values, principles, and all the elements that influenced the behavior of the person considered for a pardon. [ESTRATEGIA] Among President Aylwin's latest decisions, there was a pardon granted to an opposition party follower charged with involvement in economic crimes. What is your opinion about this pardon? [Correa] Former President Aylwin must have considered the entire group of elements defining the situation. I am not aware of the details of the case, but President Aylwin must have considered them carefully. He probably found among those elements enough cause to grant the pardon in conscience. [ESTRATEGIA] Will that practice continue during this government? [Correa] The pardon is a juridical institution, a prerogative of the president of the Republic. Each case must have exceptional characteristics for a president to make use of that prerogative. I trust it will always be so. [ESTRATEGIA] One of the issues that worries the country is corruption. Various cases of irregularities involving public servants were reported during the past government. What will this administration do to prevent those problems from reoccurring? [Correa] We must be precise in the use of terms and how we characterize situations. I do not think there was corruption in President Aylwin's government. There were irregularities, which is something different from corruption as such. Some of the cases involving alleged corruption are being investigated. No one can close his eyes to the possibility of corruption, no doubt about it. There are risks. There are relations between businessmen and politicians that invite corruption. There are situations inside a public office that facilitate corruption. But we should not forget that for corruption to exist two individuals must participate. In general terms, the blame affects more the person who has been corrupted, the person who accepted the bribe. Those who gave the bribe, and who often initiate the corrupt act, usually are not taken into account. This is a more complex issue. Eduardo Frei's government will do everything necessary in the areas of supervision, prevention, auditing, and controls. We are working on the design of specific measures. We have been in power for a very short time. [ESTRATEGIA] Will you also promote legislation on the matter? [Correa] We will do that as well. We will reinforce the comptroller and other organizations' existing supervision capacity. Regarding Codelco's [Copper Corporation] case, we think Cochilco [expansion unknown], which was responsible for auditing Codelco, performed rather weak work. We do not think they did their job very well. We must see that existing mechanisms work properly in public administration. The government will have to create responsibilities or control mechanisms wherever supervision is weak. But above all we must transmit a message to society, because there are multiple forms of corruption and citizens indulge in them every day. The fight against corruption is not the sole responsibility of the government though. We will fight it as best as we can, but citizens also must look at their own behavior and ethical norms. [ESTRATEGIA] The political class has a more elegant corrupt practice. It is called influence peddling. People from your own party have denounced it. What do you think of it? [Correa] In effect, we have influence peddling. When you are in very important positions you perceive it, but you can fight it. When I was transportation minister, I had the opportunity to handle multi-million dollar projects. We made important decisions, such as the one involving subway Line Five, which is a $300 million project. We had to organize bids involving the purchase of equipment for $100 million to $150 million. I oversaw the bidding on Santiago's street lights, which was worth $16 million, and many other large projects involving millions in investments. You can create technical commissions, involve people from many areas to prevent government people alone from making the decision. You can create bid evaluation teams to analyze economic proposals and all stages of the process to grant a contract to a company. There are ways to ensure clarity, to be reassured, and reassure the population. All mechanisms created to prevent conspiracies to commit corruption must be implemented. When you do things that way you can guarantee that the risk of corruption will be reduced to a minimum. It might even be eliminated. [ESTRATEGIA] But are you aware that not everyone acted in that manner during the previous administration? [Correa] I am perfectly aware of it, and it is very regrettable. We must reinforce the perception of what a public official should be and the immense responsibility that the management of public funds signifies. Public officials are there to safeguard these funds and to make them yield the best profits for the country's well-being. At the proper time I pointed out that I thought it was immoral to allow the National Railroad Company to continue losing 21 billion pesos per year, that is, to lose from $60 million to $80 million, just to keep it under state management. I must remind you that I am responsible for promoting a bill that resulted in the privatization of railroad freight services, a very lucrative railroad department. Based on very strict upholding of the meaning of the use of public funds -- which belong to all Chileans -- and of strict adherence to good management policies for public resources, we can achieve progress in the fight against corruption. Moreover, we must always be very alert, implement measures, and change responsibilities within the public administration when there is suspicion that strange things may be occurring. [ESTRATEGIA] The Frei administration has inherited the Codelco problem. There is a very serious charge before the Chamber of Deputies on an alleged marketing network reportedly involving past and current administration officials. How is the government going to handle such a complex case? [Correa] We have undoubtedly inherited a very complex case, but President Frei has been very explicit in stating that everything must be investigated to the very last detail so that all responsibilities are clarified, that once these responsibilities are established the proper legal proceedings will be undertaken to the bitter end if criminal actions are proven, of course. The basic procedure is to investigate everything, not allowing anything to be hidden and, of course, not covering up anything. It is much more detrimental for a government to strive to diminish the damage that these kind of situations might cause, to try to minimize or cover up the impact, than to disclose the full truth. It is much healthier for an administration to do this because public credibility is essential for the strengthening of democracy. [ESTRATEGIA] Finally, do you agree with the assessment made by Aylwin at the end of his term that there will an increase in social demands and an unfavorable international economic scenario? [Correa] We are aware that we will be facing situations that might not be as favorable as those of the previous administration. But I do not believe the situation will be as dramatic as to say that this administration will be facing serious difficulties. It is possible that we might face more social demands, but it is also true that much has been done and that much more will be done by this administration in this regard, starting with the emphasis President Frei is putting into the fight against corruption. This is a difficult issue because it entails huge resources. It entails a nationwide effort but we believe the proper conditions are there to achieve this goal. Even the opposition has expressed its willingness to cooperate on this issue. If we are able to achieve this goal, if we are able to maintain an important growth level, which perhaps may not be as high as expected because of prevailing international conditions, by generating new job sources, these situations can be confronted. Moreover, we also will be able to overcome complicated situations by granting workers, and people in general, greater freedom to exercise their rights, and we must perfect the legislation that limits these rights to do this.
