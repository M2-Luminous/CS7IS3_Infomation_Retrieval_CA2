Although TA SR [News Agency of the Slovak Republic] has not issued this report yet, the secretariat of Roman Kovac confirmed it. Ludmila Bulakova interviews Roman Kovac: [Bulakova] If someone is leaving office, it is appropriate to clear the desk. You can attempt symbolically to do something similar by clarifying some questions connected with your post as deputy prime minister. Many have been surprised by your rebelliousness--you have always been considered in general as a soft person who has been brought into the world of big politics by Vladimir Meciar. That is why some hold it against you that you publicly stood up against his line. Such practice is foreign to advanced democracies. [passage omitted] What was the famous last straw that broke the camel's back? [Kovac] I think it was the meeting with the deputies (in Plachtincie) where it was quite clear that we had slowly lost the ability to persuade people about the strengths of our policy. [passage indistinct] [Bulakova] I will revert to your open stand against the official line of the prime minister because your former party colleague and former ambassador to Austria, Rudolf Filkus, also began by criticizing the government policy as an official party representative. That met, at that time, with a controversial assessment, not only in the camp of the commentators but also among politicians. It is not a habit in the European countries, which we would like to join, for an official representative of the government to criticize its policy. Resignation first and then criticism is considered a better way. You, despite the aforementioned experience with Rudolf Filkus, chose the opposite direction. Why? [Kovac] I should like to correct this. My stand did not result in any fundamental criticism of the work of the government. I criticized the political situation into which the government had gotten--that is the crisis in parliament or simply the will of the parliament to pass important bills--that is the cooperation of the parties, or possible cooperation of political entities proved untenable. And, together with the deputies, we proposed a certain solution that, I admit, was a very untraditional solution but could have calmed the political situation temporarily. I indeed thought it would create a government of experts, which would have bridged a certain period up to the early elections. The early elections would have cleared the political scene. This proposal could have been reasonable from Slovakia's point of view, not from the viewpoint of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], not from the point of view of the existing government, but from the point of view of Slovakia. [Bulakova] The prime minister says about you that you have betrayed not only him but also the movement by having discussions behind his back not only with the opposition political parties but also with the president. There even was a rumor that you were a candidate for the future prime minister of the temporary government. [Kovac] I have stressed many times that the proposal we came up with was not a traditional one, and, naturally, it had to be discussed. In fact, we discussed it within the official boundaries of the parliamentary deputy group. If you speak about the possibility of treason and the possibility of the deputies who were or are dissatisfied with the situation in our country, even the deputies who are in the movement, one has to stress two points: One point is when the deputy deviates from his election program, and the second is when the election program is not fulfilled. [passage omitted] A new political entity should bring new principles into political work and be open-ended, which means that its fate depends on further talks, which appear very promising indeed, with other political entities, and the aim should be setting up a strong center bloc because I think that, in this transitory stage, center politics could lead towards success.
