Units of our valiant Armed Forces of the 8th Brigade of the Special Forces, the 56th Brigade, and the al-Wahdah Brigades have managed, thanks to God's grace and massive support from our masses in the Governorates of al-Bayda' and Abyan, to topple the last defensive fortifications in the region [word indistinct] and move across Mukayris in the direction of Abyan, where, at 0230 yesterday [2330 GMT on 5 May], they joined the forces of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade in Abyan Governorate. Thus, these forces have reassembled and formed, together, a striking force in the hands of unity and constitutional legitimacy to inflict defeat on the forces of apostasy which have deviated from the popular will and consensus. At the same time, the heroes of the al-'Amaliqah forces continued to present valiant resistance to the ferocious, aggressive attack by the forces of treachery and treason. The al-'Amaliqah forces fought fierce battles and confronted an intensive sea and air offensive. During these battles, they destroyed four tanks and four armored cars and shot down four of the attacking aircraft of the forces of secession. Large numbers of the attacking forces have surrendered and declared their defection to the al-'Amaliqah forces and their support for unity and constitutional legitimacy against secession. At the same time, the heroes of the 2d Armored Division in al-Rahah have waged violent, heroic, and fierce battles against the aggressor forces, which were dispatched by the elements of apostasy and secession from the al-'Anad and the 'Abbud and al-Buzah Brigades, and forced them to retreat after they beat back numerous attacks and valiantly confronted the attacks by the enemy aircraft affiliated with the elements of apostasy, which have been carrying out extensive sorties to attack the heroes of the 2d Armored Brigade since the day before yesterday. Our heroes of the air defense forces downed three of the attacking enemy aircraft. In another development, the al-Hamzah Camp Forces and the 3d Infantry Brigade are continuing their steady advancement to achieve their objectives and to pursue the rebelling secessionist elements and forces. In a cowardly and treacherous action, which reveals the extent of the hidden rancor and plotting, exposes the true nature of the evil and wicked intentions against the freedom and security and safety of the people, and which clearly shows the truth of that uncivilized project that developed in the minds of that criminal gang as a bloody project for killing, terror, sabotage, destruction, and enmity toward the homeland and people and their achievements, the leaders of the separatist, criminal gang, led by war criminal al-Bid and one of his traitorous henchmen, Haytham Qasim Tahir, carried out a cowardly missile raid on the valiant capital city of Sanaa, the capital of the unity state and the symbol of steadfastness and victory, targeting innocent citizens, civilians targets, and vital installations in it. However, God's will was lying in wait for their rancor and wickedness. Their treacherous missiles did not succeed, and some of them sustained damage in the air. At 1345 [1045 GMT], the forces of treachery and treason indiscriminately fired five Scud missiles against the inhabitants of Sanaa and civilian installations in the city. Two of them landed but did not explode. The three others exploded. No significant damage occurred, except for spreading panic among children, the elderly, and women who were asleep at the time of the treacherous and cowardly attack. The forces of rancor and rebellion also carried out similar missile raids on the valiant city of Ta'izz. However, these missiles failed to achieve their objectives, except for further frightening the peaceful residents of the city, which they deceitfully wanted to be the venue for signing the accord document. God has willed that this treacherous aggression be repulsed and the criminal killers be defeated after their true nature was exposed to the people and the world, and after the masks were removed from their ugly faces, which deceived no one other than their hateful persons and deluded loyalists. As part of their hostile schemes and objective of escalating the comprehensive war and spreading sedition in the homeland, those forces launched air raids on the headquarters of security and the al-Mashari' camp area in the city of 'Ataq in Shabwah Governorate, targeting the lives of heroic security men in Shabwah and the lives of our innocent citizens, who confronted the forces of apostasy, secession, and repression with unparalleled valiance, forcing them to retreat. The source added that the secessionist, rebellious forces of oppression and aggression will never escape just and urgent punishment as a result of all that has taken place, the bloodshed that they have caused, and their looting of public funds. They are marching down the road to suicide after they squandered the people's funds to purchase arms in order to maliciously kill the people, their children, and the personnel of their Armed and Security Forces. They want to destroy all the political, developmental, and democratic achievements that have been realized in the homeland throughout the march of the Yemeni 26 September and 14 October revolutions. At the same time, they pushed our people and their Armed Forces into the incinerator of death and destruction in a suicidal losing battle, during which they had their share of defeat, shame, and disgrace. These criminals and slaughterers are pushing deceived, innocent people into the remaining military units to kill them and shed their blood in the battlefield against their brothers and comrades-in-arms without a clear objective or honorable purpose. Rather, the sole objective of that criminal, secessionist, oppressive gang is to enjoy peace, leisure, and safety after they evacuated their families and relatives abroad, looted public funds, sold the people's public facilities, collected huge amounts of money and put them in secret accounts in foreign banks. As for the down-trodden Yemeni people who are suffering from the crisis they have fabricated, whether in Aden, Ta'izz, Lahij, Hadhramaut, Sanaa, Abyan, Sa'dah, Shabwah, al- Hudaydah, al-Maharah, and elsewhere, their share has been death and destruction. The source refuted the false allegations being reiterated by their trumpets. The source explained that what is being broadcast about the military situation calls for ridicule and disdain. In addition, it is meant to deceive foreign public opinion. As for the Yemenis, they are being kept abreast of all the facts. These allegations reflect the state of defeat, weakness, and the blind confusion within the gang of rebellion and crime as it prepares for packing up to flee abroad. The source said it is ridiculous for this gang and its sources to continue to talk about missiles from their aircraft hitting the Presidential Palace when they know these are false claims, that citizens in these and other cities know this, and that those whom it is trying to convince outside the country do not believe it. The best proof of this is that it has continued to talk, until yesterday, about the steadfastness and fighting of the Ba Suhayb Forces in Dhamar, when the fighting with these troops was settled last Wednesday [4 May], less than three hours after they had ignited the fire of war at the behest of that secessionist gang, led by war criminal al-Bid and his secessionist clique. Those troops surrendered to the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy. In addition, the commander of the Ba Suhayb Camp, Colonel Thabit Muthanna Dawwas, half brother of war criminal Haytham Qasim Tahir, was captured two days ago by the forces of unity and legitimacy. He is being interrogated now, after igniting fighting and then leaving the personnel of his camp to confront the fire of battle and death. He fled less than one hour after he issued orders. We do not know what else the source can claim or brag about when it watched, along with the whole world, Colonel Dawwas on television yesterday, explaining the truth, speaking about the defeat inflicted on his troops and the catastrophe he caused. As for talking about the steps taken by those units, which are under the control of the secessionist gang, it is a laughable matter that insults the people's intelligence and does not merit a reply because its falseness will be exposed by stark facts. Many facts will expose the delusion and deception practiced by the propaganda machine of the criminal secessionist gang, so our people and foreign public opinion will know how low this gang sinks in it lies. These elements think they are smart enough to fool people. But lies will eventually be exposed and stark facts will continue to refute falsehood and delusion. Our people realize this is a lying, criminal, and evil gang. It sustains defeats daily, because, by its arrogant false pride, it wanted to stand against the people's will, which springs from God's will. If God helps you, none can overcome you. [Koranic verse]
