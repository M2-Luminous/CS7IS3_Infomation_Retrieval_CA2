(3) At a minimum, the Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue any claim by initial billings and with three progressively stronger demands at not more than 30 day intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, legal action in the judicial system of the cooperating country shall be pursued unless: (i) Liability of the third party is not provable, (ii) The cost of pursuing the claim would exceed the amount of the claim, (iii) The third party would not have enough assets to satisfy the claim after a judicial decision favorable to the cooperating sponsor, or (iv) Maintaining legal action in the country's judicial system would seriously impair the Cooperating Sponsor's ability to conduct an effective program in the country. A Cooperating Sponsor's decisions not to take legal action, and reasons therefore, must be submitted in writing to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache for review and approval, and the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require the Cooperating Sponsor to obtain the opinion of competent legal counsel to support its decision. A Cooperating Sponsor may request approval to terminate legal action after it has commenced for any of the exceptions described above or if CCC determines that it is otherwise appropriate to terminate legal action prior to judgment. In each instance the Agricultural Counsel or Attache must provide the Cooperating Sponsor with a written explanation of its decision. If the Agricultural Counselor or Attache approves a Cooperating Sponsor's decision not to take further action on the claim for reasons described in paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, the Cooperating Sponsor shall assign the claim to CCC and shall provide to CCC all documentation relating to the claim.
