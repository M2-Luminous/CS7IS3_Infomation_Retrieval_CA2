According to Hsiao Wan-chang, the plan has achieved success in promoting investment by the private sector. He said that economic growth is expected to increase to 6.3 percent in the second half of 1994. The data presented by Hsiao Wan-chang yesterday show that the plan has played its role in bringing the economic growth rate within the target area. The achievements include: 1. Major investment plans have increased by a large margin. During the period between July 1991 and April 1994, 54 major investment plans have been filed with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with each plan involving more than NT$ [New Taiwan dollars] 200 million. The total investment amount in this period is estimated at NT$254.9 billion. There will be 93 major investment plans in 1994, with a total investment amount of NT$146.9 billion, an increase of 54 percent over 1993. These figures demonstrate that the economic plan has achieved success in promoting investment by the private sector. 2. The rate of investment by the private sector has returned to the target area. In the second half of 1993, investment by the private sector increased by 9.2 percent. Invigorated by the plan, the private sector increase its investments by 18.7 percent in the first quarter of this year. It is estimated that the investment growth rate will reach 14.5 percent in the second quarter of this year, thus achieving the goal of the plan, which calls for a 10-15 percent increase in investment by the private sectors in three years. 3. The economic situation will take a turn for the better in the second half of 1994. The economic growth rates for the second half of 1993 and the first half of 1994 are 5.5 percent and (an estimated) 5.6 percent respectively, slightly less than the targeted growth rate of 6-7 percent. Lackluster exports could be attributed to the failure to reach this goal. But it is expected that the economic growth rate will improve to 6.3 percent in the second half of 1994. 4. The trend toward industrial upgrading continues. In the manufacturing sector, the capital- and technology-intensive heavy industries have continuously increased production. In the first quarter of this year, the output value of heavy industry represents 62.3 percent of the entire manufacturing sector, up from 60.8 percent in the same period last year. In the January-May period of this year, petrochemical industry exports accounts for 53.6 percent of total industrial exports, up from 51.2 percent in same period last year. The plan has achieved its strategic goal of upgrading industry. 5. Productivity has increased. In line with the plan for effectively increasing productivity, labor productivity in the first quarter of this year increased by 4.2 percent over the same period last year. Since the introduction of the plan in July last year, the domestic economy has experienced a slow recovery. On top of that, enterprises have had a hard time acquiring land for their plants. As a result, the plan has met with frequent criticism. Li Kao-chao, director of the Economic Research Department of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, said: Such a plan does not aim to stimulate an economic recovery but rather to serve as a medium- and long-term plan for improving the domestic investment environment. It takes a longer period of time to judge the effectiveness of the plan. It is not fair to criticize the plan based only on the figures for the first and second quarters.
