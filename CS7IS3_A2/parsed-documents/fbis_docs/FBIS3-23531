Zorin] [Text] The F-22, proposed by a group of firms headed by Lockheed, was chosen in the course of a 54-month program for engineering evaluation of competitive YF-23 and YF-22 prototypes for subsequent development as the U.S. Air Force advanced tactical fighter. A number of shortcomings were identified in the process of subsequent ground and flight tests of models of this aircraft, and a program running up to the end of 1993 was drawn up to remedy them. The external appearance of the series model of the F-22 fighter (see figure [figure not reproduced]) did not undergo substantial changes. This basically affected design features of the airframe and particularly the wing. In the opinion of Lockheed specialists, the configuration and external lines of the new aircraft became more refined and elegant. A total of 22 changes were made, the main ones being an increase in wingspan from 13.32 to 13.50 m, but its area did not change (78.32 m[.sup]2[/]) since the leading edge sweep angle was reduced from 48 to 42�. The latter will permit improving the aircraft's maneuver qualities and characteristics of cruising flight at subsonic speeds (through reduced aerodynamic drag), inasmuch as, according to calculations of U.S. aircraft specialists, the optimum wing sweep angle in which maximum roll rate is achieved is 40-43�. The wing planform presumes a reduced radar signature and increased design efficiency. Thickness of the wing root section was reduced to decrease drag at high speeds and its camber and twist were changed, which improved maneuver characteristics at supersonic flight speeds. The sweep of other edges was reduced to 42� similar to the wing's leading edge, which provides a decrease in amount of radar cross-section. The area of each vertical tail surface was changed from 10.13 to 8.27 m[.sup]2[/], which permitted reducing aircraft height from 5.4 to 5 m and reducing its drag in addition. The program also provides for a number of modifications to the Pratt and Whitney F119 engine. In particular, it is planned to improve specific fuel consumption indicators in nonafterburning conditions when cruising flight is made at supersonic speeds (Mach 1.4-1.5). The following are other substantial changes: - displacement of the air intake edge 46 cm to the rear, which improves the aircraft's stability and controllability; - some forward displacement of the pilot cockpit and increased bluntness of the nose, which improves the view of the forward hemisphere and characteristics of the onboard radar; - a 66 cm decrease in overall length of the aircraft while preserving the very same horizontal tail area. It is envisaged building 11 F-22's (nine single-seaters and two two-seaters) for $9.55 billion and 33 F119 engines ($1.375 billion) for full-scale fighter development. It is planned to conduct flight tests in these aircraft to evaluate design changes. Fabrication of the first series model is planned for late 1993. It is planned to reach maximum production rate (48 aircraft per year) in 2002. According to statements of Pentagon representatives, the first air wing (48 F-22's) will gain combat-ready status only in 2002. It is planned to purchase a total of 684 F-22's for the U.S. Air Force which basically will replace F-15 tactical fighters (except for the last F-15E modification).
