Wang Yuqing, director of the Planning Department of the State Environmental Protection Agency, said that China's environmental protection action plan -- a ten-year agenda -- will contain the general objectives of environmental protection, main targets of pollution control and the protection of the ecological environment in China by the year 2000. China's economy has doubled during the past 15 years -- and is to grow at an estimated 10 percent annually -- which has caused an acute shortage of power and increasing energy consumption, 70 percent of it coal. Speaking at an international seminar on environmental protection action plan, Wang said that China now faces seven pressing environmental problems, including water pollution, air pollution in cities, harmful industrial waste and garbage pollution in cities, lack of water resources, soil erosion, low afforestation percentage and grassland degradation, and decrease of species. "These environmental problems have greatly affected the health of the people, hindered the improvement of their living standard and economic development," Wang said. He noted that China will formulate industrial and economic policies for sustainable development, enhance environmental legislation and law enforcement, and improve existing environmental protection agencies. "As a developing country with limited human, material and financial resources, China will have to set priorities of its environmental protection work," said the official. He said that China will focus on environmental protection in cities, especially 52 major cities on the government's list for environmental protection, in which the focus should be on the control of water, air, solid waste and noise pollution. He disclosed that China has selected about 9,000 major polluting enterprises as the targets for pollution control. As far as the protection of nature is concerned, priority will be given to the protection of biological resources, such as forests, grassland, desert plants, animals and particularly precious and endangered species. Zhang Kunmin, deputy director of the State Environmental Protection Agency, told the seminar yesterday said that it "still remained an arduous task" for China to create an ideal environment in the coming years because of its huge and growing population and rapidly expanding economy.
