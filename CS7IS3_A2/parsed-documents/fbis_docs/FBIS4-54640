The Moslems also launched mortar and infantry attacks on Serb settlements and positions close to Doboj and in the region of Mt. Trebava and infantry and artillery attacks in the area of Mt. Ozren (all in northern Bosnia) the sources said. The Bosnian Serb army was forced to strongly respond to the attacks, it was said. Four civilians, wounded in Sunday's artillery shelling of Doboj which killed four civilians, are out of danger, the Bosnian Serb army said. The Doboj Serbs have over the past month been under constant Moslem fire which killed many civilians, but the shelling of this town fails to draw the attention of the world public and of the U.N. Protection Force. The Moslem offensive in northern Bosnia aims to cut the corridor which links the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS). On Sunday and Monday NATO planes have constantly been flying over Bihac (western Bosnia) thus encouraging the Moslems to mount mortar and infantry attacks on Serb positions, the Bosnian Serb army sources warned. On Monday the Moslems opened anti-aircraft and sniper fire on Bosnian Serb army positions in the upper parts of the Neretva River valley, while the regular Croatian army units launched mortar attacks on the Bosnian Serbs near trebinje (southern Bosnia), it was said.
