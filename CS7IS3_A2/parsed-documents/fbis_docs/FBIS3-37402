In connection with the fact that some mass media -- first and foremost Ostankino Television -- are making tendentious comments on the recent developments in Belarus, I consider it my duty to comment on a statement that was issued on this occasion and distributed via all mass media channels today. The Belarusian nation, which lost one quarter of all its people during World War II, values stability and its joint historic roots with the fraternal Russian people more than anything else. The attempts to wreck the natural integration processes of the two sovereign states -- Belarus and Russia -- have no future because they lack common sense. Belarusian national extremists are pursuing this policy contrary to the desire of the absolute majority of Belarusian people to restore historical logic to the further development of the two fraternal states. This is why the public did not back the so-called all-Belarusian political strike on 15 February. The working people of Belarus proved themselves to be at a higher level and wiser than the nationalist adventurers, and they gave preference to the constitutional path of socially oriented reforms. The calls of the strike organizers had the opposite effect and brought people out into the squares of many Belarusian towns to demand firm social guarantees and rigid control over the economy, including the restoration of the USSR. The strike, in which between 100,000 and 3,000 [as heard] people participated in various regions, allows us to state definitely that Belarus remains a democratic, constitutional, and stable state. The planned political action aimed at torpedoing the economic union that is being created between Belarus and Russia was a failure. In this situation, we greatly regret to report that Ostankino Television newscasts gave tendentious coverage to the developments in Belarus. Not only was the comment on the political strike in the newscasts extremely exaggerated, and not only was an absurd, preposterous conclusion made about instability in Belarus, but the right to speak on behalf of the Belarusian people was kindly given to Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the Belarusian Popular Front, who is known in the Republic for his extreme views rejecting everything that is Slavic and Russian. Ostankino Television did not see fit to consider that, according to opinion polls, the so-called Belarusian national democrats are supported by only 7 or 8 percent of the population. At sharp turning points in history, politics cannot and must not be out of step with public opinion [passage indistinct] in strict accordance with the international agreement on human political rights, by which I mean clauses 19 and 20 of that document. Thank you. I wish you all the best.
