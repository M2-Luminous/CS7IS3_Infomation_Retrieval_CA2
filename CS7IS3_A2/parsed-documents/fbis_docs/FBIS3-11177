Of the 436 congressmen who voted, 236 rejected the measure, 193 supported it, and seven abstained. The proposal was submitted by the general rapporteur, Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul State]. Had the measure been approved it would have gone into effect in 1995. It would not have been valid for this year's elections. The implementation of the non-compulsory vote was defended by Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Workers Party-Sao Paulo State]. He said the non-compulsory vote would rock safe electoral districts and affect the floating vote. Jose Serra (SP) [Sao Paulo State], the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democratic Party] leader in the Chamber of Deputies, also defended the non-compulsory vote. "A right should not be converted into an obligation," he stressed. In their speeches to the plenum, Deputies Liberato Caboclo (PDT-SP) [Democratic Labor Party-Sao Paulo State] and Roberto Freire (PPS-PE) [People's Socialist Party-Pernambuco State], former government leader in the Chamber of Deputies, spoke out against it. Caboclo said the measure would stimulate political incapability. Freire said the obligation to vote is a duty of the people. "This is why the vote must be obligatory," he stressed. Senator Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front Party-Bahia State] adopted the same line of thought, saying that to have approved the non-compulsory vote would have "abandoned the fundamental rules of the people."
