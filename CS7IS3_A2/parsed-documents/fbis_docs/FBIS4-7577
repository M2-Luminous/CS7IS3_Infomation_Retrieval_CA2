He said this in reply to a question about how he would react to a statement that Communists had returned to power in Slovakia. "If, however, Communists who created a new political party assume power -- it instantly matters to everyone," Weiss adds. (The SDL was formerly the Slovak Communist Party). On early elections in Slovakia in autumn, he says: "In the elections the Slovak people will have to express themselves clearly about what path Slovakia will embark upon -- whether it will follow the line of 'civil war rather than the President', the policy, in other words, of political revenge on those who had enough courage to democratically pass a no-confidence vote on the Premier (Vladimir Meciar), the policy of populist movements which endlessly give promises, but never keep them, or whether it will follow a line of cooperation between political parties which exist in the West," says Weiss. On the new Slovak Government of Premier Jozef Moravcik and the potential devaluation of the Slovak crown, Weiss says that the new government's program is not based on "devaluation at any cost and under any circumstances." He does not think that Slovakia is "predetermined to experience rapid devaluation." Commenting on the greatest problems Slovakia is now facing, Weiss says that these are above all "growing state budget deficit and a critical situation in the education and health services, due to a lack of funds, which the new government inherited from the previous one." Comparing his party and similar parties in other East European post-Communist countries, Weiss says that the SDL has much in common with the Hungarian Socialist Party as well as with the Polish Democratic Left Party, though the party transformation took place under different circumstances there. "We also have good relations with the Italian Democratic Left Party," says Weiss, and adds that on the Czech political scene the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) of Milos Zeman is nearest to them. "Our pro-Western orientation is unambiguous," Weiss says in connection with Slovakia's foreign policy. He says that together with Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis he "has pushed through (a policy of Slovakia's) rapprochement with NATO to its full membership in this organization." Weiss says that Slovakia is watching developments in Russia and is "not satisfied with the manifestation of extremism and a new wave of 'Greater Russian' nationalism. This is also the very reason why we agree with the (U.S.-proposed) Partnership for Peace," Weiss says. On the CSSD's initiative concerning the creation of a Czech- Slovak union, Weiss says that the SDL sees the (January 1, 1993) division of Czechoslovakia as a "reality which should not be changed. Both successor states (the Czech and Slovak Republics) have been recognized and so there are no longer political conditions either at home or abroad for the restoration of what has already existed," Weiss says. Chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky says in the economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that the new Slovak Government will now have to make an "inventory of Slovakia and assess what it has inherited from (the government of ex-Premier) Vladimir Meciar." In connection with Czech-Slovak problems ensued from Czechoslovakia's split, he says that the new Slovak Government "can free Slovak policy towards the Czech Republic from negative emotions" and that it will maintain a "matter-of-fact approach" in this respect, which has already been shown in the Czech-Slovak negotiations of the Customs Union Council this week. Some partial problems which burden the Czech-Slovak relations will undoubtedly be resolved. But what the current government will most likely not manage to resolve are for instance the Czech National Bank claims towards Slovakia valued at 24 million crowns (about $800 million), and some other greater problems," Carnogursky says.
