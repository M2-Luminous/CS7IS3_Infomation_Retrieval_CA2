Lashing out at Nauru, he compared its size to that of a glass of water and said it was a Pacific nation with no honorific greetings or genealogy. His assault on phosphate rich Nauru came just two weeks after Nauru President Bernard Dowiyogo was here for independence anniversary celebrations. Tofilau was referring to an incident in 1980 when, under a previous government, claims were made that Nauru had funded opposition political groups. As a result of the claims, Nauru promptly withdrew its investments in Samoa, resulting in an apology from the then government of Prime Minister Tupuola Efi, who is now Opposition Leader and is known as Tupua Tamasese Efi. The most senior member of the opposition Samoa National Development Party present in the house, Ulualofaiga Talamaivao Niko, said Monday's remarks by Tofilau were "childish and stupid" and would have a damaging impact on relations with "our brothers in the Pacific." "If we look down on Nauru because of the size of Nauru, how would we feel if countries bigger than Western Samoa did the same? ...I'm very ashamed.
