By way of example, the newspaper mentions the Tajik-Afghan border, from which disquieting reports come in every day, and where Russian servicemen get killed. "But Russian troops do not quit. They just have no right to leave, for that would mean the death of many thousands of people... As long as the peoples of various coutnries apply to Russia for help, Russia still remains a great military power". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the army's economic problems and its prestige in society. In Russia, the defender of the fatherland has always meant more than just a man with a rifle. But lately the prestige of the officer and soldirer in the eyes of society is not as high as one would like it to be. Quite often the army was undeservedly criticised, the newspaper lamented. "But the main thing is that however hard the idea of the defence of the fatherland and its proponents were defamed, they survived and upheld the thesis that this idea is a sacred notion and that the defender of the fatherland is the person's social status", the newspaepr pointed out. TRUD on the state of affairs in Russia's armed forces. The newspaper comes to a conclusion that the defenders of the fatherland themselves are in need of protection. "Infantry officers are no longer willing to draw guard duty instead of soldiers or to shovel coal in garrison stoke-holds. "Air pilots get sick of waiting for fuel tanker-trucks, not flying weather. Navy men feel miserable at the quay wall without long-distance voyages... "The army now wants one thing -- to be an army: to drive vehicles, to fire, fly, and navigate the seas, shoot down training targets, bring up men, and live a decent life, without the need to think about referenda and the living bread, or figure in palace coups. The army wants to serve the fartherland, not politicians". ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the Sarajevo situation and on Russia's role in easing tension there. The newspaper points out that it is in many respects due to Russia's stance that there has been no "Balkan storm" operation. "Throughout last week, the entire world closely followed the development of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Balkans again turned into 'europe's powder keg' which could go off with unpredictable consequences for the old world. "Nevertheless, the conflict is not yet over. International diplomacy is yet to make a good deal of effort to undo the tight knot of Bosnian contradictions. "The West should draw two lessons from the situation taking shape there: that the crisis situation in the former Yugoslavia cannot be resolved behind the back of Russia and in disregard for her interests. The time has come to abandon the approach according to which 'it is the Serbs that should pay for everything', and to place equally tough demands upon all the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict". TRUD on the Russian Government's economic reform policy. The newspaper carries an interview with academician Nikolay Petrakov, a prominent Russian economist and director of the academy Institute on Market Studies. The interview dealt with matters aimed at promoting further economic development of Russia. Petrakov said "the market idea has been discredited". According to him, for two years more than 50 million people in Russia (who account for more than a third of the country's population) "live below the subsistence wage", as against 17 million in 1991 when every tenth was in straits whereas now every third is destitute. Petrakov believes that it is essential to adjust reforms "which must be with a human face, using the old Czechoslovak slogan." with this end in view, the academician suggests in particular that the taxation system be radically changed and an in-depth agrarian reform be carried out. "private ownership is the main principle of the market while the ownership of land is its foundation," he added. ROSSIYA newspaper runs an interview with Anatoliy Chubays who describes the course of privatisation. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages a forecast as to which kind of report will be delivered by President Boris Yeltsin in the federal assembly in the Kremlin on Thursday. The newspaper believes that the president must show that he is not only prepared "to further and deepen reforms" but is also aware of the entire "complexity and painfulness of the process" and point out the achievements of Russian diplomacy "in resolving the Bosnian crisis".
