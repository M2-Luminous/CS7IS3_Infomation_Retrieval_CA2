Russia by now has said that mentioning Latvia in the decree had been an oversight and that no Russian military bases are to be set up in Latvia. Russia has also defined the Skrunda radar base as a civilian facility. Laar in an interview with BNS said that the situation of Latvia and Russia after the Yeltsin decree has changed and that resuming negotiations between the two countries cannot be talked about until Yeltsin has "clearly and unambiguously" revoked his decree. Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs at a press conference after the meeting said changes are to be made, though, in the agreement concluded between Latvia and Russia at the governments level on the social protection of retired Russian military. Birkavs said his country's position on the issue was that all retired military under 60 years of age have to leave Latvia. A special foundation for this is to be set up, he added. The premier said about 8,500 retired Russian military under 60 are currently living in Latvia without having the country's citizenship. The two prime ministers discussed Estonian-Russian relations and working closely between Estonia and Latvia in international organizations. The Estonian leader reaffirmed his country's position of not to go to any concessions at talks with Russia. "Estonia won't back even a single step and will abide by the existing laws," he said. The meeting also discussed signing an additional protocol on farm products exports to the Estonian-Latvian free trade treaty. The issue is to be again discussed at a meeting of experts from the two countries in the Latvian capital in the middle of the next month. While discussing the customs issues, the Latvian premier said that the Baltics must do everything to cut back to a minimum the tariffs on the borders between the three countries and step up controls on the eastern border instead. Other topics on the meeting's agenda included the borders, and marking down of the land border. The prime ministers considered the possibility to temporarily suspend marking the border between the countries for a high cost of the work. The delegations for Friday's talks included foreign ministers Juri Luik and Georgs Andrejevs. The prime ministers of Estonia and Latvia are next scheduled to meet in Tallinn in the first half of June.
