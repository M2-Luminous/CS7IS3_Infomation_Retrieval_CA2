In the period of the third seven-year plan (1987-1993), the number of the fishing boats including stern strawlers of and above 3,750 ton class increased by more than 1,100 and the modernisation of aquatic products processing facilities was energetically pressed ahead. And a powerful drive was launched to expand sea culture, resulting in a considerable increase of its area. Thus the material and technical foundations of fisheries were consolidated and a prospect was opened for a radical boost of aquatic production. The fisheries of Korea made a fast development in the '60s, reinforced with mother ships of above 10,000 ton class and many 5,000-ton refrigerator transports, 3,750-ton stern trawlers and other kinds of fishing boats. In the decade, the bases of ship repair and fishing tackle production, fishing ports and aquatic products processing bases were streamlined on an overall scale and bases of sea culture were built to round off the departmental structures of fisheries and increase its independence. In 1970 the aquatic output increased 236 percent, the total tonnage of fishing boats 409 percent and the output of frozen products 319 percent above 1960. Large-size, modern and universal-purpose fishing boats were widely introduced in the period of the six-year plan (1971-1976), too, to increase the HP [expansion unkwown] per ship 1.5 times and the number of scientific and technical apparatuses installed in them 2 times. In that period modern plate-shape refrigerating factories were built at major fishing ports to additionally create a daily fast-freezing capacity of 10,000 tons and cold storage capacity of 220,000 tons. The 1.6 million-ton target of aquatic production envisaged in the six-year plan was fulfilled one year and seven months ahead of schedule. The independence of fisheries was immensely increased in the period of the second seven-year plan (1978-1984). The aquatic products processing bases were markedly expanded and many large refrigerating factories and storages built at fishing ports and consumer areas such as Pyongyang, Sinpo, Yukdae, Wonsan, Chongjin and Nampo. The aquatic output augmented 2.2 times during the fulfilment of the plan. Today the nation's fisheries with complete departmental structures is developing constantly on the basis of the latest science and technology.
