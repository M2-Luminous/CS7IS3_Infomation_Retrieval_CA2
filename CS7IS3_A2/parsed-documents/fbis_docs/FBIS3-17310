In a republic with an ethnic Russian population of more than half a million, "the diminishing number of Russian groups and classes in kindergartens and educational institutions is bound to cause concern in the Russian Federation," Grigory Karasin said at a news briefing in Moscow on Tuesday. He said this state of affairs "is on conflict with the agreement on cooperation between the Ministry on the Affairs of Nationalities and Regional Policy of the Russian Federation and the State Department of Ethnic Relations of Moldova, signed in Kishinyov [Chisinau] in November 1993." Russia's Foreign Ministry has been receiving "numerous appeals" from Russian-speaking citizens of Moldova and their organizations, "expressing deep anxiety about the possibility that, as a result of the forthcoming exams (in Moldova's official Romanian language to be held as of April 2 by decision of the government), non-ethnic Moldovans will be fired from their jobs on a mass scale merely because they have not yet mastered the Romanian language," Karasin said. He said the Russian Foreign Ministry hoped that Moldova's leadership would take a "well-considered decision conforming to international standards of human rights and taking full account of the demographic, cultural and linguistic factors that have taken shape in the republic in the course of history."
