He was commenting on a warning from Thailand's security chief for Australia not to give military aid, saying it would only escalate the conflict between the Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge. In a statement issued in Canberra, Senator Evans said Australia is giving serious consideration to the Cambodian Government's request for military assistance. He said Australia would consult with and take into account the views of other countries, including Thailand. The foreign minister said it is in line with the Paris peace accord for the elected Cambodian Government to seek aid from the international community in order to maintain the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. But Senator Evans also made it clear that it would be helpful if countries which committed themselves to the Cambodian peace process were to help the Armed Forces of the legitimate government.
