He was referring to the assurances he received this morning at a meeting with ranking members of the National Assembly Committee on National Security. Mr. Kenyon said that at a meeting with military leaders of the General Staff he had discussed the question of Bulgaria's protection against a possible use of chemical weapons and the measures which the Bulgarian Army will take in the event of a threat of use of such weapons of mass destruction in a possible military conflict. Asked by BTA whether the commission has information that any of the warring parties in the Yugoconflict has used chemical weapons, Mr. Kenyon said that he only had an information bulletin, according to which primitive warfare chemical agents like chlorine had been used in the former Yugoslavia but did not have evidence of the use of nerve gases. These are just a couple of bulletins and not evidence, he emphasized. Of course, when the convention enters into force, inspectors will be sent there to verify the truth.
