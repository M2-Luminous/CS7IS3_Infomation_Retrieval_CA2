According to the minister, the number of police members should be increased, and the police have to be properly trained and equipped to meet society's demands for protection. He also said the reorganization plan devised by the Army for those times when there is no counterinsurgency work to do includes the relocation of units. For instance, seven military detachments could be deployed in Peten Department to protect natural resources. [passage omitted] The minister believes Guatemala is ceasing to be a springboard for international drug trafficking. A positive sign is the use of drugs is not as common as in other countries. We have not captured a single plane, from Colombia or wherever, carrying cocaine during the past few months. The drug capos have apparently departed for another country, he said. The minister said drug trafficking continues over land and sea, albeit at much lower levels, as the result of the security forces' coordinated efforts. Concerning arms trafficking, the minister said an arms cache recently discovered in Suchitepequez with 22 AK-47 rifles in perfect condition proves the URNG [National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity] does not lack arms but, rather, militant members.
