FR940706-2-00022 FR940706-2-00015 Three commenters noted that the regulations do not specify the length of projects. Recommendations of project periods of 36 and 60 months were made. The Secretary notes that regulations usually do not specify project duration and instead leave flexibility for the Secretary to determine an appropriate project period each time a competition is announced. This notice solicits applications for a 36-month period. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. A commenter asked that the phrase ``in connection with a distance learning training course'' be dropped from the description of allowable telecommunications and technology fees in §388.31(d). The Secretary agrees that distance learning may include valuable in-service training activities, such as a lecture or technology demonstration, that are not part of a training course. The Secretary expects to revise §388.31(d) by deleting the words ``in connection with a distance learning training course.'' A commenter noted that it was an unnecessary limitation to require that distance education for rehabilitation workers be at their job sites as stated in §388.22(b)(2). The commenter noted that it may be necessary or efficient for an agency to gather a group of employees at a central location removed from individual offices for distance education. The Secretary agrees that there is no compelling reason to require in this priority that training occur at an individual job site. The Secretary expects to revise §388.22(b)(2) by deleting the words ``at their job sites.'' A commenter requested clarification of the heading for §388.22(b)(3), which refers to ``specific populations'' although the text that follows refers to ``all individuals or specified groups.'' The Secretary believes that it is up to the State agency to determine whether in-service training to improve employment outcomes will be targeted narrowly or broadly. Activities directed to improving employment outcomes for all population groups or for a specific target group are permitted under this priority. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. A commenter observed that the NPRM retains most of the language in the current regulations and does not accurately reflect the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (the 1992 Amendments), particularly provisions related to State and strategic plans. The Secretary believes that extensive changes have been proposed in the current regulations and is confident that all requirements in the 1992 Amendments have been implemented. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. Two commenters supported reserving a portion of funds for priorities, but believe this reserve should be divided between priorities based on need and priorities based on responsiveness or quality of the application and innovative approaches. The Secretary believes that the three priorities listed in the proposed regulations address significant needs of State agencies and that no further division of the priorities into categories is needed. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. Four commenters objected to the proposed formula in §388.21 whereby 80 percent of the funds available would be distributed based on the number of staff and 20 percent of the funds available would be distributed based on quality. They believe that the split penalizes States with small populations with limited capacity to write grants. In the commenters' view, the distribution does not take into account extra travel costs in a State with a large geographic area, and a commenter suggested increasing the small State agency minimum share. The Secretary believes that the proposed formula maximizes the amount of funds available for basic awards while ensuring that a reasonable amount is available for small agencies and for the Secretary's priorities. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. A commenter recommended dropping the priority in §388.22(b)(2) for distance education on the grounds that there is no evidence that distance education produces better results at less cost. The Secretary believes that distance education is needed in some States and wants to ensure that a mechanism exists to demonstrate innovative approaches to learning. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. Two commenters recommended deleting §388.20(f)(1)(ii) of the evaluation selection criteria that would judge in-service training outcomes by the extent to which training results in improved individual competency through licensure, certification, or award of academic degrees or certificates. The commenters believe in-service training to be short-term and job-based; therefore, reference to improved individual competency through degree-based programs should be dropped. The Secretary believes that, in response to the need to increase the number of qualified rehabilitation personnel, academic outcomes must be included among the measures of in-service training programs. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. Three commenters observed that reviewers for in-service proposals should be well qualified, represent diverse populations, and be identified by name and program affiliation after the review is completed. They commented that all applicants should receive reviewer comments. The Secretary agrees that reviewers must be qualified and representative of the diverse populations and agencies assisted through in-service training. The Secretary does make summary information available on characteristics of reviewers but believes the specific reviewers of proposals should remain anonymous. All applicants are provided with the reviewer comments on their applications when the review is completed. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. A commenter noted that §388.21 does not state what the minimum score is that an applicant must receive in order for its application to be approved by the Secretary or how it is to be computed. In order to make funding decisions, the Secretary will set a minimum score for each competition after all applications have been reviewed. The minimum score will be computed through an analysis of all reviewed applications to determine those that are in the fundable range. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.
