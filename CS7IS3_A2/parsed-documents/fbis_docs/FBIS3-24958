A note received at the Radio Mozambique news desk says that Pademo also demands that the Renamo leader produce evidence demonstrating Gen. Domingos Fondo's culpability. Pademo believes that there must be no liars among the leaders of the opposition, so it advises Afonso Dhlakama to present incriminating evidence against Gen. Fondo. The Pademo note also says that institutions such as the Attorney General's Office and the Criminal Investigation Police are working in fear and without the government's backing, thereby preventing proper investigation into cases such as Gen. Domingo Fondo's.
