Gorriaran sent a letter -- signed by "Enrique H. Gorriaran" and dated 14 March -- to MTP leaders to request a leave. In it, he denounced reports that connect him to the super gang, the holdup of an armored car, and the planting of bombs at automatic teller machines The letter says: "In my particular case, they have managed to convince those who believe whatever people say to think that I am either crazy or a criminal, and many others, who only believe part of these reports, to doubt that I am a revolutionary and to suspect that I belong to an intelligence service." Gorriaran asserted that this campaign against him has intensified since the La Tablada events when a subversive group assaulted the barracks and were bloodily quelled. He complained that "many books that together add up to some 2,000 pages have been written since then to cater to 300,000 readers interested in politics, and this is without taking into account hundreds of newspaper articles read by millions of people." The former ERP member alleged that, as a MTP member, "this campaign seeks to damage the development of the political organization" of this political movement. "These ill-intentioned reports are seeking to cast a slur on the memory of an entire generation of fighters from the 60's and 70's who have either died or been reported missing in order to belittle their examples of dignity and their libertarian sacrifices." To that effect, he pointed out that he could not let more time pass "without responding to these and other infamies," and he considered it "his duty" to devote some time "to reply to accusations that have been circulating." To conclude, Gorriaran asked to be relieved of his party affiliation for a time "due to the limitations of being underground." This suspension will "depend on the time I take to draft and order my testimony." The request was accepted at a plenary session of the MTP, which "reiterated its trust in the revolutionary example that Comrade Gorriaran has been giving throughout all these years of militancy." "Gorriaran went underground in January 1988 when a sector of Raul Alfonsin's administration accused him of being one of the promoters of the raid on the 3d Infantry Regiment headquartered at La Tablada, during which more than 20 people died, including MTP leader Jorge Banos."
