What is the objective behind it? The first mention, which went against the grain of the ordinary U.S. policy, was uttered weeks ago when the al-Ibrahim mosque massacre occurred, in which Israeli occupiers and settlers killed 53 Palestinians and wounded more than 180 others. This U.S. statement was made before the UN Security Council. At the time it was very clear that nobody could condone the massacre or even oppose its condemnation; this is because the ugliness and magnitude of the massacre and its racial motivations exposed the Israeli hypocrisy, which has been killing Palestinians for years and decades in a terrorist, racist, merciless, and harsh manner in the occupied land and world capitals; yet the Israelis continued to avoid world condemnation. What is more, the Israeli hypocrisy used to accuse the Palestinians of terrorism. In the midst of the Israeli official, terrorist, and occupationist killing, the United States opposed UN Security Council Resolution 904 for three weeks, thus defying the international community. It insisted on voting on each separate paragraph of the resolution in order that it could abstain from voting on an issue that is the most clear-cut of issues -- it is the issue of east Jerusalem, which the resolution stipulates must be included in the list of occupied territories. This stipulation is harmonious with reality and with all past UN resolutions. It is also compatible with the measures that the superpowers and other countries, including the United States, have respected to the letter; they have all refrained from opening an embassy in Jerusalem. This was done to avoid giving the Israelis the interpretation they have been working for since their occupation of the Palestinian land -- to give Jerusalem the status of the united and permanent capital of Israel. The issue could have passed if the matter had stopped at the U.S. abstention, and after the clarification issued by the White House, stressing no change in U.S. policy toward Jerusalem. But what happened the day before yesterday -- after the U.S. President met the Jewish communities and after Jewish leaders stated that Clinton had pointed out that Jerusalem is an undivided city and Israel's eternal capital -- sets off the problem from anew. It is true that U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry yesterday stressed that there are no changes in the U.S. position on Jerusalem, but that statement was general, open-ended, and insufficient. It does not resolve the situation on a fundamental issue for our Palestinian people, the Arab, Islamic, and Christian nations. When we put two and two together, we realize what is behind these statements, and this raises our anxiety on such U.S. discrepancies and ambiguities over Jerusalem. On the one hand, the Administration does not agree on a paragraph which does not state Jerusalem's occupation, and on the other they leave the U.S. President's office to announce what he had told them was his position -- on Jerusalem being Israel's unified capital. On another occasion, the official spokesman for the State Department, and not for the White House, speaks ambiguously and in general terms that there is no change in the American position on the issue of Jerusalem, without specifying the position and without redefining that position. Some have criticized the PLO because it forced the city of Jerusalem into the UN resolution. This led to the U.S. abstaining from the vote. Notwithstanding our willingness to accept all critics, we still think that blind persistence and/or hiding one's head in the sand will not help anyone. On the contrary, it will make things worse. The American stance and policies are not merely reaction. On the contrary, there are acts and policies which are well planned in advance, as well as tactical pledges. It is therefore necessary to raise them in order find out exactly what they are leading to, to know how to deal with them, and which weapons one should use. We believe that the current American Administration is under greater pressures from the Jewish lobby in the United States -- which might be behind the Whitewater issue which has become a powder keg that might destroy this Administration -- when dealing with the Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is therefore a problem which has made matters more difficult and more complicated, and has made it necessary to face up to the problems, however complicated they might be, foremost of which is Jerusalem. Jerusalem should be viewed as an occupied city and a holy city, not only to Muslims but also to Christians, whose right to their holy city has been questioned by President Clinton, who has chosen ambiguity as a means for fulfilling the Jewish illegitimate aims. It is true that Jerusalem is on the table of negotiations within the agreed timetable of the negotiations. However, such an admission should not change the fact that it is an occupied city, and that negotiations will not be about whether it is an occupied city or not but on its future, in a such a way that would bring about balance and fairness, and meet the rights of all parties concerned. Jerusalem cannot be eternally united as the Israelis have been asserting, because the word eternal is a gratuitous one. Nothing is eternal as far as history is concerned.
