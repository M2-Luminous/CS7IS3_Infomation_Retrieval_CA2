The CSU no longer rules out its withdrawal from the Bonn coalition and its republic-wide expansion following the 1994 Bundestag elections. Such a step would also spell an end to the community of the two parties in Bonn, something the CSU had decided before, on 19 November 1976, under its former chairman, Franz-Josef Strauss, and had rescinded on 12 December of the same year. Following the three-day meeting, CSU Land Group Chairman Michael Glos said in Munich on 8 January that the closed CSU meeting in the Upper Bavarian spa of Kreuth also discussed such options in the event of a grand coalition in Bonn. Glos called upon the CDU to demonstrate more willingness to fight. The larger sister party had to learn from the CSU "that elections can only be won in unity." He said that, being a realist, he advocated another coalition with the liberals following the 1994 Bundestag elections. This would, however, not be a "love match," but a deliberate marriage in which the accounts "match." An internal strategy paper of the land group chairman that WELT AM SONNTAG has obtained shows that the CSU considers the CDU situation to be "alarming." The sister party seems to be "torn by inner conflicts." The CSU is above all anticipating "with concern" the results for the CDU in the first Landtag elections this year, in Lower Saxony on 13 March. The party will "greatly suffer" from the fact that the attacks against former CDU/CSU presidential candidate Steffen Heitmann, who has since meanwhile resigned from his candidacy, were above all conducted from Lower Saxony. Following the recent differences between CSU Chief Theo Waigel and Bavarian CSU Minister President Edmund Stoiber, Glos admitted that the CSU has also made mistakes in European policy. For instance, the Maastricht Treaties appeared to have been approved too rapidly, without having first been sufficiently discussed with the citizens. Glos confirmed, however, that "all differences on crucial matters" between Waigel and Stoiber were settled at the closed meeting. A heated dispute also broke out in the meeting on 8 January over the presentation of Roman Herzog, the new CDU/CSU presidential candidate, and on the CDU's election strategy in the new laender. WELT AM SONNTAG learned from the Chancellor's Office that CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl was not happy with the fact that Waigel announced the basic agreement on Herzog as a joint candidate prematurely and on his own on 6 January. CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze stressed: "We have different ideas on how to deal with such a candidacy appropriately." Glos rejected such criticism. "Mr. Hintze should look at himself first. We do not need any advice on how to handle such a thing," he told WELT AM SONNTAG. CSU Secretary General Erwin Huber also accused the CDU of "serious strategic mistakes" regarding the struggle for voters in the new laender. Huber told WELT AM SONNTAG that the party "failed to challenge the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, as would have been necessary."
