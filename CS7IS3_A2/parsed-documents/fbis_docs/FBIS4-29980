FBIS4-29980 "dreas121_j_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-121 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Indonesia Official: No Intention To Stop Wheat Import Official: No Intention To Stop Wheat Import BK2206100494 Jakarta THE INDONESIA TIMES in English 13 Jun 94 p 3 BK2206100494 Jakarta THE INDONESIA TIMES English BFN [Text] Dr. Beddu Amang, the vice chairman of the National Logistics Agency (Bulog), said in answer to questions from the press recently that Indonesia has no intention at all to stop its import of wheat from the United States. But, Indonesia had not imported the commodity from that country under a commercial basis for the last two years due to the relatively-higher price reason. "That's normal in trade to postpone an import from other countries because of its unreachness [as published]," he said. The Bulog vice chairman said that the postponement of Indonesia's wheat was done only because of its relatively higher price in a comparison to the wheat import from Argentina and Australia. "From the commercial points of view, we saw that the U.S. wheat import was not competitive in the market," he reiterated. Moreover, he added Indonesia has requested the U.S. Government to consider the EEP (export enhancement program) to Indonesia for its import of the U.S. wheat. "I hope that the request can be understandably approved by the U.S. Government, " he said, revealing that it is directed to improve the future of the Indonesian people. The Bulog vice chairman explained that due to the uncompetitive price, Indonesia has asked the U.S. Government for the EEP treatment also imposed to its wheat import similar to other developing countries such as Bangladesh. [sentence as published] However, he said, the request has not yet been accepted yet. So far, Indonesia has imported its wheat needs from the United States both under the commercial and GSM (general sale manager) 102 3-year-term credit schemes. Last year, Indonesia imported wheat grains from the United States under the GSM 102 basis amounting to 40,000 tons. During the same period, Indonesia's total import for the commodity reached 2.5 million tons. Dr. Beddu Amang said that due to the relatively-higher price reason of the U.S. wheat in the market, the Indonesian Government has taken into consideration a conversion of its sources of the commercial wheat imports from the United States to other countries, including Argentina and Australia. Indonesia has also commercially imported the commodity from its fellow developing countries. The price of wheat imports from Argentina and Australia has been about U.S. $170 per ton, whilst its US price is relatively more expensive. "Really," he said, "although the price is already calculated under the GSM 102 scheme, but its figure is still higher," Dr. Beddu Amang said, revealing that the price difference can reach up to around U.S. $20 per ton. In the current 1994 fiscal year, Indonesia received an assistance under the GSM 102 scheme from the United States amounting to U.S. $165 million, out of which U.S. $20 million had been allocated for wheat imports from that country, while, the remaining amount was for other commodities, including protein meals, soybeans, and raw cotton.
