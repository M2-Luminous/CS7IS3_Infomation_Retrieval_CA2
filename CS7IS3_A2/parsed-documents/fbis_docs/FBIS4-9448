In a press release the regional directorate of the interior in Blagoevgrad said the assembly intended to mark the 79th death anniversary of Yane Sandanski (a prominent figure in Bulgaria's struggle against Ottoman rule) was against the law and anti-Bulgarian in orientation. The public was advised against travelling in the vicinity of the Rozhen Monastery. The regional directorate also warned that it would take the necessary lawful measures to prevent events violating the Constitution. Blagoevgrad police had an anonymous call last night warning that unless the ban on OMO Ilinden's assembly was lifted, a shop in town would be blown up. The threat was a hoax. Some one hundred OMO Ilinden followers gathered at the most. At the same time, day trippers from Sofia, Gabrovo and other parts of the country visited the Rozhen Monastery. Believers lit candles and laid bunches of lilac at the grave of Yane Sandanski. Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev today visited the monastery. "OMO Ilinden has not formally asked permission as required under the law for the assembly near Rozhen on April 24, 1994; therefore, the Ministry of the Interior will take measures to maintain law and order in the area," Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov told reporters a week ago. He denied that members of the organization have been ill-treated or barred from employment, as Ilinden representatives alleged at a recent news conference. OMO Ilinden has been denied court registration in Bulgaria because its "actions, rules and programme contravene the Constitution," which prohibits organizations that "act to the detriment of the country's sovereignty and national integrity, or the unity of the nation, or that incite racial, ethnic, or religious hatred" and forbids the formation of political parties "along religious, ethnic, or racial lines."
