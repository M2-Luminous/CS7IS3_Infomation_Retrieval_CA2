He also announced the arrest of four alleged rebels accused of carrying out the attacks at the Lima Mayor's Office and the Air Force installations. [Begin recording] [Briones] No, we cannot discount the possibility of another small group and -- I repeat -- a small group. We do recommend that they take the appropriate measures, because the terrorism law is very strict. I would not like anyone to claim later that we acted too drastically with them. At this time I think we should say -- and I would like to end with this -- that we will continue our counterterrorism operations. We want to finish this once and for all, arrest all those involved in the recent terrorist actions, and punish them with the full force of the law. We will keep working until we attain complete peace in the country. [Unidentified reporter] Are any suspects under arrest? [Briones] At this time we are still investigating. There have been a few arrests. [Reporter] How many? [Briones] We now have about four people in custody. They are important people within their organizations. We continue to investigate, and we expect to see some results soon. [Reporter] Are these people members of Shining Path or the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement? [Briones] The people we have arrested are members of Shining Path. [end recording]
