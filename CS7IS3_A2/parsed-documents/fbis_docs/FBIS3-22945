It must be understood that the terrain is hilly. Hizballah men come out of the villages on roads we are not watching. They cross mountains, river beds, rocks, and come within dozens of meters of our troops. They make use of the poor visibility and rough terrain, and the result on our end is painful. We have a problem with pinpointing intelligence on them, and we do not always have answers or information when they go on an operation, from where, and their goals. [Kiesel] Does that mean that we will have to live with the harsh reality of having victims? [Mordekhay] No. Their method of operation presents a difficulty. This is a type of guerrilla that comes out of areas that are not under our control, from civilian terrain of which they make full use. We will find ways and methods to hurt them. Last year, we carried out thousands of operations that proved themselves. We are dealing with 130 km of a very hilly border. It is not all that simple. Hizballah does not have any bases or training sites. They work out of mosques and from inside a civilian population that is often held hostage. We cannot harm the population, but we will find ways to hurt Hizballah. Compared with events in the security zone, one must remember that the northern settlements live in full security. Not a single Katyusha has been fired at the north since July. Furthermore, all attempts by terror squads to reach the border fence or get near it have been thwarted. Last year was very painful for Hizballah. They suffered 126 fatalities from our activity -- the highest figure ever -- and there are certainly more fatalities and casualties we do not know of. [Kiesel] Is a war being waged in south Lebanon? [Mordekhay] I never said that. There is a confrontation, there are battles, clashes, and exchanges of fire. I do not call this war. Anyone who wants to extend the definition of war or call it that is welcome to do so. War has certain characteristics which are not present here. In the security zone, we are constantly dealing with the situation. [Kiesel] The deputy chief of staff called it war. [Mordekhay] I know what the chief of staff and his deputy mean. They do not mean war in the broad sense of the word, where both parties employ their full forces; we certainly do not. There are exchanges of fire, clashes, and casualties. There are daily incidents. In a war you use all the means available to win. [Kiesel] Does last week's incident in which four soldiers were killed and five injured in a Hizballah ambush indicate an escalation? [Mordekhay] There has been a significant escalation in Hizballah activity over the past two weeks. They have been planting bombs and shooting antitank and Sagger missiles. The political process has an impact on Hizballah. It fears that the process with Syria is making progress, and that this would reduce their freedom of operation in the future, hence they are trying to demonstrate their force. When their activity dropped, they encountered pressure to resume activity. Also, without doubt, they are seriously influenced by the unprecedented scope of their recent arms and equipment procurements. [Kiesel] Does the equipment come from Iran? [Mordekhay] Absolutely. Iran sent dozens of Sagger missiles and hundreds of mortar bombs, as well as many other means, backing, money, guidance, and training, which led to a significant escalation. [Kiesel] Does this mean that they have surprisingly recovered from Operation Accountability? [Mordekhay] Absolutely. They suffered more than 100 fatalities last year, but they filled out the ranks with new recruits. A vacuum was created after Operation Accountability. Lebanese residents called on the government to send in the army to help. The Lebanese Government tried to send in a battalion, but the Syrians prevented it from taking steps against Hizballah. As a result, Hizballah gained strength, started rebuilding itself, and -- enjoying an incredible cash flow from Iran -- in fact, strengthened its hold in the villages. Until Syria allows the Lebanese Government to deploy its Army freely in south Lebanon, Hizballah will have a good time. [Kiesel] How deep is Hizballah-Iran cooperation? [Mordekhay] Very deep and very tight. We know they are exchanging information, training, and advice. The Hizballah leadership travels to Iran for guidance, explanations, and ideas. They do not go there for vacation or to visit massage parlors, but to be trained. [Kiesel] Your description indicates that the terror attacks cannot be prevented. [Mordekhay] They can be reduced, but not totally eliminated. Our activity, in most cases, aims to reduce their freedom of operation and make them pay a price before they reach their goal, before leaving a base, or during contact with them. In the vast majority of the incidents we do manage to hit them from a distance. [Kiesel] Why is the Air Force not employed to prevent ambushes such as happened last week? [Mordekhay] The Air Force has its limitations, it cannot discover such ambushes. We use Air Force assault helicopters against specific targets. I do not believe, however, that the Air Force can significantly change the state of affairs here. [Kiesel] Do you not feel that in fighting Hizballah the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has its hands tied for fear a retaliation of katyushas could be fired at the northern settlements? [Mordekhay] Absolutely not. No one has tied our hands. The political guidance we receive is very clear to us. We are serious people. We do consider the implications of our activity on the settlements of the north. We saw what happened when the situation deteriorated and they were hurt. [passage omitted] [Kiesel] Do you believe that, once we reach agreement with them, the Syrians will curb Hizballah and discipline them? [Mordekhay] I have no doubt about this. If Syria used its influence, it could significantly reduce the Hizballah military operability. It could stop the transfer of means to them. It could allow the Lebanese Army to deploy there. The Lebanese Army has done that throughout Lebanon, but has not lifted a finger in the areas adjacent to the security zone. Syria is a key player. Syria acting the innocent last week and saying that it does not take part in Hizballah activity is not acceptable to us. Acting naive like this is unbecoming of a rattlesnake, not even one that breeds in Damascus. Had it wanted to, Syria could curb and significantly stop Hizballah. It is a question of a Syrian decision. If they wanted, the Lebanese Army could be stationed there, and it could cooperate with the IDF in dealing with Hizballah, removing them from the villages, and closing down the military supply routes from Iran. [Kiesel] Do you know for certain of a terror act that the Syrians knew of in advance? [Mordekhay] We cannot establish a direct link between a Syrian order or instruction and a terror act; the connection is merely circumstantial. Yet, Hizballah would like to fire katyushas at Israel, but it does not dare because it understands there are agreements which should not be deviated from. What reason did they have to abstain from activity for 10 days during the Clinton-al-Asad summit? These were the quietest days I can recall. There is a hand that guides Hizballah, and it comes from Syria. [Kiesel] Do you believe al-Asad aims for peace? [Mordekhay] Al-Asad understands the international and Middle Eastern strategic situation. At the same time, al-Asad has in no way dropped the military option. Along with conducting the political process, the Syrian military buildup continues. I believe al-Asad wants to attain Syrian interests and national goals in peaceful ways. If he fails, all options are open. [Kiesel] The Intelligence Branch appreciates that he wants peace. Major General 'Uzi Dayan, however, said that if the political process gets stuck, a limited military operation is to be expected in 1994. What do you think? [Mordekhay] I would not put a time frame on this, not even in terms of years. A process starts and no one knows when it will end or where it will lead. It must be understood that the other option -- the military option -- exists on the level of the ability in the field and on the conceptual level. When will it be used? When someone feels there is no other way. [Kiesel] Do you mean that you do not rule out a Syrian military move, should all other options fail? [Mordekhay] Our working assumption should be very clear: Syria is able to do it. The question is when. Knowing the IDF and Northern Command's power, I would urge him to think twice before making a move of a military nature. I believe he is aware of this. We have the power, and we have proved we will use it against anyone who tries to put our existence at risk. [Kiesel] Has the Northern Command been asked to prepare withdrawal or redeployment plans for the Golan Heights? [Mordekhay] No. No one in the command, including myself, is engaged in any plans that have political bearings. All of the plans I deal with, all the preparations, are within the scope of providing an answer in case someone does something, God forbid. Nothing else is happening in the Northern Command. [Kiesel] If Syria means peace, would you recommend getting off the Golan Heights? [Mordekhay] This is a political issue. I believe a military man should not, and must not, comment on such issues. When the Israeli Government has thoughts and potential scenarios, it will apparently present them to the people in charge of the Army and the territory in the command. We will present our assessments then. The problem is that the Golan Heights is too small for waging a modern war and reducing damage. If the threat is eliminated, or if there is another threat, we will have to examine the meaning and make political decisions. [passage omitted]
