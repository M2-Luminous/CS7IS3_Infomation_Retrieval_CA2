Kornev, head of the newspaper EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN's information center in Ukraine: "Ukraine: The Real Estate Market as a Barometer of Government Reforms"] [Text] The situation on the real estate market is one of the most sensitive barometers of the progress of countries of the former USSR along the path of economic reforms. Here it is clear to see how the real mechanisms of property are formed. To facilitate analysis of this problem, we will divide all real estate into two parts: that which belongs to enterprises (state as well as private), which we will call production real estate, and that which is owned by citizens as private property, which we will call citizens' property. Unfinished Projects and Others (Production Real Estate) The processes of destatization of property in Ukraine are determined by the laws on large and small privatization that were adopted by parliament a year and a half ago. But for all practical purposes, they have not begun to function: The 1992 and 1993 state privatization plans have come to naught, although official figures also cite such a statistic as the fact that 1,570 enterprises have been privatized. The main form of privatization today is leasing to buy. In 1993, 1,306 enterprises were privatized, and 978 enterprises were in the process. Why is property taking such a long time to find real owners? What is going on here? Who is at fault? Some see a population that does not wish to become owners; others, a state that is in no hurry when it comes to a real transition to the market. In fact, preparations are being made for wide-scale privatization. In a very distinctive way. Here is the point of view of an expert--the influential Ukrainian people's deputy V. Filenko: "The corporatization and breaking up of large enterprises, readjustment, commercialization, and other unavoidable preliminary measures are proceeding too slowly, and to some extent are only being mimicked. But then, the fussy changing around of signboards and the formation in the state sector of pseudo-market structures and small enterprises parasitizing state property is forging ahead at full speed. On the one hand, these are means for pumping public funds, or property, too, into private pockets; on the other hand, it is the seizure of convenient starting positions, which after the proclamation of mass privatization should automatically lead to the preferential transition of the best enterprises into the hands of privileged claimants. According to a scenario that may be carried out, mass privatization will formally be begun at such time as the actual privatization of highly profitable enterprises is concluded. There are not a few tasty morsels, and one cannot put one's hands on them all simultaneously. So they are dallying with the privatization in order to gain time: "The lion is getting ready to spring." But what is happening at the surface of this process? All of the laws and decrees on privatization remain only a declaration. At auctions where municipally owned enterprises are sold, which have taken place in Lvov, Dnepropetrovsk, Kiev, Zaporozhye, Odessa, and other cities, and were held, as also in the beginning in Russia (Nizhniy Novgorod, St. Petersburg) under the patronage of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), in fact what was sold was not the objects of immovable property, but the right to their lease. The auctions themselves, especially in Kiev, proceeded in not very organized fashion--there were protests of the participants and of the procurators about the fact that a number of enterprises under dual authority were incorrectly presented for bidding. For example, a store on the first story of a departmental building has two owners--the organization that constructed the building and the municipal authorities. A whole range of enterprises was withdrawn from the trading for this reason. The edict of the president of Ukraine on corporatization placed the beginning of privatization of medium-sized and large state enterprises on the basis of the creation of joint-stock companies. The process has really been in progress since October and November of last year. Only 78 such companies have been created. In the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, great hopes were placed on the privatization of unfinished construction projects. In October of last year, the president of Ukraine signed the relevant edict. It seemed that the matter would quickly be "wound up." After all, in the republic, as we were informed by R. Kuzmin, a leading specialist of the Property Fund's administration of state enterprise privatization, there are 53,000 unfinished projects of state or municipal ownership, including 22,000 at which no construction was conducted in 1993, and 9,200 that are 50 percent ready and whose construction was taking twice as long as the norm. In the middle of January throughout Ukraine, about 100 privatization projects were "put to work." And every month during the course of this year the same number should be added to those. Here it is determined that clients who have financed the construction through centralized capital investments will at sale receive 30 percent of the cost of the unfinished project, and those who built using their own funds will receive all 100 percent. The privatization of plots of land is resolved simultaneously with the unfinished project itself. It appeared that the process would "move ahead." However, by February throughout Ukraine, only 50 sellers of dragged-out construction projects had been scraped together. The role of "dog in the manger" turned out to be played by the local organs of executive authority. In oblasts like Donetsk, Lugansk, and Sumy there turned out to be only 10 overdue construction projects apiece, and in Khmelnitskiy, not a single one. One can understand the managers' desire to hold back "their" construction until better times, to justify as state motives the necessity of its continuation. But they, as was stressed at a recent meeting at the Cabinet of Ministers, will be heard sympathetically by the privatization commission under one set of circumstances: when there are on hand or planned for the near term real funds for the completion of construction. Otherwise, the auction will judge who has the greatest opportunity and desire to bring the overdue construction project "to reason" and become its owner. For the time being, even out of 9,200 50-percent completed projects, only three overdue construction projects have been completed. Although the number of their bypassed "brothers" promises to increase. According to data of the Cabinet of Ministers economics administration, of 343 projects planned to be put into operation by state contract, only 16 have been put into operation. Ukraine is living through difficult times. This is the third year that the fall in production has continued, which has reached catastrophic bounds. The control levers over the money supply have been lost. The average monthly inflation rate reached 80 percent in December, that is, the stage of hyperinflation began. The population's standard of living was reduced to such an extent that one segment of the citizenry is forced to worry about physical survival. This is an unprecedented situation for a country not in a state of war. It would probably not be an exaggeration to say that Ukraine's path to a new democratic society and a market economy has turned out to be more difficult than that of other European countries that have escaped from totalitarianism. It is difficult to expect that the private sector will begin to invest its capital on a massive scale in industrial immovable property in conditions of economic instability and a lack of clear legal guarantees. Apartments, Dachas, and Garages (Citizens' Immovable Property) The housing market, essentially, has always existed. It is just that in different times, its affiliation with such of its forms as legal, semilegal, and "black" has changed. After all, 10 years ago everyone also knew perfectly well that an exchange of apartments was a veiled form of trade in them, and that the office dealing with apartment exchanges and the placement of advertisements simply screened a ramified network of apartment brokers, who clearly knew the price of a square meter of living space. The housing market began to take on clearer outlines in the past four years. This is connected most of all with the appearance of more liberal legislative acts and with buyers and sellers having more precise information on prices for real estate, thanks to numerous advertisements and announcements in the press and the emergence of exchanges and real estate agencies, specialized brokers' offices, and a ramified network of middlemen. "Three years ago," says L. Gruskene, president of the Kristina Ukrainian real estate exchange, "we were selling apartments for R30,000, R50,000, R70,000, whereas now the tally is kept in the hundreds of millions of karbovantsy. At the end of 1990, one could buy a good two-room apartment in downtown Kiev for $2,000-$3,000. And when we cited such prices to buyers, they perceived them as absolutely improbably high. Whereas now such an apartment is evaluated at seven or eight times higher." In 1991-1992, the high cost of housing in Kiev was determined by the projected interest in Ukraine on the part of foreign investors, who were attracted by the new markets, the highly optimistic statements by the Ukrainian leadership on the building of a market economy, and the liberal law on foreign investments. They actively acquired apartments for offices and agencies. This also applied to Ukrainian commercial structures, the entrepreneurial elite, who purchased prestigious housing in the central part of the city. Now purchasing power is falling. The interest of foreigners in Ukraine, as a result of economic instability and the absence of legal guarantees, has declined sharply. Our own nouveaux riches have basically satisfied their own requirements. There is now on the market a large quantity of mid-level apartments, which are not finding buyers. Their potential takers are people of fairly decent means, but they do not have the necessary funds at their disposal. Therefore, demand for real estate is falling. Over the year, prices for an apartment in Kiev have fallen by 15-25 percent. Here is the analysis presented by the analytical service of the Ukrainian exchange Desyatinnaya, which is a leader in the sale of apartments, dachas, and garages. The volume of deals involving real estate in 1993 comprised 178.5 billion karbovantsy. The number of contracts concluded was 3,470. At the end of December 1993, the proportional share of apartments according to location in the total volume of those available constituted: apartments located on the outskirts of town--29 percent; downtown--27 percent; near metro stations--26 percent; in regions adjoining downtown districts--19 percent. The greatest proportional share in the total volume of those available was made up of three-room apartments--38 percent--and two-room apartments--37 percent. One-room apartments make up 14 percent of the total. The average price of a single square meter of housing space amounted to: for apartments located in the center of town--$940; in regions adjoining the center--$795; near metro stations--$572; and on the outskirts of town--$502. The offered cost of one square meter of living space at the end of December 1993, as compared with the beginning of the month, decreased by 3 percent, on average. Prices for apartments of various classes in the city of Kiev are given in the table. It is necessary to keep in mind here that an analysis of concluded deals pertaining to real estate in Ukraine is made more complicated. The government decree adopted at the beginning of the year on currency regulation prohibits settlements on the exchanges from being conducted in foreign currency. And hyperinflation renders senseless the calculation of real estate values in Ukrainian karbovantsy. Therefore, the reality is such: The contract, for the record, is concluded in karbovantsy, but is in practice settled in dollars or marks. Here their own collisions could arise, but the brokers have learned to get around them. In the opinion of S. Babich, general director of the Ukrainian exchange Desyatinnaya, 30 percent of those who now sell apartments effect their resale at a profit to themselves. "In order sharply to decrease the price of apartments offered for sale and to find an additional source of replenishment for the city budget," he notes, "We proposed to the Kiev administration to sell at auction 100-200 newly constructed apartments quarterly. But they did not do this. But really, at that time there was the possibility of creating a full-blooded real estate market and to regulate it in the interests of various strata of the population." Aside from Kiev, the sale and purchase of citizens' real estate is fairly well developed in Kharkov, Lvov, Odessa, and Crimea. In these cities, the cost of housing amounts to on the order of 60 percent of that in the capital. In contrast to the Baltic countries, Central Asia, Transcaucasia, and Moldova, in Ukraine the migration of the Russian-speaking population to Russia has practically not been felt in the housing market. A portion of the well-off citizens of Ukraine has displayed a desire to acquire real estate in Moscow and in other cities of Russia. But the share of buyers from the CIS among those wishing to become owners of real estate in Ukraine is negligible. Among the most famous firms involved in the purchase and sale of apartments, dachas, and garages, in Ukraine the most famous are the Ukrainian exchange Desyatinnaya, the Ukrainian real estate exchange Kristina (which is a component of the Praveks concern), the Kiev Universal Exchange, the Yanus real estate agency, and Kommersant-D in Odessa. These and other firms at the end of 1993 signed a founding agreement on the creation of the Association of Realtors of Ukraine, whose president is to be N. Detochka, head of the Kiev Universal Exchange. The task of the association is to create consultative information services and to facilitate collaboration with its colleagues in different countries. The law adopted in Ukraine last year on mortgages gives an opportunity to develop mortgage lending. And the unquestioned leader here is the Praveks concern. Two of its component members, the Ukrainian real estate exchange Kristina and the Praveks-bank, are engaged in the apportionment of currency credit to physical persons under security of immovable property, especially apartments. Here, you will not get a loan greater than half the value of your apartment in dollars, and if you fail to return the amount, the apartment will be sold at a profit. Besides the Praveks-bank, the banks IKAB (Kiev) and Land Union (the city of Chernovtsy) are getting involved in mortgages. Since the Ukrainian International Currency Exchange was closed, the real estate market has remained just about the only barometer allowing for a determination of real benefit from the government reforms. Therefore, when asked for a prognosis of real estate prices in 1994, Ukraine's realtors give roughly the following answer: "Let us wait until 27 March." That is the date of the elections to the republican parliament. So then--the market really is eternal and has existed always. Only in three guises: legal, semilegal, and "black." The Ukrainian market will be kept from "blackening" further simply by social pressure of the population, which has reached its limit. There is only one way out: to become legal. And this will probably be the main task of the party in power.
