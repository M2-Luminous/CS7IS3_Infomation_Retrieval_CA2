The session was told that the ratification of START-2 should follow the enacting of its predecessor, START-1, signed on July 31 1991. Despite the fact that the treaty has already been ratified by Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan since the break-up of the Soviet Union, it will come into force only after the exchange of ratification letters with the USA. The session was told that the process is hindered by Ukraine where "political struggle for this or that status as a nuclear state is going on," according to the head of the disarmament department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Oleg Sokolov. As many as 3,800-4,250 nuclear ammo will be destroyed during the first stage of the START-2 treaty's implementation, which will last for seven years -- the same as the START-1 treaty. Another 3,000- 3,500 items of nuclear ammunition will be destroyed during the second stage which will last until 2003.
