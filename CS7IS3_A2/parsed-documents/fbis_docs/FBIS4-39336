"We have taken into consideration the Russian-proposed idea", he told TASS on Monday, but added that, according to the Chinese Government, "the most efficient and practical variant of solving the problem is to hold bilateral consultations in three directions: North Korea - the IAEA, North Korea - the United States, and Pyongyang - Seoul". Beijing is conducting an active dialogue with the North Korean leadership on its nuclear programme, according to sources close to diplomatic circles. It strives to preserve "special relations" between the two countries and at the same time to exert influence on its partner in order to settle the conflict without any sanctions. It is noteworthy that last Saturday the North Korean ambassador in China has resolutely rejected the Russian idea about the international conference. The nuclear free status of the peninsula should be discussed only in a close circle - between North Korea and the United States. However, the Hong Kong-based "TA KUNG PAO" newspaper is sure that China can join economic sanctions against Pyongyang. It believes Beijing can cease shipments of food and oil.
