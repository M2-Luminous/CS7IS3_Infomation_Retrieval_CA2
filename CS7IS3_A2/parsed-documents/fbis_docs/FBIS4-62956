He reported that during their two-year stay in the former Yugoslavia the Russian "blue berets" have conscientiously "worked off" almost the whole of Russia's debt to the United Nations: Just $200 million is outstanding from the previous $1.5 billion. But Russia's power structures have still not drawn up a system of social protection for the peacemakers. In the opinion of the UN administration, they are the best of all the soldiers in Vukovar and Sarajevo today, but for some reason it is only the motherland that forgets that its sons are not out for a stroll but are at war.... The Airborne Troops' commander has no information about sending new Russian military contingents to other countries, particularly Rwanda. The question of sending peacemakers to Nagorno-Karabakh also remains problematic: First the troops of the sides engaged in the conflict must be separated.
