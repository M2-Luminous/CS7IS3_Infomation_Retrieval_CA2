Our now reunified continent had to face an exhilarating challenge. Opening up before it was the chance to overcome historical divisions and to return to the forefront of the international stage. In three years, our hopes faded. The transition in the East proved more difficult and more expensive than had been foreseen, the economic crisis caused unemployment to rise, and the drama in the former Yugoslavia reminded everyone how difficult it is to assume the heritage of history. Confidence in the future gave way to concern. Today, it is up to Europe's leaders to react against this wave of pessimism and to restore confidence to our continent. This is why, as soon as I took office in April 1993, I proposed to organize negotiations with a view to adopting a stability pact in Europe. Its main aim is to put into practice the major principles which all the countries of the European continent have accepted for many years, notably by signing the Paris Charter of the CSCE. Today, everyone recognizes the territorial integrity of states and the inviolability of borders, everyone recognizes the right of each individual, even if a member of a minority, to benefit from universal human rights. Many institutions, such as the CSCE or the Council of Europe, play a remarkable role in ensuring that these rights are respected. But everybody also knows that, in our Europe marked by a long and troubled history and, as a result, by wars and population movements, questions and uncertainties still remain. The continent of Europe must put these problems of minorities and of borders behind it, once and for all. The time is opportune as, thanks to the wisdom and moderation of many governments, these difficulties are now contained. But what would happen if a crisis flared up tomorrow, caused by whatever economic or social circumstance? Project Launch on 26 and 27 May Good neighbor relations must therefore be established so closely between the people of Central Europe that their borders will never again be the subject of dispute. Respect for the rights of individuals belonging to minority groups must be perfectly guaranteed, so that these groups will automatically accord their loyalty to the countries of which they are citizens. It is time to demonstrate our confidence in the future and to show our political commitment in favor of stability in Europe. I have proposed that the European Union (EU) and all those countries which are interested in the stability of our continent, and in particular the United States and Russia, should offer the countries of Central and East Europe a political framework within which to organize in the best possible way relations between neighboring countries so that problems of borders and of minorities shall never again arise. This initiative was accepted at the European summit in Brussels in December 1993. It is only natural for this to be the first joint foreign policy and security action by the EU. It demonstrates the will of the EU to place its economic strength and stability in the service of the continent as a whole. At the Copenhagen summit in July 1993, the Twelve decided to open the door to the prospect of membership for the countries of Central and East Europe. Everybody understands that this enlargement will be made easier if the sources of instability are no more, and our economic and political structures aligned. Everybody also understands that this enlargement must also involve the field of security. This is the thinking behind the proposal made to countries seeking to join the EU to create a status of associate member of the WEU [Weestern European Union], in conformity with the EU aims to avail itself of a joint defense and security policy. The new organization of the continent of Europe that we are seeking must extend to all aspects of our common life. We must all work together on this, and as of now. The conference to launch this stability pact project will be held on 26 and 27 May. I believe this conference should be the start of a diplomatic process, the need for which everybody is now aware, to judge by the number of bilateral accords currently being negotiated but which sometimes prove difficult to successfully conclude. It must refocus attention on the commitment of all the participating countries to the principal existing texts and launch several tables of bilateral negotiations, or of regional negotiations in order to deal with the regional aspects of good neighborliness between these countries. It is not therefore a question of writing new texts, of creating a new institution, and even less of seeking to replace the free will of the interested countries. I believe that the presence of moderators at these negotiating tables will serve to reassure all parties, offering them support and, if possible, the objectivity of a third party. These third parties could be the EU, or an institution, or member countries, and France is ready to lend its assistance to anyone who may request it. Because the fact remains that the question of good neighborliness often involves tackling matters of extreme sensitivity in the area of domestic policy. A Signal of European Will Everybody must therefore commit themselves to this process with every assurance that justice will be respected. There will no longer be large or small countries, but rather partners in a common cause. The relations of the past 30 years between France and Germany testify to the extraordinary results which bilateral accords can achieve when inspired by strong political will and when they create the appropriate procedures. Franco-German consultations are so close and frequent at all levels of the state and society that, for example, the border between the two countries which was formerly so heavily emotionally and symbolically charged has today become a symbol of rapprochement. The accords which the parties will reach will be grouped within a stability pact to be signed by all the participants at the conference which will conclude this process. They will thus be lending decisive support to the legitimacy of these accords. The signatures of countries seeking to join the EU will be a fundamental element in drawing closer to the EU. Respect for these accords will guarantee harmonious progress of the European enterprise. It may be supposed that the formal nature of this pact will constitute in Europe a very strong and significant signal in favor of stability. This signal will be understood by all those who govern the economy, together with all the other powers in the world who will see in it both Europe's will to once again serve as an example for the respect of the human values which were born in our continent, and an area of progress for the people who live on European soil.
