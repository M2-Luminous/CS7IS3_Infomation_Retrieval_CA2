FR941005-2-00061 FR941005-2-00039 IV. Second Stage Refund Procedures Any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. §§4501&hyph;07. PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to OHA, and any funds that OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA. It is therefore ordered, That: Applications for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department of Energy by any one of the firms named in the Appendix to this Decision, pursuant to the Remedial Order finalized on October 22, 1980, may now be filed.
