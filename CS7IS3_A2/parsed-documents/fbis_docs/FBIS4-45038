The author of this statement is the minister for industrial restructuring and participation, Mr. Mourad Benachenhou. [sentence as published] He also told CHAINE III that he did not consider himself the minister for privatization. More specifically, Mr. Benachenhou said his ministry's mission is not privatization but rather redesign: to analyze the current state of the industrial plant and other economic activities and propose a reorganization to facilitate increased productivity. The minister added that his department has no intention of drawing up a reorganization policy in a vacuum. Quite the opposite: He envisages consulting all parties concerned, including the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers]. "The ministry will elaborate a policy that will have greater impact on the Algerian economic landscape and on all the social partners, who are extremely important, since they represent the great mass of workers. The latter will be consulted and have the opportunity to express their views about reorganization of the industrial plant." The minister noted that the objective of restructuring the economy is to increase the productivity of the industrial plant, whether it be publicly or privately owned. "We must recognize that the industrial sector needs reorganization to increase productivity and modernize the productive plant. It is growth of the existing plant, quite apart from the question of its ownership, that will ensure a return to economic growth, create jobs, and stabilize the value of the dinar," said Mr. Benachenhou. According to the minister, two factors must be considered in reorganizing the sector. First, existing productive potential must be maintained. "Deindustrialization under the cover of restructuring is out of the question." Second, reorganization must reinforce employment, not lead to its disappearance. At the time Mr. Benachenhou was installed in his new position, he said among other things that there was a need to come up with industrial restructuring options compatible with Algerian realities. The secretary general of the UGTA has proposed that priority go to creating employee shareholderships. Regarding the effects of the IMF accord on economic recovery, the minister said Algeria has the resources to recover if it meticulously implements the IMF stabilization policy. Even a simple debt rescheduling would be enough to put Algeria on the road to economic recovery, if the rescheduling covers a long enough period to allow for consolidation. The negotiations expected to begin in the next few weeks with the Paris Club on rescheduling medium and long-term official debt could lead to a $4 billion reduction in debt service for 1994 and an additional $1 billion reduction between now and the March 1995 expiration of the standby agreement; without such relief, it is estimated that debt service for the current year would amount to $9.5 billion. Referring to the secrecy surrounding the contents of the letter of intent sent to the IMF--some of the social partners seem to be critical of the government on this score--the minister said the letter contained "a number of measures whose effectiveness cannot be assured unless they remain confidential until implemented." "The contents of the accord will only be made public," Mr. Benachenhou added, "insofar as it is determined that disclosure would not prejudice national interests or be exploited by a minority for purposes of profit." "It is a question of collective responsibility," he concluded.
