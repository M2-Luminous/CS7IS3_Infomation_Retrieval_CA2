See Central of Georgia Railroad Company_Trackage Rights Exemption_Southern Railway Company and The Cincinnati, New Orleans, and Texas Pacific Railway Company, Finance Docket No. 31504 (ICC served Oct. 18, 1990) ( Central of Georgia ). Thus, portions of existing trackage rights are being expanded from overhead rights only to include both local and overhead trackage rights. The Cleveland-Cohutta line joins the Ooltewah-Atlanta line at Cohutta (milepost 14.5&hyph;I on the Cleveland-Cohutta line, which is also milepost 26.7&hyph;H on the Ooltewah-Atlanta line). The Tasso-Chattanooga line joins the Cleveland-Cohutta line at Cleveland (milepost 212.7A on the Tasso-Chattanooga line, which is also milepost 0.0&hyph;I on the Cleveland-Cohutta line). The Tasso-Chattanooga line also joins the Ooltewah-Atlanta line at Ooltewah (milepost 226.6&hyph;A on the Tasso-Chattanooga line, which is milepost 15.2&hyph;H on the Ooltewah-Atlanta line). Thus, the 179.5 miles over NSR are contiguous. The Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway Company (CNOTP), a subsidiary of NSR, has agreed to grant local and overhead trackage rights to CGA over approximately 6.4 miles of NSR's line of railroad between Chattanooga (milepost 338.0, 23rd Street Interlocking Tower) and Citico Junction, TN (milepost 332.4). 2 Citico Junction is at milepost 238.2&hyph;A on the NSR Tasso-Chattanooga line. Thus this line of railroad is contiguous with the 179.5 NSR miles. 2 CGA has been granted overhead trackage rights over this same CNOTP line in Central of Georgia, supra.
