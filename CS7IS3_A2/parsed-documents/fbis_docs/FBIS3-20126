If only the EU [European Union] can solve its internal problems. This was European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel's pronouncement to yesterday's press briefing and these "internal affairs" also came to be the main theme of the briefing. "The situation within the EU is serious. If it is not resolved soon, there will be every justification for talk of a crisis. Something that could in its turn deadlock the European Parliament." Soon -- perhaps at this coming weekend's meeting of foreign ministers. But certainly not as late as the summer's meeting of foreign ministers on Corfu. Even though Dinkelspiel says that he does not see how the issue can be resolved. "As far as I am able to judge there is no definite deadline. Technically it will be possible to carry on a good way into April." The Swedish side is currently working on the treaty of accession. It is expected that this will be translated and put before the European Parliament "in early April." "But the parliament already has a base on which to begin its work and it has done so," the European affairs minister said. However, he declined to make any statement himself about the distribution of votes in the European Parliament [sentence as published]. Something that Social Democratic opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson, for example, has done. "The question is of some importance, but not of such importance that I think it justified. Thus we have therefore, quite intentionally, not decided on a position." As a nonmember Sweden is still a mere spectator of the ongoing debacle between Spain and Britain and the rest of the EU. What Sweden is doing is "following" what is being said in Brussels, London, and Madrid. Further negotiations are not being contemplated. "But we have of course close contacts with the countries. But we always have, with everybody." But does the current conflict in Brussels not help to strengthen the no side here at home? "It could have a temporary influence on public opinion. But if there is a serious crisis, it could have more lasting negative repercussions." But Dinkelspiel was unwilling to agree -- not fully at least -- to the suggestion that the Swedish Government already knows what the final outcome will be, that everything has really already been settled. "The negotiations are incomplete. But it would of course not be wholly truthful of me to say that I do not know in what direction things are leaning." So it is now fully in order for the European affairs minister to go to South Africa on Thursday [24 March]. At the head of the first Swedish trade delegation to visit the country since sanctions were lifted. And let Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas deal with Europe over the next 10 days.
