FR940203-0-00058 FR940203-0-00017 Response: NMFS does not agree. Section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA was enacted in 1981 specifically to provide a means to authorize incidental takes in connection with legitimate maritime activities other than commercial or subsistence fishing. Prior to 1981, these incidental takes were prohibited by the MMPA moratorium on taking and any such takings were subject to prosecution under the MMPA. Negligible Impact/Small Take Comment: Commenters stated that NMFS cannot make a finding of negligible impact unless the impact is small, and of little consequence. Also, if the potential effects would be significant, NMFS cannot make a finding of negligible impact. Response: Under NMFS' regulatory definition (50 CFR 228.4), a negligible impact is an impact resulting from the specified activity that cannot reasonably be expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock of marine mammal through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival. The 1986 amendments to the MMPA altered the previous standard for determining negligible impact. Prior to the 1986 amendments, the taking from the impact had to be ``so small, unimportant, or of so little consequence as to warrant little or no attention.'' However, after the 1986 amendment, NMFS adopted the definition of negligible impact set out in the Senate's Section-by-Section Analysis (132 Cong. Rec. S16305, October 15, 1986). Section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA clearly indicates that some level of adverse effects involving the take of depleted marine mammals can be authorized so long as the impact is negligible. Comment: Several commenters stated that the taking of 1,917 marine mammals annually does not represent a ``small number.'' Another commenter considered the requested take to not have a ``negligible impact.'' This commenter and several others also state that an incidental take exceeding 9,600 marine mammals over the 5-year period is not small. Response: As noted in the EA, because not all species of marine mammals would be expected to be found within the vicinity of a test site during any particular test, the take estimates should not be considered additive for the purposes of determining whether the incidental take is small. The MMPA requires NMFS to authorize incidental takes on a species/stock basis based upon the best scientific information available. Therefore, even though it is extremely unlikely that more than a few species/stocks would be present at any one time in the offshore waters of the SCB, authorizations must be made on a species basis. In addition, because NMFS and the Navy cannot know in advance which of these species would be within the SCB at the time of a test, the Navy found it necessary to design its request as though all species/stocks recorded as inhabiting the offshore waters of the SCB would be within the safety zone, even though the probability of that happening is considered extremely remote. For that reason, as noted in the EA, NMFS considers the taking request ( i.e., 1,917 marine mammals) to reflect a ``worst-case scenario.'' This is also true for the total taking over 5 years; the statutory requirement is for a determination that the total taking (over the 5-year authorization period) would have a negligible impact (see previous response). Comment: One commenter stated that section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA requires [regulations regarding] the protection of rookeries. This commenter also believes NMFS failed to consider impacts upon other marine species. For example, the commenter stated that the EA does not mention impacts upon the migratory routes of gray whales and other migratory species and that it fails to ``pay particular attention'' to these significant species. Response: NMFS does not agree. The EA notes that the underwater explosives detonations will have no impacts on marine mammals that are ashore at the time of detonation; therefore, without information to the contrary, regulations are unnecessary to protect onshore rookeries. In addition, the best available scientific information indicates that the requested taking will have no more than a negligible impact on the populations of marine mammals inhabiting the waters of the SCB, their mating grounds, migratory routes and other areas of similar significance. The EA discusses fully the impacts on those marine species believed to frequent the test area, including gray whales, other marine mammals and other species. The EA indicated that no gray whales were sighted within Area 2 and NMFS therefore concluded that no gray whales will be killed and that only three would incur non-lethal injuries. For the same reasons the migratory routes of gray whales will be unaffected by the short-term impacts from the detonation itself. Moreover, gray whales are resilient to human activities and will reoccupy areas once the activity ceases (see 58 FR 3121, January 7, 1993), further limiting expected impacts. Comment: One commenter stated that the MMPA requires NMFS to prescribe regulations that restrict, among other things, ``the season or the period of time within which animals may be taken'' and the ``manner and locations in which animals may be taken.'' Response: While the provisions of section 103 of the MMPA do not apply for small takes under section 101(a)(5), seasonal restrictions are viewed by NMFS as one method of reducing takes. However, there is no scientific evidence at this time to indicate that there is any one period of the year when marine mammals are not within the OSTR. Although population assessment research in the SCB, currently underway, will be reviewed to determine if seasonal restrictions would result in lower incidental takes, because the marine environment of the SCB is dynamic and significantly influenced by oceanographic factors such as El Ni√±o, this might not be practical on a long-term basis. However, the Navy will be required to locate the areas within the OSTR that have the lowest numbers of marine mammals and to conduct its tests within those areas.
