Back from his official visit to Beijing, Boguslaw predicted that by the year 2000, trade volume between the two countries will recover to the level of 1986 and stabilize at 1 billion U.S. dollars. 1991 witnessed a sharp decline in bilateral trade when the trade volume dropped to 140 million dollars, down 71 percent from the previous year. In face of the widespread recession in Western Europe and in an effort to get new international market, Poland found a new partner in China. In 1993, by developing new forms of cooperation beyond barter trade, Poland and China greatly augmented economic and trade exchanges and investment in each other. The trade volume in 1993 climbed to 400 million dollars and is expected to rise steadily in 1994. Closer contacts between the two governments also facilitated the further development of their trade and economic ties. A Polish vice prime minister visited China in June 1993, in return for a visit made by his Chinese counterpart Zou Jiahua to Poland. Some provinces in China have sent their own trade delegations to Poland during the past year.
