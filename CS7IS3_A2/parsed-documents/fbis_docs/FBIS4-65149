In addition to the cultivation of German-Russian relations, the visit is intended to demonstrate Russia's importance within the network of European relations. The Federal Government also has an interest in strengthening Russia's self-confidence by including it in agreements and preventing the emergence of distrust that could turn into aggressiveness. Yeltsin will hold talks with President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl; on 13 May, he will meet with business and industry representatives. Yeltsin will visit telecommunications and high-tech companies in Baden-Wuerttemberg. German industrialists would have preferred a round of talks to discuss their wish for a reduction of investment barriers in Russia. Yeltsin's schedule apparently did not allow such a program. The German economic sector deplores discriminating tax laws and legal insecurity in Russia. Kohl's proposal that Western firms repair the leaks in Russian oil and gas pipelines could not be implemented, nor have the Russian nuclear power plants been made safe. The seven major industrial nations (G7) and the European Union (EU) programs to this end are making hardly any progress because Moscow insists that Russian nuclear power plants are safer than those in the West. During Yeltsin's visit, the Federal Republic will reportedly not make any new financial pledges, since the current scope for Hermes [credit insurance company] credits has not been fully exhausted. However, the Federal Government will confirm that it will continue to support the course of reform. The government believes that even though Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin is pursuing reform more slowly, "it is more important that the basic course be continued." Bonn does not doubt that the Chernomyrdin government is serious about carrying out reform. The Moscow chief of government had sent many foreign advisers home and asked Western governments to appoint more serious and more experienced experts. This time, no "joint statement" will be signed in Bonn, no agreements will be concluded, and the course of the visit is to present normalcy. The aim of the visit has been defined in Bonn as "psychological." It has been noted increasingly in recent months that Russia has the impression that it is not being taken seriously as a great power and a nuclear power. As U.S. President Bill Clinton did in Moscow in January, Kohl will now stress to Yeltsin that Moscow is being treated as an equal partner, and Germany is supporting the integration of Russia into European institutions. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party -- FDP) will make clear to Andrey Kozyrev that "Russia belongs to us, and we want Russia to become integrated." According to Kinkel, the fact should be considered that following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, Russia is feeling like a "solitary state" without any allies. In the Bonn talks, Kohl, Kinkel, and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) will advocate NATO's offer of "Partnership for Peace." According to the Chancellor's Office, Russia's role as a great power cannot be ignored in this respect. Regarding Moscow's statements that the "Partnership for Peace" should be replaced by a special relationship with NATO, as Russia has in mind, the Federal Government wants to find out "what and how Russia will sign." What type of special role Moscow has in mind has not been fully discussed. According to government officials, a separate relationship between Russia and the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany, which some Russian politicians are seeking, is out of the question and is at best useful only in certain situations. NATO as a whole and Moscow should define their mutual relationship, because otherwise, the smaller alliance and EU members would be offended. Germany considers the request that NATO consult Russia before making any alliance decision unacceptable, because this would be tantamount to an indirect Russian right of veto. Bonn differentiates between the offer of a "Partnership for Peace" including a voluntary right of consultation on a case-by-case basis and the more far-reaching Russian demand. In his talks with Yeltsin, Kohl will argue that Clinton, too, recommends the application of NATO's partnership concept to Russia. Like Kohl, Kinkel is considering the option of taking Russia's importance into account in this respect. In addition to the "Partnership for Peace" framework agreement that would be equal for all partners, the second part of the agreement, which will be formulated "individually" for every country, could contain modalities that would be tailored to Russia. Officials in Bonn believe that the signing of a partnership agreement with Russia could be made more attractive by accompanying it with a statement. They mention as an example of higher etiquette, a signing ceremony in the presence of the NATO Council and an address by its chairman. Bonn rules out Russia's NATO membership and its accession to the EU: "Then we might as well pack up." Bonn assesses Russia's troop withdrawal agreement with Latvia as a favorable start. Bonn will presumably call upon Moscow to observe European rules in dealing with southern neighbors like Georgia. Kohl and Kinkel will express their wish for an early conclusion of a cooperation agreement between the EU and Moscow, and recommend to Moscow that it guarantee working alternatives for Western banks. The negotiations, including those on nonmilitary nuclear deals, are making slow progress. Bonn advocates preparatory talks this summer on the admittance of Russia to the Council of Europe. The Federal Government does not consider feasible a joint farewell ceremony in Berlin for the Russian, U.S., British, and French troops in the presence of all chiefs of state and heads of government. Since Russian Supreme Commander Burlakov in eastern Germany has objected to the idea suggested by Kohl and Yeltsin that the influence of German classics on Russian literature of the 19th century should be mentioned in Weimar, and cultural ties for the future should be stressed, the compromise now will probably be that Yeltsin and Kohl will speak at a wreath-laying ceremony at the former Soviet memorial in Berlin-Treptow and at a subsequent meeting in the Russian Embassy in Berlin. If Yeltsin rejects Weimar, the ceremonies could be concentrated into half a day in Berlin; according to Bonn, the military presence should then be confined to a Bundeswehr detachment, a Russian guard of honor, and a Russian military band at the Treptow memorial. A week later, U.S. Vice President Al Gore, President Francois Mitterrand, and Prime Minister Major will seal the withdrawal of the protective powers in Berlin. Agreements in the wake of the Two-Plus-Four negotiations envision the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany by the end of 1995 -- which was advanced to the end of August 1994 during Kohl's visit to Moscow in 1992 -- and the withdrawal of the Western contingents from Berlin at a later date, so that Bonn also considers a separate farewell justified for this reason as well. Bonn officials are annoyed with Burlakov, who with his criticism of Bonn's plans, and possibly with the protection of Grachev, is apparently trying -- so they say -- to nail Yeltsin down. The talks on setting up a German consulate-general in Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad) will be difficult. When Kinkel was in Moscow in March, the Russian government was no longer ready to talk about the planned setting up of a German mission and said that this was a matter that had to be decided by the chiefs, Yeltsin and Kohl. Moscow hinted in March that Koenigsberg was a touchy issue. The Russian Security Council also put Koenigsberg on its agenda, in addition to the "Partnership for Peace." The return of German art objects, which is envisioned in the cultural agreement, is also disputed. Russia Needs a Special Role CDU foreign policy expert Karl-Heinz Hornhues has advocated a contractual special relationship between Russia and NATO. Hornhues, who is deputy floor leader of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union in the Bundestag, said in Bonn on 10 May that Russia was having problems with NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program, because, unlike the other Central and East European countries, Moscow was "independent" in foreign and defense policy terms and could look after its security on its own. However, the Soviet Union's former alliance partners had joined the "Partnership for Peace" to increase their security in cooperation with NATO. In addition, Russia maintained "political order" in East European and Central Asia, which was not welcomed but tolerated by the West, because the NATO states themselves were not prepared to make available to the United Nations or the CSCE peace troops for missions in Central Asia or the Caucasus. Hornhues said: "Without Russia, there would be no prospects for a just peace in the nationality conflicts between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, in Georgia or Tajikistan." Moscow's claim for a special relationship with the European Union and NATO was based on Russia's "security policy independence and its role as a power maintaining order." Hornhues said, however, that by speaking about "safeguarding Russian interests in nearby countries" and by stating big power claims, Russia also created the suspicion of pursuing neoimperialist goals. Nonetheless, the states of the Western alliance should think about "whether they should not offer Russia a special system of relations and treaties with NATO soon that clearly go beyond the Partnership for Peace." According to Hornhues, the preparedness to do so depends in particular on the United States, which "long ago developed a means of cooperation common between alliance partners" on problems of intercontinental and nuclear security. Hornhues said: "A special treaty relationship between Russia and NATO would not only diminish Russian reservations against membership of the Central and East European countries in NATO; for the Central and East European countries, too, closer Russian relations with NATO would mean more security."
