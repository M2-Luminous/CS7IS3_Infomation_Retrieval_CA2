Unknown to these men was a blue-and-white delivery van parked across the street from the restaurant with a long-range listening device that recorded their conversation. Inside the van were agents of the Indonesian Secret Service who were tailing Ramos-Horta, a well-known leader of the resistance movement of East Timor. The plan was to hold the conference somewhere in Asia in November 1993 to coincide with the anniversary of the 1991 Dill massacre. It would be held under the guise of discussing human rights, but its real objective was political: to turn East Timor into a major international issue to force the Suharto government to grant self-determination to East Timor and push the Indonesian people to overthrow military rule in favor of a democratic government. At the end of the conference, a declaration would be issued condemning the Indonesian Government for the violation of human rights in East Timor and urging all nations to follow suit and impose sanctions. The conference in November had to be postponed, probably because of funding difficulties but most likely because the organizers could not find an appropriate venue to hold it in Asia. The National Democratic Front which maintained contact with dissident movements worldwide and which was unhappy about the peace and amnesty proposals of the Ramos government that had driven a sharp wedge through their ranks, suddenly had a clever idea. Why not hold it in Manila? The Philippine Government would then be faced with the unpleasant prospect of stopping the conference and violating the constitutional provisions on free speech and free assembly or damaging its close ties with Jakarta and breaking up ASEAN. Either way, it would be a no-win situation for Fidel V. Ramos. In their meetings with Ramos-Horta in Bangkok and Sydney, Renato Constantino Jr. and Cecilia Jimenez, both known for their leftist sympathies, broached the idea of holding it within the premises of the University of the Philippines (UP). If the Ramos government objected, the UP faculty and students would rise to defend their academic freedom and autonomy. The conference was scheduled for May-June 1994. To add an aura of prestige to the conference, it was decided to invite international personalities like Danielle Mitterand, the wife of the French President who was a human rights advocate. This way, if Fidel V. Ramos tried to stop the conference it would prove an embarrassment to the Philippine Government. The Indonesians, who were closely monitoring the situation, were feeding intelligence reports on a regular basis to Gen. Joe Almonte, the national security adviser. Thus the question of the conference was taken up by Cluster E that deals with security matters. Cluster E concluded there was really nothing the Philippine Government could do short of violating the Philippine Constitution. Jakarta was unhappy. It could not understand why a conference with clear political overtones aimed at subverting Indonesian territorial integrity was being allowed by Manila in a state-subsidized university. Had not Indonesia been a good and loyal friend? When the Philippines suffered an oil crunch, it was Indonesian oil that bailed it out. When it was struck by a natural calamity, Indonesian help was the first on its way. When the Muslims wanted to secede from the Philippines, Indonesia acted as a moderating influence in international fora. In fact, both countries were not only the closest of allies, they were bound as brothers by race and were together in ASEAN. Hence Jakarta viewed Manila's lack of firm action as a stab in the back. What it did not know is that Fidel V. Ramos was looking quietly and patiently for a legal solution to the crisis. To show its displeasure, Jakarta postponed the round of talks with the MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] that was being held in the Indonesian capital as well as its investments and participation in the East ASEAN Growth Area business conference in Davao. Manila sent a three-man diplomatic mission led by former foreign secretary Raul Manglapus to Jakarta to explain the Philippine position and to reaffirm its full support for the territorial integrity of Indonesia. The Ramos government, Manglapus assured the Indonesian foreign minister, would explore all legal avenues to contain the damage that would be caused by the East Timor conference. But Jakarta was not appeased. The furor created by the conference was not lost on the French whose embassy in Manila kept Paris updated. If General Suharto was prepared to break with General Ramos over East Timor, there was no reason why he would not do the same with Francois Mitterand if Danielle attended the conference. And the French could not afford such a break given the fragile political situation in France and its investments in Indonesia. France was a major supplier of arms to Indonesia and the French armament industry was in the doldrums due to the end of the Cold War. It would be in the French national interest that Danielle stayed out of the conference. Jakarta stepped up its pressure. It forbade Indonesian students to participate in any meeting in Manila and its gunboats arrested Filipino fishermen in Indonesian waters. It hinted that Filipinos working in Indonesia would lose their jobs and be repatriated back to Manila. Indonesian NGO's [nongovernment organizations] threatened to convene a conference that would affect Philippine territorial integrity. The subtle message conveyed by Jakarta was that any persons or countries that would harm Indonesia would be responsible for the harm to their own people. While aimed specifically at the Philippines, the message was really addressed to all nations alike. No right-thinking government could ignore such a message. The acts of a few would not be allowed to affect the interests of a whole nation, particularly if they are foreigners acting to manipulate a situation that serves only their personal ends. This was the rationale behind President Ramos' decision to ban foreign participants to the East Timor conference in Manila and the government had a perfect right to do so. Filipinos could discuss what they want at that conference since they are protected by their constitutional rights, but no foreigners have the right to damage the good relations between countries of which they are not citizens. It is understandable that Indonesia reacted the way it did. Any country with a sense of dignity and sovereignty would have done the same. When Harvey Firestone tried to separate Mindanao from the rest of the Philippines in the early 1900's to benefit the American rubber industry, Manuel L. Quezon threatened to lead a revolt against the United States. The bill sponsored by Representative Bacon of New York died a quiet death in the House Committee on Insular Affairs. President Ramos' decision to ban foreign participants was clearly in the national interest. Countries that are poor cannot afford to eat on principles by being the world policemen of human rights. Nor can one affect change by isolating Indonesia, as Jose Ramos-Horta proposes to do. Had Fidel V. Ramos not done what he did, the damage to the Philippines would have been incalculable. History would surely have branded him as a traitor for the hardships brought upon his people. Something that the local convenors of the East Timor conference would do well to reflect on.
