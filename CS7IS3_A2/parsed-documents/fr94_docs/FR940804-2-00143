FR940804-2-00143 FR940804-2-00080 The Phlx is amending Regulation 4, Paragraph (a) to prohibit indecorous conduct on the trading floor which is disruptive to the conduct of business on the floor. The Exchange is also adopting Sub-Paragraph (iv) to Regulation 4 to impose a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000 for abusive, derisive or harassing treatment directed at any person while on the floor, which, in the view of two floor officials, could constitute a public embarrassment to the Exchange. Finally, the Exchange is adopting Paragraph (b) to Regulation 4 stating that any acts described in paragraph (a) which are deemed particularly egregious, or where an individual has established a pattern of order violations, may be referred by two floor officials to the Business Conduct Committee where additional fines and other sanctions may be imposed pursuant to Phlx Rule 960. As a result of this adopted language, similar language which currently follows the paragraph addressing physical abuse in Regulation 4 is being deleted to apply the new paragraph to all violations of Regulation 4. The Exchange believes that the amendment is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and the public interested by ensuring an orderly and decorous environment on the trading floor for Exchange business to be conducted. The proposal is also consistent with Section 5(b)(6), in that Regulation 4, as amended, would continue to provide that members of the Exchange be appropriately disciplined for violations of the rules of the Exchange. III. Discussion The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with the requirements of Sections 6(b)(5), (6) and (7) of the Act. 7 7 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988). The Commission believes that the Phlx's amendments are a reasonable measure which should help to ensure the orderly operation of the Exchange floor. The proposal addresses the operational concerns by explicitly prohibiting indecorous conduct that is disruptive to business on the Exchange's trading floor. The Commission believes that the amendment to Regulation 4 should contribute to the Phlx's efforts to ensure the efficient, undisrupted conduct of business on the Exchange and provide a trading floor environment free from conduct that could distract or interfere with market activity. As a result, the rule change should enhance the members' ability to engage in transactions in securities and, thereby, protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that the proposed amendments provide appropriate penalties for violations of Regulation 4. Specifically, the adopted range of fines ($500 to $1,000) that can be imposed for abusive, derisive or harassing conduct on the floor which is determined by two floor officials to constitute a public embarrassment to the Exchange is reasonable in relation to the infractions in question because of the Phlx's interest in ensuring the safety of its floor personnel and the undisrupted conduct of business on the Exchange. Moreover, because the rule change defines the scope of prohibited conduct, provides notice to members, provides a right of appeal, and is tailored to serve a legitimate Exchange regulatory interest to ensure that trading can continue undisrupted on the Phlx floor, the proposal provides fair and reasonable procedures for the regulation of trading floor conduct. The Commission also believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to retain discretion to pursue formal disciplinary proceedings in accordance with Phlx Rule 960 for egregious violations or where an individual has established a pattern of order violations. This will enable the Exchange to seek stiffer sanctions where warranted by the scope and nature of the violative conduct. The Commission, however, emphasizes that when an Exchange investigation results in a full disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Rule 960, all procedural rights provided in the Rule would apply. 8 8 The Exchange stated that two floor officials could not impose a fine or sanction pursuant to both Rules 60 and 960 for the same conduct. The Exchange also stated that if a disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Rule 960 is initiated by the Exchange, all procedural rights contained in Rule 960 would apply. Conversation between Gerald D.
