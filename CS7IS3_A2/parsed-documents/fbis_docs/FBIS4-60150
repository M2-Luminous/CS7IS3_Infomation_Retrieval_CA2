Pro-Israel militia men report that the occupation army intends to withdraw from Hasbayya and Jazzin, where the Israeli army has been the target of fierce resistance attacks. This step will enable the Israeli army to keep away from the Hizballah-controlled combat line extending between Iqlim al-Tuffah and Western al-Biqa'. The Israeli army will create a 3-8 km wide buffer zone that will separate the expected Israel withdrawal point and the resistance positions. Israel's objective behind this step is to cancel the combat line, explore whether the Lebanese Army can fill the vacuum should withdrawal occur, and control security in the area. It will also demonstrate Israel's good intentions during the upcoming peaceful negotiations and exploit it on the international level. Observers believe that the Israeli occupation army's withdrawal from Kawkaba, which overlooks the western al-Biqa' and the liberated area in Hasbayya, is a basic step toward the Israeli withdrawal from the areas of Hasbayya and Jazzin and toward placing them under the full control of the Lahdist militia. The Lahdist militia has become more convinced that the Israeli occupation army is using it as a buffer to protect its presence inside the Lebanese territory. The observers also believe that the Israeli army views the militia as a burden restricting its freedom of options in the ongoing negotiations, especially as the militia cannot be legitimized or accepted on the Lebanese official and popular stance. Lebanon cannot even bargain over this militia's being a traitor and collaborating with the enemy. Accordingly, this issue plays a major role in the continuing desertion of many militia members. Security sources affirm that the Lebanese army is fully prepared to fill any vacuum that might occur because of a sudden Israeli withdrawal. [passage omitted] The security sources do not rule out that Israel might effect its partial withdrawal during the next three months, especially if a tangible progress is made on the issue of negotiations concerning what is called "Hasbayya and Jazzin First." Could this Israeli option be accepted by Lebanon?
