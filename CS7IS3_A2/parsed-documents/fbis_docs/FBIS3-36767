Private farmers have already achieved a significant success in the past few years. Your products are more and more noticeable on the Russian table," says the greeting sent by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the delegates of the congress of the Association of Peasant Holdings and Cooperatives of Russia (AKKOR). I fully realize that had the state rendered more substantial support to farms, their output would have been much more substantial too, says the greeting, released today by the president's press service. "Farmers are becoming a noticeable and influential force in Russian society," the document emphasizes. "Remarkably, thousands of officers and warrant officers in reserve have received land plots. The time when you have only been posing problems is coming to an end. The main thing now is to find most effective solutions, together with the authorities, together with all those who want to help Russian agriculture."
