He told TASS that his agency aims to clarify the total amount of radioactive waste in North Korea and the location of its burial places. Blix hopes that Pyongyang "will raise the curtain of mystery" over the fate of the radioactive fuel from its 5 mgwatt reactor and said talks are currently being held with North Korea on the problem. The IAEA director played down fears about the scope of illegal exports of radioactive waste stolen by criminal groups. He said that 95 per cent of reported cases turned out to be pure inventions. However, some cases did take place and were thoroughly investigated. Blix added that he had already held negotiations with nuclear powers and agreed with them that it is necessary to cut short criminal attempts to smuggle out radioactive waste. He believes a special organisation resembling the FBI might be set up for the purpose. Dwelling on the future of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine where the worst nuclear disaster occurred in 1986, Blix said that the Ukrainian Government wants to keep the plant running because of economic problems and that the leaderships of Western Europe are ready to help it. However, in future the obsolete reactors of the plant are to be replaced, he added.
