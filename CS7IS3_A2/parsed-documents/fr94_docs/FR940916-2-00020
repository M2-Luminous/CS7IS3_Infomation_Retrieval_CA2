FR940916-2-00020 FR940916-2-00018 Notice of a Class Deviation to Waive Federal Register Notices of Financial Assistance Awards to Historically Black Universities AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of class deviation from 10 CFR 600.14(f). SUMMARY: Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.4, Deviations, the Department of Energy has authorized a class deviation from 10 CFR 14.(f) which requires a Federal Register Notice for certain financial assistance awards. This deviation applies exclusively to applications received from Historically Black Universities which will conduct pre-college summer educational programs for women and minority students. These applications were submitted in response to a Notice of Program Interest published by the Department of Energy. The intent of publishing notification of financial assistance awards is to foster competition and provide information regarding subcontracting opportunities. However, a Notice of Program Interest has already served as notice to interested applicants, and no subcontracting opportunities have been identified. Additionally, due to programmatic requirements, it is important that awards be made as soon as possible. Therefore, the Department of Energy has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 600.4, that a deviation from the requirement to publish a Federal Register Notice of each such award is (1) necessary to achieve program objectives, (2) necessary to conserve public funds.
