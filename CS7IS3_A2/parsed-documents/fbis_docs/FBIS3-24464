Kadannikov, general director of the AvtoVAZ Joint-Stock Company, by correspondent N. Mogzharetto: "VAZ--For Us Or Not About Us? One Million People Work at VAZ"] [Text] In recent years it seems that we have adjusted to everything, but still the new prices introduced for the Zhiguli in December are staggering. Here we have already passed up the Opal and Chrysler in terms of cost and we are catching up with the Mercedes. Apparently, finding no buyers for their products, the automotive plant stood idle during all of January and only in February did it produce its first motor vehicle. During these days our correspondent N. Mogzharetto met with the general director of the AvtoVAZ Joint-Stock Company, V. Kadannikov. [Kadannikov] The situation at the automotive plant is the same as it is throughout all of industry and throughout our entire economy. Because of the shortage of batching materials and items and nonpayments it was necessary to shut the plant down for a month. Plus a lot of work for repairing equipment and readjusting it for the Desyatka had accumulated. The collective went to work on 1 February and since that time it has been fulfilling its very tight schedule each day. Now about the plant's development. It is simply impossible to imagine an automotive company that never updates its products. But to put a new motor vehicle on the conveyor takes $2-2.5 billion. Today there are no centralized sources but, unfortunately, there is also nothing to take their place. Therefore we created the All-Russian Automotive Alliance, whose main task is to put a new motor vehicle into production. And we are speaking about a completely new model--the VAZ-1116. It will be a five-door "hatchback" which is suitable for conditions in the city and at the same time is high-speed (the experimental model which I have seen reminds one a little of the well-known Italian vehicle Fiat-Tipo.--I.M.) [Mogzharetto] And the Desyatka--will it come into being? [Kadannikov] Approximately 70 percent of the investments have been made in the "2110" family and series production will begin at the end of the year. During 1995 we plan to reach our projected capacities and at the same time gradually phase out our oldest motor vehicle, the VAZ-2106. The VAZ-2105, -07, -04, -08, -09, the Niva and the Oka will remain, but they will be thoroughly modernized. For example, we have already begun to make a longer five-door version of the Niva. Moreover, we are in negotiations with the General Motors firm concerning the production of a model of the Opal-Course in Tolyatti. The Desyatka family itself consists of three motor vehicles: the VAZ-2110 sedan itself, the VAZ-2111--with a "hatchback" body, and the 2112--"universal." There are several versions of the engine: the conventional carburetor engine with a capacity of 1.5 liters, the modernized one with a capacity of 1.7 liters, and the new injection engine with 16 valves. [Mogzharetto] It is very nice that under conditions of economic crisis you are putting a new model on the conveyor. But, excuse me, why is it needed if the price of even the old one has exceeded all possible bounds? Moreover, our vehicle costs less, say, in France, than it does in Russia. [Kadannikov] Our whole life is to blame for the fact that we are selling vehicles at that price. Last year prices of materials and batching items rose on average 6.63-fold, and the motor vehicle prices--4.2-fold. If you compare the prices of the Zhiguli there and here, taking into account our exchange rate of the ruble to the dollar, it turns out that they are higher here. Because the exchange rate itself does not reflect the actual relationship between the ruble and the dollar. There, of course, our Desyatka will not cost $10,000, but that is not because the price is different but because the dollar relative to the ruble is different. The ruble's actual buying power relative to the dollar is about 1.5 times less, and the government is maintaining this exchange rate artificially. Additionally, in a number of cases our prices really do turn out to be higher than in the West, if only because many of our plants are operating like social security organizations. [Mogzharetto] And that is why you "put so much pressure" on our government that effective next year it will introduce monstrous duties on foreign brands. Because it turned out that it was cheaper to buy a new Opal or Renault than a Desyatka. [Kadannikov] All the mass media are accusing me of causing that--introducing these taxes, lobbying the government, etc. I can say--cross my heart--that neither I nor any of the members of our board had anything to do with that decree. It is an ordinary fiscal law generated in the bosom of the Ministry of Finance, and the taxes that are planned will go not for the development of the domestic automotive industry but for purposes unknown to me. I think it would be impossible to abolish the importation of motor vehicles into Russia. At the present time we have approximately 15 million passenger cars in operation in the country. Our entire industry produces 900,000 motor vehicles a year, of which 300,000 are sold abroad. Thus it would take us 25 years to replace the fleet of motor vehicles. This is impossible, no motor vehicle runs that long. And if we do not ship in foreign brands our fleet will become extremely "obsolete," which will lead to accidents, deaths, pollution of the environment, etc. In many places the replacement of the automotive fleet is financed directly by the state. For example, in Greece, where motor vehicles are not produced, three years ago the government decided to allot a very large amount of money--and everyone who sold an old motor vehicle could buy a new one from the state with preferential credit. As a result, the automotive fleet was updated in a short period of time. There is no country that would not protect its producers with import taxes. There are protective measures like this that are worse than ours--in some places more intelligent, in some places less so. But if we are to speak seriously about the market and are concerned about our citizens, we must not raise the question of banning the importation of foreign makes. And we must work on the domestic market as we work on the foreign market, under conditions of competition. To me that is the natural course of events. [Mogzharetto] Is it true that after the regular price increase the plant was overstocked with Zhigulis and they would not sell? [Kadannikov] No, that is not true. There are 1,500 motor vehicles on the lot and it might seem to someone on the outside that the plant has overstocked. But that, excuse me, is a half day's output. But, naturally, the sales level declines after each price increase. When we raise prices everyone is in shock for a month or two. But then the demand levels out. [end Kadannikov] FROM THE EDITORS. We turned the floor over to V. Kadannikov--this is his viewpoint. But there are also others--for example, according to certain information, it was namely the leaders of the LogoVAZ Joint-Stock Company, V. Berezovskiy and V. Kadannikov, who actively "put their minds" to getting new customs duties introduced. Thus they are trying to attract foreign investments to the domestic automotive industry. But the investments (if there are any) will produce a return five years from now, while the Russians need an inexpensive motor vehicle today....
