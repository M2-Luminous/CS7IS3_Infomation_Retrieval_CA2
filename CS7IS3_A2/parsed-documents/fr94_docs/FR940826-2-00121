FR940826-2-00121 FR940826-2-00064 [Docket No. 50&hyph;321] Georgia Power Co. Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;57 issued to the Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, located in Appling County, Georgia. The proposed amendment would make a one-time change to Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.C for Hatch Unit 1 regarding the emergency diesel generator (DG) operability requirements during reactor shutdown conditions. Current TS 3.9.C requires two DGs be operable during reactor shutdown when a core or containment cooling system is required to be operable. The proposed amendment would revise the current requirement such that only one emergency DG is required to be aligned to its associated core or containment cooling system during a specific time of the outage. During this time period the decay heat removal (DHR) system will be in service. The DHR system, which is completely independent of the existing shutdown cooling system, is powered by the Baxley substation and has it own DG as a backup power supply. The licensee is requesting this one-time change for the fall 1994 Unit 1 refueling/maintenance outage to perform local rate testing on the residual heat removal system loops and maintenance on DG 1A. Other limitations are: (1) the other DG will be aligned to its corresponding core or containment cooling system, (2) the reactor cavity is flooded, and (3) the fuel pool gates are removed. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: This proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration because it does not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Although the proposed change slightly increases the probability of a loss of RHR [Residual Heat Removal] shutdown cooling, the probability of the total loss of decay heat removal for the core is not increased. Upon an LOSP [Loss-of-Offsite Power], coupled with the failure of one DG, RHR shutdown cooling (with two RHR pumps and their respective DGs available) will still be available. One diesel out of service, as will be the case on outage days 5 and 6, an LOSP, coupled with a diesel failure, will render RHR shutdown cooling unavailable. However, on outage days 5 and 6, the DHR system is also affected by the LOSP, its backup diesel can be manually placed into service. Furthermore, the RHR shutdown cooling system is susceptible to a single failure on loss of suction path (inadvertent closure of either value E11&hyph;F008 or F009 even without an LOSP).
