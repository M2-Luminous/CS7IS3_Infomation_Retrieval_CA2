The amount going to affected Russian companies is $2 billion. [passage omitted] As IZVESTIYA was informed at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs International Organizations Department, our diplomats have already passed on to the UN Reparations Commission almost 99 percent of all claims on the Russian side. On the whole, those who sustained losses were former Soviet foreign trade organizations which lost orders in Kuwait as a result of the Iraqi invasion. A Foreign Ministry staffer placed special emphasis on the fact that the claims issue has nothing at all to do with the problem of Iraqi debts to Russia, which will be resolved separately and on a bilateral basis.
