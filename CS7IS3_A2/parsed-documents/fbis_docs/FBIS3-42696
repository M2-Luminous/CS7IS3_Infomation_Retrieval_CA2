And if it does, then how? These and other questions are examined by MN's [MOSCOW NEWS] guests -- Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on the Budget and Finances; Vasily Selyunin, economist, deputy of the State Duma; and Mark Massarsky, entrepreneur. Diagnosis Vasily Selyunin: "A change of course is not on the horizon for us -- it already occurred this January." Mark Massarsky: "Liberal democracy has suffered a historical defeat in Russia." Mikhail Zadornov: "The change of course took place a long time ago. Today it has simply become clear and obvious to everyone. When secrets are unveiled, I believe, it is a blessing." Selyunin: The policy of reform was associated with the names of Gaydar and Fedorov. With their departure Chernomyrdin will be able to pursue a pro-inflationary policy which was resisted by the two reformists. Several economic decisions are enough to unwind inflation. The government has declared some of its intentions. One of them is the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. It has been estimated that it will increase the inflation rate in Russia by 10 percent. Another decision is to allot 500 million dollars for the construction of a new parliament building. I have dealt with the economics of construction all my life, and I do not remember a single case of a construction project being consistent with the original estimate. A normal increase in the cost is between three and four times. This means that we are ready to invest in the construction of the parliament building as much as we spent last year on all the programs of conversion. But the point is not in this alone. Beginning February 1, there is a plan to raise the wages and salaries of those employed in the budgetary sphere by 90 percent. As well as the expenditures on the newly-elected Federal Assembly. The experts of the Russia's Choice bloc have estimated that this amounts to 15 million rubles per deputy a month. What is the threat here? Already in the first quarter of January inflation was as high as 10 percent, meaning that it will reach 33 percent by the end of the month. If it keeps up this pace throughout the year, prices will grow 31-fold! Massarsky: It looks as if this government will intervene even more strongly in the economy, and the end result will be the destruction of reforms. A healthy dislike of any government is an indicator of my liberalism. But I dislike the new government even more strongly than the old one. Zadornov: If we speak about the economy, the attempt at classical macrostabilization lasted through the first three months of 1992. At that time Gaydar came to understand that their attempts had miserably failed. Gaydar was faced with an option: either to admit that his idea had proved untenable and step aside or to use his name as a screen for a totally different kind of policy. He opted for the second road. From that moment on, the Gaydar team busied itself not with economic problems but with an entirely different one; how to preserve themselves at the helm of power. Case History Vasily Selyunin: "After the Supreme Soviet had been dismissed, the government began pursuing an austere financial policy, with the result that the budget deficit rose to 7 percent and inflation to 12 percent a month." Mark Massarsky: "The government of reformers has dealt a crushing blow at the non-state economy." Mikhail Zadornov: "Since May 1992 Gaydar and his government have been pursuing a pro-inflationary policy." Selyunin: Let us remember what turn of development has taken place in the last months of 1993. The Supreme Soviet drafted a budget with a large deficit. In defiance of everything, even the law, Minister of Finance Fedorov refused to fulfil it. The handing out of preferential credits was practically discontinued at the same time. Subsidies for import (they absorbed up to 12 percent of the GNP), i.e., the possibility to buy dollars not at the exchange, but for a song, were sharply limited, and they were left merely to purchase medicines and medical equipment. Measures were taken to liberalize foreign trade. Though not the best, a non-inflationary solution was found even in the situation with miners. Part of the diamonds were sold and a fund for the development of the fuel-and-energy complex was created on account of increasing the value-added tax. The reckless subsidizing of the CIS countries was brought to an end. As a result, we received 12 percent of inflation in December against 26 percent in August. Massarsky: I would not overdramatize Gaydar's departure and key up Shakespearean passions. The government of reformers has not coped with the task of macroeconomic regulation. As it has turned out, the Russian economy is inadequate in its responses to classical ploys. A simple example: to the compression of the money mass it reacts with a reduction of the volumes of output, not with a lowering of prices as is written in manuals. the result was the destruction of production -- a fact which Gaydar and Fedorov, according to their own words, are not inclined to dramatize. I, for my part, will permit myself to make the following analogy. The Western economy may be likened to a tropical forest: you chop down a tree in the morning and there are already green sprouts in the same place in the evening. But our Russian economy looks more like the tundra: nothing will grow for 50 years on a trail left by a cross-country vehicle. But the point is not even in the economic results as such. The reformers have lost because the social basis of reforms has shrunk as a result of their actions. A crushing blow has been dealt to the non-state sector of the economy. Between 1989 and 1990 the cooperative sector of the economy grew to seven million persons and became the only dynamic sector where current assets amounted to main capital. The so-called liberalization of prices has practically wiped out these assets. Conversely, in the state sector there has been an indexation of fixed and current assets, attended by the mutual account of nonpayments. All this has sharply strengthened the noncompetitive state sector. Not to mention the taxation policy with which the reformers have been destroying us. With such taxes -- and in some cases their sum-total comes to 85 percent today -- it is impossible to have reproduction not only on a simple but even on an enlarged scale. Why are the reformers being thanked so much by the commercial banks, street traders evading taxes and the comprador bourgeoisie taking unreplenishable raw materials out of Russia? Objectively, irrespective of its good liberal-democratic intentions, the government of reformers has expressed the interests of the comprador bourgeoisie, speculative capital and officials who, like hotel prostitutes, take bribes solely in foreign currency. The world has not known and, I hope, will not know bribe-takers like the ones who have been spawned by the government of reformers. Zadornov: This "absence of policy" was continued throughout the whole of 1993. It had no clearly expressed guideposts and was internally contradictory, whereas the government was divided into groups which lobbied the interests of definite strata. The only person who expressed opposition to this policy was Boris Fedorov, who alone consistently resisted pro-inflationary solutions. Let us put it bluntly that he did that not quite correctly and quite often did not fulfil even presidential decrees. But let us cherish no illusions, for it is not Fedorov who shaped up policy. As a result, both Fedorov and Gaydar acted as a screen for by no means a liberal economic policy. Forecast Vasily Selyunin: "By spring Chernomyrdin will have been fired -- this will be a result of his own policy." Mark Massarsky: "I expect nothing good of the new government -- things will grow even worse." Mikhail Zadornov: "It is pointless, I believe, to speak about the economic reform in the immediate future." Selyunin: The more Chernomyrdin vows fidelity to reforms, the more doubts this arouses. The Persians have a saying: "You said -- I believed, you repeated -- I doubted, you started insisting -- I came to understand that you were lying." The premier and, it seems, the president have drawn the following conclusion from the election returns: the pace of reforms must be slowed down, weak enterprises must be kept afloat, and unemployment must be resisted. However, they tend to forget that this entire "softening" will bring about a splash of inflation. But what people fear most of all is the growth of prices. Gaydar's opponents say: "We must stimulate production." But the floating of money stimulates production growth only to a certain extent. Very quickly inflation acquires such a scale that money discontinues working in general. We have witnessed this situation in Ukraine where inflation is already comparable with that of war-torn Serbia. God forbid that we take the Ukrainian road. I believe that already by spring things may reach the point of an all-Russia strike. The government will resign. Massarsky: On an even larger scale the government will begin feeding noncompetitive production units -- collective and state farms, the military-industrial complex, loss-making mines, and so on. By destroying competition it will destroy the rudiments of the market. Zadornov: Large centralized credits will be allotted in the immediate future, for decisions to this effect have already been drafted. A steep spiral of inflation is assured. And it is important to note the following: the new government will be able to draw on the left-wing parliamentary majority. But the situation is even more dramatic. Upon the constitution's implementation, real power will be concentrated in the president's hands. Will the president find the strength and desire to be a more radical reformer than the government and the parliamentary majority? This question remains unanswered. Massarsky: If the president joins hands with the Left on the principle of the state being the be-all and end-all (and, judging by his followers' statements, this is possible), the priorities of civic society will be consigned to oblivion. Pride of place will again be given not to man, but to the state. This will have its imprint not only on policy, but on the economy, too. I am still an optimist though. I believe that we will be saved by polycentrism. After all, there still exists the parliamentary democratic opposition. There is the fracturing of interests in the structure of the executive branch itself: the government is already turning into a definite counterbalance to presidential structures. And, last but not least, there exists the fourth branch as well. Figure
