A large number of officials of various kinds have been laid off right up to the level of vice premiers -- their number has declined from nine to four. And only two of them will be first deputy heads of the cabinet. Only 20 ministries, 24 state committees, and 20 departments are left. At first glance these figures confirm the official story of the latest government reshuffle: The inflated apparatus must be dealt with. But behind this reduction one can discern a tactical gain for the agrarian and industrial lobbyists and their leaders at the helm of power. Premier Chernomyrdin has been given a week to personally appoint his deputies and ministers. Already observers are united in the opinion that it will be suggested that O. Soskovets and Ye. Gaydar become the first vice premiers and A. Zaveryukha and Yu. Yarov mere vice premiers. Of course this layout could be different. If only because at a recent press conference Gaydar dropped a transparent hint that he might not join the government. It is true that he did not say everything about his doubts. But the absence of his comrades in arms A. Chubays and B. Fedorov on the list of vice premiers needs no special comment. If the reformers' key figures are deprived of their powers then Gaydar will yet again be in the unenviable role of "whipping boy." With this selection of vice premiers inflation will go sky-high by the spring and the future of privatization will look vague to say the least. With this disposition of forces Gaydar and "Russia's Choice" will most likely join the hidden [glukhaya] opposition.
