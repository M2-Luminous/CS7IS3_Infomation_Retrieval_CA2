[Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Is there any chance of yet another initiative by the Russian government succeeding? And, who stands to gain from Vladimir Kazimirov's visit to Azerbaijan? These were the questions which most concerned my colleagues who had come to shed light on the talks held today between President Geydar Aliyev and the Russian president's personal representative Vladimnir Kazimirov. Vladimir Kazimirov again reiterated during this visit to Azerbaijan that Russia has not changed its previous proposals for the peaceful resolution of the conflict, and, in his opinion, it is far more appropriate and useful to renegotiate the peace conditions advanced during the previous consultations than to put forward a new idea each time. Geydar Aliyev said that the Azerbaijani side has often supported the peace initiative and exerted every effort for the elimination of this meaningless war but every time the Armenian side attached no importance to these proposals. Kazimirov noted that this time around the concrete aim of his visit to Baku was to submit proposals for the establishment of a cease-fire as of 1 February; and Russia calls on the sides to endorse this initiative by remaining in their present positions. The Azerbaijani president replied to this proposal by advancing consistent and convincing evidence. [passage omitted] Vladimir Kazimirov mentioned another point in an effort to have Aliyev change his mind. Kazimirov argued that a new chairman of CSCE Minsk Group has been appointed and it would be good if he took up his duties tomorrow morning with a report that a cease-fire has been achieved in Nagorno-Karabakh. Geydar Aliyev's reply clarified this issue. [Aliyev statement in Russian omitted] After the conversation, the republic's president announced his concrete proposals. [passage omitted] Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, and State Adviser Vafa Gulizade were also present at the meeting. [end recording]
