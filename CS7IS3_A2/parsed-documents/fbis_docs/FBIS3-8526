The entire constitution of the federation of the Croats and the Muslims, as a community of originally sovereign peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been more or less completed. In this way a foundation stone has been laid for the restoration of peace in the Balkans. However, this will also depend on the behavior of Karadzic's Serbs, who are supposed to return a third of the conquered Bosnian territories. The Russian influence on the Serbian side will be crucial in all this. For the time being, though, there have been no encouraging signals from Belgrade yet, the Austrian media and political observers assess. The expert Croatian-Bosniak commission is supposed to continue preparations until 17 March--as requested by the Bosnian side because of Ramadan--on all the relevant documents for the final agreement. Charles Redman, special envoy of U.S. President Bill Clinton, arrived in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna this afternoon to take part in the continuation of the Croatian-Bosniak talks. [passage omitted]
