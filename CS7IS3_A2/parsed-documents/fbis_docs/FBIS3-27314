Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China, made these remarks when he met with Nong Duc Manh, chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam, here this afternoon. Nong and his party arrived in China February 21 as guests of NPC's Standing Committee. This is the first Vietnamese parliamentary delegation to visit China after the normalization of ties between the two countries. Qiao Shi appreciated the increasing exchange of visits by leaders of the two countries and the growing bilateral cooperation in political, economic and other spheres since the normalization of relations between the two countries, saying that that has laid a good foundation for the two countries to further their cooperation. Qiao told the Vietnamese guest that political and social stability and economic development have enabled China to stand the tests of the drastically changing international situation. The experience of Western countries in economic development is the creation of working peoples and is a common treasure of all mankind, Qiao said. "We should study these experiences and absorb those best suited to China's actual conditions." Nong expressed the hope that the visit would enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries and help to usher in a new phase of friendly cooperation between Vietnamese National Assembly and China's NPC. "We would like to know more about China's reform and opening and further bilateral economic cooperation," he said. With Vietnam now undergoing reforms, its National Assembly is faced with the heavy task of passing new laws, Nong said. China's NPC has accumulated a lot of experience in this regard, which is worth learning, he said. He suggested that the two parliaments should enhance their exchanges, especially the cooperation and exchanges between the two sides' special committees. NPC Vice-Chairman Wang Hanbin was present at today's meeting.
