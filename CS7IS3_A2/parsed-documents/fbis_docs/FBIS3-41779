As a member of the World Health Organization [WHO], he informed WHO headquarters of this fact in a telegram and asked for assistance. The focus is completely localized at the present time. Cholera is not yet in the Kolkhozabad rayon, and a team of 100 persons including experienced bacteriologists from Russia are working in the Pyandzh rayon. The minister announced that as far as physicians from remote foreign lands are concerned, their presence at the focus of the epidemic is not necessary and they will not be let in. As far as the cause of the two lethal outcomes is concerned, it is impossible to say precisely whether they were due to cholera or some other serious diseases from which those who died suffered. There are no grounds for panic, and rumors regarding the cause of the appearance of cases of cholera in Dushanbe are unfounded. However, the telegram from the minister to the WHO headquarters in Copenhagen was sent on the very day that his deputy Anatoliy Kopyltsov stated in IZVESTIYA that there is no cholera in Tajikistan. How is this to be understood? In response to this question, Akhmedov said that exciting panic in the republic on this score would serve no purpose. I myself can add one curious detail. Before giving even this incomplete information, the deputy minister demanded that we reach an agreement to pay him. As arguments he said the following. First, he had already been on his feet for 12 hours and is not obliged to waste his time talking to a journalist. Second, information is a commodity that is worth money. Third, he has already sold information to the BBC at a dollar a paragraph. All of this would have looked like an unfortunate joke had the discussion not taken much more time that the actual information itself.
