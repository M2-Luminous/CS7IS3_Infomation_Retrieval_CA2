FBIS3-51721 "drlat016__a94005" FBIS-LAT-94-016-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 ANNEX Argentina Government Denies More Flights to U.S. Airline PY1901012994 Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 16 Jan 94 Section 1, p 14--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1901012994 Buenos Aires LA NACION Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Economy Ministry sources disclosed that the government has not authorized the U.S. company American Airlines to increase the frequency of its flights to and from Argentina during the low season. This refusal follows a similar one issued in November against a similar petition filed by American Airlines and United Airlines and supported by U.S. Ambassador James Cheek. American Airlines was informed of the refusal while the economic team was holding meetings with Iberia officials to negotiate the possibility of increasing Argentine Airlines' capital. An Economy Ministry official explained that the official refusal of American Airlines' proposal was prompted by Argentine Airlines' commitment to cover all the demand, which, according to the U.S. company, exceeds 60 percent of the available seats. This gesture indicates that the government is issuing favorable signals to Argentine Airlines' operator. The economic negotiation did not manage to find a solution to Iberia's petition to increase Argentine Airlines' capital. An official source said: "If it is not demonstrated that the company is economically viable, it is useless to make any capital contributions."
