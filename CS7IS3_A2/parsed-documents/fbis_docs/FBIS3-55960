The news agency did not provide the date and venue of the meeting, but said an agreement on friendship and cooperation between neighbouring Georgia and Chechnya is expected to be signed. According to Yusef, the meeting was agreed during a recent visit of the Chechen government delegation to Tbilisi. The announcement came shortly after it became known that ex-President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia, an irreconcilable opponent of Shevardnadze, is dead. Chechnya was the shelter for Gamsakhurdia for two years of his exile from where he commanded the anti-Shevardnadze struggle in western Georgia. The late Gamsakhurdia who reportedly committed a suicide will most evidently be buried in Chechnya, according to the will of his widow.
