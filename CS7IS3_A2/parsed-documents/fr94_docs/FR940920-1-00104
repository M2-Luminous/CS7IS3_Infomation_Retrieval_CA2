See combined limit. f Or 85-percent reduction. g The proposed emission guidelines do not include a combined limit for Hg and Cd; however, based on the individual limits, a combined limit is shown for comparison. h Based on periodic determination. i Cr, Cu, and Mn are abbreviations for chromium, copper, and manganese, respectively. j No combined limit specified. See individual Pb limit. k Measured by an annual stack test. l Or 50-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent. m Or 95-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent. n Based on a 7-day rolling average, measured continuously. o Based on a 24-hour average, measured continuously. p Or 75-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent. q No limit specified. r For mass burn/waterwall combustors.
