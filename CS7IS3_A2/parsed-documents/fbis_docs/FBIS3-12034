In the opinion of Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes, Gaviria will have to turn the OAS into a more pragmatic organization that spends less time making statements; an organization that will be able, for example, to attack extreme poverty and to make international solidarity a reality. According to the experts, it will fall to Gaviria not only to devote himself to consolidating democracy on the continent but, especially, to leading American integration. The analysts point out that it is in connection with Cuba, however, that Gaviria could contribute something new to the OAS. They remember that Colombia is one of the American countries that has maintained the best relations with Cuba in recent years, even with formerally ruptured diplomatic ties, and it has gone so far as to negotiate the sale of oil to the island in defiance of the U.S. embargo. According to observers, for these reasons, from his new position in the OAS and with his excellent contacts with the United States, Gaviria is in an excellent position to build bridges toward the Cuban Government and perhaps achieve Cuba's reincorporation into the Pan-American system.
