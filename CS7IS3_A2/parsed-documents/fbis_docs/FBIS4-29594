Howe, who doubles as housing and regional development minister, made the remark in a meeting with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, a Foreign Ministry official said. Howe reportedly said Australia gives high marks to Japan's painful but courageous decision last year to partially open its tightly controlled rice market to foreign competition as part of its efforts to conclude the global trade negotiations. The Australian minister also voiced hope Japan will participate in an international conference planned for November in Melbourne, the official said. The "international conference on cities and new global economies" will be co-hosted by the Australian Government and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Hata briefed Howe on the major tasks his administration is currently tackling, the official said. Howe asked Hata to convey views of the Asia-Pacific region when he attends this year's summit meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized economies in Naples in July. As he was leaving the premier's official residence, Howe described the meeting with Hata as "very good." Howe arrived in Japan on Friday for a weeklong stay to hold talks with Japanese Government officials on regional development and ask for Japan's participation in the conference. He met with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on Monday morning.
