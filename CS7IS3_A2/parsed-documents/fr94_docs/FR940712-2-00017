FR940712-2-00017 FR940712-2-00012 [Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;000 and &hyph;001; CP93&hyph;673&hyph;000 and &hyph;001] Northwest Pipeline Corp.; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Northwest Expansion II Projects July 6, 1994. On November 10, 1993 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) issued a Notice of Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Northwest Expansion II Projects in the above dockets and related projects proposed by Paiute Pipeline Company (Paiute) in Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;751&hyph;000 and CP94&hyph;29&hyph;000 (Paiute Expansion II Projects). The purpose of the notice was to request comments on environmental issues. On June 14 and June 15, 1994 Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) filed amendments to its two original applications that represent a change in the scope of the Northwest Expansion II Projects. Based on the changes in the amended filings, we have determined that an environmental assessment (EA), rather than an EIS is the more appropriate document for analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with Northwest's projects. The cooperating Federal agencies agree with this strategy. From the standpoint of the environmental analysis the important changes are: •The deletion of 8 pipeline loops from the projects, which reduces the total miles of pipeline construction from 177.2 miles to 54.9 miles; •The deletion of 11 compressor station modifications, which reduces the required compression from 88,235 horsepower (hp) to 14,820 hp; •The addition of 5.8 miles of 20-inch-diameter loop in Marion County, Oregon (the Salem Loop) and 1,070 hp at the existing Pegram Compressor Station in Bear Lake County, Idaho that were not part of the original proposals; •The deletion of 26 of the 37 originally proposed meter station modifications; •The change in pipeline routing of both the Gresham Loop and Weyerhaeuser Lateral; and •The termination of service agreements by all shippers that had proposed to have Northwest deliver gas to Paiute for ultimate delivery to customers in Nevada. The list of facilities proposed in the amended filings are in appendix 1 and maps showing the location of the Salem Loop, the Pegram Compressor Station, and the amended routing for the Gresham Loop and Weyerhaeuser Lateral are attached as appendix 2. 1 1 The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the Federal Register . Copies are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 or call (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the appendices were sent to all those receiving this notice in the mail. For the purposes of the environmental analysis Northwest's two applications will be considered together because the construction of the Gresham Loop is common to both applications. 2 The facilities proposed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;001 include the increase in compression at the Washougal Compressor Station; the construction of the Gresham Loop, 1.3 miles of the Salem Loop (milepost 64.1 to 65.3), and the Johnson Creek Meter Station; and the upgrading of six existing meter stations. The remaining facilities are part of Docket No. CP93&hyph;673&hyph;000. 2 The length and location of the Gresham Loop is the same in both applications; however, in Docket No. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;001 Northwest proposes using 20-inch-diameter pipeline, while Docket No. CP93&hyph;673&hyph;00 proposes using 30-inch-diameter pipeline. The termination of all contracts that called for Northwest to deliver gas to Paiute effectively severs the connection between Northwest's and Paiute's proposals; therefore, only Northwest's proposed facilities will be included in the EA. The EA Process The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. Our EA will give the Commission the information it needs to do that. If the EA concludes that the projects would result in significant environmental impacts, we will prepare an environmental impact statement. Otherwise we will prepare a Finding of No Significant Impact. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues, and to separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Local scoping meetings have already been held for the original projects. Additional scoping meetings are not planned. We are asking for comments only on those portions of the projects where the routing has been changed or the facilities were not part of the original proposal. The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed projects under these general subject headings: •Geology and paleontology •Endangered and threatened species •Visual resources •Water resources •Vegetation •Land use •Air quality and noise •Wetland and riparian habitat •Cultural resources •Fish and wildlife •Socioeconomics •Soils We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the projects, or portions of the projects, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of the EA which will be mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings. Public Participation You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the projects. You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the new portions of the proposal. You do not need to re-submit comments if you have already done so. We are particularly interested in alternatives to the proposals (including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: •Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., Washington, DC 20426. •Reference Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;001 and/or CP93&hyph;673&hyph;001; •Send a copy of your letter to: Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., Room 7312, Washington, DC 20426; and •Mail your comments so they will be received in Washington, DC, on or before August 11, 1994. Becoming an Intervenor In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceedings or an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) which is attached as appendix 3. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered. Environmental Mailing List If you don't want to send comments at this time but still want to receive a copy of the EA, please return the Information Request (see appendix 4). If you have previously returned the Information Request you don't need to do so again. Additional information about the proposed projects is available from Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, EA Project Manager, at (202) 208&hyph;0325. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
