He said the ministry's security plan stresses a decisive confrontation with terrorism to safeguard stability and the citizens' security while at the same time raising the standard of services to the public and remedying negative conditions in the country's prisons. [passage omitted] The interior minister said that the current confrontation is based on the security forces always taking the initiative in striking effective and repeated blows against dangerous groups while ensuring that all legal standards are observed. He explained that there is no alternative to a firm and comprehensive confrontation with terrorists because any other course would mean compromising the homeland's future and destiny. He pointed out that the initiative shown by the security forces has put a decisive end to the exploitation of the mosques in Asyut for the propagation of extremist ideas and helped to uncover the plan to assassinate the prime minister and to apprehend the terrorist group in Shubra al-Khaymah that had been instructed to carry out a series of assassinations and other terrorist acts. [passage omitted] The interior minister revealed the existence of bilateral agreements to extradite terrorists, noting that several of them have been extradited from abroad and several others will be extradited shortly. He said this is being done with the help of other government departments. Concerning the disappearance of former Libyan foreign minister Mansur al-Kikhya, the interior minister said: We have not uncovered the facts of the case yet. We cannot say anything if we are not sure of it. He said he is totally opposed to indiscriminate arrests and that only the actual culprit must be punished. Adding that he will not hesitate to question and punish anyone who makes a mistake, he said daily inspections must be made in all governorates and central police stations to maintain proper performance standards and ensure that members of the public brought to police stations are well treated.
