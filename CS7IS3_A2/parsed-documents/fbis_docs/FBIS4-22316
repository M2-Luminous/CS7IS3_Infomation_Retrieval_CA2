He stated that the majority of the population supports his initiative concerning the repealing of the Republic's currently effective Constitution. Kirsan Ilyumzhinov also reported that the Republic's new Basic Law is in the process of preparation: this is the Great Steppe Code, the enactment of which means the practical liquidation of the Republic's sovereignty. The historic document that has been taken as the basis has been adapted to the realities of modern life and contains the following principles: the inseparable link with the nation of Russia (the impossibility of the Republic's secession from the Federation); RF [Russian Federation] citizenship; etc. The question of the president's status is in the process of being resolved. One possibility is that he will be confirmed by the RF president, that is, on the basis of his status he will be equated to an administration head. President Ilyumzhinov, who was immediately christened by the Western SMI [mass media] as the "unifier of Russia," gave an interview to a SEGODNYA correspondent. He reported that his appeal at an expanded session of the peoples of Kalmykia, at which he announced the repeal of the Republic Constitution, had "caused indignation on the part of the opposition." "Kalmyks suddenly felt that they were Kalmyks. Base nationalistic feelings sprang up. But the nation supports my decision, and the incompletely beaten opposition has crawled out: basically former Communists who are striving to gain power. It is they who are attempting to unsettle the situation. They have declared that I am a traitor, and have created a committee to save the Constitution," Mr. Ilyumzhinov said, stating that he is firmly resolved to "stop the theater of the absurd." "I have ordered that the mass media publish everything, and later on we shall analyze it. Once again I want to demonstrate that, for me, power is not for the sake of power, but for the sake of the nation's well-being. Because I am the only president who does not receive any salary for occupying the position. I give my salary to a children's home. I wanted to demonstrate the same thing when I was in the White House on 3 and 4 October," the president stated. According to Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, Moscow is "still looking at" his unexpected decision, which, he admits, not even his closest aides knew about. As for the other autonomous republics, so far as the president of Kalmykia knows, they are unanimous in censuring the step he took. "I feel that in Russia there must be one president and one Constitution," he emphasized, remarking at the same time that "I shall not leave until economic stability arrives in Kalmykia. And, for the time being, everything is proceeding according to my scenario."
