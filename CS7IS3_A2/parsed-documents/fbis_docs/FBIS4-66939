Result: 10 tonnes of hashish seized, worth 1 billion Belgian francs. It was a veritable armada that pursued the smugglers: 165 gendarmes and 200 troops. For several months, the Brugge gendarmerie had known that a Belgian criminal organization was transporting drugs by sea. They learned recently that there was hashish on board the Berceuse, a Belgian ship coming from Morocco. They also learned that the drugs would be transshipped at sea onto the Orca, a small fishing vessel from Zeebrugge. On the night of 23 April, the two ships were intercepted at sea as the transshipment was taking place. The crew was caught red-handed, and the cargo and vessels were seized.

(Warsaw PAP in English 1848 GMT 26 Apr 94) Customs officers at Gatwick Airport have been sickened by a sleazy new tactic adopted by cocaine smugglers. A kilo of the drug -- worth 72,000 British pounds -- was discovered hidden in excrement, packed among foodstuffs, apparently brought into Britain by a Nigerian woman. The find was made after a flight from Nigeria landed. David Chesters, assistant collector for Her Majesty's Customs, said: "There was an appalling smell and the Customs Hall had to be fumigated. This is the first time I have come across such a tactic. Clearly, they were trying to fool the sniffer dogs." Officers at the airport said: "The stench was appalling. We're used to people swallowing condoms full of cocaine and waiting for them to pass it through, but this was disgusting." (London PRESS ASSOCIATION 0350 GMT 28 Apr 94)
