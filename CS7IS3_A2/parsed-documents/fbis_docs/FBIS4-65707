At the meeting, Mr. Farzat Kucani, chairman of the Council for External Economic Relations, set forth the Turkish businessmen's views of the state of trade and economic contacts between Bulgaria and Turkey, as well as of the opportunities for their expansion. Bilateral trade, which has been around 300 million U.S. dollars in the last few years, is seen as too low for the considerably larger potential of the two neighbouring countries, the sides agreed. Mr. Kucani discussed the prospects for cooperation which requires assistance and decisions of the government authorities. He said that Turkish companies are ready to share in the modernization of the Port of Burgas (on the Black Sea), of tourist facilities in the area of Burgas, and in the construction and implementation of other projects in Bulgaria. For his part, Mr. Daskalov pointed out that common understanding had been reached at the talks in Ankara to draft agreements on the avoidance of double taxation and on reciprocal investment protection and promotion. These agreements are expected to be signed during the visit of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev to Turkey. Mr. Daskalov visited Turkey to arrange the forthcoming visit of President Zhelev to Ankara and a visit to Bulgaria by Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. During his stay, the chief Bulgarian diplomat met with his Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin and with the President of Turkish Grand National Assembly Husamettin Cindoruk. Yesterday Mr. Daskalov was received by the president of Turkey Suleyman Demirel. The two countries' foreign ministers yesterday signed a protocol on expansion of bilateral cooperation. Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaykov said at a news briefing today that this is an important document as it specifies areas of future cooperation between Bulgaria and Turkey. From Istanbul, Mr. Daskalov is scheduled to leave on a working visit to London.
