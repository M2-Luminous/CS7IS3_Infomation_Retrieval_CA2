Citizens, men and women. Following the conclusion of the presidential and legislative elections campaign, polling begins on 20 March, the anniversary of Independence Day. In the context of my own following up of the electoral campaign and preparations for polling day, I noticed two things: First, some political parties have designated only a few monitors in polling stations despite the fact that we extended the official deadline by 24 hours for them. What is regrettable is that they have not remedied the situation. As for the second matter, for which municipalities and sub-municipalities are responsible, it concerns the distribution of voting cards. I gave firm instructions that citizens be informed of the need to register their names in the electoral lists, and to enable them to ascertain this registration in the reviewing period so as to avoid any mistake, overlooking or omission. I also ordered that they be given enough time beyond the registration deadline to register and remedy the situation. Furthermore, I instructed the relevant authorities on the municipal and sub-municipal level to be careful to prepare the voter registration cards properly, so as to avoid all types of mistakes with names and addresses, and to make sure that it is sent or handed to them within the deadline, before voting starts. It has come to my attention that some voters have not received their cards either because their names are not on the lists -- in spite of their assurance that they had registered their names previously -- or because of a mistake with the names and addresses, or merely because of a failure in distribution. Cases like this contradict our desire to enable everyone who has the right to take part in the elections to carry out that right, which is guaranteed in the constitution and the law. It also does not give a positive image of the work of the municipalities -- which I have always reaffirmed are the first school for democracy, and for the development of the civic spirit, and for the kindling of the sense of citizenship in the nation -- in addition to it hurting the image of the administration in the mind of the citizen. I place full responsibility for any failure, if this is proved to be the case, on the municipal leaders and their general secretaries. To avoid such a situation, I have given instructions to the Interior Ministry to take note of this matter in the time remaining before the beginning of voting by taking the necessary measures to enable all voters to receive their cards. Fellow citizens, to vote is not a mere formality nor is it an obligation, but it is a patriotic duty and a civil right represented by the casting your vote in favor of whoever you see as eligible to represent you at the House of Deputies. It is also a right and a duty to underline the involvement in and positive response to the national cultural project -- a large part of which we have accomplished -- and a great deal is expected from it due to the legitimate aspirations and the challenges which we should overcome with God's help. The joined daily effort to which we adhered as a principle and a value, begins from the voting process itself. To let our people practice this responsibility, having reached a high degree of maturity, rationality, and eligibility for an organized and developed political life, the administrative bodies should facilitate the performance of this duty and the practice of this right to everyone by providing them with the legal means namely the electoral card. It is, at the same time, the main precondition for the involvement of everyone with renewable impetus, sincere resolve, and a high spirit of responsibility in the new take-off with which we are preparing our country to occupy the highest status in continuation of what we started on 7 November [1987]. Peace and God's mercy and blessings be upon you.
