FR940503-0-00065 FR940503-0-00020 Classification This final rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. The AA finds there is good cause to waive prior notice under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Prior notice is impracticable and contrary to the public interest because it would cause undue burdens on some members of the groundfish fishing industry and would further delay full implementation of conservation measures intended to replenish groundfish stocks. Further, the AA finds that the public meetings held by the Council to discuss designation of beginning and ending dates for the fishing year for this fishery provided opportunity for public comment to be considered. The AA finds that under section 553(d) of the APA the need to have this regulation in place by May 1, 1994, is good cause to waive the 30-day delay in effectiveness of this regulation.
