The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Luanda government are already discussing the dossier on national reconciliation. UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Valentim, who is the UNITA negotiating team's spokesman, said yesterday that they are optimistic and will score positive results. Agreement has already been reached on 12 of the 18 points under discussion, and the two sides do not differ very much on the remaining six points. Dr. Valentim said the present moment is crucial and he favored a power-sharing pattern similar to the one in South Africa recently adopted by President Nelson Mandela. Sources close to the talks say the two sides will today discuss the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel's role in the national reconciliation context, the role of UNITA deputies in the Assembly of the Republic, the return of UNITA's property, and the reinstatement of the state administration, besides other collateral issues.
