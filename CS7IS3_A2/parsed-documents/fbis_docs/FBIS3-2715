Sun made the statement while briefing reporters on the March 21- 25 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks between Taiwan and South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Hungary, Chile and South Korea in Geneva. Sun noted that the countries had long expressed their concern about Taiwan's prohibitions on agricultural imports from their countries. As a result, the COA has agreed to remove the prohibitions within six years to facilitate its entrance into the world trade body. Currently, Taiwan allows the import of bananas, pineapples, guavas, mangoes, oranges, mandarin oranges, lemons, grapefruit, grapes, lichee, papaya, plums and longan from the US as well as peach and persimmon imports from Europe and the US. Taiwan also allows imports of apples from the US and Canada, but prohibits apple imports from Japan and limits apple imports from other countries. The restriction has triggered protests from New Zealand and Australia.
