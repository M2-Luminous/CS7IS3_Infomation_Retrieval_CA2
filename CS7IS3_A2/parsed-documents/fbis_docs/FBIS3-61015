Rusanov, chief of the Aviation Flight Safety Service [SBP] of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, under the rubric "Flight Safety: Experience, Analysis, Problems": "Thousands of Dangerous Situations..."] [Text] ...those being the thousands of dangerous situations that arise owing to omissions and oversights by many officials that are compensated for every year by military pilots, risking their health and sometimes their lives. The conditions for maintaining the level of flight safety that had been attained (not to mention further improvements in it) have changed for the worse in recent years. The extent of the hazardousness of factors affecting the failure-free operation of all components of the "pilot--aircraft--environment" system has increased first and foremost, and flying time has decreased in general and for each pilot or crew in particular. The lack of the necessary quantity of fuels and lubricants and training ordnance, along with the difficulties of infrastructure and amenities for the personnel of aviation and supporting units caused by the cutbacks and relocations of the troops, is having an acute impact. All of this is having a negative impact on morale and the psychological state of the fliers, and is reducing the motivation to continue both flight work and military service as a result. It is nonetheless namely in this difficult climate that it is essential not only to pursue, but even to intensify the work to prevent flight accidents, since each of them causes great harm to our aviation and the army as a whole. It would obviously not be sensible, given the realities of the current moment--where instances of failure to observe the requirements not only of official documents, but even fundamental ones (decrees, edicts, resolutions), are becoming far from isolated--to be limited just to the customary directive and disciplinary methods for ensuring flight safety. Yes, the aviation documents are strict. One difficulty of the current period is the fact that most of the basic manuals and guides regulating flight work, whose unconditional fulfillment by every aviation specialist--first and foremost the pilot himself--is required, unfortunately assume his complete provision with everything that could have an impact on flight safety. That is far from always possible everywhere or for everyone today, however. And closing our eyes to these gaps between, figuratively speaking, yesterday's and today's flight organization is not the best method of action for aviation commanders of all ranks or for the officials of the SBP. Under these conditions, it would be expedient, while preserving the established principle of ensuring flight safety "from the top down" (High Command--larger formations and units--air unit--pilot), also to take into account the degree of motivation to prevent accidents "the other way"--"from the bottom up" (that is, to start right with the pilot). The pilot was considered to be the object of exhortation, monitoring and, of course, sanctions under the command-administrative system for his failure to observe a host of flight-safety requirements from officials at all levels when preventive measures were organized to avoid accidents. It came to pass that he, while personally risking, at a minimum, his flight and service career and, frequently, the state of his health and sometimes even his life in a flight accident, seemingly had considerably less of a vested interest in the safety of his flights than a host of superior officers! When preventive work is optimized relying on the predominant role of the personality of the pilot, for whom all the higher structures should be working, we obtain a powerful supplement in the form of the organizational energy of thousands of pilots (or members of flight crews) to the efforts of dozens of SBP specialists. It is no secret that it is namely the pilots who in practice prevent thousands of dangerous situations arising from the omissions and oversights of officials in various fields every year. But there are reserves here as well, since almost every one of the crashes and accidents that occurs over the course of a year could have been prevented or, at least, had a less grave outcome with timely and correct actions (after the dangerous situation arose) by the crew. The unsatisfactory level of training of the flight personnel in practical prevention of the accidents that are most typical of their branch of aviation and type of airframe, however, leads to the systematic repetition of one and the same accident and crash situations arising out of objective or subjective unfavorable factors that are exhaustively studied by the SBP specialists, but prove each time to be new and unexpected for the next crew to get into the difficult situation. That is just what happened when an Mi-8 helicopter hit a mountain slope hidden by cloud cover and crashed while transporting refugees from the Transcaucasus in July of last year. The air-traffic control bodies had not satisfactorily analyzed the conditions for flying over this mountain pass, while the crew, going up into mountains with cloud cover, was not able to assess the danger of that factor under the concrete conditions of the flight. Three crew members and ten passengers were killed as a result. Another crash, even more grave in its consequences, occurred a month later in the same area when the same mission was being carried out. The crew of an An-12 cut short their takeoff run virtually without separating. The aircraft rolled over the end of the runway, hit some obstacles, was smashed and burned. Thirty-six people died. Doubts of the successful outcome of the flight had arisen among the pilots owing to the high air temperature, the maximum loading of the aircraft and the specific features of the shape of the runway. All of these dangerous factors had not been taken into account by either the crew or the airfield dispatcher. Could the crews have averted just these outcomes in these specific situations? Investigation indisputably demonstrated that such a possibility was virtually guaranteed--the crews were entirely able to avoid creating a situation fatal for each of them and then, when it had arisen all the same, could have countered its unfavorable development and ended the flight safely even though it had begun to be aggravated. It is namely in these two directions--not creating dangerous situations, and if they arise anyway, preventing their aggravation and reducing the gravity of the outcome by the most effective means--that should guide the training of flight personnel. The seeming simplicity of such a concept for practical preventive work, however, requires sound analytical and methodological work in each branch of military aviation to select and quantify the typical (repeating) special situations, to practice techniques for averting them, and then to localize each of them and ultimately devise and maintain the skills for the whole range of techniques developed. It can be accomplished most effectively at the centers for the combat application of aviation, in close interaction with the specialists of the Combat Training Directorate and the Flight Safety Service. In the realization of the proposed model for preventive work, each pilot or crew will be able to select, regardless of directives from above, the most expedient positions from among the set of techniques for repetition namely those elements of the flight mission, in the fulfillment of which he senses the predominant danger, and to practice them in class, on a simulator or on a computer when preparing for a specific flight. The activity to ensure flight safety by the higher commands and inspectorates will undoubtedly require optimization under contemporary conditions. Each of them should strive to create for their subordinate levels (or interacting levels) the most favorable working conditions to maintain the required level of flight safety in a contemporary setting. This is already being realized through the cutbacks in the previously widespread host of inspectorates and checks, performance ratings and other measures of an administrative type, and the redistribution of efforts in the direction of performing methodological measures and assisting in each area. The basic principle of the structures controlling the activity of the air regiment should be to provide its command personnel with the most favorable climate for planning, organizing and conducting flights. The urgent task of all the services participating in flight training should be considered to be the elimination of dangerous factors under their control that a the cause of the appearance and aggravation of dangerous situations. Thus, for example, the investigation of the most severe flight accident of last year--the crash of a transport aircraft landing with passengers on board at night in minimal weather conditions at a back-up airfield that had not been assimilated before--first placed the focus on crew error in the performance of the pre-landing maneuver. Detailed study of the circumstances of this tragedy, however, showed that the actions of the crew only crowned a situation that had been conditioned by violations, omissions and blunders by a whole series of officials who had given the assignment and prepared the crew, made the decisions for takeoff and rerouting, were responsible for the lighting and electronic equipment of the airfield, analyzed the weather etc. If any one of these had made the correct decision and carried it out, the crash situation may not have arisen. As for scientific developments in flight safety, it would be expedient to concentrate efforts today on the "applied" questions--maintaining the level of proficiency of pilots under conditions of irregular flights, and substantiating measures to avert the most serious flight accidents. It is essential to emphasize in conclusion the importance of uniting the efforts of specialists from all agencies in the performance of everyday work to prevent accidents in aviation under contemporary conditions. The expensive experience that has been acquired in the investigation of flight accidents should be utilized with the maximum possible promptness and completeness in the aviation of the armed forces of the Russian Federation. A closed-doors mentality is impermissible here, since it only reinforces the method of trial and error (such as the fact, for example, that analogous accidents happened after the crash of the An-12 on civil aircraft in Vladivostok and Tbilisi). This pertains entirely to the intelligent utilization of foreign experience in flight safety. COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
