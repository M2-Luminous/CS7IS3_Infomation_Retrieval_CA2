The current contamination and salinity of Lake Poopo's waters is threatening extinction for the region's flora and fauna. This has evoked concern among the indigenous settlers, who are suffering from a lack of food for their subsistence. The CORDEOR president, Marcelo Arzabe Vasquez, explained to PRESENCIA that the rehabilitation of Lake Poopo and other nearby lakes is an imminent event. It is based on the plan being carried out with the Joint Bolivian-Peruvian Commission for the Development of the Lake Titicaca Integrated Zone (Subcomilagos), which includes the rehabilitation of the upper and lower basins of the Desaguadero River. He remarked: "This plan has been handled with special dedication, because we are aware that we must guarantee the natural habitat for the lives of the indigenous tribes and nations, particularly the Uru Muratos who make their living from fishing and hunting on Lake Poopo. Their subsistence fishing is nonexistent, and this is a major concern of our administration." Lack of Attention Daniel Moricio Choque, leader of the Uru Muratos, for his part, explained that they know that Lake Poopo's waters are contaminated, and yet this situation does not concern any authorities. He claimed this to be so despite the fact that the atherine [a mackerel species] fishing catch in 1992 did not exceed 500 kg, compared to 1990's total of 3,000 tons, and accounting for 50 percent of the national production. During 1991, the atherine production amounted to 2,600 tons. In 1992, 90 percent of the fishing fauna disappeared, and in 1993 there is nothing to fish for, as the indigenous leader explained. He said that this proved to be a difficult situation of those living in the Murato settlements. The indigenous residents feed themselves with wild ducks from the area but, owing to the water's salinity, they too are becoming extinct. This prompts the prediction that there will soon be total famine. Currently engaged in raising Aymara sheep, the Uru Muratos are hoping to obtain a small territory in which to devote themselves to farming. The situation being experienced in the settlements of Punaca, Tinta Maria, Llapallapani, and Willaneque is tragic, because the inactivity caused by the reduction in Lake Poopo's water level and the lack of fish is causing massive migration. This has left the communities as ghost towns, and the schools that existed have been closed. They are waiting for attention from the national authorities to alleviate this situation, which is now added to the poverty and misery of those who have sustained the fishing activity for centuries. Rehabilitation To achieve the rehabilitation of Lake Poopo, consideration was given to a study made in 1985, warning of the lake's contamination with heavy metals. The study, conducted by Great Britain's Overseas Development Administration (ODA), announced the results of the chemical and spectrophotometric analyses of samples of water, plants, sediments, and fish from the Poopo Basin. The analyses have made it possible to establish the fact that this lake was highly saline (in 1985), particularly in the south, where the salinity exceeded 70 percent. These figures are higher than those recorded at Lake Moon, California, one of the best documented saline lakes. The evidence from all the water, plant, silt, and fish samples indicates that there are extraordinarily high concentrations of all metals in the Poopo Basin. According to the study, the concentration of dissolved metals in the lake comes from the largest deposits in central Bolivia, such as the Poopo, Monserrat, Avicaya, and Huanuni mines, located no farther than 20 km from the lake. The strongest evidence of contamination comes from the San Juan Sora Sora River, containing high concentrations of a wide range of metals. It is known that the levels of many metals are toxic for fish, and levels exceeding those permitted have been recorded.
