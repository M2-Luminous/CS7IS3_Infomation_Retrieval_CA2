Alarm over the clause, which would link trade and labour standards, reflects deep suspicions by nearly all developing countries that the West is seeking to levy additional duties on the exports of countries which enjoy cheap labour advantages when the new World Trading Organization (WTO) takes over from Gatt to police global commerce. Many Asean officials fear that such a link would turn out to be a disguised form of protection against imports from economies with lower labour costs. Asia-Pacific nations, whose economic growth has been powered by their low-cost exports, are particularly concerned and have vowed to fight the link. At last week's 50th annual session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap), executive secretary general Rafiuddin Ahmad led a chorus of denunciations about attempts by "countries which might impose neo-protectionism." In a national speech on March 21, Indonesia's President Suharto criticized unspecified world powers which sought to impose their own views of human and labour rights as a condition for economic cooperation. He said that industrial nations were pushing developing countries on such issues as raising the minimum wage because of their troubled economies and declining competitiveness. "No country has the right to dictate their own concepts or views to another country... Let alone to force their will as a condition for international economic cooperation," he said. Speaking at last week's Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) conference, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak acknowledged that the US efforts to include a social clause in a global trade treaty were not new and go back to 1987. But he cautioned that "The proposal could lead to market impediments for goods from less-developed countries." At the same forum Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed charged that the West was trying to weaken developing nations by imposing minimum wages. Manila also declared it would resist attempts by the United States to insert a social clause in any trade agreement, particularly on issues affecting workers' rights. Antonio Buencamino, director of the Philippine Bureau of International Trade Relations, said "the Philippines opposes any attempt to include social clauses or workers rights in trade talks." "Our labour is cheap, but that does not mean it is exploited," Buencamino said, noting that workers in the export industry often earned much more than the mandated minimum wage. Despite the uproar in Asia, chief US trade negotiator John Schmidt, declared before leaving for Morocco that Washington would not accept the Marrakech declaration or documents related to the WTO preparatory committee "without some language" on labour rights. In a bid to quell the row before it erupts into a damaging North-South split, Gatt chief Peter Sutherland called a meeting of trade envoys yesterday to seek a compromise. Observers said much would depend on how hard the United States presses the issue. The United States wants a ministerial declaration in Marrakech to accept that the WTO would deal with the link between trade and labour. Developing countries have refused to consider any reference to the issue in the declaration. Washington, is expected to get its strongest backing from France which has been pressing the European Union to enact regulations against "social dumping" -- selling goods produced with cheap labour under poor working conditions. US and French officials argue that the WTO, which will be a more powerful watchdog than Gatt, should enforce a connection between trade and labour conditions. France wants the body to apply standards that will prevent countries from exploiting children, prisoners and bonded workers as a way of gaining trade advantages. Gatt officials are further worried that the introduction of the controversial social dimension would divert attention from work that needs to be done to ensure that measures to liberalize world trade contained in the Uruguay accords are sealed and actually applied. Washington, however, argues that it accepts the existence of a "natural comparative advantage", including wage rate differentials, linked to a country's degree of development. The United States submitted at the beginning of the Uruguay Round in 1987 a paper listing a set of five internationally recognized standards it saw as trade-related. The five points were freedom of association for workers, freedom to organize and bargain collectively, freedom from forced or compulsory labour, a minimum age for employment of children, and "minimum standard" for working conditions, including occupational health and safety hazards. Many members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including Switzerland and the Nordic countries, concede that these problems will, sooner or later, have to be faced. But most feel it would be more timely to raise such issues when the WTO preparatory committee gets down to work. Any member would then be free to take up any topic. Officials said the European Union was proposing a wording stressing that the committee was free to tackle "new issues", without any specific reference to labour rights. More than 120 countries are to gather in Marrakech for the signing of the new pact, which will encompass for the first time services, intellectual property, agriculture and textiles. The scale of the agreement, which once fully operative, will bring an estimated additional worldwide growth of between $230 billion and $270 billion over a decade, helped build a momentum that brought together Gatt members after seven years of marathon negotiations. This same pressure makes most observers confident an agreement will be signed. Gatt officials, quoted in Marrakech, said that while they were worried that the row triggered by the United States might "spoil the atmosphere" of the meeting, they were confident it would not sink the Uruguay Round.
