Recently new elements have been added to the conflict, which actually dates back to earlier times: On Friday [14 January], during a program on the local cable television Asket, General Lebed stated that the leaflets that had been distributed on the previous night announcing that a coup was being prepared had been printed at the suggestion of Vladimir Shevtsov, the security minister of the separatist government. Lebed also accused Shevtsov of cabling a communique to Moscow warning about the alleged coup, which was to have taken place on 15 January. In addition, on the same day on which Lebed replied to those allegations [on Asket television], the Dniester authorities issued a press communique and organized a news conference on the same issue. Further events took place on Tuesday, 18 January, when the Moscow daily IZVESTIYA published a statement by Lebed, who, among other things, asserted: "Currently they are openly looting in the Dniester Republic, and that is why no progress is being achieved in the peace talks [with Moldova]" and that the solution, in his opinion, consists of "the banishment of all those loathsome figures (the current Dniester leaders -- editor's note), the organization of new elections, and the ascent to power of credible personalities..." That is why the general called upon the population living on the left bank of the Dniester to disobey the authorities. Recently the commander of the 14th Army held a meeting with school headmasters and the chairmen of the trade unions in the educational sector. Speaking in front of the plenum of that meeting, Lebed acknowledged the children's right to study in their mother tongue from textbooks printed in the Latin alphabet. That upset Professor Vasiliy Yakovlev, the leader of a civic group, so much that he called Lebed "a spy for the Republic of Moldova" and a "coauthor of the Romanization of education in the Dniester republic." Also on Tuesday [18 January] the 14th Army Command issued a declaration warning the Tiraspol authorities that "decisive retaliatory measures will be taken, including the use of arms, if slander and attacks are issued against the personnel and the military assets of the Army of the Russian Federation." It seems that Moscow, in the person of General Lebed, is fed up with the unaccomplished vanity of the self-styled republic's leaders, and it also intends to react firmly. Obviously, all such reaction will be in pursuit of Moscow's goals. Anyway, a dual power structure has been instated in Tiraspol, and both parties possess sufficiently large and well equipped military and paramilitary forces.
