The cause of it all is the contrast between imposed and personal concepts. The specter of a "second Afghan" now loomed up in the framework of alarmed reports from the border, now disappeared in the presence of calm, impoverished Dushanbe. A flare-up of activity in the spring is as natural as the changing of the seasons, Colonel Ivan Malevich, chief of the information service at the headquarters of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces (KMS), told me. It has always been that way. They have come out of Afghanistan and continue to come not in order to sit around in trenches. One does not have to be clairvoyant to anticipate an invasion as soon as the passes are opened and the roads dry up. Only one's imagination can predict what will follow.... "I Do Not Capture Transgressors; I Kill Them." Colonel Nikolay Malofeyev, chief of the Panj border detachment, was more to the point in answering this question. Expressing dismay at the unexpected arrival of the journalist, he said that he was not giving interviews, that this was forbidden and he did not want to give any. He was more concerned by the shortage of personnel and the refusal of new recruits to go from Russia to Tajikistan in a situation in which the Tajiks themselves are not burning up with a desire to serve. Replenishments come through the requisitions of local military commissariats, who frequently place young citizens of independent Tajikistan onto busses by force and haul them from the hamlets and villages to the detachment of Russian border troops, turning them over, as they are, without equipment or medical examination. There the young recruits, who sometimes do not know Russian, take on the appearance of a soldier in a situation approaching frontline conditions and acquire the military science of defending their fatherland. From the legal standpoint it is difficult to say who they are -- mercenaries, since they are serving in a foreign army but on their own territory, or trainees under Russian instructors. They say that there is a gentlemen's agreement on this matter but not formalized in a contract. At the outposts they receive the same pay and provisions as Russian border troops, which is equal to ten times the minimum wage of the Tajiks. The material incentives have little effect upon morale, however. Deserters are apprehended and returned to the bank of the Panj in the same way. Not all of them, to be sure. Some of them are still being sought. According to KMS intelligence, the Tajiks have trouble mastering the skills and are not distinguished by special valor in the conduct of combat operations. They account for more than half of the personnel at some outposts, and the Russian officers can foresee the day when they will be commanding Tajiks exclusively. The Panj sector is considered to be under the greatest pressure. It experiences mortar shellings and penetration attempts practically every day. Tajik militants and Mojahedin are concentrated at the juncture of the third and fourth outposts in the Afghan community of Bagrikul. They have tanks and artillery. If they wanted to, I was told at headquarters, they could wipe out any fortification within a half-hour. They could not get along without the support of the 201st Division, even though the border troops have acquired Grad rocket launchers, tanks and armored personnel carriers in recent months. The main thing is communication and constant control, which did not exist last summer, when the tragedy occurred at the 12th outpost of the neighboring Moscow detachment. The artillerymen keep the Afghan bank constantly in their sights. Groups of up to 40 men slip through, aware that the border is guarded only during the day in the area of the outposts. In the morning patrols frequently find underground passages for an electronic signalling facility, which has not been set up over the entire length of the system by far. If the system has been activated in the night, they go out at dawn, and then only if there is gasoline and the vehicles are running. In such cases it is already too late to demonstrate fire power. One would not find the violators even with dogs. "Do they frequently come through during the day?" I asked Colonel Malofeyev. "They could be refugees." "No less frequently than at night. Refugees do not come through here, though. I do not take prisoners. I kill them." It Will Obviously Not Be Necessary to Dye the Helmets Vehicles with light-blue tags are one of the prominent indications of Dushanbe. They are given the right-of-way by peasants, and elders bow respectfully to them. Decorative work with a pretension of good intentions was performed in the 201st Motorized Rifle Division in October of last year, when the CIS heads announced the creation of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces in Tajikistan. The commonwealth thus overcame a system of mutual distrust in a move toward a military alliance. More than 100 staff members from Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrghizia and Kazakhstan were once again arm in elbow as in former times. Friendship is one thing, but they all have different zones of responsibility. The demarcation is indicated with a heavy felt-tipped pen on a map on the desk of Boris Pyankov, commander of the KMS. The allies gather there and hold council. UN observers from the UNMOT-1 mission sometimes look in in the hope of hearing the answer to a burning question addressed to them by Western journalists: What is Russia after in Tajikistan, peace for peoples or an opportunity to revive the empire? The generals reply that the KMS is there in accordance with the UN Charter at the request of the Tajiks to ensure stability and arrange a dialog. And it would not be a bad thing for the Security Council to be given such a mandate, since the conflict here threatens universal peace. In this case, not just the licence tags but the helmets too could be painted light blue. The UN members reasonably object that Russia cannot claim a mandate since Andrey Kozyrev himself has recognized the area as one of political and military interests. Furthermore, never before in the history of the world community have the "blue helmets" guarded the border of a state where an operation is being conducted. This is the consensus in Tajikistan. Troops of the country in which they were located have never yet been among the UN troops engaged in operations to maintain peace. The peacekeeping forces must separate the sides of the conflict, not take them on as allies. Whom to separate, though, and along what line? Dushanbe alone has 4,500 underground opposition supporters, Kulyab Oblast has around 2000, Kurgan-Tyube 3,500 and Gornyy Badakhshan 7,000. This totals an army equaling half of all the power structures. The situation is truly out of the ordinary. Peres Ballon, personal representative of the UN Secretary General, said in a talk with Boris Pyankov that he could advocate through the Security Council the sending of 300 military observers to Tajikistan. Head of state Emomali Rakhmonov seemed to agree, but the commander of the KMS cut him off, saying: Your spies will not be sitting in my headquarters. Give some status to the UN and gain access to operational reports. Or, as Pyankov proposes, we could withdraw 100 kilometers from the border and your troops could assume control over this zone. Anything but that, Peres Ballon replied. In general, it is clear that there is no love lost between the KMS and the UN. There should be no illusions about this. Russia and its partners interested in the solidarity of the Tajik borders will obviously have to count more on the status of the regional coalition and on the Tajik talks on collective CIS security. The KMS presently has 25,000 soldiers. They have at their disposal modern combat equipment, including aircraft and space communication stations. An impressive force, equal to the cost of peacekeeping. Russia has assumed 57 billion of the 65-billion ruble cost of semiannual expenses. Tajikistan is the poorest relative in this family. Lesha Gorbatyy Gives the "Green Light" An Uzbek battalion of 350 men has taken up the rear area of the Panj border detachment, covering the southwestern part of Khatlon Oblast. The population there is half Uzbek, and they greeted the KMS personnel as their own. The bands of Ali Bespalov, former director of the motor vehicle directorate at Shartuz, are located beyond the Amu-Darya. They say that when he left Afghanistan he took with him a large quantity of stolen gold, built a home in the area of Mazari-Sharif, deals in drugs and has more than 200 men under arms. In December of last year his militants blew up a train on Tajik territory. Uzbeks in the KMS repelled him, and he has not appeared again. One would not envy the Kyrghyz. They have one of the most difficult sectors in the Pamirs. The battalion of 286 men delayed its departure slightly and was forced to make its way through snow-filled passes, dragging its weapons with it. The starving Badakhshan people greeted the defenders well but asked them not to interfere with the smuggling of drugs from Afghanistan to the CIS. Lesha Gorbatyy, head of the Mafia in Iskashim Rayon generously agreed to the presence of the peacekeeping forces. His caravans of opium and marijuana freely travel the Khorog-Osh road. Another problem of the Kyrghyz is that they have no money and no food. Badakhshan is in the ruble zone, and you can buy nothing to go with the local fish there. And the situation with Russian currency is tight in Tajikistan. There is not enough even to pay the ministers. Kyrghyz officers in the KMS receive wages of 2,500 rubles per month, that is true. Nothing is provided for the soldiers. In the future, I was told by Colonel Aleksandr Usatenko, Bishhkek's representative, these are potential bandits. For now, though, they are eating out of the pot of the Russian border troops. There are no problems with the Kazakh battalion of the KMS, because there actually is no such battalion. Saken Zhasuzakov, Almaty's emissary at the Joint Command headquarters, told me that it has been formed and is supposedly in waiting at some railway station. They need only the order. There is no one to give it, though. The parliament is dissolved and a new one has not been elected. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who signed the agreement in Moscow on 24 September, lacks the authority to send the guard to Khorog, where, incidentally, they are not anticipating it too greatly, since the GBAO [Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast] Ismailites spare neither the Muslims nor the Kazakhs. And then, my partner in the conversation told me, Russia has its own interests here: uranium, gold, land.... Next year, you know the Badakhshan people are planning a luxurious celebration of the 100th anniversary of their joining the Russian empire. The Kazakhs, however, do not have any special plans for this.... Airborne Hussars as a Morale Factor Coincidence or not, the day Tajikistan's National Army was formed falls on the same day as Defenders of the Fatherland Day in Russia, that is, 23 February. The first anniversary was celebrated in Dushanbe with a military parade in Ozodi Square. Tajik soldiers dressed in Russian overcoats marched past the reviewing stand, tanks rumbled and canonneers fired salutes of rockets brought from Orenburg. The pirouettes of four Su-25 fighters evoked particular excitement. The air aces were brought in from Kubinka near Moscow. The "airborne hussars" flew brilliantly, for which they were thanked by Aleksandr Shishlyannikov, republic minister of defense. The Dushanbe people had a good time. Clearly it is difficult to build an army in a devastated state within a year. The authorities are more concerned with strengthening the security committee and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. In numerical strength these two departments surpass the young Tajik Army four-fold, which, judging from everything, Russia will have to outfit. Right now the army constitutes a fairly strange formation. Around half of the 6,000 men are in the separate Brigade imeni Fayzali Saidov, established in July 1992 at the very height of the bloody events as part of the Popular Front. "Bachai Fayzali" was a companion-in-arms of Sangak Safarov and was killed by the latter as punishment for pillaging. Sangak himself was done away with by a guard, to be sure. The ethics of those days still live. The Fayzali people feed themselves in Kurgan-Tyube by collecting quit-rent from local kolkhoz members, most of whom are Uzbeks. Another settling-up occurred among them a month ago, during which dozens of soldiers and peasants died. A usual thing, unfortunately. Few take the killing in Tajikistan over spheres of influence and access to material benefits as a sign of activeness on the part of the opposition. With less basis for relying on Minister of Internal Affairs Yakug Salimov, who has 20,000 men at his disposal, I was told by informed people, Rakhmonov sees his support precisely in the army and the KNB [National Security Committee]. There is a lot of talk about the procurator's office and investigative agencies not being particularly zealous in exposing crimes. Nothing is known at this time, for example, about who killed Lt. Dmitriy Kuts, a Russian border troop, near a roadside post close to Kurgan-Tyube. More than 60 workers with the procurator's office in the city of Dushanbe have been discharged in the past three months. The September law on the surrender of weapons is not being observed. Kalashnikov semiautomatic rifles are more and more being used as the final say in sorting out relations with a rival or a claimant for a lucrative job. When you speak to the Tajiks about this, they point to Russia, where detective subjects are sometimes far more drastic. Nonetheless, they put their trust in its support.
