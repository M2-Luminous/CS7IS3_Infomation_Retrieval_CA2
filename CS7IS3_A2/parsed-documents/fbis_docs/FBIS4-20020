This warning was made by Economic Affairs State Secretary Van Rooy at the ABN/AMRO conference, "Why America Now," held in Amsterdam on 7 April. Van Rooy talked about 20 countries which are busy with similar plans, and she pointed in particular to the United States: "As regards the implementation of the GATT/Uruguay Round agreements, the Netherlands will very carefully supervise the adaptation of U.S. antidumping legislation. The current practice is that complaints by U.S. companies are honored in almost all cases by the Department of Commerce. That gives some food for thought. The United States is calling for free trade, but there are clear indications that it is protecting its own market for certain sensitive products by means of antidumping and antisubsidy legislation." According to Van Rooy, the United States, as well as the European Union, must not give the wrong impression, since that could end up having a boomerang effect on their own exports if other countries react with their own antidumping rules. Increasingly Better According to Van Rooy, Netherlands companies are doing increasingly better on the North American market. Netherlands exports in 1992 totalled 11.5 billion guilders: Around 10 billion guilders went to the United States; around 900 million to Canada; and around 565 million to Mexico. Exports to Mexico, in particular, rose sharply and, according to the most recent CPB [Central Planning Bureau] estimate, Netherlands exports to the United States rose by 25 percent (in value) in 1993. The state secretary expects that Netherlands exports will be able to grow further with the implementation of the NAFTA free trade agreement and the GATT agreement. Here, she sees opportunities in particular for products such as steel, paper, medical equipment, chemicals, pharmaceutical products, foodstuffs, (agricultural) machinery, and supply industries.
