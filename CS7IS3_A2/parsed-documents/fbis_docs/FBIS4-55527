According to KDS Deputy Chairman Vaclav Benda, it will do so after "all coalition mechanisms are exhausted," in the form of publishing a series of articles in the press. The KDS deputy chairman also told DENNI TELEGRAF that the party leadership is interested "neither in the ministerial post nor in Minister Novak's head but, rather, in the correction of the situation in the department." According to the KDS, the remaining "coalition mechanisms" are discussions of its objections to the operation of the Ministry of Justice at the level of the coalition four. Another alternative is a meeting with Minister Novak on the ground of his deputies' club in the parliament. Benda considers the discussion in front of television cameras proposed by [Justice] Minister Novak another form of presentation of the aforementioned objections. "If none of these approaches leads to the correction, there is nothing left for the KDS and myself but to publicly point out the specific shortcomings that affect the interests of the general public," Benda said. To the question of whether the KDS has any hard evidence, he replied in the affirmative.
