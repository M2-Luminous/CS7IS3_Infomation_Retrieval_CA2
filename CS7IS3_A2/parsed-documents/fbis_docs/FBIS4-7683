FBIS4-7683 "dreeu065_b_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-065 Daily Report 26 Mar 1994 BULGARIA Zhelev Said Seeking Reconciliation With SDS Zhelev Said Seeking Reconciliation With SDS AU0104151994 Sofia DEMOKRATSIYA in Bulgarian 26 Mar 94 pp 1, 2 AU0104151994 Sofia DEMOKRATSIYA Bulgarian BFN [Report by Mikaela Vuzharova: "Dialogue With the Union of Democratic Forces Is Necessary, Especially Under the Present Circumstances"] [Text] A noncommunist government capable of implementing at least part of the reform by the end of 1994 could be formed under the current parliament. All this is possible. However, the goodwill and energy of a strong cabinet are required in such case. The country is suffering because it feels the lack of change. This is what President Zhelyu Zhelev stated in an interview for the daily NOVO SLOVO [NEW WORD]. A dialogue with the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] is necessary, especially under the present circumstances, he said. I am ready for such talks if the SDS should manifest an interest in holding them, the head of state declared a year and a half after his breach with the political forces, thanks to whose voters he obtained his present post, a breach that he was personally responsible for. At the same time, Dr. Zhelev continues to insist that he did not contribute to the fall of the SDS government in 1992. A cabinet formed by noncommunist forces -- something that could not take place without the participation of the SDS -- a cabinet that will not rule forever, but that could do much in view of the forthcoming elections, so that they may give a greater chance to the democratic forces -- this is how President Zhelev explains his idea, which was repeatedly launched by MP Georgi Markov [from the SDS]. The head of state is categorical in stating that a cabinet that is based neither on the Berov cabinet formula nor the former Dimitur Popov government could be elected under the present parliament. Zhelev's evaluation of the team that is ruling Bulgaria today is that it is supported by the Socialist Party. This fact ties the hands of the cabinet in many respects, according to the president. The program of the Berov government offered many opportunities, but they were not implemented at all, Zhelev thinks. He further declared that all parliamentary political forces, even those of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] under whose mandate the cabinet was formed, had great reservations about it, and hence, the possibility exists that the government would be soon overthrown. Zhelyu Zhelev insisted on his previous statement that elections should be held in the autumn of 1994. According to recent analyses made by the presidential team, the situation in the country is especially alarming, most of all due to the complete breakdown in people's trust in the state institutions. DEMOKRATSIYA was told this by a source at 2 Dondukov Street [address of the Presidency]. According to the team's findings, the parliament is already in the ridiculous situation of falling below the critical 10-percent confidence barrier. According to a sounding of opinions among the political forces, it appears that the DPS intends to revise its behavior in parliament and support a possible new cabinet, which should prepare the forthcoming elections on a democratic basis. Numerous deputies of the new formations at the National Assembly, with the exception of a few individuals mostly from the Alternative Liberal-Social Party [ASP], reportedly share the same views. According to NOVO SLOVO, they are all awaiting the trend of the SDS's behavior after Prime Minister Berov's operation, namely in the new stage of the political and economic crisis. This factor, in particular, is supposed to be decisive for Prime Minister Berov's own dilemma, in connection with deciding whether he should remain in his post or resign after leaving hospital.
