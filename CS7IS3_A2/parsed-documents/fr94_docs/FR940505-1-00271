FR940505-1-00271 FR940505-1-00012 (iv) Reduction in operating schedules for one or more emissions sources at the facility. For those facilities choosing to comply through use of reduced operating schedules, operating schedules for baseline emissions levels and for emissions levels starting January 1, 2001, continuing for a period not less than 5 years. (4) Projections of annual VOC emissions for each emissions source through the year 2005 after application of the reduction methods described in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A) (3) of this section. (5) For all sources subject to the FIP cap reduction requirements, all information required as part of the facility's Title V operating permit. For sources not subject to Title V, sources shall submit all information which would be required for sources subject to Title V. 8 8 This information shall include, for example, test or demonstration methods used to demonstrate achievement of the VOC emissions reductions required in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(B) (1) through (5) of this section. The methods may include but are not limited to: (1) the test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and (2) data and engineering calculations approved by EPA documenting process modifications that were made to reduce VOC emissions. (B) Beginning January 1, 2001, each owner or operator of a facility which is subject to the limitations of this paragraph (b)(5) because of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section shall limit total VOC emissions from the subject facility to the level calculated by the following equations: E:GRAPHICSEP05MY94.027 (See footnote to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) (1) of this section) where R 2001 =Allowable VOC for all emissions sources at the facility for the year 2001 in units of kg (lbs) per month, R o =Baseline VOC emissions in units of kg (lbs) per month for each emissions source at the facility. Baseline emissions shall be calculated in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) (2) of this section. i=Subscript denoting a specific emissions source, and n=Total number of emissions sources at the facility. E:GRAPHICSEP05MY94.028 (See footnote to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) (1) of this section) where R 2002 =Allowable VOC for all emissions sources at the facility for the year 2002 in units of kg (lbs) per month, R o =Baseline VOC emissions in units of kg (lbs) per month for each emissions source at the facility. Baseline emissions shall be calculated in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) (2) of this section. i=Subscript denoting a specific emissions source, and n=Total number of emissions sources at the facility. E:GRAPHICSEP05MY94.029 (See footnote to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) (1) of this section) where R 2003 =Allowable VOC for all emissions sources at the facility for the year 2003 in units of kg (lbs) per month, R o =Baseline VOC emissions in units of kg (lbs) per month for each emissions source at the facility. Baseline emissions shall be calculated in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) (2) of this section. i=Subscript denoting a specific emissions source, and n=Total number of emissions sources at the facility. E:GRAPHICSEP05MY94.030 (See footnote to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) (1) of this section) where R 2004 =Allowable VOC for all emissions sources at the facility for the year 2004 in units of kg (lbs) per month, R o =Baseline VOC emissions in units of kg (lbs) per month for each emissions source at the facility. Baseline emissions shall be calculated in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) (2) of this section. i=Subscript denoting a specific emissions source, and n=Total number of emissions sources at the facility. (See footnote to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) (1) of this section)
