The treaty of friendship and cooperation signed Tuesday [12 April] is valid for 10 years and envisages annual contacts between the top Spanish leaders [as published], two meetings between the foreign ministers, and interparliamentary contacts. Relations between Spain and Russia have historically been like the River Guadiana: nonexistent, meager, or anomalous -- hardly ever normal. The exquisitely diplomatic way in which Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez presented the now signed friendship and cooperation treaty is proof of this. For the Spanish leader, the treaty is the continuation of another signed by Spain and Russia in 1812 -- the year of Napoleon's defeat; a formula which, among other things, enabled him to to avoid any reference to Mikhail Gorbachev -- the Soviet Union's last president -- with whom he signed another document of a similar nature. So henceforth relations between the two countries have an appropriate framework for ceasing to be "meager," as the Spanish side described them, or "anomalous" -- the term used by Yeltsin to refer to the past. To the treaty of friendship and cooperation there must be added the signing of another five agreements aimed at promoting trade between the two countries, but this normalization of bilateral relations, although important for Spain, also has a Russian and a European interpretation. Less than three years after Yeltsin replaced Gorbachev, the Russian political situation, and, by extension, that of the countries comprising the CIS -- essentially, the geographical area of the former Soviet Union -- remains unstable. Yeltsin has again received the Spanish leaders' support for his reform policy, but the difficult internal situation continues to cast dark clouds over the transition to democracy and the liberalization of the economy. That is why Yeltsin's constant allusions to the Spanish democratic transition should not be seen as purely rhetorical. The cases are different, among other things because in Russia the change of political system must be accompanied by a radical change in the economic system, but the path toward Russia's modernization could be similar -- through a pact -- as Yeltsin strove to emphasize during his visit. The enterprise of ensuring that Russia's transformation is peaceful is an enterprise for all Europeans -- not just the Russians -- and the best way to ensure that this is so is through cooperation, from which Spain could also benefit in normalizing its relations with a giant which, while it is now experiencing a grave crisis, has extraordinary potential. Hence the treaty of friendship and cooperation signed in Madrid places Spain in a good position with respect to the future. On one occasion, when asked where Russia was on the map, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz stated that Russia is neither Europe nor Asia -- simply Russia. This is certainly so, but agreements such as those signed in Madrid can enable Russia not to move away from Europe.
