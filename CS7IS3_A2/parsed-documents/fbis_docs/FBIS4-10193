In response to this, Robaina stated that for a long time, every Cuban generation has participated in the People's Government, adding: We do not need to worry about a replacement for Fidel because Fidel, together with the Cuban people, the youth, and the not so young, is part of a project of development and change. Other issues, like The Nation and the Emigre Community conference; the new impetus of Cuba's foreign policy; and Havana's possibilities for paying its debt to Montevideo were discussed by Robaina at this news conference, which concluded just minutes ago.
