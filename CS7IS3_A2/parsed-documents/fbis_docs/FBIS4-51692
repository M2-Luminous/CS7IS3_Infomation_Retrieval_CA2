Khernsai Jaiyene said although Khun Sa respects the Thai monarch highly and wants closer ties with Bangkok, he wants Shan to remain "independent". He said Khun Sa could have been misquoted. "We respect His Majesty the King and, once Shan state gains independence, we would like to invite the Thais to trade with us," Khun Sa said during a recent press interview. "All our rich natural resources can be sold to Thailand as raw material and Thailand will benefit immensely from it." Khun Sa said he would like Shan state to have a close economic relationship with Thailand, like that of countries in the European Community.
