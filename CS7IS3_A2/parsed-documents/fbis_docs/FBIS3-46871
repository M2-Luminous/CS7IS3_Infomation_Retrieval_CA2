At present Vietnam has 105,000 km of high-way, 2,600 km of railway, seven main ports and three international airports and 10 domestic airports. But only 12 per cent of roads are surfaced with asphalt and only half of the 8,000 national bridges are permanent ones. The country has seven railway lines of which the longest one is the Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh City line. This 1,726 km-transviet line, which was restored after the Vietnam war nearly 20 years ago, now needs to be upgraded to meet passengers' demand for time and services. More than 12,000 km of river routes are being used by means of transport but the river-port system is not well prepared. Ports at sea have a better prospect of modernization due to foreign investment. However at the moment there is not any port whose annual capacity of commodities delivered can reach 10 million tonnes. Vietnam's airports, especially Noi Bai, Tan Son Nhat and Danang airports have been upgraded to a considerable extent. But these airports need to be transformed and enlarged with an estimated outlay of USD [U.S. dollars] 300 million. So, from now to the year 2000, USD hundreds of billion must be invested in upgrading the transport system. While people are encouraged to contribute their manpower and part of the funds for the building and repairing of the local road network, the Vietnamese Government focus its financial resources and aid funds and the international cooperation on upgrading the national arteries. Highway No. 5 which connects Hanoi to the port city of Haiphong is planned to be expanded to 20 metres with four lanes for vehicles. The work is the result of loans from Taiwan and Japan. A USD 250 million project to expand Highway No. 18 (linking Bac Ninh, Ha Bac Province to Quang Ninh) has been approved. In the south, the road linking Ho Chi Minh City with Vung Tau will be entirely rehabilitated. Saigon-Long Thanh Express Way together with a bridge lying across Dong Nai river will be completed in the year 2000. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will provide fund totalling nearly USD 300 million for the restoration of 1A highway, the road from Hanoi-Vinh and from Ho Chi Minh City to Nha Trang. In addition the Governments of Japan, France, Australia and some international organizations will also fund additional loans for the repair and rebuilding of some bridges. According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, in the coming time more than ten 100 metre-long bridges will be built with expenditure ranging from USD 5 million to USD 100 million and four harbours will be upgraded so that they can accommodate vessels of more than 30,000 DWT.
