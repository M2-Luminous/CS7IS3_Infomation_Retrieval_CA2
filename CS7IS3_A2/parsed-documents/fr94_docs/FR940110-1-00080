FR940110-1-00080 FR940110-1-00006 Section 960.17(e)(3)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that the loan fund or loan consortium shall have in place a legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable mechanism that permits it to recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the project in the event of the sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, and the applicant shall have in place a legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable mechanism that permits it to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium such amount recovered by the loan fund or loan consortium from the sponsor or owner. Section 960.17(e)(3)(ii)(B) of the proposed rule also provides that the applicant shall have in place, if the Bank agrees and such agreement is legally enforceable, a four-party agreement that includes the Bank, the applicant, the loan fund or loan consortium, and the sponsor or owner, that permits the Bank to recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the project in the event of the sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements. Section 960.17(e)(4) of the proposed rule provides that the Board in its discretion may grant a waiver of any required remedial actions for fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, upon written request by the Bank, applicant, loan fund or loan consortium, sponsor or owner. M. Required Annual AHP Contributions Section 960.18 of the proposed rule requires each Bank to fund its AHP annually in accordance with the formula set forth in section 10(j)(5) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(5). Proposed ยง960.18 is consistent with ยง960.10 of the Board's existing AHP regulation, except for minor wording changes and deletion of language regarding required funding in 1990 through 1993 which is no longer necessary. See 12 CFR 960.10. Specifically, proposed ยง960.18 provides that each Bank shall fund its AHP in accordance with the following formula: (a) In 1994, the greater of: (1) 6 percent of the Bank's net earnings for the previous year; or (2) That Bank's pro rata share of an aggregate of $75 million to be contributed in total by the Banks, such proration being made on the basis of the net earnings of the Banks for the previous year. (b) In 1995 and each year thereafter, the greater of: (1) 10 percent of the Bank's net earnings for the previous year; or (2) That Bank's pro rata share of an aggregate of $100 million to be contributed in total by the Banks, such proration being made on the basis of the net earnings of the Banks for the previous year. The term ``net earnings of a Bank'' is defined in proposed ยง960.1. The definition has been revised from the definition in the Board's existing AHP regulation in order to more accurately track its definition in section 10(j)(8) of the Act. See 12 CFR 960.1(j); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(8). N. Temporary Suspension of AHP Contributions Section 960.19 of the proposed rule sets forth the provisions governing temporary suspensions by Banks of their required annual AHP contributions. A number of revisions have been made to this section in the Board's existing AHP regulation in order to more accurately track the language in section 10(j)(6) of the Act concerning this section and to provide greater clarity. See 12 CFR 960.11; 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6). 1. Application for Temporary Suspension
