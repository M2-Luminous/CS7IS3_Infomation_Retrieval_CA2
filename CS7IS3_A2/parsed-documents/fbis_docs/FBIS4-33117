He said he is against price freezes, but in favor of price controls like those adopted in First World countries such as Italy and the United States. "There will be no price freeze, but the government will do its best to prevent abuse," he said. He added that the National Supply Superintendency or any similar organization will be very active if he wins the elections. Lula said that one of the first steps his administration would take would be to summon businessmen who failed to pay for their taxes and reach an agreement for the payment of their debts. Lula has been told that 50 percent of businessmen have not paid their income tax, their tax on manufactured products, or their debts with the National Social Security Institute. He added that after the debt is rolled on, however, no one will be pardoned. "Currently we have no means of collecting these debts, because if the government now demands that the companies pay their debts the businessmen will have to sell their companies." Lula added that, as the government also has huge debts, he will propose to the creditor banks the rescheduling of the domestic debt to enable the government to invest about $100 billion per year. According to his evaluations, this amount -- plus foreign investment -- will allow the country to grow from 5 percent to 7 percent per year. During an electoral rally in the Federal District, Lula said: "Our economists say that the domestic debt is much more serious than the foreign debt." Nonetheless, Brazil's situation is better than that of Italy and Japan. According to Lula, the Brazilian debt represents 34 percent of the GDP, while in Italy it represents 105 percent and in Japan 50 percent. Lula praised Federal Revenue Secretary Osiris Lopes Filho. He said: "I believe he is a serious person who has good intentions and is trying to put an end to tax evasion." Lula believes, however, that good intentions are all he has, because he does not have the tools to control abuse. "He cannot arrest anyone for tax evasion," he said. He added that he will propose a reduction of taxes, and that the PT is against the provisional tax on financial operations. If elected, Lula will only send draft bills to Congress after being sure they will be approved. "First, we will negotiate to the point of exhaustion," he said. When the government is sure that it has the majority of votes, it will send the draft bill to Congress, Lula said. He became PT leader in the Chamber of Deputies after being elected federal deputy for the 1987-1991 mandate. The PT fiscal reform could result from constitutional reform or from proposals to amend the Constitution. To ensure the latter, the government will have to count on the support of three-fifths of the deputies and senators -- that is, 302 deputies and 49 senators.
