He denied such reports, saying: "It is true I am vice chairman of the Japan-North Korea Parliamentary Union, and I was also a member of (former Liberal Democratic Party Vice President Shin) Kanemaru's delegation which visited North Korea. However, this does not constitute any basis for saying I have suspicious relations with North Korea." Regarding reports that some U.S. Government officials are beginning to regard Takemura as the "North Korean connection" in the Japanese Government, Takemura said: "I have never heard of such a connection."
