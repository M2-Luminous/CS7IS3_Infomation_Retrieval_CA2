Ortega: Agreement Made With Chamorro on Leaving Post PA2504214294 Paris AFP in Spanish 2104 GMT 25 Apr 94 PA2504214294 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Managua, Apr 25 (AFP) -- The controversial Nicaraguan Army Commander General Humberto Ortega, who has held on to military power for more than 14 years, announced this Monday that he has reached an agreement with President Violeta de Chamorro for his separation from his post. Although he did not give any date for his departure, Ortega made it clear that there is an agreement with the government for his separation, which will be defined in a Military Organization law to be sent to Congress for approval in the coming days. Ortega, whose separation is demanded by Nicaraguan sectors and the U.S. Government, had up to now been opposed to this "unilateral" decision by President Chamorro, who announced last year that Gen. Ortega would be removed in 1994.
