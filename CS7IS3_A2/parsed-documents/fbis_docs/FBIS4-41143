The Upper Chamber Does Not Want To, the Lower One Cannot Approve the Budget"] [Text] At yesterday's plenary meeting Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the lower chamber, raised his voice to a shout and ordered that deputies on trips be recalled, the scheduled State Duma visit to The Hague be canceled, and all deputies except for the sick come to work by 0900 hours on Friday. The speaker's fury stemmed from parliament's failure to adopt the 1995 [as published] federal budget at the third reading. Deputies voted three times, and in the second vote the budget had every chance of being approved -- it fell short by only four votes, which could admittedly have been supplied by the deputies-cum-government members currently out of town. Nothing seemed to foreshadow such an outcome. After a fairly sluggish discussion of the agenda (the deputies did not even react to an enticing proposal to dismiss Andrey Kozyrev, who signed the treaty on partnership with NATO yesterday), the State Duma proceeded to approve the budget it had already given its second reading. Things were taking their normal course, but somehow lethargically as if in a slow-motion picture: Budget Committee Chairman Zadornov had the floor, Deputy Finance Minister Petrov followed him, a vote was held -- and there you go, the budget was rejected by a margin of 31 votes. The deputies voted once again -- another failure. During the break the factions left for a conference, the State Duma Council met, and acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin was summoned. However, his arguments that the Central Bank cannot give credits and that there will be no money to pay for deliveries to northern areas, the harvest, and so forth did not convince the people's representatives -- the budget fell 43 votes short of approval. It was then that Ivan Rybkin delivered a fiery diatribe and demanded that those "stuck in the smoking room, giving interviews, and so forth" be brought back. However, the only person to respond -- and even he only responded by telephone -- was Anatoliy Sliva, chairman of local self-government committee, who said that, though he was sick, he would come to the Friday meeting to attend the fourth vote on the budget. It is doubtful, however, that all deputies will follow Anatoliy Sliva's noble impulse -- on Friday the next match of the Russian soccer team at the World Cup will be aired on television during the daytime.
