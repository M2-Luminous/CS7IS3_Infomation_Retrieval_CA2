FR940105-2-00106 FR940105-2-00050 As demonstrated by the authorized user's failure to treat the prescribed treatment site, the Licensee did not meet the objective in 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4). The NRC agrees that the Licensee had a QMP and that the physician understood the intent of the written directive. The NRC has determined, however, that the procedures may have been inadequate in that the physician did not adequately confirm (or verify) the placement of the applicator and that the QMP procedure for confirmation (or verification) is vague and does not provide high confidence that the objective will be met. Accordingly, the NRC maintains that with regard to both incidents, violations of the QMP occurred. Summary of Licensee Response Requesting Mitigation of the Civil Penalties As a general comment to violations identified in Sections I and II of the Notice, the Licensee contends that the civil penalties should be reduced, noting that it has voluntarily conducted an independent, formal, and comprehensive review of the hospital's radiation safety program, and a panel of four experts conducted the review on May 10 and 11, 1993. The Licensee also notes, as evidenced by this formal review program, and other comprehensive measures detailed in its incident reports dated December 22, 1992, January 4, 1993, and February 5, 1993, that it is committing significant management and fiscal resources to address the concerns expressed in the enforcement action. The Licensee believes that the remedial actions that the NRC seeks to encourage will be realized without the need for stringent enforcement in the form of proposed civil penalties, and that this is consistent with the Enforcement Policy. With respect to the violations in Section I, as stated above, the Licensee notes that the NRC letter stated that 100 percent escalation of the civil penalty was warranted based upon the hospital's past enforcement history. Since the letter makes reference to an incident which occurred in 1989, the Licensee questions consideration of that action since the NRC's Enforcement Policy indicates that a licensee's prior performance normally refers to a period within the last two years of the inspection at issue, or the period within the last two inspections, whichever is longer. Since this license is a broad scope license that is inspected on a yearly interval, the Licensee believes it is contrary to established NRC practice to cite an incident occurring more than three and a half years ago as a basis for escalation of the civil penalty. Further, since the NRC's current Enforcement Policy has been modified to provide for maximum flexibility and consideration of all mitigating circumstances, the Licensee requests that the NRC exercise its discretion to reduce the civil penalty associated with the violations in Section I of the NOV. With respect to the violations in Section II, the Licensee states that the NRC's cover letter to the NOV indicates that all of the adjustment factors set forth in 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C, were considered. Although the NRC increased the base civil penalty by 200 percent for ``past enforcement history and multiple examples,'' and concluded that the remaining factors warranted no further adjustment, the Licensee believes that, upon closer examination of the circumstances, mitigation is warranted. Regarding the ``multiple examples'' adjustment factor, the Licensee notes that the NRC's Enforcement Policy makes it explicitly clear that for this factor to be applicable, the multiple occurrences should have the ``same root causes.'' The Licensee contends that while the NRC indicated that the root cause of the two incidents was inattention to detail by the treating physicians, this is not the root cause of the cited violations. The Licensee notes that the NOV states that the root cause of Violation II.A was failure to have an adequate procedure in place consistent with the program requirements in 10 CFR 35.32, whereas the second violation, II.B, is stated by the NRC to arise from a different root cause, namely, failure to follow an existing procedure established in conformance with the program requirements of 10 CFR 35.32. The Licensee further states that the fact that these violations derive from different root causes is reinforced by the fact that the specific corrective action for one violation would not necessarily have prevented the other. Based on this information, the Licensee believes that escalation of the base civil penalty under the ``multiple examples'' factor is inappropriate. Regarding the ``prior enforcement history'' adjustment factor, the Licensee believes that the application of this factor was inappropriate in this case, noting that the Quality Management rule has become effective only recently, and there has been no opportunity to develop an enforcement history for compliance with this rule. Just as the Enforcement Policy recognizes that this factor should not be applied where the Licensee has not been in existence long enough to establish a performance history, the Licensee contends that so too should this logic be applied in establishing performance history for quality management violations. On this basis, the Licensee contends that escalation of the base civil penalty is unwarranted.
