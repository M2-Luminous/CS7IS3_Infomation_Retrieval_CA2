Saberbein said that the government cannot escape its responsibility in this regard, because it is the government's policies that have caused the number of Peruvians who live in conditions of acute poverty to increase from 7 million in July 1990 to 12 million at present. The ex-minister said that after three and a half years of the current government, production continues depressed, unemployment is overwhelming, and wages are extremely low, as a result of which Peru recently was declared by the FAO [UN Food and Agricultural Organization] one of the worst fed countries in the world, along with Haiti, Afghanistan, Burundi, and other extremely poor African countries. Saberbein claimed that today in Peru, people are eating less, working less, and producing less than during the two previous democratic administrations. The social costs paid so far to reduce inflation, he said, are much greater than necessary, due to defects in the government's policies. He said that farmers and peasants have been abandoned by the government, with the reduction in agricultural credit, the lack of technical assistance and massive imports of foodstuffs. Agricultural workers today are earning 50 percent less than in mid-1990, he added, saying that this is why they voted "no" so overwhelmingly. Saberbein said that the government's policies have also placed industry at a disadvantage in competing with foreign producers, due to serious delays in foreign exchange transactions, lack of credit, the high cost of energy, and payment of antitechnological taxes. He said that the government is wrong to think that foreign investment can replace domestic investment and take charge of our development. He maintained that no country has developed by following that principle, as development in all countries has been essentially the result of domestic investment. Saberbein stated that, to strengthen the fight against inflation and increase domestic investment, current economic policy must be corrected so as to create favorable conditions for producers and workers, which would make possible better wages and more jobs through export promotion and sustained growth in production for the domestic market. He said that the government's extremely liberal policies are not the solution that Peru needs. There are other alternatives that will correct yesterday's and today's mistakes. This is why, Saberbein said, the APRA has been working intensively to develop its program, to be able to offer the country before long a better alternative to the current government. Saberbein explained that, as part of this activity, during the past 60 days the APRA has conducted five regional Program Sessions, one of which was that held this weekend in Arequipa, with the participation of leaders and activists from the departments and provinces in the southern part of the country. The event was opened by Engineer Javier Tantalean, president of the National Planning Commission of the PAP [Aprista Party of Peru], and was adjourned by ex-Deputy Carlos Roca, deputy secretary general of the APRA.
