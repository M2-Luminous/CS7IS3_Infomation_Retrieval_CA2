FR940526-0-00057 FR940526-0-00022 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 052394A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for aggregate species in the Greenland turbot/arrowtooth flounder/sablefish trawl fishery category by vessels using trawl gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary because the 1994 Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance specified for that category has been reached. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), May 23, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Senior Inseason Manager, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The 1994 Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance for the Greenland turbot/arrowtooth flounder/sablefish trawl fishery category, which is defined at ยง675.21(b)(1)(iii)(C), is 137 metric tons (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง675.21(c)(1)(iv), that the Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance specified for that category has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for aggregate species of the Greenland turbot/arrowtooth flounder/sablefish trawl fishery category by vessels using trawl gear in the BSAI from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 23, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.21 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: May 23, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
