The news conference was presided over by Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai and was attended by a large number of local and foreign news reporters. The news conference started with the deputy foreign minister reading the Foreign Ministry statement on the U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo against Vietnam. The statement reads in full as follows: On behalf of the Foreign Ministry, I would like to announce the statement of the SRV Foreign Ministry regarding the U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo against Vietnam. [passage omitted on Le Mai reading the Foreign Ministry statement published above] This is followed by a question and answer session. An Australian Radio and Television Company reporter asked: When did the Vietnamese Government receive the report on the U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo and by what means? And was this decision made by President Bill Clinton or the U.S. Government? Deputy Prime Minister Le Mai answered: According to U.S. law, the right to lift the embargo rests with the president. As for when we were informed of this, I can say that we have been widely informed by friends from various countries and through different means. I am using the word friends here to refer to newsmen. And before President Clinton's decision was announced, our [UN] ambassador in New York had met with U.S. State Department officials who had informed him of the action. He telephoned me about this matter before 0500 this morning, that is, before the presidential announcement. A Japanese ASAHI reporter asked about the plan to establish the U.S. liaison office in Hanoi and about when the establishment of diplomatic offices will be planned. Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said: The U.S. and Vietnamese Governments will have a meeting to exchange views on stipulations governing the number of diplomatic cadres and members of the diplomatic corps as well as on the operating procedures for these liaison offices. I do not think that these are difficult issues. Therefore, the exchange of liaison offices between the two governments will be undertaken soon. A BANGKOK POST reporter asked: What are the follow-up steps after the U.S. presidential announcement on lifting the embargo against Vietnam and what are the most important issues? Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said: What we have been longing for and will continue to long for is to have the United States regard Vietnam as a friend. Our Vietnamese people will also regard the American people as friends. The deputy foreign minister also answered many questions raised by Vietnamese and foreign reporters on the MIA issue, on the question of frozen assets of the two sides, and on the relations between Vietnam and other ASEAN countries following the lifting of the embargo. A FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW reporter asked: Rumor has it that Vietnam will give priority to U.S. businessmen to engage in a number of investment projects such as those involving oil and gas exploitation. Is this true? Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai answered: We welcome U.S. businessmen coming to do business in Vietnam, to contribute to economic cooperation, and to spur economic development in Vietnam in the interests of the two countries. The Vietnamese Government hereby assures U.S. businessmen that the Vietnamese Government will create equal opportunities for U.S. businessmen to compete with those from other countries already in Vietnam. Tradition does not allow us to give preferential treatment to one country without giving the same treatment to others. I think that with its technology and its economic strengths, the United States will be able to develop its competitive power if it enjoys equal opportunities.
