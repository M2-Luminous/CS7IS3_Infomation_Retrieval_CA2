The working group preparing the draft has almost completed work on the text. Nonetheless, it still has to be "polished." The experience of the independent states proclaimed following the collapse of the Union has shown that the adoption of a constitution that is new in content is a protracted and labor-intensive process. It would be inappropriate to rush such an important job.
