Mr. Luo Jian said that Fujian had rich tourism resources and was the main place of origin of Taiwan compatriots. Since 1987, more and more Taiwan compatriots had come to Fujian to visit their ancestral homes and resorts and to make religious and business trips. According to statistics, the province had received some 340,000 Taiwan compatriots last year, the most since the 90's had begun. Mr. Luo said that the tourism departments in Fujian and Taiwan had coordinated with each other in giving services to Taiwan compatriots and in recent years such cooperation had not only boosted the development of Fujian tourism but also that of Taiwan. Artificial blocks stopping Taiwan compatriots from travelling to the Mainland would benefit neither side. Fujian's tourism facilities had improved, with its present foreign-related 100 hotels, 50 of which were star-grade as well as 14,000 standard rooms and nearly 30,000 beds to basically meet the demands of overseas visitors. Mr. Luo also said that the provincial tourism departments had been emphasizing travel safety and had enacted a set of management regulations. These departments conducted safety inspections of various tourism services every year and trained employees to guarantee safety measures. Even if an individual accident occurred, Mr. Luo, added, the departments would handle it with the utmost efficiency.
