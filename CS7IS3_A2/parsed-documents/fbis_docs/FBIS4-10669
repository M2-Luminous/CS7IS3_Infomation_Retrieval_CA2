Officials from the electric union last night reported that from a total generation capacity of 3,132 mw throughout the country, more than half is produced by thermoelectric plants built in Russia or Czechoslovakia. The thermoelectric plants in Santa Cruz del Norte and Mariel in the western part of the country, and Rente in Santiago de Cuba were manufactured by the Soviet Union, while the Nuevitas thermoelectric plant, which has a generation capacity of 550 mw, was built in Czechoslovakia. Electric Union officials said Cuba has not received any spare parts for these plants since 1990, and only since May 1993 has the country has been able to maintain a certain level of spare parts for programmed maintenance operations and repair of unexpected breakdowns. Right now, from that total generation capacity, 570 mw are affected by the plants' maintenance problems, 821 mw by breakdowns, and 372 mw by generation limitations -- the equipment operating at lower capacity. Some spare parts and other meterials necessary for a maintenance program are already in the country, while others are about to be acquired. These spare parts will allow recovery of the generation capacity of these plants. Despite our economic limitations, the country has provided the necessary resources to make this inevitable investment, in an effort to solve the current problems as soon as possible. The lengthy power cuts will begin a gradual reduction process throughout the country, to the extent that the maintenance programs required by these plants are fulfilled.
