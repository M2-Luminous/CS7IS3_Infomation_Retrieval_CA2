FR940228-0-00036 FR940228-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of Export Administration 15 CFR Parts 771 and 774 [Docket No. 931116-3316] Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations; Elimination of the Certification Requirements for General License GLR AGENCY: Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), by eliminating the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) certification requirements for exports and reexports of replacement parts and equipment under General License GLR to Country Groups Q, T, V, W, and Y. These reporting requirements were originally imposed as a tracking system to help determine how well the replacement provisions of General License GLR were working. BXA has determined that placing the symbol GLR on the SED is in itself a certification that the conditions of the general license are understood and that the exporter will comply with the terms of the general license. However, the removal of the certification requirement does not relieve the exporter of any recordkeeping obligations or other export clearance provisions contained in the EAR. This rule also eliminates the reporting requirement regarding servicing commodities imported from Country Groups Q, W, or Y and eliminates the reporting requirements regarding certain reexports of one-for-one replacements and replacement equipment. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective February 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia Muldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2440. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Exporters are reminded that listing General License GLR on the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) and the presentation of such a SED to the U.S. Government under the clearance procedures of part 786 constitutes a declaration that the export is authorized under General License GLR and that the exporter is committed to the terms and conditions of the one-for-one replacement authority of General License GLR, including, but not limited to, the duty to destroy abroad or return the part to be replaced. Rulemaking Requirements 1. This rule involves a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0018 and 0694&hyph;0047. This rule will reduce the reporting burden on the public. 2. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.
