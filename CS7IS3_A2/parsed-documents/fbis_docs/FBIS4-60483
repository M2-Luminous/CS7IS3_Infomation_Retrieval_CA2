Mr. Narasimha Rao was received at the airport by the home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan; the civil aviation and tourism minister, Mr. Ghlam Nabi Azad; and the Harayana chief minister, Mr. Bhajan Lal, besides others. As reported the prime minister's arrival in New Delhi was slightly delayed as Air India's special aircraft carrying him and his delegation developed a minor technical snag while landing at Paris for a scheduled halt. A standby aircraft already stationed at Charles de Gaulle Airport was used for the onward journey home. India-American business leaders have proposed creating two new institutions on Wall Street in New York to chalk out programs for the modernization of Indian industry. Sponsored by the Greater Houston Partnership, the plan was presented to the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, who accompanied the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on his just concluded U.S. visit. A press release issued by the group says the plan envisages creating mutual funds, venture capital funds and other debt and equity instruments to raise capital for India in the next decade. The release estimated a contribution of at least $100 billion by the U.S. private industries for Indian markets in the next five years. It also said the Indian Americans have the capacity to fund $5 billion per year for the modernization of the country's industry. The leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Atal behari Vajpayee, has lauded the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, for not succumbing to U.S. pressure on the issues of Kashmir and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Talking to newsmen in Lucknow, Mr. Vajpayee expressed satisfaction on the firm stand taken on these points.
