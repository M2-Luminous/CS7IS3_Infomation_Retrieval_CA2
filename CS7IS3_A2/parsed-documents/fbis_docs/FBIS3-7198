In an interview with newsmen, Arturo Tabara, one of the communist leaders opposing Jose Maria Sison, said "its never late" for the movement to make a comeback if all oppositionists in the party will "unite in forming a new party different from Sison's." He added, Mr. Sison's view of armed struggle as the best means to further the party's political agenda must be changed in order to give way to more important considerations of the times. Mr. Tabara revealed that before his capture in Bacolod City last January, the oppositionists were already planning to establish a party with a different ideological base. He has lost touch with his comrades, he said, but he remained hopeful of the emergence of the new party soon. Mr. Tabara said anti-Sisonists equal the strength of Mr. Sison's allies in terms of membership as they number 9,800 nationwide. He admitted, however, that Sisonists have more arms because they have more money.
