His visit is important in terms of exposing the true nature of Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan. President Aliyev delivered a speech in the Institute for International Relations. He explained issues relating to Azerbaijan's independence, the new stage in relations between Azerbaijan and Britain, Azerbaijan's new state structure, and the Republic's new foreign policy. Geydar Aliyev also explained in detail Armenia's aggressive war against Azerbaijan. Several members of his audience asked him questions on various issues. We want to brief you on the questions and Aliyev's replies. One question was as follows: President Ter-Petrosyan said, when he visited this country two weeks ago, that the Azerbaijani Government is reluctant to guarantee the security of Armenians in Karabakh. He stressed that the Armenians in Karabakh are struggling for their security. Can you comment on that? Aliyev replied: The information Ter-Petrosyan has conveyed to you is wrong. I stress that Azerbaijan fully guarantees the security of the Armenian people in Karabakh. The Armenian military forces have occupied 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory. They must withdraw. Only after Armenia's withdrawal can the issue of guaranteeing the Armenian people's security be discussed. A war is being fought on Azerbaijan's territory. Another question was: The Armenian and Azerbaijani people have been involved in bloody disputes since the ninth century. Can't the two sides make territorial concessions. For example, has any proposal been made in the talks between the two sides to join Karabakh with Armenia and the area between the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and Azerbaijan with your republic? Aliyev gave a very clear reply. He said: No one knows how long the dispute has continued between the two sides. But I don't believe we need to study the history of the region. A glance at historic facts does reveal that part of Armenia belonged to Azerbaijan in the past. I can point to the territory that belonged to Azerbaijan on a map. It is known as Zangezur. That area belonged to Azerbaijan in the past. Zangezur is a historic part of Azerbaijan. It was transferred to the Armenians in 1920. In short, a glance at history will reveal that the Armenians must return many things to Azerbaijan. We covet no part of Armenia's territory. Aliyev was asked: A glance at history will reveal that [word indistinct] countries have the right to outline their views and voice their demands. But everyone knows that the dispute began after former President Gorbachev sent Aganbegyan to Paris. He informed the Armenians in Paris that Karabakh must be united with Armenia. A dispute with the Armenians in Azerbaijan did not exist before then. It seems that Moscow and the local residents in Karabakh must be blamed for the dispute. If that is the case, then they must be blamed for the war. Can you assess this? Aliyev replied: The people of Armenia and Azerbaijan have had friendly relations and existed peacefully for decades. True, the academician Aganbegyan said in Paris in November 1987 that Karabakh must be united with Armenia. He also said that Gorbachev gave his consent. That kindled the bloody war. History will blame those who are responsible for the dispute, regardless of who they are. They will be tried by the people soon. The claim that the Armenians in Karabakh alone are waging a war against Azerbaijan is wrong. The Karabakh population is not even 100,000 people. How can 100,000 people, including the elderly, women, and children, carry out combat operations? How can 100,000 Armenians force 1 million Azerbaijani people to become refugees? Undoubtedly, the issue is Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan. There is another question that our listeners will find interesting: Can you comment on how you assessed Iran's proposal to mediate? We hope you can also assess Iran's relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Has Azerbaijan achieved progress in its policy on Iran? Aliyev replied: Normal relations exist between Azerbaijan and Iran. Due to the policy maintained by the former Azerbaijani Administration, our relations could not be described as normal until recently. No problem exists right now. Iran and Azerbaijan have established very favorable relations. So Iran has revealed that it can mediate between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Iran has appealed to Armenia in that regard. But we are convinced that mediation by one country cannot be successful in such a complex situation. The effort by international organizations must be united. We have rejected no mediation effort by any country. Dear listeners, we hope the war will end quickly, that peace and security will be established, and that the Armenian occupiers will withdraw from the occupied territories, but Armenia has not [word indistinct]. President Geydar Aliyev's visit to France and Britain has enabled the Western countries to establish the identity of the aggressor. Misleading people is no longer possible.
