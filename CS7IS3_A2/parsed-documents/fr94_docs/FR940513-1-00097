FR940513-1-00097 FR940513-1-00020 (2) Possess or land regulated species in excess of the possession limit, per trip, as specified in §651.27, unless: * * * * * (14) Fish with or possess within the areas described in §651.20(a)(1) nets of mesh smaller than the minimum size specified in §651.20(a)(2), unless the vessel is exempted under §651.20(a)(3), (a)(4), or (i), or unless the vessel qualifies for the exemption specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. * * * * * (16) Fish with or possess within the area described in §651.20(c)(1), nets of mesh smaller than the minimum size specified in §651.20(c)(2), unless the vessel is exempted under §651.20(i), the vessel possesses no more regulated species than the possession limit specified in §651.27(a), the nonconforming mesh is stowed in accordance with §651.20(c)(4), or the vessel qualifies for the exemption specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. (17) Fish with or possess, within the area described in §651.20(d)(1), nets of mesh smaller than the minimum size specified in §651.20(d)(2), unless the vessel is exempted under §651.20(i), possesses no more regulated species than the possession limit specified in §651.27(a), the nonconforming mesh is stowed in accordance with §651.20(c)(4), or the vessel qualifies for the exemption specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. * * * * * (23) Import, export, transfer, land, or possess regulated species that are smaller than the minimum sizes specified in §651.23, unless the regulated species were harvested from a vessel that qualifies for the exemption specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section or the exemption specified in §651.23(f). * * * * * (g) Presumption. The possession for sale of regulated species that do not meet the minimum sizes specified in §651.23 will be prima facie evidence that such regulated species were taken or imported in violation of these regulations. Evidence that such fish were harvested by a vessel not issued a permit under this part and fishing exclusively within state waters or under the exemption specified in §651.23(f) will be sufficient to rebut the presumption. This presumption does not apply to fish being sorted on deck. 4.
