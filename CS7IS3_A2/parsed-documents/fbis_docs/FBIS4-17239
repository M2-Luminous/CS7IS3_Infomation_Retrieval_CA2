This was a decision passed in Geneva where the negotiating teams of the two conflicting sides have discussed over the latest three days a political status to be granted to Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia, which is the most sensitive and complicated problem of Abkhazian settlement. During the meeting, mediated by U.N. and Russian diplomats and arranged in full accordance with the agreements signed in Moscow on 4 April, the two sides failed to come to any compromise. "So far, we have not reached understanding", said Sokrat Dzhindzholia [name as received], Abkhazian prime minister and chief negotiator. In an interview with TASS, he suggested that the concluding meeting on Friday would hardly break the deadlock either. The Georgian delegation does not pin hopes on tomorrow's meeting either. When asked if there were any chances of signing some agreement on Friday, Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Ukleba said it was hardly possible. On Thursday, the mediators forwarded two draft documents to the negotiating teams. One of them lists "political and legal components of all-round settlement," the other provides for creation of a coordinating commission to solve political issues in the fields of energy supply, transport, communications and others. The conflicting sides are to come up with their preliminary remarks on the documents on Friday. However, the central discussion is likely to get under way in Moscow on 10 May. The main "stumbling-block" during the talks was difference in approaches by the two sides to the problem of Abkhazia's political status. The Georgian delegation insists that dialogue should proceed from the idea of Georgia's territorial integrity. The Abkhazian team does not agree. "We proceed from the fact that Abkhazia and Georgia are presently independent of each other," Dzhindzholia told TASS. U.N. and Russian diplomats tried to span a bridge between these two stances by proposing a compromise wording, under which Abkhazia is to be "a subject vested with sovereign rights within a union state" built within the boundaries of the former Georgian Soviet Republic as of 21 December 1991. The warring parties are to recognize the territorial integrity of "the union state", the name for which will be chosen in the course of further negotiations. As for the proposal for a coordinating commission, Russian and U.N. experts believe it may comprise four representatives from each side. It was also suggested that the commission hold its meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, beginning from 1 June, under the chairmanship of a U.N. envoy and with the participation of a Russian mediator and a CSCE observer.
