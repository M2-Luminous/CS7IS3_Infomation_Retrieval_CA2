Gen. Diya gave the warning today in Kaduna, in separate addresses to traditional rulers and leaders of thought in the northern states. He reiterated that the government's tolerance in the face of provocations and confrontations by some selfish elements did not signify weakness, but a deliberate choice to demonstrate a high sense of maturity, to move the nation forward. The chief of general staff said Nigerians might have been wondering why the government had tolerated the open confrontations against it, embarked upon by some people. The administration, he explained, was a child of circumstance, which came to save the country, and had used the method of dialogue to resolve issues. Gen. Diya, however, noted that some persons, who claim to champion democracy, had maintained defiant attitude against constituted authority by mobilizing newspapers and magazines to publish falsehood, and openly abuse leaders to destabilize the government. He observed that these people were calling for open rebellion against the government and the installation of Chief Moshood Abiola as president. Gen. Diya disclosed that at the inception of the administration, Chief Abiola himself recognized, supported, and gave advice on the formation of the cabinet, and even nominated some people for ministerial appointments. He therefore wondered at the turnaround and the threat by Abiola to install himself president by June 12 this year. The chief of general staff warned that the administration would firmly show commitment to peace and security of the nation. Earlier, the Shehu of Bornu, (Alhaji Mustafa Omar el Kaneni), had reiterated the loyalty of northern traditional rulers to the Federal Government. About 40 of them attended the meeting with the chief of general staff, which was also attended by military administrators from the northern states.
