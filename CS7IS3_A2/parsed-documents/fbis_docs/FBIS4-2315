Ningxia, with estimated verifiable coal deposits of more than 31.5 billion tons, is one of China's coal-producing bases together with the autonomous regions and provinces of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Shaanxi. In 1993, the region turned out more than 13.5 million tons of coal and earned some 30 million U.S. dollars by exporting 588,000 tons. According to a regional government plan, its coal production will reach 20 million tons a year by the end of 1995, and production will double the present figure by 2000. Experts say the booming of the coal industry in the region stems from the state's policy of transferring energy and energy-consuming industries to the northwestern part of the country. At present, a 2.4-million-kw thermal power plant is being built in the region, and another 10-million-kw thermal power base is included under the government plan.
