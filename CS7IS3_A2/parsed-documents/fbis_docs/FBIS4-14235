The celebration was held in an atmosphere of overflowing national zeal streaming from the depth of the Yemeni people's national conscience, faith in God almighty, confidence in the present and future, and awareness of the importance of the Yemeni revolution and the blessed unity. [passage omitted] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman, attended the grand popular speech rally. He delivered an important national speech. Addressing the masses who assembled in 70 Square, brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said: This day last year, our people, men and women, throughout the governorates of the Republic of Yemen orderly headed for the polls to elect their representatives to the House of Representatives. [passage omitted] The brother chairman said: We stress to the masses of our people that we will not agree to seeing the role of the legislative institution -- the House of Representatives -- marginalized. We call on the representatives of the Yemeni people -- being above parties and narrow party affiliations -- to exercise their Constitutional tasks without hesitation, for they are the representatives of the Yemeni nation. Our Yemeni people struggled before and after the revolution until we arrived at 27 April, the day when the first parliament in the history of unified Yemen was elected. I call on state officials to respect the nation and to head for the Constitutional institutions in order to take the Constitutional oath and to exercise their tasks. Any practices outside Constitutional institutions or the Constitution will be considered illegitimate. For over nine months, our Yemeni people have been suffering a great deal as a result of a grueling and suffocating crisis. It is a crisis for which some have been paid filthy money -- the same money that once tried to abort the revolution and now tries to abort unity and democracy. However, it is a bet on a losing horse. Our people, who supported the revolution and the republic and held fast at the 'Ayban, Zafar, and Radfan mountains, are again ready to collectively confront the enemies of unity and democracy and the advocates of separation. They have been paid the price of the crisis. Yet, they continue to talk about the people's suffering and living conditions. They have received the price of the crisis to purchase mines, machine guns, and tools of death to [words indistinct] and to abort the unity and democratization. In their view, returning the homeland to pre- 22 May 1990 is a cultural achievement. Our understanding of a cultural achievement is democracy, development, progress, social justice, and boosting national unity among the sons of the Yemeni people. No cultural plan can call for disintegration, destruction, planting the mountains with mines and lethal weapons. Yet, they claim to be speaking for unity and on behalf of the masses. From this place, I call on the valiant children of Yemeni people in Aden, Hadhramaut, (?Rassan), al-Dali', al-Yafi', Shabwah, al-Maharah, Abyan, and throughout all the governorates of the republic to lie in wait against all anti-unity forces and separatist elements. If the separatists manage to control any part of the homeland, the iron fist will return. However, our entire Yemeni people throughout the homeland will be waiting for the separatists and will confront them. Our people will stem those who stop at the gates of some capitals to receive filthy money to abort unity. Our people and their Armed and Security Forces will say no to those people. They will collectively erect an impregnable wall against outlaws and those who want to harm the unity and democracy. The brother chairman said: We proudly assure the masses of our Yemeni people that the unity enjoys extensive Arab, Islamic, and international support. This is because the unity is a guarantee of regional security and stability. We call on the unionists in the Yemeni Socialist Party to speak out and to firmly oppose the advocates of separation, who are inimical to the Yemeni people. We say yes to unity and democracy and no to infighting, blocking roads, and embellished speeches; yes to development, paving roads, building hospitals, and purchasing medicine, instead of purchasing tools of destruction, subversion, and death, and fattening overseas bank accounts. Earlier, the festival was opened with Koranic recitations. Afterward, many speeches were delivered, including a speech by the popular commission for defense of unity and opposing separation in the capital. The speech was delivered by brother Jamal Sharhan.
