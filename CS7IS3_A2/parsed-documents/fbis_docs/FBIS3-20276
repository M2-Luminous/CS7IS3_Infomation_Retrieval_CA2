"I am very pleased because we have been able to avoid at the very last minute what threatened to be a serious crisis which would have cost the EU much of its credibility," stressed Mr. Claes on Tuesday evening in Istanbul where he is completing an official two-day visit to Turkey. The recantations of recent weeks suggest, however, that a difficult debate is likely at the 1996 intergovernmental conference on EU institutional reforms. Mr. Claes nevertheless remains optimistic: "We showed on Sunday that we are able to provide satisfactory responses to very complex matters," he stated. The Belgian foreign minister now wants to allow things to settle down and rejects the idea of quickly setting up a committee of wise men charged with clearing the way in preparation for 1996. "We must not be too hasty. This committee should not start its activities until around mid-1995. It serves no purpose to immediately start a discussion between the different factions and therefore encumber the normal activities of the Community and the enlargement debates currently in progress with the four candidate countries," he added.
