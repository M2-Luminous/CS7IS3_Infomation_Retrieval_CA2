In the letter, addressed to head of the KRRIT Ryszard Bender, Drzycimski wrote: "After having watched Tuesday's main news bulletin (on public TV channel 1, ed.), I came to the conclusion that I can no longer remain silent." In his opinion, the lack of television coverage of Walesa's return from his official visit to Estonia and his press conference at the airport, infringed not only the law on radio and TV but also "all principles that public television should adhere to." Terming as "scandalous" the treatment of the head of state by Polish television on Tuesday, Drzycimski also recalled a "superficial coverage" of Walesa's visit to India, a tendentious selection of fragments of Walesa's recent talks with the Democratic Left alliance (SLD) caucus and serious mistakes in reports on his visit to Lithuania. Drzycimski expressed the hope that the KRRIT would take measures to prevent "such scandalous incidents" from happening. The KRRIT on Wednesday discussed Drzycimski's letter.
