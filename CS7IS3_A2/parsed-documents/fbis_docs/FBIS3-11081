The minister made this statement after being summoned before the Interior Policy Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, which wanted to hear his views on the draft amnesty law. The commission is collecting information to determine procedures for handling the rebels who participated in the 1992 military uprisings, as well as procedures under which charges can be dropped. Gen. Montero Revette said although he is not familiar with the text of the draft amnesty law, and although he cannot oppose any congressional debate or approval of the law, "we cannot grant a blanket pardon to all officers who participated in the foiled coup attempts." There are some officers who cannot return to their military institutions because they adopted political stands and have made political statements. He explained that the draft amnesty law contradicts military principles that endorse handling such cases on a case-by-case basis and not by way of a general policy. In other words, within the military, each case is unique unto itself. Gen. Montero Revette pointed out that the Defense Ministry will expedite the dropping of charges by studying each case individually. He added that this policy was recommended by the office of President Rafael Caldera as a means for resolving the cases of the arrested military officers. He said that so far charges have been dismissed against 319 rebels -- 270 before the new government was installed, 10 by decision of court-martial, and 39 since 2 February. As part of an effort to quickly resolve the problem, he said that last Sunday a military commission led by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Nicolas Valencia Vivas went to Peru to negotiate the return of those servicemen who have sought asylum in Peru. The minister denied that an offer will be made to those who are imprisoned to exchange their freedom for a discharge from the Armed Forces. He also said it is not true that those who have been released are being harassed, adding that they are not being given any command posts and are constantly being rotated. The minister explained that those who have requested a discharge have been offered help in finding a job. Those who return to the Armed Forces are kept "under observation" for one year, while their commanding officer prepares monthly evaluations. At the end of one year, they are then assigned command posts. Gen. Montero Revette stressed that under no circumstances should this be considered a witch hunt. He added that there are not enough intelligence officers to conduct an individual follow-up on each person against whom charges have been dropped. Referring to the case of Commander Hugo Chavez Frias, Gen. Montero Revette reiterated that Chavez Frias has expressed his wish to be the last person released, adding that his wish is being respected. The general indicated there was little chance of Chavez Frias returning to the FAN [National Armed Forces] because his case is one of "the most complex, considering he was the leader of the uprising." On another subject, the defense minister said that his ministry has abolished what seemed to be a policy of investigating and arresting civilians for voicing opinions through the media. Currently, no civilian is under arrest in connection with the uprisings. The Defense Ministry's policy is not to open a case against civilians for voicing opinions to the press. To facilitate the process, we have decided that any necessary information must be coordinated with the ministry through its various departments. [sentence as published] In conclusion, he said there have been some changes in the military institutions, and he invited the deputies to provide the names of those "officers who are members of AD [Democratic Action], Copei [Social Christian Party], National Convergence, and Radical Cause" in order that necessary steps can be taken. The politization of the Armed Forces will not be permitted as far as military promotions are concerned, because this is being used as an argument for not accepting into the FAN anyone who has publicly voiced political opinions.
