If we judge only by the three raised fingers [symbol of Eastern Orthodoxy, used by Serbian nationalists, and displayed by Russian troops arriving in Bosnia-Herzegovina], we could be wrong. It is true that the Russian soldiers could not help their hearts (or perhaps they could not help the slivovits either, if they made a stop or two on the way) and that they too -- surprised, probably, by the people applauding them -- gave vent to their religion. However, Yeltsin is not a religious convert but a statesman who, regardless of the occasional caricatures with which he is described in the West, has the old reflex of his predecessors. Is the greater-Russian opposition pushing him toward imperial waters? Or the military leadership? Or has he himself found this way to put Russia back into world politics again? Yeltsin's egg is difficult to separate from the Russian chicken. The return of Russia -- provided that it is "neither temporary nor accidental," as the best French "Kremlinologists" prove -- is radically changing political relations in Europe (and the world). Some strategists are jumping the gun in declaring "a new era of bipolarity," just like the one before the Berlin Wall came down. It is still better to wait: Can Russia, if it is not able to follow its imperial pretensions economically, be a "world factor" in some other way apar from by threatening a global conflict one more time? The latest experience from Bosnia induced Paris LE MONDE to speak about "the taste of the Cold War." Fortunately, only "the taste," for the present leaders in Moscow are far too dependent on Western connections to take the ultimate risk. After the "tragic helplessness" throughout "Yugoslav crisis," Europe can do nothing but admit that it was given a three-year free play by the United States to stop the war on its territory, but could not do it. It remained a "political dwarf," as it does not have the means (the army) to realize its ambitions. Gradually, persuaded by Europe (or France) among other things, the United States is getting back into Europe, but as the only superpower, not just as an ally. Has it, as a tugboat, following the logic of the "old situation," pulled Russia along as well? A couple of years ago, when Moscow was disoriented, the United States would probably not have managed to pull it along, at least not so fast and efficiently. The way the "Russian phoenix" is rising from the ashes (according to Mrs. D'Encausse, the first to predict the collapse of the former empire) shows that it has the strength, or thinks that it has. Anyhow, Russia is here to save its friends, but also to protect its interests. Does that create a new concept of European balance? One concept disintegrated with the fall of the Berlin Wall. How to build another one, without making it "a new Yalta"? Can one determine the borders of interest of "a new West" and "a new East" in the Balkans, for example, since we are talking about "Russian interests"? Russia's entry onto the Bosnian scene is, in the eyes of many, to do with creating a new balance. Perhaps with creating a new division (of interests) as well.
