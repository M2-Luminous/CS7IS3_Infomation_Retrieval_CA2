Note 2: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726 as an additional source of service information for airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;535C engines. Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725 as an additional source of service information. The FAA's intent is that the appropriate revision levels of Rolls-Royce Service Bulletins RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726 and RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725, used in conjunction with Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822, are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1, dated October 1, 1993; and Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1, dated January 7, 1994. (c) Within 4,000 hours time-in-service after accomplishing the modification required by paragraph (b) of this AD, or within 4,000 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later; and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 hours time-in-service: Accomplish the thrust reverser sync-lock integrity test defined below to verify that the sync-locks have not failed in the ``unlocked'' state. Prior to further flight, repair any discrepancy found, in accordance with procedures described in the Boeing 757 Maintenance Manual. Thrust Reverser Sync-Lock Integrity Test 1. General A. Use this procedure to test the integrity of the thrust reverser sync locks. The procedure must be performed on each engine. 2. Thrust Reverser Sync Lock Test A. Prepare for the thrust reverser sync lock test. (1) Open the AUTO SPEEDBRAKE circuit breaker on the overhead circuit breaker panel, P11. (2) Do the steps that follow to supply power to the thrust reverser system: (a) Make sure the thrust levers are in the idle position. (b) Make sure the thrust reversers are retracted and locked. (c) Make sure these circuit breakers on the main power distribution panel, P6, are closed: (1) L ENG SYNC LOCK (2) R ENG SYNC LOCK-ALTN (d) Make sure these circuit breakers on the overhead circuit breaker panel, P11, are closed: (1) LANDING GEAR POS SYS 1 (2) T/R IND R (3) T/R CONT-ALTN-R (4) T/R IND L (5) T/R CONT L (6) R ENG SYNC LOCK (7) T/R CONT R (8) EICAS CMPTR LEFT (9) EICAS UPPER IND (10) EICAS CMPTR RIGHT (11) EICAS LOWER IND (12) EICAS DISPLAY SW (13) EICAS PILOTS DSP (14) AIR/GND SYS 1 (15) AIR/GND SYS 2 (16) LANDING GEAR POS SYS 2 (17) PROX SW TEST (e) Supply electrical power. (f) Supply pressure to the left (for the left engine) or right (for the right engine) hydraulic system. B. Do the thrust reverser sync lock test. (1) Use the SENSOR CHANNEL SELECT thumb switches to set the PSEU code for the auto-restow proximity sensor. (a) On PSEU (^17), The left engine code is 433. (b) On PSEU (^16), The left engine code is 105. (c) The right engine PSEU code is 099. Note : The following step will cause the Hydraulic Isolation Valve (HIV) to open for approximately 5 seconds. The next 3 steps must be done during this 5 second time. These 4 steps may be repeated if required. (2) Push the TARGET TEST switch on the PSEU and hold for one second. (3) Make sure the TARGET NEAR light on the PSEU comes on after approximately four seconds. (4) Make sure that the EICAS Advisory message L(R) REV ISLN VAL shows for approximately 3 seconds and then does not show. (5) Make sure the sync lock manual unlock lever on the right sleeve of the reverser does not extend. (6) Push and release the RESET switch on the PSEU. (7) Open the applicable circuit breaker(s): (a) For the left engine; L ENG SYNC LOCK (Panel P6) (b) For the right engine; R ENG SYNC LOCK (Panel P11) R ENG SYNC LOCK-ALTN (Panel P6) (8) Move the left (right) reverse thrust lever up and rearward to the reverse thrust position. (9) Make sure that the thrust reverser does not extend. (10) Move the left (right) reverse thrust lever to the forward and down position. C. Put the airplane back to its usual condition. (1) Remove hydraulic pressure. (2) Close the applicable circuit breaker(s). (a) For the left engine; L ENG SYNC LOCK (Panel P6) (b) For the right engine; R ENG SYNC LOCK (Panel P11) R ENG SYNC LOCK-ALTN (Panel P6) (3) Close the AUTO SPEEDBRAKE circuit breaker on the overhead circuit breaker panel, P11. (4) Remove electrical power. D. Repeat the thrust reverser sync lock test on the other engine.
