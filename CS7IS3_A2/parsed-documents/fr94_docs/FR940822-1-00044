A new Subpart E entitled ``Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning,'' is added to 10 CFR Part 20 to read as follows: Subpart E_Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning Sec. 20.1401␣Scope. 20.1402␣Concepts. 20.1403␣General provisions. 20.1404␣Radiological criteria for unrestricted release. 20.1405␣Criteria for license termination under restricted conditions. 20.1406␣Notification and public participation. 20.1407␣Site-Specific Advisory Board. 20.1408␣Minimization of contamination. §20.1401 Scope. (a) The criteria in this subpart apply to the decommissioning of facilities licensed under Parts 30, 40, 50, 60, 61, 70, and 72 of this chapter, as well as other facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended. For high-level and low-level waste disposal facilities (10 CFR Parts 60 and 61), the criteria apply only to ancillary surface facilities that support radioactive waste disposal activities. For uranium mills, the criteria apply to decommissioning of the facility but not to the disposal of uranium mill tailings or to soil cleanup. (See Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 40). (b) The criteria in this subpart do not apply to sites already covered by a decommissioning plan approved by the Commission before [insert effective date of rule] and in accordance with the criteria identified in the Site Decommissioning Management Plan Action Plan of April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13389). (c) After a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria in this proposed rule, the Commission will require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determined that residual radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant public risk. (d) This subpart also requires that, after the effective date of rule, applicants for licenses, other than renewals, describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive waste. §20.1402 Concepts. (a) The objective of decommissioning is to reduce the residual radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater, and other media at the site so that the concentration of each radionuclide that could contribute to residual radioactivity is indistinguishable from the background radiation concentration for that radionuclide. The Commission realizes that, as a practical matter, it would be extremely difficult to demonstrate that such an objective has been met. Therefore, the Commission has established a site release limit and is requiring that licensees demonstrate that the residual radioactivity at a site is as far below this limit as reasonably achievable. (b) The limit for release of a site is 15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) to an average member of the Critical Group for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background. If doses from residual radioactivity are less than 15 mrem/y TEDE, the Commission will terminate the license and authorize release of the site for unrestricted use following the licensee's demonstration that the residual radioactivity at the site has been reduced to As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). (c) ALARA considerations must include all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting from the decommissioning process. Licensees shall demonstrate why further reductions below the limit are not reasonably achievable. Depending on the site-specific ALARA analysis, any dose level less than or equal to 15 mrem/y may be considered ALARA. However, in many situations, licensees may have little or no site contamination and should be able to readily achieve the overall objective for decommissioning (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short-lived radioisotopes). (d) The Commission expects the licensee to make every reasonable effort to reduce residual radioactivity to levels that will allow unrestricted release of the site. However, the Commission will consider terminating a license in cases where restrictions must be imposed on the use of the site to ensure that public doses are maintained below the 15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) TEDE limit, provided the licensee: (1) Can demonstrate by analysis of the benefits and risks of further reduction that residual radioactivity at the site is ALARA and that further reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the 15 mrem/y TEDE limit for unrestricted use are not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would result in net public or environmental harm; (2) Has made adequate provisions for institutional controls to reduce annual TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the average member of the appropriate critical group to 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE; (3) Has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site; and (4) Has reduced the residual radioactivity at the site so that the TEDE from residual radioactivity would not exceed 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year even if the restrictions applied in the termination were no longer effective in limiting the possible scenarios or pathways of exposure. §20.1403 General provisions. (a) When calculating TEDE, the licensee shall base estimates on the greatest annual TEDE dose expected within the first 1000 years after decommissioning. Estimates must be substantiated using actual measurements to the maximum extent practical. (b) When determining ALARA, the licensee shall consider all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting from the decommissioning process (including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process) and from residual radioactivity remaining at the site following termination of the license. (c) During decommissioning, the licensee shall take reasonable steps to remove all readily removable residual radioactivity from the site. (d) The licensee shall demonstrate a reasonable expectation that residual radioactivity from the site will not cause the level of radioactivity in any groundwater that is a current or potential source of drinking water to exceed the limits specified in 40 CFR Part 141 as they exist on [insert effective date of this regulation]. (e) Licensee notification to the Commission of intent to decommission in accordance with §§30.36(b), 40.42(b), 50.82(a), 70.38(b) or 72.54 of this chapter shall specify whether the licensee intends to decommission in accordance with §20.1405. Licensees proposing to decommission in accordance with §20.1405 shall submit a plan for establishing and supporting a Site Specific Advisory Board (SSAB). (f) Licensees proposing to decommission in accordance with §20.1405, shall submit a decommissioning plan to the Commission. This plan shall include the recommendations of the SSAB and the licensee's proposed analysis and disposition of this advice. §20.1404 Radiological criteria for unrestricted release. A site will be considered acceptable for unrestricted use if: (a) The residual radioactivity that is distinguishable from background radiation results in a TEDE to the average member of the critical group that does not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) per year; and (b) The residual radioactivity has been reduced to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).
