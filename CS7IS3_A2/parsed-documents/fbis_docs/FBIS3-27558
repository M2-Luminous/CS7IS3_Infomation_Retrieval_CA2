An editorial, carried by the official newspaper NODONG SINMUN, said that the DPRK is willing to accept IAEA's inspections of its nuclear sites aimed at sefeguarding the consistency of the nuclear security. However, only when the DPRK and the U.S. reaches an agreement on simultaneous action on the basis of the commitments made earlier can early inspections take place, the paper added. According to the principles of simultaneous action, if the DPRK accepts the IAEA's inspections, the U.S. should cancel its annual military exercise with South Korea and issue a joint decision with the DPRK on the timing of the third round of meetings, said the newspaper. The editorial concluded that only after these actions have been implemented can the nuclear issue be fairly solved. It also criticized some U.S. news media for blaming the failure of the implementation of the IAEA's inspections on the DPRK's refusal to give entry visas to inspectors. The failure was not the DPRK's fault, the paper said.
