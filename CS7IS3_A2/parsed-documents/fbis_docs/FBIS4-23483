On 27 May 1994 an indication was given to Parliament of thinking within government on the need to set up a commission of truth and reconciliation to enable South Africa to come to terms with its past. I reiterate that reconciliation is not simply a question of indemnity/amnesty and letting bygones be bygones. If the wounds of the past are to be healed, if a multiplicity of legal actions are to be avoided, if future human rights violations are to be avoided - and indeed -- if we are to successfully initiate the building of a human rights culture -- disclosure of the truth and its acknowledgement are essential. We cannot forgive on behalf of victims -- nor do we have the moral right to do so. It is the victims themselves who must speak. Their voices need to be heard. The fundamental issue for all South Africans is therefore to come to terms with our past on the only moral basis possible namely that the truth be told and that the truth be acknowledged. International human rights norms and standards and other international experiences provide us with guidance. 2. In finalizing our proposals we are considering the following matters: (i) Composition of the commission the commission should consist of eminent respected South Africans and must be broadly representative. (ii) The terms of reference of the commission would include investigating and establishing the truth about human rights violations and their acknowledgement. Gross violations of human rights must be fully and officially investigated with due regard to fair procedures. The identity of the victims and what happened to them, and the identity perpetrators must be made known. There must, as indicated, be both knowledge and acknowledgement. The events need to be officially recognized and publicly revealed. Truth telling responds to the demand for justice for the victims and facilitates national reconciliation. (iii) Fair procedures: The commission should perform its task and responsibilities on the basis of fair procedures and the adherence to international law relating to human rights must be assured. (iv) Reparation/compensation: This is another difficult matter. However, a framework needs to be created to deal with all claims -- especially those based on gross violations of human rights with the power to bring finality to such matters -- it being borne in mind that it is the democratic government that will have to bear the financial burden. (v) Time frame: The commission is to complete its work within a prescribed period of time for example 18 months or two years. (vi) Reporting to the nation: There should be reports submitted to the president from time to time as well as a final and complete report after which the president shall report to the nation and thereby close this chapter on South Africa's past. 3. Amnesty/indemnity It is in the above context that legislation should make provision for amnesty/indemnity. (i) The commission may set up a specialized structure to deal with all applications and make recommendations. (ii) The cut-off date in respect of offences committed will be no later than 5 December 1993. (iii) The offences in respect of which amnesty may be applied for will be defined strictly within the framework of the constitutional provision on national unity and reconciliation. (iv) The recommendations of the commission shall be referred to the president whose decision will be final. (v) There will be a fixed cut-off date for applications. All persons seeking amnesty/indemnity will be required to submit applications by not later than such date. 4. Participation Participation in the process will help the nation to heal itself. Whilst the above represents the thinking within government, individuals, organizations, religious bodies and members of the public generally are invited to submit their comments and proposals by 30 June 1994 to the Ministry of Justice before legislation is finalized. Such comments, suggestions and proposals will receive consideration in the finalization of legislative proposals which will then be placed before the cabinet. 5. Outstanding applications Whilst we are in the process of preparing legislation along the lines set out above, there exists great concern about the various applications for indemnity submitted under the existing indemnity laws to the previous government. Such applicants have an expectation that their applications will be processed and finalized in terms of the existing indemnity laws. I agree that these applications cannot await consideration until a new law is passed. Hence consideration of all such applications under the existing indemnity laws will be expedited. An advisory committee under the convenorship of Mr Brian Currin, national director of Lawyers for Human Rights will be set up immediately. Its task will be to scrutinize all such outstanding indemnity/amnesty applications which are still pending and to make appropriate recommendations to the state president. Those who qualify in terms of the two indemnity laws will be released immediately. Those who do not qualify will, together with the new applicants be given an opportunity to apply for amnesty through the new mechanisms which are being established in terms of the constitution.
