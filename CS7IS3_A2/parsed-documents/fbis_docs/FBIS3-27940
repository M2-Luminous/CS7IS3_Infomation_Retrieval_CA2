The article first reports that the Labor Ministry Women's Bureau used to be the symbol of improvement of women's social status because the bureau was the first to hire women as senior officials, and many women from this bureau eventually became Diet members, or even Cabinet ministers. Therefore, it prides itself as the sole authority on policy on women. However, last year, Mariko Bando, who had climbed the bureaucratic ladder in the Prime Minister's Office throughout her career, was appointed the ninth chief of the Women's Affairs Office under the Prime Minister's Office, an organization created in 1975 for the UN Year of the Women. All eight of her predecessors came from the Labor Ministry Women's Bureau. This led to angry demands from the Women's Bureau for a clear delineation of functions, even resulting in a written agreement between the two rival offices. The bureau's strong opposition also defeated the Prime Minister's Office's original plan to upgrade the Women's Affairs Office to a division. Suzuki writes that many instances of bureaucratic rivalry have also been reported between the Labor Standards and Employment Security Bureaus in labor administration, giving rise to criticisms not only within the ministry, but also from the labor and management groups. The article goes on to relate that sectarian jealousies at the Labor Ministry also affect its local offices. Compared to other ministries, the ministry has the most local branches, but these local offices all have separate vertical command structures divided according to bureaus. While there had been efforts to consolidate the command structure in the early eighties, after the Second Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform made a recommendation, these efforts failed in the face of strong opposition from the various bureaus desperate to protect their vested interests. Suzuki also points out that Diet members are reluctant to work on labor policy because this is an area not directly connected with money or votes. Therefore, labor issues zoku-giin [Diet members with special interests in specific policy areas] are practically nonexistent. Consequently, it is particularly difficult for the Labor Ministry to have its proposed legislations passed in the Diet. The ministry is also characterized by a serious lack of reemployment posts for its retired bureaucrats, unlike other more profitable ministries with a considerable number of semigovernment organizations under their jurisdiction. Moreover, in recent years, more people tend to find jobs through privately published job information magazines rather than through the Public Employment Security Offices nationwide, the operation of which is one of the Labor Ministry's major functions. On the whole, the ministry is portrayed to be in the grip of a serious lack of self-confidence, and suffering from debilitating sectarian infighting.
