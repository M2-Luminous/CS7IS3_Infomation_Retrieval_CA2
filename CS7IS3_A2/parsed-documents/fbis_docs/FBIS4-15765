The speaker is convinced that the agreement must not undermine the sovereignty of his country. He still thinks that before the treaty is signed the banknotes of the National Bank should remain the only legal tender in Belarus. He is alarmed by the fact that during the five months of waiting for the unification trade, industry and mutual settlements have frozen. Hryb said Belarus should get full clarity on the matter as soon as possible because every day of uncertainty "brings us closer to disaster." Hryb sees the future of the country in a mixed socially-oriented economy with a sufficiently strong role of the government. In his opinion the economy can stabilize only on condition of the revival of a common production space primarily with Russia. (INTERFAX Note: The parliament has ratified the treaty of an economic union with Russia. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich finds it necessary to back the move by a public vote on 23 June simultaneously with the first presidential elections. During the vote the attitude of the nation to economic integration with Russia could be defined. Quoting public opinion polls the prime minister claims that the absolute majority of Belarusians support a union with Russia. In the opinion of Kebich the referendum would be an important instrument of strengthening political stability in the country. Local experts view the proposal of Kebich as an important political move by one of the strongest candidates for presidency.) Meanwhile, Hryb has not decided whether he is going to join the race. "I must frankly admit that I am afraid of assuming such a burden because I realize the responsibility it implies," he told voters in Vitebsk. Answering the question why the constitution was approved by the parliament, not through a public vote Hryb said that a referendum is the most uncivilized way of approving the constitution because far from all citizens could express a competent opinion of the fundamental law, while the Belarusian Constitution was carefully examined by experts of all levels for two and a half years.
