Shigetake Ogata, speaking to the House of Representatives Budget Committee, said that about 247,000 Korean residents are Chongnyon members, including 56,000 in Chongnyon affiliates, while 369,000 are members of the pro-Seoul Korean Residents Union in Japan (Mindan). Ogata also said that 63,000 Korean residents profess to be neutral. According to the Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau, about 688,000 Koreans were living in Japan in 1993. The agency determined the breakdown of statistics through figures provided by the agency's offices in each prefecture. Regarding the sending of money to North Korea by pro-Pyongyang Korean residents, Ogata said that the residents send the money through a number of routes, including trade payments, remittances to relatives and friends in North Korea, and joint business ventures, and donations to the Korean Workers Party [Workers Party of Korea] and government organizations. He added that some of the money, estimated to be between 60 billion and 80 billion yen, is sent through banks or taken along by residents visiting North Korea. The issue of Korean residents sending money to North Korea has gathered attention with increasing talk of economic sanctions against Pyongyang for refusing to permit full inspections of nuclear facilities suspected of being part of a secret atomic weapons plan.
