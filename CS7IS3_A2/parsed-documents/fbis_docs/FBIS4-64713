We do not want Berlusconi to have everything. Our ideals are not up for sale and this is why we want a political ministry and not only an economic one. We shall be the guarantee; if the government were to threaten democracy, it would not last two seconds." Bossi seems to agree with [Roberto] Maroni, who offered a way out to Berlusconi by asking for the Foreign and Treasury ministries instead of the Interior Ministry, which is a problem. The League leader also attacked the prime minister-designate: "He thinks the state is a company he can raid."
