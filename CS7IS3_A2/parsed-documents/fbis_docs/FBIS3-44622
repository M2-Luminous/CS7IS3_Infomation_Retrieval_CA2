At this meeting, Vice Governor Zhang Shiying requested all localities to focus their efforts on improving teachers' working conditions, standard of living, as well as political and professional quality, on strengthening their contingent, and on protecting their legitimate rights and interests in the course of implementing the Teachers Law. He pointed out: A prominent problem at present is the arrears of wages for secondary and primary school teachers since the end of last year. From Teachers' Day to the end of November, the arrears of wages for secondary and primary school teachers throughout the province totaled 108 million yuan, involving almost 200,000 teachers in more than 80 cities, counties, and prefectures, causing big difficulties to these teachers' lives and serious influence to educational work, particularly rural compulsory education. All localities should take this problem into serious account, party and government leaders at all levels should pay personal attention to it, and the relevant departments should closely coordinate with each other. All kinds of necessary measures should be taken and different channels should be used to pay these wages before the implementation of the Teachers Law, so that these teachers can spend the New Year happily. At the same time, measures should be taken to prevent the recurrence of the same problem. If arrears of wages for teachers occur after the Teachers Law comes into force on 1 January 1994, the relevant leaders will be held responsible for this according to law. Zhang Shiying also set requirements for supervising implementation of the Teachers Law.
