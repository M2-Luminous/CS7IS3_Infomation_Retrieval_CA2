Judit Laszlo reports: [Laszlo] The Brussels summit and the Partnership for Peace is an important milestone in the process that was proclaimed by the government led by Jozsef Antall in 1990. The point of this was to do away with eastern ties and to approach western integration, Gyorgy Csoti said. The decision on the Partnership for Peace is important from the point of view of the region's security. The Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee is of a similar opinion. It was this committee that recently invited a Hungarian Foreign Affairs Committee delegation to visit Germany. Returning form there, Gyorgy Csoti said the central and eastern European countries, or rather everybody, even Kazakhstan, has to offer a kind of partnership to the western integration organizations, for example, NATO, which, on the one hand is directed toward membership, and on the other toward cooperation. The latter is all the more important, for it is not possible for everybody to become a NATO member, and not everybody wants to. Gyorgy Csoti here mentioned Russia, which is extended on two continents and is a match for the Western European region. Csoti also said that German politicians, contrary to rumors, particularly supported the integration endeavors of Hungary and the Visegrad Group countries. Also discussed at the talks in Germany was Hungary soon receiving a status similar to associate membership in the West European Union, Csoti said.
