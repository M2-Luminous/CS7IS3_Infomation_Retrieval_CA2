"If he wants to speak, let him do so. But I believe in the truth. The world knows it is not possible for us to still support the guerrillas," Chettha said. Spokesman Sieng Lapresse attacked Thai military recently in the Phnom Penh press, which quoted him as saying that some Thai military officers were against the government's stated policy not to support the Khmer Rouge. "They have a bad Thai military (element) in there that supports the Khmer Rouge against Thai policy. Let's get the bad seeds out of there," Sieng said. Chettha said the government and the military have made it clear that they stopped providing arms to the Khmer Rouge after the Paris peace accords were signed in 1991. Thailand, instead, had played a vital role in restoring peace to the beleaguered country. "We always assist the legitimate government. But they still dig up the past. We can't stop them from rnaking such comments," he said. Chettha expressed confidence that Cambodian criticism and suspicions would cease as a result of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's current trip to Phnom Penh. He urged the public to put its trust in the govemment. He also called on the press to understand Thailand's position and help boost understanding. He said Thailand had made many contributions to Cambodia, including building infrastructure and schools. Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan yesterday also insisted that the Thai military had stopped providing assistance to the Khmer Rouge. "All branches of the armed forces have confirrned to me that they no longer support the Khmer Rouge. Once such an assistance was given. But now it is an old issue," said Banyat. [passage omitted]
