"We decided to flee because it was very hard to make a living there," said Yo upon arrival, "and we're very pleased to have arrived in South Korea because our dream of defecting to the South has now come true." He said he had been a captain of the Public Security Ministry before he worked as a driver just before his defection. On March 18, he and his family fled to China, crossing the frozen Yalu River, and then moved to southern China by train. "In China, we had much help from ethnic Koreans," he said. But he declined to comment on where they visited in China and when, where and how they got in touch with the South Korean Government. Yo arrived with his family members, wife, Yi Ok-kum, 45: Two sons, Kumyong, 18, and Unyong, 16: and daughter, Kumju, 20. The Yo were the second North Korean family who defected to the South after the Kim Man-chol family who fled to South Korea via Japan and Taiwan in February 1987.
