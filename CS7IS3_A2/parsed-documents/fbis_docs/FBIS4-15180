The ambassador stressed that "Moscow is guided by the fact that all issues connected with the withdrawal of troops from Latvia and with conditions of temporary operation and the status of the radar station in Skrunde, were settled in the documents initialled by the two countries' delegations on March 15". The documents lay down that the radar station is a Russian military establishment, under civil control, and cannot be regarded as a military base. At the same time, the ambassador expressed surprise that a xerox copy of the instruction saying about an alleged establishment of Russian military bases in Latvia, reached the Latvian Foreign Office quicker that the Russian Foreign Ministry. "Such efficiency prompts some considerations," Rannikh said. Moscow will examine the incident, since it "is detrimental to our relations, which we regret," the ambassador stressed. According to Rannikh, the incident which provoked a sharp reaction in Latvia, prompts a conclusion on the need for the earliest signing of the documents agreed in mid-March. The Russian president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov also made explanations at a news conference on Thursday. According to the press secretary, "the Russian side does not raise the question of deploying any bases in Latvia. The radar station in Skrunde cannot be regarded as a base. "All issues connected with the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia were already settled in the Russian-Latvian agreement which was recently initialled."
