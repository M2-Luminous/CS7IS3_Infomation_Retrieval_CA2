Leaving aside the question of the consistency of the austerity measures themselves, the unfeasible and ambitious privatization plans, the lack of determination and discipline in levying additional taxes on prosperous social groups, not to mention a prospective deterioration in the already disturbed social balances once the program itself is fully implemented, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's set of economic and financial measures, as a matter of fact, misses its basic goal; namely, overcoming the public deficit. A public deficit by definition basically arises from the state's unproductive expenditures as every high school graduate could simply guess. Yet, even after having introduced a new set of austerity measures, the government has obviously left the major source of public expenditures--state expenses on security and defense which approximately comprise one-third of the budget--intact. Ciller, however, still calls on the nation to swallow this "bitter pill," or she warns, the nation's fate will be at stake. If the nation is really to swallow this "bitter pill," if the government has really to close down or sell out State Economic Enterprises, and lay off thousands of public employees on the pretext that they are "economically unproductive," then why does the government let the most unproductive allotment in the budget grow in inverse proportions? Who has decided that the nation through the state should invest in guns but not in butter? And in economic and social terms how feasible or profitable is it to invest in guns or, in other terms, in war? According to Ciller and her closet aides, Turkey in the last decade has spent TL 800 trillion in order to support security operations in the Southeast. She moreover plans to spend a further TL 400 billion in the next 16 months. Yet during the decade old conflict in the Southeast, the "enemy," the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) forces, have grown from 250 in 1984 to 20,000 in 1994. Except for the security mechanism, which has swollen to huge dimensions, the state has been deprived of all its public functions in the state of emergency region. Meanwhile clandestine, fundamentalist organizations such as Hezbollah have been allowed to speak through secular mechanisms. Local people have fallen victim to frequent instances of torture and mistreatment. The economy, in turn, has come to a halt, the free circulation of goods, money and people between the country's West and the Southeast provinces has almost stopped. The countryside has been devastated, forests set on fire, agricultural areas destroyed and livestock and farming nearly abandoned. People from the countryside have had to group themselves in and around the region's bigger cities or immigrated to Western cities such as Mersin, Adana, Istanbul, and Ankara, turning these metropolitan centers into ungovernable, big villages. And the immense human sacrifice included at least 10,000 people, more than 2,000 of whom were civilians, and resulted in growing ethnic and religious tension among the citizens of various origins both in the region and in the West. The overall result: A decade's balance sheet, after enormous spending on war and in spite of all material and human sacrifice, has now produced a country which is failing when judged by two major international criteria. It has an incredibly bad human rights record and an ever falling economic credibility. After having given her one year to pursue the so-called path to a "military solution" to the Kurdish question, the Western allies now question some of Ciller's policies. Bonn suspends military aid at least temporarily; Washington hedges about additional economic aid to Turkey; and the British Parliament hosts a major PKK official in order to hear his version of the Kurdish problem. Just at that fatal point "the enemy," the rebel PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, offers Turkey another chance for a lasting peace, one year after the abortive call for a cease-fire in March 1993. "Just recognize our Kurdish identity and render constitutional guarantees to our claims for self-government. We are ready to concede any solution within Turkey's present boundaries," Ocalan says. "No territorial claims, no separatism." Yet, it seems that the government and the Army are determined to pursue their path to "military solutions," with the naive belief that the PKK is already isolated from the "people" and will inevitably yield to the immense military pressure already in progress. The outcome of the ongoing military crackdown on the PKK forces, which extends from the east bank of the Euphrates to deep in northern Iraq, and which, the military claims, will continue until the PKK is "finally eradicated" from the region, will eventually show the Turkish public if the "military solution" to the Kurdish question is, or was, any solution at all. Turkey's citizens of both Kurdish and Turkish origins have already paid an immense price both in material and human terms for the war or to repeat the chief of staff's terminology for the "low intensity warfare" in the Southeast. Now at the height of the flagrant clashes in northern Iraq, it is high time to develop concrete and conceivable plans for peace. There is no reason to believe that Kurds would submit their "national identity" as a result of military force, the appeal to which has cost the citizen of this country a whole decade, thousands of lives and billions of dollars. The reverse contains more truth; the unreasonable appeal to force by successive Turkish governments has awakened the Kurds to their "national identity" on such a scale that even the present moderate overtones displayed by the PKK might be viewed as rather "fainthearted" by thousands of Kurdish victims of the conflict. No one should fool himself or herself into thinking that Ocalan's latest offer for peace results from an organizational and political weaknesses or from a deteriorating position in the region. On the contrary, there is every proof that Ocalan's influence in his own organization is at its peak and the PKK's influence among Kurds in other parts of the region--in Syria, Iran, Iraq and Armenia--is on the increase. Yet, Ocalan seeks peace just when he has reached maximum control over his sphere of influence, for he seems to be a wise enough leader to understand that he is historically incapable of inflicting a final defeat on the Turkish Army; yet he is equally confident that his forces cannot be finally defeated by the Turkish Army. Thus, arises an offer for peace, before a decade's military stalemate makes the country a huge junkyard and a massive cemetery, a country in which he believes Kurds are fated to live together with Turks. Now, after having spoiled the nation's fortunes and resources for decades on guns in order to deny the identities of its Kurdish brethren, Turkey has to decide. Is not peace more profitable than the war? Is not investing on production more feasible that spending on the military? Is not recognizing Kurds as constituents of a democratic Turkey more progressive and more humane that recognizing them as our "enemies?"
