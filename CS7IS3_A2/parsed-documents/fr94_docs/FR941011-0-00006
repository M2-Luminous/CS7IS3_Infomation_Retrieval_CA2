SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 12372 This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Executive Order 12778 The Office of General Counsel has certified to the OMB that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of this Executive Order. Paperwork Reduction Act The amendments set forth in this final rule do not generate any new or revised information collection or recordkeeping requirements on the public. Regulatory Flexibility Act It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this final rule. It has been determined that this rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small businesses because licensing under the USWA is strictly voluntary on the part of the warehouseman. The actions taken herein are required by statute. Executive Order 12612 It has been determined that the policies and procedures contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. National Environmental Policy Act This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. Background Pursuant to the provisions of the USWA, the Secretary has the authority to license public warehousemen. Warehousemen that opt to have a USWA license understand that fees will be imposed to cover the costs of the program. Specifically, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 mandates the imposition of fees for USWA licensed warehouses. The Act stipulates that: The Secretary of Agriculture *␣*␣* shall charge, assess, and cause to be collected a reasonable fee for: (1) Each examination or inspection of a warehouse *␣*␣*; (2) each license issued to any person to classify, inspect, grade, sample, or weigh agricultural products stored or to be stored *␣*␣*; (3) each annual warehouse license issued to a warehouseman to conduct a warehouse *␣*␣*; and (4) each warehouse license amended, modified, extended, or reinstated *␣*␣*. Such fees shall cover, as nearly as practicable, the costs of providing such services and licenses *␣*␣* including administrative and supervisory costs *␣*␣*. This final rule adopts and changes the fees charged and collected, discontinues publication of fee amounts in the Regulations for Warehouses (7 CFR, chapter VII, subchapter C), and provides for fees to be adjusted annually in order to cover program costs. Fees assessed in fiscal year 1995, are stated in the paragraphs and tables contained herein. This fee information was also contained in the proposed rule published on May 19, 1994, in the Federal Register at 59 FR 26146. The table covering annual fees for cotton, as proposed, has been adjusted for warehouses that have a capacity exceeding 160,000 bales. Warehouse and Service License Fees The fee for original issuance, reissuance, or duplication of a license for cotton, grain, tobacco, wool, dry beans, nut, syrup, and cottonseed is $65 for each license issued. The fee charged to license individuals to inspect, sample, grade, classify, or weigh commodities is $26 for each service license issued. Warehouse Annual and Inspection Fees These fees are in the following tables by agricultural product. Inspection fees are assessed for each original examination or inspection, or reexamination or reinspection for modification of an existing license. Annual fees are assessed independently of inspection fees.
