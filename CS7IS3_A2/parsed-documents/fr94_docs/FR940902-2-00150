FR940902-2-00150 FR940902-2-00061 Entergy Corporation (70&hyph;8445) Entergy Corporation (``Entergy''), 225 Baronne Street New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration with the Commission under Sections 3(b), 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 32 and 33 of the Act and Rules 10, 43, 45, 53, and 54. Entergy seeks exemptions from the Act in connection with the acquisition of the securities of one or more subsidiary companies (collectively, ``Subsidiary Companies'') which will be engaged directly or indirectly, and exclusively, in the business of owning and holding the securities of a new Argentine company (``Newco''). Newco will be formed to bid for the right to build, own and operate proposed high voltage transmission line (``Project'') in northeast Argentina. Entergy states that Newco would qualify as a ``foreign utility company'' under Section 33 of the Act. Therefore, Entergy requests that the Commission issue an order under Section 3(b) exempting the certain Subsidiary Companies from all provisions of the Act that would be applicable to such companies as ``subsidiary companies'' of Entergy. In the Alternative, Entergy proposes to acquire the securities of the Subsidiary Companies under all other applicable sections and rules thereunder of the Act. The Project is designed to carry electricity from the Yacyreta hydroelectric facility, now under construction, to the high voltage transmission system owned and operated by Transener S.A. Entergy Currently owns an indirect 9.8% interest in Transener S.A. through its wholly owned subsidiary company, Entergy Transener S.A., which is also a ``foreign utility company'' under Section 33 of the Act. The Project is expected to take up to 22 months to complete at a total cost of up to approximately U.S. $300 million. Entergy will be participating in the Project with a consortium of other U.S. and international investors (``Consortium''). Entergy contends that for various tax and legal reasons, it is preferable to hold its interest in Newco indirectly through the Subsidiary Companies. Entergy further asserts that the particular ownership structure to be used for the Project will depend on, among other things, the requirements of the documents relating to the bidding for the Project (``Bid Documents''). The Bid Documents currently require that the shareholders of Newco, collectively, have an aggregate net worth of at least $150 million. The terms of the Bid Documents further provide that, during the construction period for the Project, each shareholder of Newco is jointly and severally liable together with Newco for all obligations arising out of construction, including damages. In view of such requirements, as well as the possible requirements of Project lenders, Entergy proposes that it may fully or partially capitalize one or more of the Subsidiary Companies (but not newco) with amounts up to its proportionate share of the Project's estimated total cost either prior to the submission of the Cosortium's bid or to facilitate the financial closing of the Project. Entergy expects that its total investment in connection with the Project, including any contingent liabilities of a Subsidiary Company as a shareholder of Newco, would in no event exceed $90 million. Entergy proposes that within 45 days after a determination is made not to proceed with an acquisition of an interest in the Project, it will liquidate or dissolve the Subsidiary Companies, unless Entergy determines to utilize the Subsidiary Companies in conjunction with another exempt acquisition under Sections 32 or 33 of the Act. Therefore, Entergy requests authorization from the Commission to effect such a liquidation or dissolution. The direct or indirect investments in the Subsidiary Companies may take the form of: (1) purchases of capital stock, partnership interests, notes or other securities; (2) capital contributions or open account advances; (3) guarantees, letters of credit or other credit support (collectively, Guarantees'') arranged or provided by Entergy in respect of the securities or other obligations of a Subsidiary Company or Newco in connection with the Project; or (4) any combination of the above. Investments by Entergy in the capital shares or other equity securities of Subsidiary Companies having a stated or par value will be in an amount not less than such stated or par value. Open account advances by Entergy to a Subsidiary Company would be non-interest bearing and repayable within one year of the advance. Any promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued by a Subsidiary Company to Entergy would: (1) mature not late than 30 years after the date of issuance thereof; and (2) bear interest at a rate not greater than the prime rate of a bank to be designated by Entergy. Any such promissory note or other evidences of indebtedness may, at Entergy's option, be converted to a capital contribution through Entergy's forgiveness of the indebtedness evidenced thereby. Entergy requests authority through December 31, 1997 to issue Guarantees in an aggregate amount that, when added to investments in the Subsidiary Companies and Newco otherwise made as provided above, will not exceed $90 million. Guarantees may be required, among other things, to satisfy credit support requirements of lenders and other Project participants under financing documents or other agreements to which the Subsidiary Companies or Newco becomes a party in connection with the development of the Project. The terms of, and any fees or interest payable in respect of, Guarantees will be established at arm's length based on market conditions; provided that (1) the term of any Guarantee would not exceed ten years from the date of issuance thereof, and (2) any fees with respect to any Guarantee would not exceed three percent per annum of the face amount of such Guarantee. Funds for Entergy's direct or indirect investments in the Subsidiary Companies and in Newco are expected to be derived from Entergy's available internal cash resources. Entergy also anticipates that the Subsidiary Companies will not engage in any financial from external sources in connection with the Project. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
