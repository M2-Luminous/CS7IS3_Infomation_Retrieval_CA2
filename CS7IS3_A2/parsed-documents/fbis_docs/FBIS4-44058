Staff Colonel Mehmet Ali Erdogan, commander of the unit, said in a speech at the ceremony that the Turkish peace force was trained to serve and survive in Bosnia-Herzegovina independently. He pointed out that the unit is going to Bosnia-Herzegovina with 261 different types of vehicles, close to 1,300 tonnes of equipment, and, as a precautionary measure, additional supplies for 60 days. [passage omitted] National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan said that guided by Ataturk's principle of "Peace at home, peace in the world," Turkey has always believed in the need to protect peace. He pointed out that during the Ottoman era, the Turkish nation made peace reign in the Balkans and the Middle East -- current sources of ethnic tension -- for hundreds of years. Golhan said Turkish troops carried out their duties successfully in Korea 44 years ago and in Somalia a short while ago. [Begin Golhan recording] It is a fact that the Turkish nation has close historical and cultural ties with the Muslims living in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Our heroic soldiers are going there now, however, to help put out the fire and prevent the massacres, without discriminating between ethnic origins or religious differences. None of the regional countries and no person should have any doubts about that. [end recording] [passage omitted]
