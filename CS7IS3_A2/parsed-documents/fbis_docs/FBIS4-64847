"We need clear and reliable investment conditions for the whole investment period. Those who cannot guarantee this should not be surprised if no investment is made," he said in Warsaw at the East-West economic meeting of highly industrialized nations (G-7) with 10 Central and East European reform states (E-10). Deviating from his prepared text, Rexrodt listed details: "In the energy sector, we will need such stability for a period of between 20 and 30 years. A calculable tax system is indispensable. Taxes must promote investment and should not burden investment unreasonably." Other points, according to Rexrodt, are a functioning banking system allowing the retransfer of capital invested, the acquisition of real estate, and the reduction of bureaucracy. In addition, exports must be possible, and intellectual property must be protected. Rexrodt thereby referred to concrete complaints of business people doing business in the East. He said that last year, approximately 10 percent of German investment abroad went to Central and East Europe. By the end of 1993, the Federal Government assumed guarantees for investment totalling 2.9 billion German marks. Four-fifths of this sum went to the Visegrad countries (Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia). The minister emphatically advocated greater access for the East European countries to Western markets. To clarify practical problems, a business forum of economic experts having practical experience preceded the meeting. The participants published a "Warsaw Business Statement" on 6 May, in which they set the goal for themselves to carry out direct investment in the E-10 countries of approximately $200 billion by the year 2000.
