The bulk of the job cuts, though not all through redundancy, will fall on the RAF. RAF chiefs will have to accept wholesale privatisation of many of its repair and maintenance units. RAF manpower levels are expected to fall from 70,000 to 60,000 by the end of the decade. The only consolation for departing RAF engineers and mechanics is that many of them are expected to be recruited by commercial companies, who are likely to win contracts to maintain frontline aircraft in place of the RAF. The latest round of defence cuts follows completion of the study Frontline First, commissioned to prune all support services to meet Treasury demand for a reduction in the budget of 750 million pounds a year from 1996-97. The most controversial item in next month's cuts will be the closure of Rosyth, which employs 4,000 navy and 1,800 civilian workers. The RAF withdrawal from Germany may not be announced next month, although the decision has been taken in principle, subject to consultations with the Germans and Americans. Gordon Brown, the shadow Chancellor, whose Dunfermline East constituency contains Rosyth, said Labour and the unions would vigorously oppose any attempt to close the naval base. Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, is still negotiating with the Treasury about some aspects of the cuts package, which will be announced on July 14. One point of disagreement is over additional savings Mr Rifkind has managed to find during the six-month study. An extra 100 million pounds a year in savings has been identified, over and above the 750 million pounds sought by the Treasury, and Mr Rifkind wants to plough some of the money back into training and increasing RAF pilots' flying time. However, the Treasury insists that any remaining funds must be passed back and made available for other government requirements. Mr Rifkind will be summoned before the Commons Defence Select Committee during the summer recess to be questioned about the cuts (Jill Sherman writes). Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the committee's chairman, said the civil servants responsible for the 33 areas that have been under scrutiny would also be called to give evidence. Sir Nicholas said any attempt to cut the defence budget further next year would be opposed by senior backbenchers. Downing Street sources said Whitehall was "leaking left, right and centre" and insisted that no decisions had been taken about the defence cuts.
