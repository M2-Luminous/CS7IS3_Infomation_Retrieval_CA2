ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: Under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970, the Commission is proposing a rule to require child-resistant packaging for mouthwashes with 3 grams or more of absolute ethanol per package. The Commission has preliminarily determined that child-resistant packaging is necessary to protect children under 5 years of age from serious personal injury and serious illness resulting from ingesting mouthwash. DATES: Comments on the proposal should be submitted no later than July 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, or delivered to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, room 502, 4330 East-West Highway, Bethesda, Maryland 20814&hyph;4408, telephone (301)504&hyph;0800. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jacqueline Ferrante, Ph.D., Directorate for Health Sciences, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207; telephone (301)504&hyph;0477 ext. 1199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background 1. Relevant Statutes and Regulations The Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (the ``PPPA''), 15 U.S.C. 1471&hyph;1476, authorizes the Commission to establish standards for the ``special packaging'' of any household substance if (1) the degree or nature of the hazard to children in the availability of such substance, by reason of its packaging, is such that special packaging is required to protect children from serious personal injury or serious illness resulting from handling, using, or ingesting such substance and (2) the special packaging is technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate for such substance. Special packaging, also referred to as ``child-resistant packaging,'' is defined as packaging that is (1) designed or constructed to be significantly difficult for children under 5 years of age to open or obtain a toxic or harmful amount of the substance contained therein within a reasonable time and (2) not difficult for normal adults to use properly. (It does not mean, however, packaging which all such children cannot open, or obtain a toxic or harmful amount from, within a reasonable time.)
