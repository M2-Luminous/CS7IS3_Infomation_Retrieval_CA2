An Army source told our correspondent Moti Amir that the settlers caused a disturbance at the site and that the soldiers were forced to confiscate the weapons of some of the Jews in order to prevent a worse confrontation between them, the IDF, and Arab residents. No one was arrested but the soldiers took down the particulars of some of the settlers.
