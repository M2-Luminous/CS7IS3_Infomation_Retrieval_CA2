The press service of the cabinet of ministers reports that due to reductions in gas deliveries to Ukraine from its main suppliers, these matters at present are safely under the supervision of the government. On 2 March, in particular, it was decided to use gas more rationally, which would make it possible to reduce considerably the consumption of gas by the national economy. This will allow Ukraine to perform its obligations in a stable manner in respect of the transit of gas across its territory and will ensure the blue fuel is supplied to European countries in full. The government at the same time is taking steps to resolve relations with gas exporters and resume its deliveries to Ukraine at the level determined by interstate agreements.
