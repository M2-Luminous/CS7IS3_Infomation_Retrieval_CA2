The head of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation [PBC], Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, told AFP he had asked for an official meeting after the Israelis notified him of their decision. The PBC had intended to site the studios in Ramallah where a pre-1967 transmitter and radio masts are being renovated. "Now we cannot have the studios in Ramallah," Abu-'Ayyash said. The town is not part of the autonomous areas. "They have to be in Jericho or Gaza, only the transmission will be in Ramallah. "We asked for a meeting to discuss this officially. We prefer to have the studios in Ramallah," he stressed. However the Palestinians had managed to get radio equipment donated by Germany out of Israeli customs without paying duty after a three-week battle, Abu-'Ayyash said. The sound and editing equipment was intended first for training new staff, he said. The Palestinians hope to launch a radio service in July following the start of autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza Strip last month and the PBC has taken on a full-time staff of 17. They also have plans for a television channel, but that will take longer to set up, Abu-'Ayyash said.
