Most serious, however, is the inclusion of certain people who had not been nominated by the regions or branches. One of the most noticeable exclusions is that of former KaNgwane chief minister, Enos Mabuza, who was number 62 on the list, but who was convinced to stay out because of his membership of the SA Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board. Other names that have been struck off the list are those of Sheila Sisulu, Franklin Sonn, Professor Njabulo Ndebele and Billy Modise, also because of their membership of the SABC board. Most controversial is the including of people like Gazankulu chief minister, Samuel Nxumalo, who never featured in the list submitted by the Northern Transvaal region of the ANC. Nxumalo is but one of the names that was included in the list by the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ANC so as to comply with the undertaking to include representatives of organisations that are members of the Patriotic Front. People like Lebowa chief minister Nelson Ramodike featured in the list of the Northern Transvaal region as they made an undertaking at an early stage that they were prepared to fight the election under the ANC umbrella. Nxumalo's Ximoko Progressive Party (XPP), on the other hand, announced only last week that it was going to fight the election together with the ANC. Sources from the Northern Transvaal region of the ANC said they expected their grassroots membership to strongly object to Nxumalo's name being on the ANC list. A meeting has been arranged for this week between XPP and the ANC where the former will apparently extract a commitment to ANC policies by the latter. An irate delegate from that region said he was happy that ANC leader Nelson Mandela was going to tour the area shortly to hold People's Forums. "He will answer for the NEC why people like this were included," he said. Nxumalo told SUNDAY NATION that he was happy to be on the ANC list. Nxumalo, who a few months ago shared a platform with state president F.W. de Klerk at a National Party [NP] rally in Pietersburg, admitted that some members of his party were more lenient towards the NP and said he would "try" to persuade them to understand "the concept of liberation". Eastern Transvaal and the Western Cape are also fuming over Mabuza's and Sonn's exclusion, respectively. One Western Cape region delegate at the ANC's conference being held at Nasrec [a conference center] in Johannesburg said: "They (the NEC) should at least have referred the names back to us for our consent." Meanwhile, other prominent ANC leaders do not feature in the National Assembly list as they will stand for the Senate and the provincial legislatures. Assistant general secretary Jacob Zuma is not on the list as he is the organisation's choice for the premiership of the Natal province. Other popular figures like Matthew Phosa, Terror Lekota, Allan Boesak and Tokyo Sexwale are not on the list as they have been chosen to stand as premiers of their respective regions. Stalwarts like Govan Mbeki and Harry Gwala are also not on the list after having asked to be left to stand in their regions. Cheryl Carolus, head of the ANC's health department, was a surprise omission. She told SUNDAY NATION that while she spent most of her life in the struggle she never dreamed of becoming a politician. ANC deputy-president Walter Sisulu is also not on the list. When asked why, he said: "You will find me in other tasks." His wife Albertina is number 10 on the list. Some candidates on the list are most likely to forfeit their present positions in churches, trade unions and other civil society organisations. At the time of going to press, the general secretary of the Institute of Contextual Theology, Catholic priest Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, was having a meeting with the church council to decide his future. This comes after a call by People John II that Catholic priests should choose between politics and their religious work. Another cleric on the list is Sister Bernard Ncube. Police, Prisons and Civil Rights' Union president Gregory Rockman resigned from the union after he heard he was on the ANC list.
