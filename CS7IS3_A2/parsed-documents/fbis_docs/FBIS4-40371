This statement was made by Deputy Economics Minister Sergey Vasiliyev at a news conference in Moscow Wednesday. He categorically dismissed "speculations of various kinds" about "an alleged dual power in the management of the economy, that of the government and the presidential staff." Vasiliyev pointed out that the first package had been prepared solely by government experts, while "only one representative of the presidential team attended to the development of the other one." As another reason for Boris Yeltsin's interference into economics, Vasiliyev indicated the fact that the State Duma "could not bake laws like cakes" as there is a procedure for their adoption.
