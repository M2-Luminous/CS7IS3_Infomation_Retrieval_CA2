Many of their governments, including Thailand's, fear the negotiations and the planned creation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) will be used to pressure them into adopting labour, human rights and environmental standards they consider inappropriate. Their main fear is that any such move will damage their economic competitiveness. Businesses in developing countries often depend on cheap labour and lax environmental and labour standards to keep their costs down, and their products cheap. They see the move by the West to impose higher standards as a sneaky way to protect its own industries. They have a point. Protectionism is on the rise in the developed world. But this is not the entire story. National sovereignty Many consumers in the West are genuinely concerned that they are purchasing products made at the expense of the environment or the health of indigenous people (although they like cheap products, too). In their own countries, they may have some say over how such matters are protected, but the origin of imported goods is usually a mystery. Hence another reason to push for stricter enforcement of regulations abroad. Governments in developing countries have responded by complaining that their national sovereignty is being impinged. But such talk will no longer do. "Free" trade is not really free, it comes with a price. Businesses appear eager to have their cake and eat it, too. They want easy access to lucrative markets abroad but don't want to face up to the realities which closer trade links entail. Breaking down economic barriers inevitably means breaking down political and social ones, too. The European Union has recognized this. Its leaders realize that economic union cannot be carried out without some kind of political union. Nor would the North American Free Trade Agreement have passed in the US without the side agreements on labour and the environment. With this in mind, we must all pay very close attention to how the World Trade Organization develops. As Gatt expands and deepens, the WTO could well form the beginnings of a kind of world government, one which could conceivably gain greater powers than the United Nations. As it stands, the WTO is not terribly accountable. Its representatives are appointed by governments and bureaucrats. It should be democratized, perhaps by creating a sister organization whose members are elected directly by the people, as with the European Parliament. Our government should certainly continue defending our right to make our own decisions. But sooner or later, all the countries which sign the Gatt -- or any free trade agreement, including Afta [ASEAN Free Trade Area] -- will have to realize that acceding to the treaty will mean sacrificing national sovereignty on some issues. If we don't like it, then we shouldn't sign. Of course, compromise must cut both ways. The US may well be justified in demanding, say, that Japan and Norway halt their whaling activities or that China stop using prison labour. But we in Asia also have a right to examine America's internal affairs. One point which stands out is the widespread availability of guns in the US. Many Americans seem to believe they have a God-given, or at least a constitutionally ordained, right to own a deadly weapon. Some might say this is their own business. But it affects us in Asia, too. Japanese students The latest instance was the case of two Japanese students gunned down in a Los Angeles [LA] parking lot. The incident created a public uproar in Japan, so much so the US ambassador felt the need to officially apologize on behalf of the United States government. The Japanese should consider themselves lucky; the US government rarely apologizes to governments of other foreigners gunned down in the States -- although it did express regret when Thai monks were murdered in Arizona several years ago -- much less to its own people for allowing weapons to be so easily available. This is not the only way in which America's gun policy, or lack thereof, has affected foreigners. The gun used to assassinate Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was traced back to LA. Who knows how many guns are bought in the States and then exported for murder abroad? Defenders of the United States' liberal gun laws say that gun control won't work, that it will only affect law-abiding citizens. But that's because it has barely been tried. The US government is too easily swayed by powerful anti-gun-control lobbies. Asian countries would be doing Americans and the world a favour by pushing for stronger weapons laws in the States. This is just one example to show that many issues are no longer simply national in scope, but made international with the advent of ever freer trade. Rather than fighting the trend towards greater regulatory cooperation, we should try to work with it.
