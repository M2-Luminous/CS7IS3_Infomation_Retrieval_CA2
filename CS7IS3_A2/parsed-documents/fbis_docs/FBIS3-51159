Official Arturo Yero might be being held hostage at the Cuban diplomatic offices, according to the organization of Cuban exiles, Cuban Democratic Solidarity, which did not rule out the possibility that Yero could have found "safe haven." Sources in the Foreign Ministry in Quito unofficially confirmed the disappearance of Yero and his wife but denied an asylum request had been filed. Some 10 Cuban diplomats and journalists have deserted in Ecuador in the past few years, including intelligence officers. According to Jesus Cruza-Flor, president of Cuban Democratic Solidarity, Yero is actually "a captain of Castro's intelligence forces" who reportedly received an order to return immediately to Havana, "which he refused." Cruza-Flor said the disappearance of the official, which is the second such case at the Cuban Embassy in Quito, "confirms that Fidel Castro's regime is inevitably reaching its end because of the overall discontent of the people, who flee Cuba as soon as they find an opportunity, leaving everything behind and risking it all."
