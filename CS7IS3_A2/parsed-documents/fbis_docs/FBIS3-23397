Two Israeli citizens were injured in the attack. Here is a report by our correspondent in the territories Golan Yokhpaz: A leaflet signed by PFLP activists and in which the organization assumes responsibility for the terrorist attack on a bus near the settlement of 'Ateret, north of Jerusalem, was disseminated in Ramallah this morning. This is the first operation in the framework of settling scores between the Palestinian people and the Zionists following the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs, the PFLP activists state in their leaflet. Our forces will not cease their activities until a just and comprehensive solution has been found to the Palestinian problem and until a Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its capital has been founded. The leaflet goes on to say that the attack was carried out by two PFLP fighters who succeeded in escaping. [passage omitted] Two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists were arrested this morning several hundred meters north of the Erez checkpoint. Armed with a knife, the two managed to make their way out of the Gaza Strip without permits to enter Israel. They planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Israel. They were carrying a leaflet signed by Hamas and a copy of the Koran.
