In his opinion, the upcoming visit will primarily be of "an economic nature." As before, Germany remains Russia's most important business partner and major "currency donor," underlined Sokol. In general, the trade-economic relations between two countries are developing favorably, however, several problems which hinder their further development, have accumulated over the last period of time. First of all, it is the problem of Russia's debt. Currently it exceeds 50 billion dollars. This sum includes the earlier granted credits which cannot be repaid due to a number of reasons. Along with the state debt there exists the so called "commercial debt" of the Russian enterprises to several German firms for the delivered goods amounting to 1.2 billion dollars. One more problem related to the previous two ones concerns credit granted to Russia under the guarantee of the German insurance company Germes. Since 1991 all previous credits totalling DM 18.4 billion have been allocated on preferential conditions with a 10-year delay in payment. Since 1994 the company Germes passed a decision to annul all benefits with respect to Russia and to issue export guarantees in accordance with the international practice with an advanced payment amounting to 15 percent of the contract's value due to the growth of Russian debt. Because of this circumstance the majority of Russian enterprises cannot use the credit line of the company Germes now. As a result, the Russian government has not passed its decision on utilization of the DM 2.5 billion credit allocated by the German party for Russia in 1994 under the guarantee of the German insurance company. Meanwhile, the absence of preferential credits can lead to diminishing of Russian import from Germany and to the reduction of turnover between two countries as a whole; both parties recognize that this does not meet their interests. The Russian Foreign Economic Relations Ministry believes that mutually acceptable decisions which would prevent further lowering of the bilateral trade-economic exchange can be found in the course of the upcoming Russian-German negotiations.
