But the U.S. bellicose elements are making a mistake. Socialism of Korea is an invincible socialism which cannot be destroyed with anything. The kernel of the invincibility of the DPRK is the great singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses. The community of destiny, an integral whole of ideology and purpose in which ideology is one, and the destiny and weal and woe are shared by all -- this is the singlehearted unity of Korea. This singlehearted unity in which the leader, the party and the masses form a harmonious whole is a unity which is hardened like steel in a grim test. In March last year a touch-and-go crisis was created, which might trigger off a war any moment, due to the reckless war manoeuvres of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean authorities. In a few days more than 1.5 million young people volunteered to the Korean People's Army. Five million youths and students vowed to defend their leader, their party and the socialist homeland with their lives, becoming 5 million rifles and 5 million bombs. Hundreds of thousands of veterans rose up like a giant, shouting "we will take charge of defence." The entire people effected a great upswing in socialist construction with a rifle in one hand and a sickle or a hammer in the other. This is the strength of singlehearted unity mightier than thousands of nuclear bombs. With this singlehearted unity, the Korean people are afraid of nothing and have no unconquerable fortress. The DPRK is invincible as it has a matchless army which has grown under the guidance of the great brilliant commander. The People's Army is mighty Armed Forces with both modern offensive and defensive means. Each man of it is prepared to be the match for a hundred. He is an indomitable soldier with faith and will to defend with his life the leader, the party and the motherland under any circumstances. The entire people are armed and the whole country is fortified in Korea. The Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red Guards are fully ready for defending the country. The defence industry guarantees the military equipment needed for the defence of the country. Though the imperialists put pressure upon Korea, threatening economic "sanctions", the independent national economy remains unshaken. This is another source of the invincibility of the DPRK. The Korean people have lived and are prepared to live on rice produced by them, clothes produced by them and daily necessities produced by them. The U.S. imperialists must not run wild. They may dispatch 6 million troops, not 600,000, and may deploy much more formidable missiles than Patriot. But they cannot frighten the Korean people. The United States must ponder over the matter. If one likes fire he is bound to get burnt.
