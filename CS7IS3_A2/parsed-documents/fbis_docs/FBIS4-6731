Spokesman Kyd said that "it is highly possible that North Korea will accept additional inspections of its nuclear facilities before the end of April, at the earliest, as wished by the IAEA," and added that "in preparation for the smooth progress of discussions with North Korea, the IAEA is ready to send its inspection team to Pyongyang within next week." On 20 April, North Korea sent a message to the IAEA proposing that IAEA inspectors witness the upcoming change of fuel bars at its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. An IAEA source also said that "in the message North Korea asked the IAEA to witness the upcoming change of fuel bars at its nuclear reactor," and that "this is the first concrete reaction from North Korea to the international community's request for additional nuclear inspection."
