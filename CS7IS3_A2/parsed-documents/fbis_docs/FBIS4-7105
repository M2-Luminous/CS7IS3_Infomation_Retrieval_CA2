On that evening at Fujimi-cho in the Chiyoda Ward of Tokyo, many people were seen riding up to the central building of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan. This was because the General Association held a celebration two days before Kim Il-song's birthday. Many members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] attended. At least 17 SDPJ members were present, including Takako Doi, the former SDPJ chairwoman and incumbent speaker of the House of Representatives; Tomiichi Murayama, the incumbent SDPJ chairman; Makoto Tanabe, also a former SDPJ chairman; Hajime Fukada, director of the SDPJ Organization Bureau; and Yuzuru Shimazaki. It stands to reason that the SDPJ would send some members to the party held in celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday because of its friendly relations with the North Korean Workers' Party. Nevertheless, when we look at the members who attended the party, we see how singular the SDPJ is. The international situation surrounding North Korea is extremely tense. Even China, which is North Korea's last major ally and which had previously shown its intention to veto any resolution of the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions against North Korea, took a step backward. This year it refrained from sending a delegation to Pyongyang to attend festivities held in celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday. By making such a decision, China has clearly indicated to North Korea that neither China nor the international community can accept North Korea's persistent refusal to accept complete international inspections of its suspected nuclear sites. The Japanese Government went one step further than China, saying it will do "what it can within the constitutional framework" if the UN Security Council decides to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. In other words, the Japanese Government has decided to present a firm front, basically in accordance with the United Nations. Despite such circumstances, the chairman of the largest party in the ruling coalition attended a celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday on his own initiative. I do not appreciate this conduct. The presence of Hajime Fukada and Yuzuru Shimazaki at the party is somewhat understandable, since Fukada is known to have been nicknamed "North Korean ambassador to Japan" by other SDPJ members and Shimazaki is noted as an ardent admirer of Kim Il-song--he once called the North Korean leader "the greatest politician in the world." However, Tomiichi Murayama's position is totally different from theirs because he is the party chairman and simultaneously the leader of the largest coalition member. The same can be said of Takako Doi. As the speaker of the House of Representatives, she represents the highest authority on national rights. She also stands on top of the three powers of administration, legislation, and judicature. Therefore, every move she makes has great significance politically. I was not just surprised at the news that Murayama and Doi acted on their own in contradiction to the government's tough stance toward North Korea; their behavior raises suspicion in my mind. It reminded me of the news report that the former Soviet Union had been providing monetary aid to the SDPJ. This was made public in April 1993. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, a considerable amount of information came out of the Kremlin, mostly classified information that would have remained secret forever had there been a continuation of one-party rule by the Communist Party. There were several secret documents which proved the SDPJ had received funds from the Soviet Union under the pretext of financial aid to promote trade, tourism, and cultural exchange between the two countries, and that the SDPJ had used the illegal money as campaign funds. The following names were clearly mentioned in the documents: Masashi Ishibashi, former SDPJ chairman; Akira Iwai, former head of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan; and Kanji Kawasaki, a senior member of the SDPJ. They all strongly denied involvement. However, although it has been a full year since these facts were made public, it seems they have not yet provided any information or documents to prove their innocence. Therefore, the SDPJ still lies under strong suspicion that it had financial dealings with the former Soviet Union. In other words, the SDPJ had taken a pro-Soviet line, while receiving financial support from the communist country. Now the SDPJ takes a pro-Pyongyang policy. Did the same factor which induced the SDPJ to adopt a pro-Soviet line again come into play in the process? We can hardly offer a negative answer to that question. To be specific, the point at issue is the relationship between the SDPJ and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, which is the virtual North Korean mission to Japan. There was always some talk that several SDPJ members have received political funds from companies affiliated with the General Association. I truly wish it were not true, but unfortunately what happened once might happen twice. Moreover, although the SDPJ claims to be in favor of a United Nations-oriented diplomacy, it neglects the party platform when dealing with matters related to North Korea. Contrary to the UN will, the SDPJ has called for a soft stance towards North Korea. Furthermore, amid the political turmoil caused by the tense deadlock over whom to choose as successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, several senior members did not hesitate at all to attend the party held in celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday. All these moves cannot but provoke stronger suspicion in my mind.
