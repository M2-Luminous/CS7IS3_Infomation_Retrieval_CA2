After hearing Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's report on the recent Israeli attacks and the measures taken by the government and legitimate authorities to confront these attacks, the cabinet said that the aim of the Israeli aggressions is to split the internal ranks and harm the homeland's unity. The cabinet, which met under al-Hariri at the government house, appraised the national solidarity shown against these attacks. It heard a report from Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz on the Foreign Ministry's contacts with the major powers and the Security Council members to hold a session and adopt a resolution condemning Israel. Information Minister Michel Samahah stressed after the session that Lebanon is calling on the United Nations to apply international law. He said: [Begin Samahah recording] The Lebanese Government's stand is very clear. According to international law, the victim and the aggressor cannot be put on the same level. Hence, we call on the United Nations, as the cabinet clearly said in its statement today, to apply its legitimacy, international law, and the UN Security Council resolutions to deter Israel from committing its aggressions, and to condemn its occupation of Lebanese territories in the south and western al-Biqa' and its repeated attacks -- as we saw recently, such as the piracies and kidnappings and the attacks on the territories lands and especially on Lebanese citizens in Lebanon's heartland. [end recording] On Israel's theft of Lebanese waters, Minister Samahah said: It is no secret that Israel has coveted Lebanese waters since its establishment. Lebanon's Foreign Ministry has raised this issue in all the arguments over this question. The foreign minister sent a message to the UN secretary general earlier this week asking him to send an experts committee to inspect the al-Litani River waters in the south. Asked whether Prime Minister al-Hariri briefed the cabinet on his meeting with U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley, Minister Samahah said: The meeting was held as part of the Lebanese efforts and contacts held by the president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and the Foreign Ministry departments to hold a Security Council session and to adopt a stand that condemns Israel's repeated attacks on Lebanon, especially the latest one. We have nothing to add with regard to the U.S. stand or to that of others.
