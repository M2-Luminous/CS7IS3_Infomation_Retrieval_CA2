Asked about the topic by journalists, Perez Balladares noted that relations with Cuba will be the same as those maintained with any other nation. Perez Balladares, a 47-year-old businessman, added that relations between the two nations will be characterized by respect for the systems prevailing in each country and noninterference in their respective internal affairs. Panamanian-Cuban relations were virtually annulled following the U.S. invasion of Panama on 20 December 1989 and operate only at the level of acting charge d'affaires. Perez Balladares, who will be proclaimed winner of the 8 May elections on 12 or 13 May, was nominated by the Democratic Revolutionary Party, which the U.S. military intervention removed from power.
