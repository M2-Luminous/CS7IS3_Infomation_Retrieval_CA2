Hungary's involvement in controlling no-fly zones in Bosnia, which is based on a UN mandate, has to be separated from NATO actions in Sarajevo and Gorazde. The latter manoeuvres were governed by other Security Council resolutions, and had nothing to do with AWACS surveillance flights over Hungary, the minister said. In reply to MTI, Jeszenszky said he welcomed all steps that promote a political solution and, at the same time, warn aggressive forces. He expressed the hope that the action would contribute to a political settlement, which started with the Croat-Muslim agreement. Asked about the position of the Russian government, Jeszenszky said Moscow had to be aware that such action might occur. The minister expressed the hope that Moscow would continue to cooperate with the United States and the United Nations in settling the Yugoslav crisis. He recalled that Russian policy had played a useful role in Bosnian mediation over the past few months. He added that peace in Bosnia is as much a Russian interest as that of the Unites States, Hungary and Bosnia itself.
