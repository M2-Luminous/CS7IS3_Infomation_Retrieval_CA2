Nevertheless, balanced trade (in 1993 Austria achieved a 16.4 billion-schilling surplus) is not expected before the end of the 1990's. In January 1994, however, imports from the region increased significantly: They were up 28.3 percent to a level of 3.3 billion schillings, while exports increased only by 5.6 percent to 4 billion schillings, Egon Winkler, head of the foreign economic department of the Economics Chamber, said in a news conference on Thursday [17 March] on the occasion of the East European foreign trade meeting. Exports to East Europe last year increased by 5 percent to 59.2 billion schillings, while imports decreased 1.2 percent to 42.8 billion schillings. Hungary was Austria's most important customer in 1993, with Austrian exports amounting to 16.5 billion schillings. The Czech Republic came in second, with Austrian exports totaling 11.3 billion schillings. Slovenia was the third most important market in East Europe, with imports from Austria reaching 6.8 million schillings. The Austrian trade delegate to Ljubljana, Raymund Gradt, said that the geographical proximity was one reason for this, but he also noted the country's relatively good economic situation and the relatively high purchasing power as a result of major wage increases in 1993. Moreover, Slovene companies are "prompt payers." Poland, which comes fourth, last year imported Austrian products worth 6.4 billion schillings. It is followed by Russia, with imports from Austria amounting to 6.2 billion schillings. As far as transactions with Russia are concerned, Austria has now provided the opportunity for Control Bank credit guarantees again under certain conditions, sources from the Finance Ministry have stated. Guarantees will be provided for short-term transactions (with a duration of up to one year) with a ceiling of 30 million schillings. The special condition in this connection, however, is that such guarantees also require a bank guarantee from Russia.
