The promising new alloy is called the ``quasi-crystalline particle dispersed aluminum alloy.'' For the time being, the alloy is made into a thin 20- to 30-�m-thick tape. This new alloy was discovered by the research group of Professor Ken Masumoto, director of the Metal Technology Research Institute (MTRI) of Tohoku University, and Professor Akihisa Inoue, of the same institute, during the course of studies involving the super-rapid cooling/solidification of aluminum alloy-based amorphous alloys. Of particular interest because of the potential commercial value are aluminum-manganese-nickel-based and aluminum-manganese-cobalt-based high-strength alloys that were developed jointly by MTRI and Yamaha Technical Research Institute. Those alloys have been found to show a tensile strength of 1,200 MPa, which is more than twice that of the heat-treated 2000-series super-duralmin (2017), which is currently used as a high-strength alloy. Moreover, the new alloys' tapes are so ductile that they do not crack even when bent 180� and folded flat. These quasi-crystalline particle-dispersed aluminum alloys are so called because spherical quasi-crystalline particles, with diameters ranging from 30 to 50 �m, are uniformly dispersed in the matrix of an aluminum alloy. The quantities of the quasi-crystalline particles are 50 to 70 volume-percent. The ``quasi-crystal'' was first discovered by Shechtmann's research group in Israel. At that time, there was no crystallographic explanation for the mysterious phase with quintuple symmetry found in a super-rapidly solidified aluminum-manganese alloy. It was clarified with the aid of a high-resolution electron microscope that the regular-icosahedral alloy contained many phase strains, called `(phase-on) strains,' internally. Subsequently, quasi-crystalline phases were discovered in two- and three-element alloys containing magnesium and titanium, and gradually the phase was understood to be a unique electron compound. Although the initial quasi-crystalline phases had been unstable quasi-stable phases, the first quasi-crystalline phase which was a stable, quasi-stable phase, was discovered in 1986 in aluminum-lithium-copper-based alloys. Having studied the above-mentioned series of quasi-crystalline phases, MTRI in 1992 developed an aluminum-manganese-cerium-based high-strength alloy in which several 10s-�m-diameter spherical quasi-crystalline particles were dispersed, and it pursued further development of other implementable alloys in an accelerated fashion. However, for practical applications, the problem was to use rare-earth metals, such as cerium. According to ST Project Leader Toshiharu Hoshi of the Yamaha Technical Research Institute, ``when a rare-earth metal is used, production conditions become complicated because of its tendency to oxidation.'' In 1993, MTRI discovered that transition-metal elements such as manganese, cobalt and iron could replace cerium, and it began to take a gigantic step toward the practical implementation of the new alloys.
