Barricades and tents outside the Supreme Soviet have been removed. The traditional day of the city was held here yesterday and was a great success. According to the presidential adviser, the fact that the Crimean Tatars have captured two 9-storey buildings in Yalta causes a certain worry. Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, left for Yalta today on a fact-finding mission to further report the situation to the parliament. Mr. Chernyatevich has noted that the Crimea has received information about a collegium of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry held in Kiev. The collegium discussed the findings of the inspection of the 32nd Ukrainian Army Corps stationed in the Crimea. There is no information about the findings of the inspection, but as is known, a new inspection will be held this autumn.
