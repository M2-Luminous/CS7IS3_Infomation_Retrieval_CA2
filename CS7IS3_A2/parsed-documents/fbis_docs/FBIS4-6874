In this regard, Jiro Saito, administrative vice finance minister, made a comment at a news conference on 21 April and smiled wryly, saying, "I have no knowledge of taking advantage of the prime minister." He even looked angry for a moment. The prime minister reportedly said: "I wanted to use the power of the MOF. On the contrary, however, the ministry took advantage of me over the issue of the national welfare tax and other issues." The prime minister reportedly did some soul-searching at a midnight news conference as well. He sounded as if he was saying he failed because he acted in accordance with the MOF's recommendations. In this regard, Saito first said "I think I should not comment on this because I heard it from others." He then denied a rumor that "the Ministry of Finance masterminded the national welfare tax plan."
