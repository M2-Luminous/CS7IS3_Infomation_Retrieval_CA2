On the Arrest of Russian Agents in the United States"] [Text] The incident over the arrest in the United States of two Russian foreign intelligence agents, Aldrich Ames and his wife Maria Casas, has alarmed the public in that country. No wonder. The 52-year old Ames worked in the most sensitive posts in the CIA for over 30 years and has vast experience of overseas work. In 1983-1985 he was head of the CIA's Soviet Counterintelligence Section and was one of the most trusted men in the state. His attractive 40-year-old wife, who was born in Colombia, had the most brilliant career prospects at Georgetown University. They could be called a model family unit of a healthy U.S. society but suddenly, overnight, they have become Russian spies. Yet they had good incomes. Ames was paid around $100,000 a year (around $9,000 a month). This is enough to make the ordinary patriotic American's head spin. And when it became known that Russian intelligence had paid this married couple around $1.5 million since 1985, the sense of outrage became universal: What kind of Russian treachery is this? We give them aid and they spend millions on espionage activity in our country! It seems that the U.S. President was also in some confusion: Ames was placed under surveillance [blokirovan] last October but it was not until Monday, 21 February 1994, that Bill Clinton allowed the case to be made public. There is no limit to the U.S. press' indignation these days. However, let us leave emotions aside and try to delve a little deeper. The Ames case has been given the kind of political overtones which automatically bring to mind a story dating back almost 33 years. In 1960 the United States and the USSR took the first real steps toward ending the cold war, thanks to the efforts of President Dwight Eisenhower and Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev, general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. Agreement was reached to hold a summit meeting of the four great powers in Paris after which Eisenhower was to pay a visit to Moscow. However, the hawks in the military-industrial complexes and the CIA and the KGB put the most powerful pressure on their top leaders and wrecked what could have been an historic agreement. On 1 May 1960 the CIA sent a U-2 spy plane into Soviet air space, it was shot down near Sverdlovsk, and its pilot, Frances Garry Powers, was taken prisoner. Khrushchev kept the fact of this arrest secret and, according to the classical laws of political intrigue, lured Eisenhower into a trap by forcing him to deny that this flight had taken place. At the Paris summit he demanded public apologies from the U.S. President and this, of course, was a humiliation for Eisenhower. And without even waiting for a reply from his colleague he exclaimed in great emotion: "Eisenhower is no longer a welcome guest in the Soviet Union!" The U.S. President was about to explain that he had come to Paris for serious talks and wanted the conference to move on to the discussion of relevant questions but the summit was already wrecked by then. Khrushchev ostentatiously walked out of the hall. That was, of course, a political mistake. The Soviet premier had given way to the hawks in his own country, people who in general were more interested in their own position in the hierarchy of power, a position falsely concealed by a concern for the country's security and well being, rather than in peaceful living conditions for the USSR. Relations between the United States and the USSR deteriorated sharply. Soon after that there was the Caribbean crisis, which almost plunged us all into World War III. It seems to me that something similar is going on right now. Except that this time certain forces in the United States would like to give Khrushchev's role to Bill Clinton. And Powers' role to Aldrich Ames. The U.S. mass media have been trying to meticulously calculate what damage the Russian spy's activity has caused the States. What can you say here? Probably the damage is considerable. But intelligence is a two-day business. In recent years the world press and the Russian press have written quite a lot about the fact that U.S. intelligence agents are virtually wandering freely around Russia's vast open spaces. And what escape is there these days from the reports in the Moscow press that the exposure of Ames was not a consequence of the couple's extravagant spending, as the ordinary American is persistently reminded by his press, but resulted from a leak of information from the highest levels of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (in normal parlance that means that a U.S. intelligence operative of Ames' stature is operating in Moscow, too). But what about the damage that has been done to our country's economy by our native traitors, as it were? For example, the activity of Oleg Penkovskiy, who was recruited by the Western special services, really rocked the USSR's defense system in the past. And how can you assess the damage inflicted on our country by Oleg Gordiyevskiy and Arkadiy Shevchenko, who were recruited by those same special services and who held very high posts in the Soviet hierarchy? And what about Vladimir Rezun (Viktor Suvorov) or General Lyalin? The list could go on. No, the matter is of course not one of economic damage and Russia's treachery. In the U.S. media, clearly, there are circles which could theoretically be categorized as hawks (we have them in our country, too) and which were merely seeking an appropriate pretext to exaggerate this affair. But the real reasons are clear to see. Not everyone liked Viktor Chernomyrdin's new government. The question was: To support him or not? The second reason was clearly Moscow's position on the Sarajevo crisis. Essentially the Russian president's initiative in this conflict thwarted the hawks' attempt to resolve the "Serbian question" with the help of air strikes. Russia's political weight in the international arena rose suddenly and very sharply. It proved very difficult to endure this and assess it not as one would like but as it really is. So they decided to use the Ames' affair to try to stop this process of Moscow's return to the great powers' club if it seemed likely that the process would succeed. I think, however, that no good will come of these attempts. The U.S. President, like his Russian counterpart, is showing quite a well balanced approach here. There is a striking difference between how the Ames affair is being covered in the U.S. press and in official statements. For example, it is reported that the note handed to Russian Charge d'Affaires V. Chkhikvishvili in Washington contains nothing which would indicate the likelihood of a complication of relations between the United States and Russia and there are no calls for any specific actions. Furthermore, it has emerged that yesterday President Clinton turned down the calls by some U.S. legislators for an immediate reduction of U.S. aid to Russia in connection with the Ames affair. Pointing to the gravity of "the espionage affair," he stressed that cooperation with Russia in restricting the proliferation of nuclear weapons and support for democracy and reforms in Russia are important U.S. strategic interests. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev yesterday urged that the "Ames problem" should not be politicized. All this inspires the hope that political relations between Russia and the United States will not be aggravated this time and that a new Caribbean crisis will not loom on the horizon.
