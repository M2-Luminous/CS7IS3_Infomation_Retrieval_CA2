The voters of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] increased by 2 percent, which is not statistically significant, but it means that they have caught up with the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. In the case of the other parties, the changes are even smaller. Support for Fidesz and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] has not changed (9 and 5 percent), while support for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] increased by 1 percent (to 7 and 6 percent). Based on public opinion polls of recent months, it can be said that the leading group of parties has become stabilized. The six parties that gained seats in parliament in 1990 also have the biggest chance to do so in 1994. The support level for the non- parliamentary parties is around 1 or 2 percent -- such as, the Workers' Party, the Agrarian Federation, the Entrepreneurs' Party, the Repbulic Party, the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], and the United Smallholders Party [EKGP] -- or does not even reach this minimum -- for example, the National Democratic Federation [NDSZ] and the Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP]. More people became certain about their preferences as the parliamentary candidates became known, party lists were published, and the campaign became more intensive. While in the second half of March, 40 percent of the citizens could not or did not want to vote; this went down to 34 percent in April. At the moment, 64 percent of the electors promise definite participation, and a large majority of them also named the party they would probably vote for. In the month before the elections, we can attribute major importance to this group. They are the most likely participants of the 8 May elections. (These people say they would vote for a party or deputy "this Sunday.") At the moment, 49 percent of the adult population belongs to the group of potential voters, 5 percent more than in the second half of March. The members of this group have a higher than average schooling level, and most of them are middle-aged rather than young or old. In this group, the MSZP has a large advantage; it enjoys almost four-tenths of the support of active electors. It is the SZDSZ that managed to increase the number of its voters among the potential voters, thus claiming second place, while the MDF has the third largest active support. At the moment, 15 percent of the electors -- more than 1 million people -- consider themselves definite voters but do not know which party to vote for. Elderly people and Budapest citizens are more typical among them than the average. The parties can still increase their number of voters from this group; however, we can only approach their electoral orientation indirectly from their negative sentiments. It follows that those parties have a smaller chance of gaining the support of these people, for which more of them show antagonistic feelings. In this sense, the MDF can be the most pessimistic because antagonistic feelings are shown toward this party by most people (21 percent). Quite a few people also spoke negatively about the FKGP [11 percent). From the group that is certain about participating in the voting but uncertain about the choice, 7 percent named the Workers' Party and the MSZP as parties worth voting for, and 5 percent mentioned MIEP. An increasing number of the population believes that, according to the political power structure, the MSZP has the biggest chance to win the elections. At the end of March, every fourth elector assumed that the Socialists would win the elections and every third believed this in April. The survey was carried out 8-18 April 1994. One thousand people who represent the country's population over the age of 14 were questioned. Of the 1,000 questioned, 936 are eligible to vote. The group to be examined was Hungarian citizens over the age of 18 who have a permanent address in Hungary. The structure of this group and that of the surveyed people correspond in age, gender, and type of dwelling. The data received in the public opinion survey can at the most deviate by 4 percent if every citizen who is eligible to vote had been asked; however, the results arrived at in the survey have the biggest likelihood.
