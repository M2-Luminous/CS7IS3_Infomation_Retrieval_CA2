This was revealed by Kim Chae-ho, who defected recently to the South, during a press conference held at the Seoul Press Center this afternoon. Before he defected, Mr. Kim was the head of a work team at the Sanamchon Chemical Complex, a uranium refinery plant under the North Korean Ministry of Nuclear Energy. Mr. Kim said North Korea began to develop nuclear weapons in 1986 and was able to produce plutonium in 1988. Mr. Kim, who escaped from North Korea on 2 February because the North Korean authorities became aware of the fact that he misappropriated $5,000 in foreign currency, said plutonium has been continuously produced in the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. He claimed that although he does not know whether North Korea has a nuclear weapon, North Korea has attained a considerable technological standard for the development of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, brothers Hwang Kwang-chol and Hwang Kwang-il said they crossed the border to China last June because they were caught stealing food and lived a life of those who enter China illegally. Elder brother Hwang Kwang-chol, 20, said that because of the haphazard food rationing in North Korea, stealing food is a frequent practice there.
