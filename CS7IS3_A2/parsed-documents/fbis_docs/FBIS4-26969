Jiang made the call during a week-long tour through east China's Fujian Province. Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, stressed that as a big and the most populous country in the world, China has to be self-sufficient or even more so in grain supply. He urged greater efforts to guarantee sufficient crop growing areas, grain output and reserves. He called special attention to this problem in the developed coastal areas where the industrial and service sectors are developing rapidly. On state-owned enterprises, the president said that the public sector is the mainstay of the national economy. State-owned enterprises, particularly large and medium-sized ones, have played a leading role in the development of a socialist market economy, he said, adding that the current difficulties are very complicated and they should not be made a pretext of losing confidence in them or regarding them as a "burden". He urged all government departments to devote their main energy to the development of the public sector of industry. Although China is encouraging the development of the private sector, including foreign-funded enterprises, he said, it is after all playing a supplementary role in the national economy. He warned that whatever reform measures are taken to deepen the reform and transform the operational mechanism of the state-owned enterprises, everything must be done to ensure that state property maintains and increases its value. No loss of state property should be allowed in the course of reform, Jiang stressed. Jiang stressed the necessity of the policy of letting part of the areas to get prosperous first while persisting in the goal of common prosperity. He encouraged the developed coastal areas to help with the development in the central and western regions by strengthening cooperation and providing advanced technology and management experience so as to gradually achieve common prosperity, which, he said, is an important condition for safeguarding social security and consolidating national unity. Jiang also urged Fujian Province to enhance economic and trade ties with Taiwan and contribute more to the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
