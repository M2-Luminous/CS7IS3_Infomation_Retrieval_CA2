All primary applicants must submit a completed CD&hyph;511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying.'' Prospective participants (as defined at 15 CFR part 26, section 105) are subject to 15 CFR part 26, ``Nonprocurement Debarment and Suspension'' and the related section of CD&hyph;511 applies. Grantees (as defined at 15 CFR part 26, section 605) are subject to 15 CFR part 26, subpart F, ``Government-wide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace (Grants)'' and the related section of CD&hyph;511 applies. Persons (as defined at 15 CFR part 28, section 105) are subject to the lobbying provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, ``Limitation on use of appropriated funds to influence certain federal contracting and financial transactions,'' and the lobbying section of CD&hyph;511 applies to applications/bids for grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts for more than $100,000, and loans and loan guarantees for more than $150,000, or the single family maximum mortgage limit for affected programs, whichever is greater. Any applicant that has paid or will pay for lobbying using any funds must submit an SF&hyph;LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities,'' as required under 15 CFR part 28, Appendix B. 7. Recipients shall require applicants/bidders for subgrants, contracts, subcontracts, or other lower tier covered transactions at any tier under the award to submit, if applicable, a completed CD&hyph;512, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transactions and Lobbying'' and a completed SF&hyph;LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.'' CD&hyph;512's are intended for the use of recipients and should not be transmitted to the Department of Commerce. SF&hyph;LLL's submitted by any tier recipients or subrecipient should be submitted to the Department of Commerce in accordance with the instructions contained in the award document. 8. Unsatisfactory performance of an applicant under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding. 9. Costs incurred by an applicant prior to an award being made are incurred solely at the applicant's own risk. Applicants are advised that notwithstanding any verbal assurance that they may receive, there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to reimburse pre-award costs. 10. If an applicant is selected for an award, the Department of Commerce has no obligation to provide any additional future funding in connection with that award. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the total discretion of the Department of Commerce. 11. All applicants who are private or public non-profit organizations or associations are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal whether any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of, or are presently facing, criminal charges such as fraud, theft, or perjury, or are involved in other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty or financial integrity. Classification This notice of availability of financial assistance is issued under the authority of title I of Public Law No. 103&hyph;75, section 202(a)(5) and (c) of the International Travel Act of 1961, as amended, and 42 U.S.C. 3151. Because this notice relates to grants, benefits, or contracts, section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)(5 U.S.C. 553) does not require that notice and an opportunity for comment be given for this rule or that its effective date be delayed for 30 days. Since notice and an opportunity to comment is not required by the APA or by any other law, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and none was prepared. The Department of Commerce has determined that the Federal assistance covered by this notice will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, no draft or final Environmental Impact Statement has been or will be prepared. This notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. All information collection requirements under this notice are consistent with those covered in Office of Management and Budget Circular A&hyph;110. Leslie R. Doggett, Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;208 Filed 1&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;11&hyph;1
