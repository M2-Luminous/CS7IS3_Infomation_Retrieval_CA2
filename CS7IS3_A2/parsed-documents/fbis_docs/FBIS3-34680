The opposition Iraqi National Congress said that Husayn Kamil, 36, was undergoing emergency treatment for a brain tumour. Medical officials would not divulge what was wrong with him, but confirmed he had been admitted to hospital. He holds the title "special advisor to the president" with the rank of minister, and reports directly to Saddam. He was minister of defence, and took over at the industry ministry last September. He is head of the Military Industrial Organisation, a key post overseeing arms production, and is one of the most powerful men in the Iraqi government. Despite his relatively youth, he was regarded as the father of Iraq's chemical, bacteriological, ballistics and nuclear weapons programmes, which have been destroyed under UN resolutions following the Gulf war three years ago. He is married to Saddam's eldest daughter, Raghad.
