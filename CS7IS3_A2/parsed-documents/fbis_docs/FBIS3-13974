Mutual accusations and allegations followed by counter-allegations have filled the two neighbors with enmity toward one another. Pakistan is even more over-heated. A nation-wide strike is being observed to show solidarity with Kashmiri militants. This fruitless effort is like cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. In reaction, the Youth Congress [Indian Congress (I)] has held demonstrations. Demonstrations have been held near the Kashmir and Punjab borders [with Pakistan]. In both countries, these demonstrations have the possibility of flaring into violence and security forces may have to use force to contain these demonstrations. Mutual suspicions are escalating and could become explosive. When there is a halt in understanding between India and Pakistan, the increasing tensions in the Subcontinent become very worrisome. Everyone knows the basic cause of the Kashmir crisis. After the separatists became involved in terrorism, the situation became more complex. It is no secret that these terrorists have received training, weapons and shelter from Pakistan. Pakistan wants all of Kashmir as its own. But Bhutto's intentions do not match those of the militants. Their dream is of an independent Kashmir. Consequently, Benazir's wishes are unlikely to be fulfilled. In reality, Kashmir is an inseparable part of India and its own internal affair. Benazir cannot take Kashmir by force. This is why she is so busy making a fuss about it everywhere. She is busy raising the subject at international forums and is not particular about where. For example, she tried to raise the Kashmir issue at an economic summit in Davos. It was farcical. People did not come to Davos to hear her lecture about Kashmir. She tried to present the Kashmir problem as an issue of concern to the entire Muslim world. Many Muslim countries, however, regard Kashmir as an internal matter of India. Perhaps a more important point, though, is that the Muslim world is divided. Unlike the middle ages in which jihads were conducted in the name of religion, national interests are now paramount. When Pakistan was created as an Islamic nations, half of India's Muslims remained behind. They accepted the secularist Indian Republic. The Islamic community in Pakistan has been unable to build national unity on the basis of Islam. Was not Bangladesh created on differences of language and culture? [passage omitted on separatist tendencies in Pakistan] Now Pakistan is raising Kashmir in international forums. There are supporters in the U.S. administration. The Kashmir problem is complex. The common man's life is full of uncertainty due to terrorists clashing with security forces. There has been suffering on all sides. Internationalization, however, is not the solution. Making Kashmir an Islamic nation is not the solution. Benazir Bhutto, living in a glass house herself, should not throw stones. *
