This statement comes 10 days before the European summit in Corfu, where the process of the EU's institutional reform will be launched, culminating in the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996. According to Alain Lamassoure, this will require a new referendum. The Corfu summit, Alain Juppe stated for his part, ought to launch the preparatory work for this institutional meeting. The Council of Ministers, the Commission, and Parliament will be asked to draw up an assessment of the implementation over a little more than one year of the Treaty on European Union. These reports will serve as the raw material for a "think tank" which will be created in mid-1995 to prepare for the Intergovernmental Conference the following year. No Details on Future Projects Yesterday, Alain Lamassoure seemed sensitive to the problem of "guiding" the European programs on large networks, which, in his opinion, rank as the "third biggest common policy exercise," alongside agricultural policy and structural policy. It is a program to which the Twelve will solemnly reaffirm their attachment at the Corfu summit on 24 and 25 June. However, they will limit themselves to approving the 11 priority projects for the construction of major transport infrastructures and the eight energy projects, the list of which was confirmed in Luxembourg yesterday by their foreign ministers. Alain Juppe, apparently anxious to correct the impression given by the relative modesty of these initial investments, stressed the "determination" of the Twelve to implement the whole of the program envisaged. The same tone was taken by his European affairs colleague: "The Brussels decision to spend ECU20 billion per year has not been called into question," Alain Lamassoure said. The fact remains that no details have been given on the additional projects which might be implemented to move from an overall investment of less than ECU32 billion to the ECU200 billion mentioned at the Brussels summit six months ago. However, with regard to a program aimed at speeding up and consolidating economic growth, nobody can deny that the overall effect is not the same in the two cases. [passage omitted]
