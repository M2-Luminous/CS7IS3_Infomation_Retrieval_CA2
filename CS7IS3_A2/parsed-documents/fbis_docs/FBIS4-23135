In an attempt to blame the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] for the disruption of the UN relief program at a time when the UN Security Council is about to meet and when U.S. senators are in Angola, government forces have been instructed by their General Staff to resume clashes in sensitive areas like Malange and Bie [Cuito]. 2.

On 27 May 1994, government Su-22's and Su-25 bombed our positions, using 48 bombs of 250 kg each.
