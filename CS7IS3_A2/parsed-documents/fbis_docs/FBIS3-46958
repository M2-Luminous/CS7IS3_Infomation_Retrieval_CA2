Just ask Maj. Gen. Bernard Sandoz, chief Swiss member on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), who is three years and five months into an assigment that secludes him in barracks in the middle of no-man's land in the truce village of Panmunjom on the dividing line between South and North Korea. "We have to accept other channels of dialogue. They (South and North Korea, the United Nations Command [UNC]) don't need us so much," Sandoz tells reporters from YONHAP, the first Korean journalists to meet him inside the Swiss barracks. The commission was powerful when it was formed at the end of the 1950-1953 Korean war. Purpose -- to supervise, investigate and control so that neither side of Korea will increase military tension in violation of the Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the war. Members -- Czechoslovakia and Poland picked by North Korea, and Sweden and Switzerland chosen by South Korea. It had five inspection teams in both halves of Korea to check every ingoing and outgoing ship, aircraft and train to prevent arms smuggling and espionage. "In 1954, 1955, 1956, there were no discussions (between South and North Korea)," Sandoz recalls. "We were the only ones to be able to cross the border freely. We would tell each other what the other thinks. "The main job was to make contact, make them understand the viewpoint of the neighbor." It was the NNSC that persuaded South and North Korea to sit down for informal, secret talks at the outbreak of the Pueblo incident in 1968, when North Korea captured a U.S. spy boat and its crew. It was in the NNSC lounge that the two Koreas held sports and students talks, and here that they exchanged the agreement on a non- nuclear Korean peninsula. "This is proof that it (NNSC) is still useful," says Sandoz. But NNSC history tells of numerous ups and downs. Demonstrators opposing the Armistice Agreement rallied against the commission and some people even sent bombs to its barracks. All inspection teams were recalled, and staff drastically reduced from 96 to about 10 at the Swiss commission. Recent years saw more disappointments. Czechoslovakia left the commission after North Korea insisted that its breakup into separate states had invalidated its status. The seat has remained vacant since April 10, 1993. North Korea is yet to name a successor since it "found no one who can give the assurance they will be neutral," according to Sandoz. North Korea refused to recognize the appointment of the first South Korean as chief of the UNC side of the Military Armistice Commission in March 1991, and the next May, when the NNSC chose to remain neutral and not pressure the UNC to revoke the appointment, North Korea cut off all official contact with the commission. "It's very frustrating to be here and not be able to fulfill our mission completely because of the boycott," the 58-year-old general tells the YONHAP reporters. There are limitations to how much the commission can do right now because North Korea insists on talking only with the United States. "The NNSC is at any time willing to mediate, but the problem is both sides have interest to negotiate directly, North Korea directly with the United States, South Korea directly with North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) directly with North Korea without any intermediary," he explains. Sandoz travels to Pyongyang and other North Korean cities every few months at unofficial invitation from his counterparts there and China, a signatory of the Korean Armistice Agreement. He was invited to Pyongyang for President Kim Il-song's 80th birthday celebration in April 1992 and went through North Korea last year on his way to and back from Tibet and China. There is no telling when Sandoz will return to his home country and resume his diplomatic career. The post is for three years, but his stay in Panmunjom was extended at the lack of a successor. But he is sure about one thing, that NNSC has to stay until the Korean Armistice Agreement is replaced by a peace regime. "We believe strongly we are still useful because we are part of the Armistice Agreement, the only legal base," he says. North Korea wants the commission dissolved, but South Korea and the UNC say otherwise. "As long as they have different views, we stay. This is the official position of NNSC and the members' governments," Sandoz says.
