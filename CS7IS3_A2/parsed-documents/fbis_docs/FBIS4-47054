Noncorrelation in the definitions of principle concepts is leading to a situation whereby the partners are speaking seemingly different languages. Moreover, the existing classifiers for the most part no longer meet even intra-Russian requirements. The changeover of the Russian accounting system to a language which is understood throughout the world has become the primary task of the latest development of the Center for Economic Market Conditions under the Russian Government and the Center for Economic Classifications, the "All-Russian Classifier of Types of Economic Activity, Products, and Services" (OKDP). Its electronic version (12 Mb) went to the main federal economic departments yesterday. [Begin boxed material] Basic Problems Resolved on the Basis of the All-Russian Classifier of Types of Economic Activity, Products, and Services --Organization of "horizontal ties" in the production sphere and the sphere of services between producers and consumers of products and services. --Provision of strict and precise functioning of the system of taxation, investments, and crediting; --Creation of regional and interregional information systems of economic management; --Creation of systems for cataloging products; --Creation of a system of state registers of enterprises with correlation by types of economic activity implemented, products produced, or services provided; --Formulation of a system of "electronic marketing" of products and services; --Realization of a set of accounting functions within the framework of the system of state statistics. [End boxed material] At the present time there are three basic economic classifiers in effect in Russia: the OKONKh--the All-Union Classifier of Sectors of the National Economy; the OKP--the All-Russian Classifier of Industrial and Agricultural Products, and the OKSP--the All-Union Classifier of Building Products. The development of a new classifier is the first serious result of work within the framework of the State Program for Changeover to the System of Accounting and Statistics Accepted in World Practice, which was ratified by the Russian parliament in 1992. It is noteworthy that the principle adopted for the OKDP is not the experience "of a number of countries with consideration of Russian specifics" (up to this time the consideration of these specifics has, as a rule, not brought anything good), but rather the internationally accepted classifiers. The organization of the classification groupings of the OKDP is based on the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities and the Central Products Classification, which have been ratified by the UN Statistical Commission. The operational introduction of a new universal classifier will entail an entire series of significant changes. The state system of registers of enterprises will be changed, and comprehensive data bases will be created based on it. Specialists point out that the information gathered in these data bases will have very significant commercial value--it will make it possible to locate business partners more cheaply and accurately. It will also be of considerable importance for taxation. For example, the absolute majority of benefits provided by Russian tax legislation is associated with the type of activity engaged in by the payer of one tax or another. Only with the aid of a classifier is it possible to determine precisely whether or not the payer is entitled to this benefit. The OKDP is being introduced by Goskomstat [RF State Committee on Statistics] into statistical practice as of 1 July 1994 (Gosstandard [RF State Committee on Standardization, Metrology, and Certification] has already sanctioned its introduction as of 1 January of this year). It is presumed that at first the OKDP will operate in parallel with the classifier of industrial and building products. After the development and introduction of a second version of the OKDP (proposed date--1 January 1996), the entire set of current classifiers (except for the TN VED [commodity nomenclature list for foreign economic activity], which is associated with the OKDP by a conversion table) will be repealed. This moment may be called the final unification of world and Russian statistical standards.
