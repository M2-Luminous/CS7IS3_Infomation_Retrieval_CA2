But the high emotions in the newspapers and on television and radio, fueled by Viktor Linnik and his team, are showing no signs of abating (in particular, yesterday's issue of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA carried a manifestly biased article entitled "Viktor Linnik Has Yet To Occupy the Editor's Chair"). But the crux of the matter is in general terms simple: In early February the PRAVDA collective passed a vote of no confidence in the then Editor Viktor Linnik. It did so because the newspaper's leader was unable to ensure its regular publication and because an atmosphere of uncertainty about the future had been created in the editorial office. But the main reason was that the editor and his comrades-in-arms were ready to close the newspaper down for an indefinite period, which would have caused -- and already was causing -- irreparable damage to PRAVDA's prestige and would have jeopardized its continuing existence. However, on 6 April, Linnik was reinstated in his post by a court ruling -- clearly errors in the organization of the collective's assembly played their part here. All right, PRAVDA's workers, as law-abiding people, agreed to implement the court judgment. But the very first steps toward reinstating the "chief" caused unrest in the collective. It turned out that Linnik was still prepared to close the newspaper down for a long while and he announced that the paper had split from its publisher, heedless of the damage that such a step could cause his editorial associates. Orders, including orders on staffing issues, were signed one after another, without any consultation at all with the editorial office, which under the editorial charter has the final say. The board of the journalists' organization then decided to call -- strictly in accordance with the editorial charter -- a combined meeting of the journalists' organization and the journalists' collective. It considered the question of the chief editor. Having agreed to implement the court ruling, the collective deemed it essential to hear Linnik. But the latter refused to attend the meeting or talks with his comrades. Linnik was released from the duties of chief editor by an overwhelming majority of votes (there were only four votes against). At that same meeting Aleksandr Ilin, a PRAVDA worker for 20 years, who had run the collective for the previous two months, was elected chief editor of PRAVDA. During that time 40 issues of the newspaper had ben published and it had developed a good working rhythm. That is why a decision in favor of Ilin was made, not because of any fiat from abroad, as certain "patriots" claim. It only remains to say that PRAVDA's editorial office is producing a newspaper, and our readers, judging by their responses, hold it in high esteem. But some former ambitious colleagues are doing all they can to damage PRAVDA by distorting the truth of the matter, operating on the principle that it does not matter if PRAVDA is in a bad way as long as they are okay. You will agree that a chief editor who fights for his job against the will of a collective which has voted him out looks strange. Perhaps it is time for our colleagues on other publications to realize that by their articles they are supporting not PRAVDA the newspaper (this hardly worries them) but a contender for the editorial chair?
