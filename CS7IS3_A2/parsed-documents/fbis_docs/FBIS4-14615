An inquiry was opened on the reasons for the assault by some 1,000 protestors, following a call to action by Tbilisi militia chief David Zeikidze, with explanations ranging from a personal vendetta to a possible coup attempt against President Eduard Shevardnadze. A parliamentary spokesman said the protestors, some of them armed, were opposing the national assembly's appointment of Shota Kviraia as new interior minister a few months after he was first named by Shevardnadze. The incident could also be linked to December's fierce fight between the ministries of defence and security, when Kviraia was acting as deputy minister of security. That conflict sprung from the chaos reigning in the country, which is bursting with armed militia, and policy differences over the rebel autonomous republic of Abkhazia. According to an AFP journalist in the parliament, Shevardnadze was still in the building attending a meeting Thursday afternoon. A quarrel broke out in a corridor when the president, surrounded by bodyguards, tried to calm Zeikidze and his men after they had hit a deputy, the journalist said. Access to the parliament was blocked and security was tight throughout the capital Thursday afternoon, the anniversary of a 1991 referendum on Georgian independence and the birthday of former president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who fled office in January 1992 and died last December. Demonstrations were expected, in particular around Gamsakhurdia's former home on a hill above the capital. Security forces were concerned that any protest could spread down into the city centre.
