In light of our province's actual conditions, in addition to the 20 items of goods and services whose prices and charges should be subject to overall price control as stipulated by the State Council, that is, wheat flour, polished long-grained nonglutinous rice, polished round-grained nonglutinous rice, edible plant oils, meat, eggs, milk, salt, sugar, soy sauce, detergents, coal for domestic use, liquefied petroleum gas, gas for domestic use, rents, running water charges, tuition fees and extras, child-care fees, medical care fees, and in-city public transport fares, the provincial government decided to put the prices of medicines under control. Price bureaus of various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, counties, and cities are encouraged to work out lists of additional specific items to be put under price control and report them to local governments for implementation. Since the prices of our province's 21 items subject to price control have mostly been liberalized, to ensure the active control of commodity prices by means of price control, the provincial government has worked out specific stipulations on the division of authority over and measures for price control. It is learned that price control over the 21 items of residents' daily necessities and service charges has been carried out in different ways in accordance with the degree of impact on residents and the existing price management. These are mainly monitoring and guiding the trend of commodity prices by regulating the filing system, collecting information about commodity price changes and promulgating rules and regulations, providing information for macrodecisionmaking, introducing buying and selling price differential control and wholesale and retail price differential control to the circulation links of some commodities, and applying moderate administrative intervention in the behavior of increasing the prices of some commodities by introducing a report-for-approval system at the provincial and city levels or adopting interim price limiting measures. The provincial government stressed: Price control should be carried out at the same time as the enterprises' decisionmaking power to set their own prices is respected. All producing and operating enterprises should properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. In setting their prices, they should take it as a prerequisite to maintain market and social stability and rigorously standardize their own price readjusting behavior. At the same time, they have the duty to report readjustments of the prices of residents' basic daily necessities and service charges to their superior price departments for approval and recording in accordance with state stipulations. Subordinate governments also have the duty to report readjustments of the prices of basic daily necessities and service charges to their superior governments.
