We were (and still are) in agreement that an authentic pacification can only be achieved if the international community and the United States keep their promises to the former combatants in a timely manner. However, the fulfillment of promises made to the negotiating parties seems far away. The Peace Agreements were clear: Direct measures should be adopted to guarantee the full exercise of the demobilized personnel's civil and political rights when they moved from the mountains and garrisons to the country's civilian life. This implied the commitment of the United Nations, the U.S. Government, and the so-called "friends of the secretary general" to help ease the reentry of soldiers and guerrillas into civilian life by giving them the means to be productive within a totally legal framework. The government demobilized more than 30,000 soldiers prior to the scheduled timetable. The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] also did its part (or so it is believed) by dismantling its "guerrilla army" (although we have always doubted that they dismantled their "people's army." However, it seems that others were the ones that failed. It is a lesson we must not forget. The "offers" of aid were very similar to an astute ambush by the United Nations on the negotiating parties, which forced the latter to acquiesce "to everything." Both the United Nations and the Bush administration wanted to get rid of the Salvadoran problem without caring that this nation would be torn by the senseless criminal violence that would emerge from those agreements. Both parties (government and guerrilla) made the mistake of putting their faith in the United Nations and the international community, which, of course, have helped in terms of minor issues but have not confronted any problem in depth. Two years and a few months have elapsed since "peace" came to El Salvador, and poverty is increasing among the myriad demobilized and uprooted people who cannot acquire jobs, land, or anything else. The paranoid attitude of these people makes one's hair stand on end and threatens to prompt new outbreaks of subversive violence. There is an organization of former soldiers that has already seized the National Assembly with everybody in it, including the president of the Republic. They have come in significant numbers to the doors of the Defense Ministry several times to demand war reparations. On the side of the former guerrillas, it is no secret that there are bands of armed former guerrillas in combat formation and which are patrolling the north of Morazan and Chalatenango (in the north and northeast sections of the country), or that squads of former guerrillas are stationed in the Santa Ana volcano (to the west), the most important coffee region in Salvadoran territory. These are not good omens for peace. The key point, however, must be in the hands of somebody in the U.S. State Department. Both the government and the former General Command of the FMLN must speak plainly to the people. They should, if there are no hidden designs, say that the ethical responsibility belongs to the United Nations and the U.S. Government, which, on other issues such as legal reforms, land distribution, and police matters, continue to project their imperialist shadow to push legislators against the wall. The astute international policy of the new UN Secretary General's Office and the Clinton administration is the one of Pontius Pilate: They are washing their hands. Both apparently are asserting with their attitude that this problem has been handled by other people and that neither the United Nations nor the United States can afford to keep these commitments at this time. The skepticism we originally voiced when criticizing the Peace Agreements has turned into a reality: The Salvadoran peace process has served to quiet the rifles and has allowed "commanders" of the former guerrilla to reach very lofty positions in national politics; nevertheless, regrettably, the people with the lowest incomes on both sides are the ones who have been sacrificed. Nobody in El Salvador has the power to change this picture. Perhaps, when the "contras" and the "recontras" get organized -- as is already being envisioned on the horizon -- the international community will turn its eyes again to this poor nation. But, for now, we can only wait for the new pressures that will surely arise -- this, by what we can see, will occur before the end of the year -- after the new government is sworn in on 1 June. The Salvadoran case is unique. Suddenly the "commanders" of the Marxist insurgents are "very chummy" with the democratic parties. There are 21 FMLN deputies who are living like small bourgeoisie, enjoying the sweetness of the "exploitive" capitalism that they once vowed to destroy. In only two years of political participation, most of the rebel "command staff" members are now wealthy businessmen. In terms of the demobilized people, however, the situation is pathetic. Thousands are literally dying of hunger, and there is an even greater number of refugees and uprooted people who have not found sanctuary from their woes. After 14 years, those people who once believed in "the revolution" are poorer than before. The war destroyed their humble homes, which admittedly were paltry, but, at least, they owned them. Now they are nomads and cannot feed their children. The same is true for hundreds of people who were uprooted by the war and remain homeless. If this is "the peace" promoted by the United Nations and the U.S. Government, we do not reject the possibility that -- in less than a decade -- El Salvador will be entangled in strife once again.
