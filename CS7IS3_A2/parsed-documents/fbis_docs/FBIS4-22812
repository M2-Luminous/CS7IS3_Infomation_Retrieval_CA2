Government divestment should be seen as a process of transition to variety in forms of property, to new management forms and to entrepreneurship as a means of creating a dynamic economy by increasing the stimulus to work. Why has commerce moved to the forefront of privatization, where it must be acted upon decisively? The reason is that no movement toward the market is possible until the system of bureaucratic distribution of the produced product is broken. For long years a great deal of concern was expressed about how to "correctly" distribute, whom to take away from, and whom to give to. This system of distributing everything is one of the supporting members of the command system and its supplementary underground economy. Time has shown that government trade is basically unable to create a real stimulus for the producer, to enliven turnover between the city and the village or to stimulate goods procurement operations. The economy was built on laws of direct distribution, without effective reverse ties along all of the parameters of the national economy. However, product quality, abundance of goods, and conscientiousness in trade -- all of this cannot be subject to dictates but develops out of economic conditions. The consumer-purchaser has one eternal and inalienable right -- the right to make choices in the market, "voting" with his wallet. This is an important feature of an individual's political freedom. At the same time, the distribution system turned out to be a very costly operation because of the need to support a huge apparatus for goods distribution at all levels and in all systems (in planning organs, in ministries, in soviets of all levels, and so forth). It would be appropriate to note that from the very beginning the distribution system was predisposed to abuses, speculation, and corruption. Speculation itself is the own child of the government monopoly in consumer goods production and trade. It is also exceptionally important that the market economy allows the country to become an integral part of the world economy and to make use of the advantages of such a division of labor. To do this we must have general business laws, the freedom to trade goods, a stable currency and, most importantly, a legally-based civil society. Privatization of commerce, together with other measures, is being called upon to radically alter the situation -- to remove the administrative superstructure, to open the way to competition, and to eliminate ongoing shortages, which were artificially created even when they did not exist. The distribution system -- the government monopoly in production, distribution and trade, is to be replaced by a social-market mechanism and free trade capable of balancing supply and demand in the market. This is not a goal but a means. The social role of commerce is being strengthened. Protecting the interests of the buyer is a strategic path towards the development of trade. Trade is the branch in which we can expect the most rapid and radical changes in property relations and a high level of privatization. In Moscow over 90 percent of stores, public nutrition enterprises and consumer service enterprises have been privatized. This is a large number, considerably more than in any other region in the country. The process of "small" privatization has become irreversible and evidently will be completed, for all practical purposes, in the near future. As we know, Moscow took the initiative in privatizing enterprises in the service sphere from the very beginning, when a normative base did not yet exist. A considerable amount has been accomplished. Things are always difficult for the first to do something. Everyone criticizes Moscow-style "small" privatization for being carried out in haste, for the things that have not yet been done, and for the things that have already been completed. Were mistakes made? Yes, they were, and some of them were extensive and basic. But not all the criticism that continues to this day is conclusive, well-grounded or convincing. Much of the criticism is slander and intrigue. People write and say things that assume that privatization has not yielded anything, that trade points are "growing fat," and that services to the population have deteriorated. Everything becomes known by drawing comparisons. Let us recall the fall of 1991 -- the complete breakdown of the market, empty stores, demeaning lines, and a sense of helplessness. There were many predictions of hunger, cold, and revolts. These predictions did not materialize; the market is being reestablished. It is a truism that to properly understand what occurred and is occurring in trade, to make a well-grounded assessment of privatization, one should use as a basis the fact that the apple (trade) does not fall far from the tree (economy). Trade is a slice of the condition of society, its barometer. There is no reason to hope for a "good" barometer reading when the weather is miserable. In trade the diseases of the past and the mistakes of the present are manifest as nowhere else. Today we can finally say that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The main character in the market is His Highness Goods. The shortage of consumer goods was the "birthmark" of our entire history during the existence of the command-administrative system. As theoretical and practical weapons we had the dogma that consumer demand must gradually outstrip goods production and the supply of these goods to the population. In other words, under socialism demand could never be satisfied, and the tormenting word "deficit" was ours for eternity. The concept of "real income" long ago became relative, because it is impossible to name a product group for which demand would be fully met. According to orienting figures, during successful 1970 (some sigh about it even now), 20 percent, and in 1978 -- already 53 percent of growth in savings were the result of unsatisfied demand. The pumping in of money unsupported by goods became a flood that drowned trade completely in subsequent years. The hope that a consumer could purchase inexpensive goods, even if he had to wait in line, was less and less justified. Not everything could be bought by far, but the population was wittingly issued depreciated money. The monetary income of citizens systematically outstripped increases in the total volume of commodity turnover and paid services. At the same time there was a concealed growth in government retail prices, and the quality of goods decreased while prices remained the same. This entire shortage of goods was not due to the country's poverty; after all, it was inferior to none in military strength. It was the fruit of certain choices and ideologies, i.e., the realization of the postulate that in contrast to capitalism, our demand must outstrip the production of goods and push it forward, and this, they said, was the advantage of our state. The crisis within the system led right to the collapse of production, and the shortage became most urgent. A year or two ago the shelves of many stores were totally empty. Today, although not everywhere, most shelves are filled with goods of the kind the consumer hardly ever saw on the open market even during the best of times. Enterprises have appeared that are not inferior to the best contemporary models in terms of both quantity of products as well as of commercial technology and organization and services to the consumer. The most characteristic features include complete economic independence of enterprises, their direct ties with suppliers, rejection of the practice of state funding with its accompanying trail of paperwork and misappropriation of assets and time from a large number of workers, and finally, the appearance of new stores on the level of world standards. Take GUM [Government department store], for example, which recently celebrated its centennial. Its collective is pursuing the goal of creating a world-class store. No, this is not at all an attempt to "sell GUM to foreigners lock, stock and barrel," as some "specialists" claim. The goal is a different one: stockholders are looking for and finding partners who are multiplying their efforts to organize the most modern trade enterprise. Large wholesale trading associations such as Master-Lider, Olbi, Roditi, Ofis-Klub and many others are making themselves known. The trade enterprises of many countries, including Moskva-Makdonalds, Moskovskaya Pishcha, the Russian French MOS-Danon SP [Specialized enterprise], the Russian-German Taki-Moskva SP, and others, are operating successfully in the capital. The old MacDonald's restaurant and its two younger brothers are especially popular. The interest in expanding joint commercial operations is evident not only in the capital, but in other countries as well. The fruits of cooperation include better quality services and the introduction of new technologies that are naturally based on mutual interests and advantages. Would you like to see with your own eyes stores in the capital that are commercial jewels in the fullest sense of the word? Then visit the Novoarbat or the Tverskoy food stores. They have a wide variety of fresh products. The stores belong to stockholders and do without middlemen. For this reason, the proportion of trading costs in the price of the product at the Tverskoy store, for example, is a little over 11 percent, which is considerably lower than in any other. Having begun 4 years ago with a lease, the enterprise is increasing turnover, having now reached the billion-ruble-per-month mark. The bank joined the food store as co-owner. And another feature: Suppliers from near and faraway places abroad trust their goods to the store. About 30 percent of goods turnover involves products that are sold on consignment, i.e., with payment going to the supplier after the goods are sold to the population. There is a considerable number of such stores. Unfortunately, however, there are many more that one is grieved to look at, where the operating principle is "I do whatever I want" and where trade rules are flouted. Intoxicated by the newly-received freedom and by the opportunity to make quick and large profits, such trade "points" are moving towards abuse without concern for their own development. Every second buyer in such enterprises is cheated in the weighing of the product or during the payment transaction. Often the items for sale are of poor quality, and sometimes they are downright dangerous to one's health. These, however, are remnants, and we will bring order here. However, let us return to privatization. If Moscow were not in a hurry to complete this work, and had it continued to receive goods according to "plan," and allocated from "funds," the picture today would be lamentable. Government deliveries planned last year and at the beginning of this year, have fallen through completely. The capital has received and today is receiving fewer than half of the promised deliveries. About 55 percent of the food products consumed by Muscovites were procured and delivered by new entrepreneurial structures. For some industrial goods almost 100 percent of goods are supplied in this manner. These are the first fruits of rejuvenated trading and its contribution to supplying a city of many millions of people. Let us explore another aspect of the question -- the social structure of goods turnover. In terms of forms of property this structure is changing rapidly and quite considerably. For the first time, Russian consumers put less money into state trade than into non-government trade. Today the share of the former already comprises only 46 percent. The proportion of private trading is 40 percent and of consumer cooperatives -- about 14 percent. In terms of privatization pace, retail trade is the leader within the domestic economy - 40,000 stores, halls, cafeterias and cafes are in private hands today. This is only 8 percent, which does not seem to be a large number. Nevertheless, this small proportion of privatized enterprises sells as much as the entire state trade, and if we also consider turnover in consumer cooperatives this figure is even greater. The state store is inferior not only in goods turnover but in profitability as well -- in private "points" it is higher by a factor of 1.5, and in terms of effectiveness of expenditures (the relationship of profits to circulation expenses) -- by a factor of 2. Of course, retail prices are higher by a factor of 1.5 in private shops than in state stores. However, an enormous distribution apparatus associated with the practice of funding, the writing of orders to receive goods, and so forth, has been liquidated. As a result, total volume of goods turnover in 1993 exceeded the preceding year by 4 percent. Note that there was an increase and not a decrease. The natural use of basic foodstuffs -- meat and meat products, eggs, potatoes, vegetables, sugar and confectionery items -- also increased. But let us be fair. Some problems are solved, others remain and new ones are developing. Former state and municipal enterprises were usually privatized in the capital in the form of property of labor collectives. Today only 30 percent of them have purchase-sales contracts and attestations of the right to ownership. This means that almost two-thirds of privatized enterprises have "become stuck" between earth and sky -- between private and state. Practically not a single one of them has, as of yet, a legally formulated document related to the right to land use (place where the trade object is located). Thus, on the one hand, most stores are considered owners; on the other hand, strictly speaking their collectives occupy the role of hired labor. Such "owners" naturally do not take the risk of investing assets to expand goods turnover and to develop their material base. They are interested in transforming profits into their own personal wages as quickly as possible. Normative documents allow for only two forms of selling -- at auction or according to "strict" competition in the form of closed bidding. But world practice includes other, more effective methods. For example, there is special-purpose selling not to the one who pays the most but to the one who proposes the best conditions for utilizing the trade object. In our opinion, a new concept should be included in the government privatization program -- open trading with set conditions. This will become a serious hindrance to those who love behind-the-scenes deals. It can be said that the most effective forms of selling still fall outside the sphere of our activities. Incidentally, we should remember that in the relatively successful East Germany plants often were sold at the standard price of 1 mark, with the obligation that investments be made. The federal government spent tens of billions of marks to improve enterprises that were being sold instead of submitting to enticing dreams about some sort of fantastic income from the sale of their own losses. An analysis of data on the course of commercial privatization convincingly shows that enterprises of the former state trade are making the transition more and more to collective-share ownership by labor collectives. This includes the largest department stores, restaurants, trade centers, and wholesale bases. Many of them, despite the short period of work following privatization, have proven that they have managed successfully as owners and are able to compete with private owners and commercial structures, maintain specialization of enterprises, increase sales volume and raise the level of social guarantees for workers. We should also stop to consider the figures that reflect the selection of a particular method of privatization. Auctions, despite their support by an unceasing propaganda campaign, have not become significantly widespread. Even today, preference is given to the practice of buying out leased property, especially within the sphere of retail trade. On the one hand, this is a concession to the interest of labor collectives. On the other hand, it is a verification of fact -- there is an absence of real competition in the commercial property market. It turns out that it is not easy to find other owners willing to invest their money in primitive counters, tumbledown structures, and equipment that became obsolete long ago. We cannot but acknowledge the sad fact that there has been a sharp downturn in the development of the branch's material-technical base. The auction is the most widespread, but not the only, form of selling. We foresee the possibility of carrying out contest sales. The advantages of holding a contest are apparent. We are referring to the interests of the population first and foremost. One owner will replace the bakery with a disco-bar; another will open a bakery within a "Khleb" [bread] store. Moreover, a mandatory condition in a contest is the preservation of specialization (commercial profile, sales level, services) for a period of 3 years. These stipulations must be included in contracts during the subsequent changing of hands of the object, if this occurs before the completion of the 3-year period. Unfortunately, there are problems even with "small" privatization. The profits achieved by commercial enterprises do not assure their financial security. According to various calculations, deductions decrease possible profits by half, and subsequent payments into the budget, the payment of numerous taxes and dues curtail the remaining half by this same amount. The remainder, which as we know, is not always "sweet," is very small; it is even insufficient to purchase goods. The federal budget does not earmark assets to maintain commercial enterprises. All hope lies in local organs of authority. The need for commercial investment is enormous. After all, a calamitous reduction in its material-technical base is occurring. In 1992, for example, the number of stores decreased by almost one-fourth. During the period of transition to market relations it is vitally important to have government support, especially initially. In Poland, for example, beginning commercial traders do not pay a turnover or income tax for 2 years and 1 year respectively if they are selling industrial goods. Let us summarize what has been said. Commercial privatization in Russia, including Moscow, is unprecedented in scale and cannot be compared to the experience of any other country in the world, even if we take into account the great technical difficulties involving its form, the voucher system and the valuation of objects being privatized and their property. The privatization program passed by the Russian Supreme Soviet provides unjustifiably large incentives to labor collectives. Evidently, it is hardly reasonable to change privatization rules while privatization is in progress, and to thus risk provoking large social conflicts. Evidently, the current stage of privatization must be completed and rules must be changed gradually. This must be done according to mutual agreements and not according to the dictates of a particular side. The main difficulty is that property has already been divided up, and active control over it on the part of the new owners is absent. Here the administration as well as the labor collective must play an increased role. This is why it is our task to develop effective owners, to formulate rules and procedures for redistributing property, and to create a system that will withstand any attempts to squander it. It is important to move from a system of almost free distribution of property to one in which property is sold, from unconditional privatization to privatization based on supplementary investment, and to conditions that protect the interests and rights of consumers. No less important today is the need to strengthen the responsibility of those who buy privatized enterprises. Here we must adhere strictly to purchase-sale conditions. With this goal, contracts must foresee all of the essential conditions for providing model services to the population. For our part, we must foresee effective forms of control over adherence to such conditions and severe sanctions for violations of these conditions. The role of commerce is not limited to the sale of goods. A no less important task is to provide exemplary services to the consumer. The higher calling of commerce is to serve man, and that is the whole point of commercial privatization.
