The meeting reviewed the visit to New York by an Iraqi delegation led by Tariq 'Aziz, deputy prime minister and member of the RCC and the Iraqi Command of the ASBP, and the outcome of his contacts with the members of the UN Security Council. After the meeting, an official spokesman made the following statement: Our delegation noticed that there are circles in the Security Council that may grow into a majority that have begun to sense the harshness of the blockade to which the Iraqi people are being subjected. These circles are taking a positive outlook on Iraq's implementation of the obligations enshrined in Resolution 687. The nations that represent this trend stressed the need for Rolf Ekeus to present a monthly report to the council about the Special Commission's relations with Iraq and for this to lead to the commission setting the beginning and period of what was called the test in order for the Security Council to move to the implementation of Paragraph 22, which should not take long. Some council members mentioned six months as a suitable period to test the implementation mechanism. Other member nations wondered why the period could not be a little shorter or longer to make sure that Ekeus draws up his timetable on clear and practical grounds rather than be swayed by political goals that do not meet with the agreement of the council's members who moved from a new positive position in their approach to this issue. This constructive and fair position was shared by France, Russia, and the PRC, along with other nations like Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Rwanda, among others. On the other hand, the United States and its supporters, or the countries that are influenced by its analyses and intentions, view things from the perspective of fabricating excuses to drag out the blockade on our people and avoid a commitment to a fixed date for implementing Paragraph 22, which allows Iraq to export its products, including oil, to the outside world The conclusion we have drawn is that an important positive development has occurred in the position of important and influential circles in the Security Council. This development requires follow-up and encouragement in order to know for certain whether or not there is should be serious and imminent hope for the lifting of the injustice done to Iraq. The next two months will be important to make clear conclusions in light of what President Saddam Husayn announced in his address to the council of ministers on Sunday, 13 March 1994, the first day of the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. After two months, the ASBP command and the RCC will be able to make the suitable decisions. The official spokesman said: On this occasion, we pay special tribute to the states whose positions were clear in this direction. These specifically included France, Russia, China, and Brazil. We appeal to these countries to develop their positions to become clearer and more influential within the Security Council and the circles in which they have influence. While following up all the details of these developments, our great people will not forget the fair stands of these states and whoever support this just position. It is obvious that the basis for the development in the stands of these countries vis-a-vis Iraq is the firmness and patience of our great people; their active social, political, and economic life; our people's strong adherence to their future; and their firm and unshakeable faith in their nationalism. The ASBP command and the RCC adopted a series of instructions and resolutions to follow up the political and diplomatic move in the coming period and until the next Security Council review [of the sanctions on Iraq] in the second half of May.
