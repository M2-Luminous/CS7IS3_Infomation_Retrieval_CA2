The former U.S. President has to look for the mistake in his own quarters, because he always said one thing, did the second, and wanted the third. This changeling of a U.S. policy for the Persian Gulf was inherited by Bill Clinton, to whom not many new things for this region, where 65 percent of the world's known oil reserves are deposited, have occurred since that time. On the whole, Washington limits itself to sticking to the regime of sanctions that the United Nations imposed against Iraq more than three years ago. However, this embargo has had few effects, at any rate fewer than the West had hoped for at first. In Baghdad there is no indication of a broad opposition to the regime of Saddam that has developed from need, rather of a certain solidarity. Moreover, the sanctions had an effect to the contrary. On the one hand, a dangerous diplomatic vacuum developed in Mesopotamia. Iraq was declared a leper to whom nobody talks -- and of whom, therefore, nobody knows anything. On the other hand, the sanctions are preventing the West from considering a political strategy for the Gulf because they lead one to believe in sham stability: As long as Saddam Husayn rules, he guarantees Iraq's cohesion and, at the same time, justifies the international quarantine that, on its part, is defusing Baghdad's potential threat. In this way, the embargo is degenerating into a comfortable control instrument that seems to make any crisis planning superfluous. However, it would be appropriate to think about the time following the lifting of the sanctions. After all, several scenarios are conceivable, if not probable: 1) The gradual softening of the embargo. This would enable Saddam to rearm himself secretly. 2) Increased international pressure that leads to the lifting of the sanctions by the United Nations. In that case, Saddam would remain in power and would have won all along the line. 3) The overthrow of the despot by people from his clan or the military (of which there are indications in Baghdad). In that case, the successor would have another name, but he would have the same moustache or would pursue more or less the same policy as Saddam. 4) The overthrow of the regime by a popular uprising. This might lead to a civil war, in which Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and above all Iran would probably be involved. The West, particularly Washington, is not prepared for any of these variants. The reason is alarmingly banal: The United States does not know what it wants. Personal revenge on Saddam? This is desirable because the man is a criminal, but it is not necessarily the guideline of a rational foreign policy. The overthrow of the ruling class in Iraq? This is understandable, but hardly feasible in view of the economic and political power and the sheer will to survive of Saddam's courtiers and officers. The punishment of the 18 million people of Iraq? What for, perhaps because they did not get rid of the dictatorship long ago? Leading Iraq back to the community of civilized states? Not even Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the United States' closest partners in the Gulf, are fulfilling this criterion. The latest attempt by U.S. [National] Security Adviser Anthony Lake to outline a new Gulf policy was an excuse rather than an answer to these questions: Accordingly, the times when Washington alternately supported Iran and Iraq as a regional policeman are said to be over; the new magic word is dual containment [preceding two words in English], of both Tehran and Baghdad. If only the United States did not hurt itself in this tour de force. If Washington really wants to keep these two historical Gulf superpowers in check, it has to ensure alone the security of one of the most important and dangerous regions of the world -- with its permanent troop presence and permanent bases. It would be pure self-deception to rely on Saudi Arabia. This artificial product of a state is highly unstable and might completely break down under the pressure of a close U.S. embrace: One can easily slip on oil. A responsible policy for the Gulf must be the exact opposite of dual containment, that is, dual involvement. That means that the United States recognizes the historical, economic, political, and military role of Tehran and Baghdad in this region. Both states have to be involved in a comprehensive political concept where everything, from oil prices via disarmament to joint security, can be discussed. The United States wants a stable Gulf, so that the flow of oil does not come to a standstill. The neighboring states have exactly the same interest. This is not a bad basis for a Gulf policy.
