Although Chou is an opponent of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant project, he nevertheless suggested that the government accelerate the development of nuclear devices as a hedge against the Mainland Chinese threat. ``Peace in the region can be maintained only by the creation of mutual assurance of destruction over the skies of the Taiwan Strait,'' Chou said. He said developing nuclear weapons is necessary if Taiwan wants to be independent of Mainland China. He warned, however, that announcing independence without a deterrent force to back up the proclamation would invite disaster.
