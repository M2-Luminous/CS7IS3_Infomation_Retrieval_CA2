Belkin (Novosibirsk Medical Institute) under the ``Discussion and Readers' Comments'' rubric; received May 20 92; UDC 616.591-057-02:613.647]-07] [Abstract] The configuration of an electric field (EF) in the electric power linezone is totally different from that of an alternating electric field (AEF): the former is arotating electric field (REF) characterized by circular or elliptic polarization, while the AEF has linear polarization. The article presents data on the response of skin epidermisand cornea of laboratory animals (unbred white mice) to chronic action of REFs (with a12.5 kV/m vertical and 11.0 kV/m horizontal EF component) and AEFs (with a 14.0 kV/mvertical EF component). A description and the electrical schematic of the experimental device is presented. It was determined that epidermis is affected by EP and responds to EP action by stabilizing geometric parameters. Tumors were detected in animals that had spent long time in EFs (mainly in REFs). In explaining mitotic activity of epidermis cells in these animals the author proceeds from the assumption that induced currents are the main factor in the effect of low frequency electromagnetic fields. The main process of EF (currents) interaction in a biological object takes place on the tissue and cell levels. The organism possesses effective protection against external low frequency EFs. Acceleration of rigor mortis had been detected in animals that spent at least 1.5 months in an EF. There is no principle difference between high intensity industrial frequency alternating and rotating electric fields. It is concluded that low frequency EFs warrant further studies. The author contends that it is necessary perform separatenormalization of the time spent in an EF for REFs and AEfs. Figures 2, tables 2, references 18: 14 Russian, 4 Western.
