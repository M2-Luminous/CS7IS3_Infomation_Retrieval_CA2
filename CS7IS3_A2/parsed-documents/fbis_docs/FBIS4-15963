According to Juppe, Latvia can rely on French support on the issue of the Russian Army withdrawal. He also said that France has always considered that the army has to be withdrawn unconditionally and it cannot be related to other issues, for example the status of Russian-speaking residents in Latvia. Juppe supported Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis' proposal to set up an international support fund to eliminate the consequences of the work of the Skrunda radar station and the social tension caused in Latvia by Russian military pensioners. According to Ulmanis, with the creation of such a fund talks would continue and internal political crisis in the Baltic region would be abated.
