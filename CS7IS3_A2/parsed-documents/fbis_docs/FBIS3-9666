Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. It has been announced that the cordial and friendly talks confirmed the hitherto good bilateral relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Libya. Minister Unkovic stressed his satisfaction at the fact that, even in the conditions of sanctions under which the two countries are living, there is an interest and desire for the best possible level of cooperation. Trade between the two countries prior to the introduction of sanctions by the international community was exceptionally important to Yugoslavia so that efforts to revitalize cooperation in future are an exceptional pleasure. Envoy al-Turyaki expressed Libya's readiness to send humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia via the Red Cross. According to him, this is only a small symbol by which Libya wishes to show its goodwill and understanding for its old Yugoslav friends.
