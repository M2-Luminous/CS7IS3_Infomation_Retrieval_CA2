To this end, L-lysine decarboxylase (UII type from E. coli) made by Sigma (U.S.) and Vladipor No. 1 cellulose membranes are used. The enzyme electrode preparation method and a block diagram of the L-lysine concentration measurement circuit are cited, and the dependence of the L-lysine sensor activity on pH and the effect of the measurement temperature on the lysine sensor sensitivity are plotted. The enzyme optimum operating conditions fall within pH=5.5-6.0; a decrease in pH increases the biosensor sensitivity, but lower pH values inhibit the enzymatic activity. The optimum operating temperature is 37ï¿½. The sensor is characterized by a linear response within a 0.4-8 mM concentration range. In addition to lysine detection, the proposed sensor may be used for other chemicals, e.g., chlorophos. Figures 3; references 6: 2 Russian, 4 Western.
