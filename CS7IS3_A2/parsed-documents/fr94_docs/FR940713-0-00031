FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Paul Parsons, Special Review and Reregistration Division (7508W), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Special Review Branch, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA (703-308-8037). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document announces the revocation of tolerances established under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346(a) and 348), for residues of the insecticide carbophenothion in or on the commodities listed in 40 CFR 180.156, 40 CFR 185.700, and 40 CFR 186.700. These commodities are: alfalfa (fresh and hay); almond hulls; apples; apricots; beans (dry); beans, lima (succulent); beans, snap (succulent); bean straw; beets, garden (root and top); blueberries; cantaloupe; cattle fat; cherries; clover (fresh and hay); corn (kernels plus cob with husks removed); corn forage; cottonseed, undelinted; crabapples; cucumbers; eggplants; figs; goats, fat; grapefruit; grapes; hogs, fat; lemons; limes; milk; nectarines; olives; onions (dry bulb and green); oranges; peaches; pears; peas (succulent); pecans; peppers; pimentos; plums (fresh prunes); quinces; sheep, fat; sorghum, forage; sorghum, grain; soybeans (succulent); spinach; strawberries; sugarbeets (roots and tops); summer squash; tangerines; tomatoes; walnuts and watermelons (180.156); dried tea (185.700); and dehydrated citrus pulp and citrus meal for cattle feed (186.700). EPA issued a proposed rule, published in the Federal Register of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54316), which proposed the revocation of tolerances for residues of carbophenothion in or on various commodities. The Agency's decision to revoke these tolerances was based on the fact that all registered uses of carbophenothion products have been cancelled and any provision for sales and/or distribution of stocks has expired. The Agency believes that sufficient time has passed for legally treated agricultural commodities to have gone through the channels of trade. Since it is unlikely that carbophenothion, which is not a persistent pesticide, would persist in soil more than 4 years, there is no anticipation of a residue problem due to environmental contamination. Consequently, no action levels are being recommended to replace these revoked tolerances. No public comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee were received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. Therefore, based on the information considered by the Agency and discussed in detail in the October 21, 1993 proposal and in this final rule, the Agency is hereby revoking the tolerances listed in 40 CFR 180.156, 40 CFR 185.700 and 40 CFR 186.700. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competiton, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. This rulemaking has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed in the proposed rule.
