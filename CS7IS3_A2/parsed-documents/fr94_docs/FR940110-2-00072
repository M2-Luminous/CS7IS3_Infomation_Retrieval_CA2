[TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 (codified at 49 U.S.C. 10922(l)) imposed a 2-year moratorium (subject to renewal) on the Commission's issuance of new grants of operating authority to motor carriers domiciled in or owned or controlled by persons of Mexico or Canada. Under this statute, the President has the authority to remove or modify the moratorium if he determines it to be in the national interest, that is, if overriding economic or foreign policy considerations make such an action advisable, or if a negotiated settlement with one country or the other can be reached. Under the moratorium, the President must notify the Congress in writing 60 days before the date on which the removal or modification is to take effect. Shortly after it went into effect, the President exercised his authority and removed the moratorium with respect to Canada. The President indicated in a memorandum to the United States Trade Representative that the United States and Canada had reached a bilateral understanding that would ensure fair and equitable treatment for both U.S. and Mexican motor carriers on both sides of the International Boundary line. 47 FR 54053. The moratorium remained in place for Mexican motor carriers because the Mexican Government continued to restrict U.S. motor carriers' access to Mexico. Under the terms of the statute, the President extended the moratorium for 2-year periods in 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990, and, most recently, in 1992. On November 3, 1993, however, in a Statement of Administrative Action, the President gave notice to Congress that he would lift the moratorium with respect to Mexican charter and other tour services on NAFTA's effective date, that is, on January 1, 1994. 1 1 This satisfies the 60-day notice period called for under 49 U.S.C. 10922(l). In any event, Congress, in approving NAFTA, specifically consented to the President's modifying the moratorium as announced on November 3, 1993. Under NAFTA, the moratorium will be lifted in phases. 2 The schedule of liberalization is as follows: 2 The NAFTA schedule of liberalization does not remove all barriers for Mexican motor carrier operations in the United States. The moratorium will remain in place for Mexican carriers in the one area that was not liberalized, namely, point to point carriage of domestic cargo in the United States. 1. Upon entry into force of NAFTA, for access by Mexican charter and tour bus operators; 2. Three years after signature of NAFTA, for access by Mexican motor property carriers into United States border States, and for establishing companies to distribute international cargo within the United States; 3. Three years after entry into force, for access by Mexican regular-route passenger carriers; 4. Six years after entry into force, access for cross-border operations by Mexican motor property carriers.
