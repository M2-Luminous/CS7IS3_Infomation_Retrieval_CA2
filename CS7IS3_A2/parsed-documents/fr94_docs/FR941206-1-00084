FR941206-1-00084 FR941206-1-00007 If, for example, an entire plant is designated as the affected source, the new source MACT would cover no part of the plant unless replacement of equipment or a group of equipment causes the entire plant to be reconstructed. On the other hand, if each individual piece of equipment (e.g., each spray booth) is designated as an affected source, then that individual piece of equipment can be subject to the reconstruction provisions. A narrow definition of source, such as this one, results in new source MACT applying to each piece of new equipment. 2. Modification Considerations According to section 112(a)(5), modification means any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a major source that increases the actual emissions of any HAP emitted by such source by more than a de minimis amount or that results in the emission of any HAP not previously emitted by more than a de minimis amount. Subpart B of part 63 addresses modifications and identifies the de minimis quantities for each HAP that would trigger the modification provisions. Subpart B requires modified major sources to implement the MACT emission limit for existing sources established pursuant to section 112(d). If a MACT rule for an affected major source has not been promulgated, existing source MACT is established on a case-by-case basis. For this source category, the modification provisions are not a primary consideration in selecting the affected source designation. Modifications of existing sources would mean that the existing source MACT standards continue to apply. The only modification that would occur in this industry that would affect a source's control requirements would be one that causes an area source to become a major source. If an area source becomes major due to a modification, it is subject to existing source MACT. If an area source becomes major due to a reconstruction, it is subject to new source MACT. The affected source definition, however, has no effect on the major source designation because that designation is based on emissions from all emission points located in a contiguous area under common control, even if the affected source is narrowly defined. 3. Affected Source Definitions The Committee did not discuss the affected source definition for the proposed rule. The Agency, therefore, is proposing the affected source definition that it believes is consistent with the Committee's other decisions. To determine the appropriate affected source definition, the Agency focused on the proposed standards for finishing operations as the driving force for choosing an affected source definition. The Agency did this because the finishing operation is the primary emission source at the majority of sources, and the proposed MACT standards differ depending on whether the source is existing or new. The Agency concluded that there are three possible affected source definitions for finishing operations: each finishing step, each finishing line, or each facility. The Agency first considered the implications of defining the source as each finishing step. With this affected source definition, if a new application station (e.g., a spray booth) was added to a finishing line, the finishing material used in this step would have to meet the MACT standards for new sources. The Agency agreed that this was not feasible because the proposed rule allows for averaging within and across finishing steps. If a source is subject to new source MACT for one step and not for others, this step could not be incorporated into the averaging and the facility's flexibility would be limited. This runs counter to the Committee's previous decision to allow sources the maximum flexibility possible in complying with the proposed rule. The second possible affected source definition would be to define a finishing line as the affected source. New source MACT would apply if a facility installed a new finishing line, or if an existing line was reconstructed, as reconstruction is defined in ยง63.5. With this affected source definition, new source MACT is considered technically feasible by the Agency because all of the finishing materials applied would have to meet the same HAP limit. The same problems with averaging arise, however, as arise if a finishing step is the affected source. For example, if a facility operates multiple finishing lines, including one that is subject to new source MACT, the new line could not be included in the averaging calculation because the HAP limit that applies to it is different than the limit that applies to the other lines. Because this limits a facility's flexibility, the Agency did not select the finishing line as the affected source. Also, it is sometimes difficult to define the finishing line within a plant. For example, an owner or operator may add or remove pieces to or from a finishing line at any stage of the finishing. For all of these reasons, the Agency, by default, chose the entire facility to be the affected source.
