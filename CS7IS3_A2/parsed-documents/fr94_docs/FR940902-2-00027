FR940902-2-00027 FR940902-2-00020 This residual contamination level is negligibly above levels that would allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. The Site was remediated to industrial standards. The Site is currently used for light industry and is expected to remain so, given the historical land use in this area. In addition, although the remaining surface contamination level had a residential hazard index of 2, the residual contamination is buried under one or more feet of crushed rock used as backfill; therefore, no contact route exists. EPA signed a Record of Decision for no further action at the Allied Plating Site on June 29, 1993. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality concurred with the no further action remedy selection. EPA believes that the implemented remedy at the Allied Plating Site is protective of the public health and the environment. All possible exposure pathways from contamination on-site have been addressed, including groundwater and near-surface soils. A five year review is scheduled to be conducted at the Allied Plating Site by June 1998. If EPA determines that the remedy is still protective of public health and the environment, no further five year reviews will be conducted. EPA has determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA at the Allied Plating Site have been completed, and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. The Oregon State Department of Environmental Quality has concurred with this decision. Dated: August 1, 1994. Chuck Clarke, Regional Administrator, Region 10.
