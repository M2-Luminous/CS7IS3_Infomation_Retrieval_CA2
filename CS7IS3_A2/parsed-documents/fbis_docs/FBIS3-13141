For one thing, worldwide condemnation of the massacre has not been such as to lead one to conclude that the Middle East peace process will go forward or that the Palestinian side has improved its bargaining position at the negotiating table. For another, the enormity and monstrosity of the massacre can only reinforce the image the world has of the odious nature of occupation. Which means that true salvation for the Palestinian people and the path to true peace in the region lie in a total Israeli evacuation of the Palestinian territory. We need to come up with the proper response to the massacre, and, since its political reverberations are still developing, their nature and scale will be determined by the mechanisms employed by both sides of the conflict and the skill with which they are used. If the enemy government seeks to assuage resentment and return things to where they were before the massacre, in order to escape the concessions expected of it as a price for this abominable crime, then the PLO must embark upon a vigorous drive to restate the truths the odious occupation has brought into sharp focus; namely that true peace in the region is an impossibility without a complete Israeli withdrawal and guarantees for the freedom and independence of the Palestinian people. While this is not the first massacre committed against the Palestinian people during their conflict with Israel, it marks a first in terms of scale and ugliness. It was committed against the background of a negotiating process that pushed the ugly face of occupation into the background and presented decisionmakers and public opinion around the world with the appearance of a thriving future peace. In other words, the negotiating process supplanted the true picture of occupation with good wishes and grand dreams that could not realistically come true without potent pressure being brought to bear on the occupying power. If that pressure has not been forthcoming it is because the Israeli occupation has not been perceived to be that much of a threat to the lives, security, and future of the Palestinian people. The Ibrahimi Mosque atrocity has debunked these illusions and sent the message that peace and occupation do not mix. We must think of a response to the massacre less in the manner of an act of retribution and more in line with a comprehensive policy. This is because any purely retaliatory act will hardly strike at the heart of occupation. Nor should our retaliation be restricted to one domain. We must invest the political dividends of the massacre at the negotiating table while providing a direct answer by spilling Israeli blood through a systematic intensification of the armed struggle against those who bear direct responsibility for the massacre -- the Kach movement's gangsters and occupation troops. This is to underscore resistance and the ongoing intifadah as legitimate rights as our people strive to wrest their freedom and independence. In other words, we must engage the enemy in a multifaceted battle until it is defeated and all forms of its presence on our land and the dark era of occupation are eliminated once and for all. These are inexorable eventualities. Revolution until victory.
