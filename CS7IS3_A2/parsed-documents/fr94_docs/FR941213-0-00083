FR941213-0-00083 FR941213-0-00019 49 CFR Part 567 [Docket No. 91&hyph;24; Notice 2] Certification AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Technical amendments; final rule. SUMMARY: This notice corrects a citation to the motor vehicle importation regulation that was in effect until January 31, 1990 (19 CFR 12.80) and which has been superseded by a new regulation (49 CFR part 591). EFFECTIVE DATES: The amendment is effective on December 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George Shifflett, Office of Enforcement, NHTSA (202) 366&hyph;5307. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 15, 1991, NHTSA made several technical amendments to conform the language of part 567, Certification, to new regulations, issued in September 1989, regarding the importation of motor vehicles not originally manufactured in compliance with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards (56 FR 22355). The reader is referred to that notice for further information on this subject. Inadvertently, the agency neglected to include paragraph 567.4(k) in the amendments to part 567. Paragraph (k) applies to those ``passenger cars admitted to the United States under 19 CFR 12.80(b)(1)'' which lack an original manufacturer's certification of compliance with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The correct citation is to Paragraph 591.5(f). This notice effects that correction. The notice also revises the authority citations to reflect the recodification in Title 49 of the agency's authorities previously in Title 15. Because the amendment is technical in nature and has no substantive impact, it is hereby found that notice and comment thereon are unnecessary, and that good cause is shown that an effective date earlier than 180 days after issuance of the rule is in the public interest. Therefore, the amendment is effective upon publication in the Federal Register . As the amendment makes no substantive change, it does not affect any of the impacts previously considered in the promulgation of part 567. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 567 Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles. In consideration of the foregoing, part 567 of 49 CFR is amended as follows: PART 567_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 567 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 322, 30111, 30115, 30117, 30166, 49 U.S.C. 32502 and 32504; 49 U.S.C. 33101&hyph;33104, and 33109; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. ยง567.4 [Amended] 2. The introductory text to paragraph 567.4(k) is amended by removing the phrase ``19 CFR 12.80(b)(1)'' and adding, in its place, the phrase ``49 CFR 591.5(f)''. Issued on: December 7, 1994.
