(b) If the Regional Administrator rejects the recommendation of the Presiding Officer, in whole or in part, the decision shall include a written explanation for that rejection that states each point of disagreement with the recommendation of the Presiding Officer. If the Regional Administrator determines that the proposed penalty assessment must be withdrawn, such action may be done without prejudice.
