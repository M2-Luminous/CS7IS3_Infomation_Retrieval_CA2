The resolution that the UN Security Council is about to adopt will emphasize the political standpoint about the recognition of borders of the Republic of Croatia and Croatia's territorial integrity. The resolution will extend the UNPROFOR mandate by six months, not by 12 months as proposed by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. According to the resolution, UNPROFOR will have the right to seek air support if prevented in the implementation of its tasks, President Tudjman said in reply to the question of what Croatia expects from the new UN Security Council resolution. President Tudjman then went on to say that in a political sense Croatia could be completely satisfied with the resolution, although, he added, the UNPROFOR mandate, due to the lack of funds and forces, was not as operational as Croatia would like it to be. President Tudjman stated that for its policy Croatia had guarantees by the United States and other international players. He informed the U.S. journalists that Croatia had requested from the United Nations and the Security Council that UNPROFOR control the borders between Croatia and Serbia and Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to prevent the arming of the Serbs in Bosnia- Herzegovina and in the UNPA in Croatia. We also demanded the reopening of roads and the oil pipeline and the return of around 400,000 refugees to their homes. Asked whether an agreement on a cease-fire and on the resolution of the issue of the Serbs living in the occupied areas in the Republic of Croatia would be reached in negotiations being held in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, President Tudjman, laying an emphasis on the current international situation, said that the Serbs from Knin, under the current international circumstances, would agree with the peaceful solution. If they failed to accept that, Croatia would then, in line with UN resolutions, be able to resort to other means and in that it would enjoy the support of international factors. I hold that we shall be able to reintegrate these areas into the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of Croatia in a peaceful way, the Croatian president stressed. President Tudjman said that the problem of the UNPA's was the main precondition for the normalization. He said that relations could not be normalized as long as Serbia maintained its occupation of Croatian areas. Tudjman stressed that despite the fact that the Serbian and Yugoslav Governments, under international pressure, accepted that the time was ripe for the normalization of relations, resolute political moves were lacking and extreme Serb war-mongers were still active. After this, President Tudjman replied to questions in connection with the solution of the crisis in Bosnia. Asked if a possible confederation between Bosnian Serbs and Yugoslavia could be linked with the solution for the UNPA's, President Tudjman said that these issues could not be linked as Serbs were one of the three constituent nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbs in Croatia were a national minority that do not have a right to self-determination in accordance with international standards. President Tudjman said that the UNPAs have always been an integral part of the Republic of Croatia. In reply to a question about Croatia's policy towards Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Tudjman repeated Croatian positions to the U.S. journalists. These positions were first demonstrated by Bosnian Croat votes at the referendum on an independent Bosnia-Herzegovina, then by the support for a proposal to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into provinces, and it should also be stressed that Croatia was the first state to have recognized the independent Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia's policy has always taken into account the overall interests of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Tudjman said and stressed that the Washington agreement would not have been possible if the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna that protected the interests of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina had not existed.
