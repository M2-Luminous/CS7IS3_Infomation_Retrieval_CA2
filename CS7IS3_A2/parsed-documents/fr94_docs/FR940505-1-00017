ACTION: Proposed rule, dismissal of. SUMMARY: The Commission denies the petition for rulemaking filed by Ocracoke Broadcasters requesting the substitution of Channel 224C1 for Channel 225A at Ocracoke, NC, and the modification of its construction permit for a new Class A station to specify operation on the higher class channel. See 59 FR 40401, July 28, 1993. The Commission found that the proposed site would not permit compliance with Section 73.315 of the Commission's Rules regarding 70 dBu city-grade coverage. The Commission also denies the counterproposal filed by Lawrence F. and Margaret A. Loesch to substitute Channel 273C1 for Channel 273C2 at Edenton, NC, reallot Channel 273C1 to Columbia, NC, substitute Channel 224A for unoccupied but applied-for Channel 272A at Pine Knoll Shores, NC, and modify Station WERX&hyph;FM's license to specify Columbia as its community of license. The Commission found that the proposed transmitter site is located in a swamp and no showing that a suitable transmitter site exists was provided. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.
