The 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Workers Party of Korea Central Committee, which opened toward the end of 1993, decided that the following three years [as heard] would be a period of adjustment in economic construction, clearly presented a need to implement a new economic strategy of directing primary efforts to agriculture, the light industry, and foreign trade, and decided to increase state investment in agriculture and pursue agricultural development. The Korean National Agriculture Meeting, which was convened this 25 February, summed up experiences and presented tasks and measures to develop agriculture based on those experiences. An important task in developing agriculture in Korea is to increase rice and corn production per chongbo [one chongbo equals 2.45 acres] to eight or 10 tonnes and, thus, reap 15 million tonnes of grain a year in a few years. To fulfill this goal, the Korean National Agriculture Meeting presented various measures, and a noteworthy measure, among them, is to improve the peasants' cultural and technological standards and vigorously carry out a technological revolution in the rural areas. The meeting noted that constantly improving the peasants' standards of agricultural technology is a key task to develop agriculture. The meeting demands that the higher education system be strengthened in rural areas, that many farm universities and agricultural colleges where students work and study open, that technical personnel necessary for agricultural production be trained en masse, that various technical study teams and special training courses be established to ensure that peasants learn latest agricultural science and technology. Another important task in the Korean technological revolution in agriculture is to build irrigation systems, use electric equipment in farming, mechanize farm work, and use chemical fertilizers in farming. The Korean National Agriculture Meeting noted that Korea had brought about great achievements in its efforts to build irrigation systems and use electric equipment in farming and that it must give priority to mechanizing farm work and applying scientific knowledge to farming. Therefore, the meeting demanded that the industrial sector strengthen its assistance to agriculture and produce more agricultural equipment of various sorts to ensure that cooperative farms in various areas do farming in a timely manner without receiving assistance from the city labor. The meeting demanded that chemical fertilizer plants in various areas produce efficient chemical fertilizers in abundance. It also encouraged those plants to produce biochemical fertilizers [saengmul hwahak piryo] and plant growth control materials [singmul songjang chojolchil] in abundance to supply them to rural areas.
