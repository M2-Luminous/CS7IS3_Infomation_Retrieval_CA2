As the Japanese would have it, this is well nigh the first policy utterance by the amnestied bearded leader since his stay in Lefortovo [Prison]. Rutskoy informs the Japanese that he is ready for the struggle for the post of Russian president and does not intend to leave the political arena. The leader notes without false modesty here that he has sufficient strength and experience to successfully conduct an election campaign and then lead Russia. Rutskoy attributes this uncommon self-confidence to the fact that he is virtually insured against making major political mistakes in the future because in the past Yeltsin has taught him clear lessons in a specific discipline: how not to run the country. Having received such a valuable "inoculation," the amnestied figure gave the Japanese to understand that in order to achieve his aims he intends to form a powerful united patriotic front, which will be his mainstay in the election and bring him to power. Judging from his replies his allies in the struggle will be communists and other patriotic forces whose potential the leader has to utilize effectively. Rutskoy also called for the voluntary reunification of former Soviet republics in a new union, noting the objective need for such integration. The recent inmate of Leforotovo inveighs against Yeltsin in strong and varied terms. In addition, Rutskoy curses the West and the world community as a whole for the support given to the present Russian president in October last year. Rutskoy stresses here that he does not consider himself a criminal. On the contrary, he calls himself a true defender of the law and constitution and is puzzled as to how foreign observers -- in whose eyes "those who shot innocent people" are still reformers -- were unable to discern this. The former vice president informed the Japanese that he is currently very busy finishing off his latest book with the epoch-making title "Ways of Reforming Russia in All Key Areas." A scientific-sounding title, but judging from the author's explanations the book, which is due to come out as early as this summer, will describe not only the mysteries of reform but also backstage Kremlin intrigues in 1991-1993. Rutskoy promises to spill the beans about his relations with Yeltsin and to cite other juicy details from the life of the political elite. In a short commentary on Rutskoy's written replies, KYODO indicates the high probability that a Russian presidential election should be expected not in 1996, when Yeltsin's term of office officially expires, but before that -- next year or even at the end of this year.
