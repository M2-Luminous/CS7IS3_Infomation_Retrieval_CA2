Akashi wants the monitors deployed to stabilize the conflict ahead of ceasefire talks, said Michael Williams, Akashi's spokesman, ahead of the UN envoy's meeting with Karadzic. "Mr. Akashi will be pressing the point that it would be advisable to obtain an enhanced UNPROFOR observation in critical areas in order to stabilize the situation in anticipation of possible ceasefire negotiations," Williams said. Brcko, in northeastern Bosnia, is thought to be the Serbs' next target after their standoff over Gorazde. Seizure of Brcko would widen a strategic corridor linking Serbia and Serb-held areas in northwestern Bosnia. Akashi and UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander General Bertrand de Lapresle began talks with Karadzic during the afternoon in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale, the TANJUG news agency reported late Tuesday afternoon. "We are hoping that something positive in that regard will come out of the meeting this afternoon," Williams added. Earlier in the day Akashi met Bosnian Government leaders in Sarajevo. Several western sources have reported concentrations of Serb and Bosnian Moslem forces near Brcko. Military experts have predicted it would their next strategic target after Gorazde.
