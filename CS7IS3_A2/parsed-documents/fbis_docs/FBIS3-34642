Those three problems relating to the crossings, the size of the Jericho area, and the security measures in the areas of the settlements and in the roads leading from the settlements to Israel constitute an obstacle. We announced yesterday that we had solved this problem and overcame this obstacle. Consequently, the road will be open to reaching an agreement. This is not a separate agreement from the Gaza-Jericho accord, nor is it a partial agreement, rather it is a declaration overcoming the major obstacles. [Kohen] Will this declaration provide answers to Israeli security concerns and at the same time achieve Palestinian wishes and aspirations? [Sha'th] I believe that it responds to a great many of these aspirations, but it does not necessarily give each party what it wants. This is the nature of such talks, especially as far as these kinds of phased talks are concerned, which seek to reach partial agreement on a transitional government, not on full sovereignty and an independent state. There is no model that one can follow. Therefore, we have to work out some kind of arrangement that realizes the Palestinian people's aspirations for dignity, independence, and freedom and upholds the Israelis' demand for security, which has always constituted an Israeli concern. [Kohen] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, at the end of every set of negotiations each side calculates the losses and gains of an agreement. What is the Palestinian gain from the agreement signed in Cairo last night? [Sha'th] That we implement the accord that we signed in Washington relatively quickly because we have lagged behind. Now we should end this delay so as to implement this accord. The beginning of an implementation of the accord will open new vistas to our people in the occupied Palestinian territories that will gradually remove from them the burden of Israeli occupation and achieve for them part -- part -- of their aspirations in governing themselves and repatriating part of the Palestinian people to Palestine, especially those displaced in 1967. Consequently, the gain here is to start moving matters toward the realization of the Palestinian people's goals.
