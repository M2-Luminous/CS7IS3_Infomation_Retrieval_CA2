Cetin replied to questions by Turkish reporters in Strasbourg, where he is attending the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers meeting. Answering a question, Cetin warned that assessing the question of terrorism in Turkey from a human rights viewpoint creates the impression that terrorism is being supported. Sending a CSCE observer delegation to Turkey is definitely unacceptable, Cetin stressed. In reply to a question on recent developments in northern Iraq, the foreign minister recalled that the region is part of Iraq and stated that it is out of the question for Turkey to mediate between clashing Kurdish groups.
