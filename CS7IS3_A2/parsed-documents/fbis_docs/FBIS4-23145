Speaking at the final press conference in Lilongwe, the chairman of the council for the month of May, Mr. Lovemore Munlo, commended the role of the council played during the transition period. He explained that the council was instrumental in changing the political scene in Malawi, thereby producing the first parliament and president in a multiparty system. On the council's final discussions, Mr. Munlo said members had appealed to the newly-instituted government to consider funding political parties to pay their election monitors. He explained that it is a constitutional requirement that government should fund political parties, to ensure their continuity, and also allow competitive politics as a pillar of multiparty politics in Malawi. Mr. Munlo also said that the council had agreed to turn the (?returnee) committee into a commission which will cater not only for returnees but also for destitutes.
