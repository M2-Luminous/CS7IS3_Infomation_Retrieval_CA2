In a statement issued today, a ministry source said that there is absolutely no truth to reports that the computer-operated centers for receiving reports on faulty telephone lines, which the National Communications Authority has established, are being used to obtain information on the subscriber's line when reporting a fault. The source stressed that the line is tested in order to ascertain the type and location of the fault and to automatically record it so that the repair teams can correct the fault and restore the line to operations. The source added that Egyptian engineers and technicians are in charge of these centers, that no person other than those working there are allowed in, and that there are no foreign experts working in these centers. The statement went on to say that the fault-reporting centers are completely secure and no telephone line can be tapped while engaged. It added that there are no contacts or links between these centers and any foreign entity and this confirms that the Egyptian network cannot be technically penetrated. The statement noted that the role of the company carrying out the work is limited to the installation of the equipment, and this is done under the supervision of the authority's engineers. The company's role ends once the equipment is received here and before being put into service.
