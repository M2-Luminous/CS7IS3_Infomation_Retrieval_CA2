Most panelists stressed the need to put "great effort" into winning public support through regional hearings by presenting "various quantitative options," Sakue Matsumoto, acting chairman of the Tax Commission, told reporters after a panel meeting. The advisory panel to the prime minister listed major opinions spelled out in seven previous meetings to map out the direction for discussion on tax reform, including income tax cuts and offsetting tax hikes. Matsumoto, speaking in place of panel chairman Kan Kato, said he does not know if panelists want to include concrete figures in the June report. But he said members agreed to carry out "quantitative" discussions. He also said most panelists called for additional proposals such as administrative and fiscal streamlining and welfare revision to win support if the tax reform is to cover heavier burdens on taxpayers. Matsumoto said panelists are still split on whether to conduct a full tax reform or take more limited measures under the weak economy.
