Commenting on the publication of a report by the U.S. in which seven third world countries have been introduced as main supporters of terrorism, the `TEHRAN TIMES' wrote in its editorial that a brief look would reveal that all the seven countries were those that were not prepared to give in to the American global superpower role, and opposed Washington's expansionist policies. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was the greatest center for training terrorists, and coup d'etats and assassinations have been among the basic components of American foreign policy in the decades after World War II, argued the paper. It concluded by saying that the relations between the American government and the terrorist groups was an "undeniable" fact.
