Figueroa thus referred to the hardening of the Cuban stance regarding eight Cuban citizens who remain in the Chilean Consulate in Havana. According to press reports, Fidel Castro's government has stated that it will never authorize the people who occupy foreign embassies by force to leave the country, even if they decide to abandon them voluntarily. Figueroa said that a communique in this sense represents a change of Castro's original offer to grant the refugees exit visas. Figueroa also reasserted the Chilean Government's decision to continue giving them protection for humanitarian reasons and to see that no reprisals are adopted against them if the eight Cubans decide to voluntarily leave the consulate. In Havana, in addition to the eight Cubans who have sought asylum at the Chilean Consulate, there are another 107 in the Belgium Embassy and 21 in the German Embassy.
