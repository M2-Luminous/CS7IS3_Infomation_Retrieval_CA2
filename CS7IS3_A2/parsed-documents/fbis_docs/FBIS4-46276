FBIS4-46276 "jptot023__l94062" JPRS-TOT-94-023-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 26 April 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA INDIA Kashmir Sources Report Pakistan Funding Figures Kashmir Sources Report Pakistan Funding Figures 94WR0155B Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 26 Apr 94 p 13 94WR0155B Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] Jammu, April 25--Pakistan's inter-services intelligence (ISI) has launched a fresh operation to step up militant violence in Kashmir and to scuttle any move of the Centre to restore the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir, official sources here said, reports PTI. Under the operation "expense support," the ISI has begun pumping into Jammu and Kashmir huge amounts of money, including foreign currency to sustain militancy, besides motivating people to re-activate propaganda on alleged atrocities by security forces. This money would als be used for "damage control" efforts in the areas, where militant support has been waning in Kashmir due to pressure of the security forces and wrong actions of militants. The sources said more than Rs 80 crores had reached pro-Pak militant outfits in Kashmir between December last year and end of January this year in the aftermath of Hazratbal crisis. However, the security forces had seized some consignments of cash and gold from the Jammu borders during past few months, the sources said, adding the seizure including foreign currency was approximately estimated to be around Rs 4 crores. Most of these consignments have reached the state through "couriers." In some cases money was sent in the name of relief through some trusts like America-based "Kashmir-American council" and the Gulf-based "Jamat-i-Sihadis." Funds were sent through banks to frontline pro-Pak Hizbul Mujahideen which stands for merger of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan, the sources said. The pro-independent outfit, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), which started militant movement in Kashmir early, was being deprived this financial support as Pakistan was opposed to its moves for "independence of Kashmir." The sources said one of the arrested Hizbul Mujahideen militants, Ashfaq Ahmed Lone, had told his interrogators that he had got Rs 16 lakhs from the ISI for his outfit early this year. Another captured militant, Shahab-Uddin of the Hizbul Mujahideen, had admitted that he had brought $10,000 for Master Ahsan Dar, a former commander-in-chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen. The money for Master Ahsan Dar was sent by Mohammad Yusuf, a patron of Hizbul Mujahideen in Rawalpindi, the sources said. The consignments under this operation also included anti-India propaganda material for distribution among the local population in Kashmir and other areas of Jammu region. The ISI, the sources said, was forced to launch this operation in the wake of increasing alienation of the people from Pak-sponsored militants, who were indulging now in criminal acts. Pakistan has also been making efforts to scare away the political leaders from initiating political process in Jammu and Kashmir, the sources added. The ISI has formed a "Jehad council," a strategic cartel of all the pro-Pakistan militant groups, adds UNI. Talking to a group of visiting newsmen, Brig Gen Staff (operations) Arjun Ray said that headquarters of the council was located in Muzafarrabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). It was acting as the spokesman of all the militant groups in the valley to the Pakistan government. Brig Ray said the council had been designated to look after the raising and distribution of funds to the various militant outfits on behalf of the ISI and would also project the militant outfits' requirements of arms and ammunition.
