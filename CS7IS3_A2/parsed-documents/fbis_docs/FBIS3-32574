FBIS3-32574 "drlat028_a_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-028 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Feb 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Interview Conducted With U.S. Visa Applicants FL1002005194 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 9 Feb 94 FL1002005194 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Normalizing relations with the United States regarding migration has always been one of the Cuban Government's objectives. For example, in 1993, Cuba authorized 100,000 people to temporarily leave the country, but only 30,000 were able to travel. The remaining 70,000 were denied a visa by the U.S. Interests Section, located in our capital. Journalist Zenaida Costales has a report for us on what goes on there, day after day. [Begin recording] [unidentified speaker] Everyone has an objective. [indistinct comments by numerous unidentified speakers, speaking simultaneously] [Unidentified speaker] They stand guard here, in the line. There is one who keeps the list of the people in line. Then... [rephrases] but one must be here at 0630. To sacrifice all those days! So, well, we do not have a set time for leaving here. We are just as likely to leave at noon as at 1400 hours. It depends. The U.S. Interests Section should consider that. [Unidentified speaker] Well, here I am again today, for the 16th day. [Unidentified speaker] And you have been... [rephrases] I myself have been here a week, night and day. The other day, last Monday, we were drenched by a rainstorm at 0500. This area was so muddy that it looked like a pigsty around here. It was such a mess that it was criminal to have to be here. And to have to spend the whole day and the whole night that way.... [leaves sentence unfinished] [Two unidentified speakers, speaking simultaneously] But that is [words indistinct]. That kind of disregard! [Costales] That kind of thing happens everyday at the park at Calzada and K Streets, called the Park of Lamentation because of the thousands of people who gather there in front of the offices of the U.S. Interests Section to await an interview, during which they find out whether or not they will be allowed to travel to the United States. [Unidentified speaker] I have not been able to get in yet -- and without knowing, (without their) telling me yes or no. [Unidentified speaker] Heck, it does people in, in the heart! People come out of there in tears -- all emotionally upset because after all those things, to have them say to you: You cannot go! [You think:] Let's see if I get lucky tomorrow and will be able to go. And the luck (?involved in) having them say yes to me! If they say no to me, then I will have spent all those months in vain. That is not easy, [repeats] not easy. [Unidentified speaker] I plan to go in there tomorrow, to see what they tell me. (?I have no idea what will happen.) [Unidentified reporter] What if they say no? [Unidentified speaker] Huh? What am I going to do, resign myself? The thing is, he is going to die and I am not going to get to see him before he dies, because he is in bed, in serious condition. [Costales] The U.S. Government turns the matter of emigration into one more stumbling block in the already difficult bilateral relations between Cuba and the United States. But let us let the protagonists themselves express their opinions. [Unidentified speaker] (?We must) clear up one little thing: The Cuban Government gives anyone who wants to go permission to go. The whole blockage problem is here at the embassy because the Cuban Government really does not prevent anyone from going. Anybody who asks to go there and has complied with the formalities gets permission. But it is here that one is blocked. [Unidentified reporter] And what were you told at the U.S. Interests Section? [Unidentified speaker] That I could not go (?right now,) because I was too young a person. [Unidentified reporter] And what do you think of that? [Speaker] His words of hope were for me to come back next year, but I told him no, that next year I would be only one year older, that it would be the same thing, that I would still be young. [Unidentified speaker] One cannot afford to lose the hope of living, in this life! [Unidentified reporter] And what if they say no to you? [Speaker] Well, they will be forcing me to do something I would rather not do. I would like to see my grandparents and come back, but they are obliging me to do something else. [Costales] There are still many things left to resolve regarding emigration. These testimonies show that the doors in that wall are still closed. [end recording]
