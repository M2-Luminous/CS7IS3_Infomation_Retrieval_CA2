FR940928-0-00044 FR940928-0-00017 50 CFR Part 642 [Docket No. 930791&hyph;3191; I.D. 092294B] Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure of a commercial fishery for king mackerel. SUMMARY: NMFS closes the commercial fishery in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for king mackerel from the western zone of the Gulf migratory group. This closure is necessary to protect the overfished Gulf king mackerel resource. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 24, 1994, through June 30, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark F. Godcharles, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5306. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The fishery for coastal migratory pelagic fish (king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cero, cobia, little tunny, dolphin, and, in the Gulf of Mexico only, bluefish) is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 642, under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Catch limits recommended by the Councils and implemented by NMFS for the Gulf of Mexico migratory group of king mackerel set the commercial quota at 0.77 million lb (0.35 million kg) for the western zone. Under §642.26(a), NMFS is required to close any segment of the king mackerel commercial fishery when its allocation or quota has been reached, or is projected to be reached, by publishing a document in the Federal Register . NMFS has determined that the commercial quota of 0.77 million lb (0.35 million kg) for the western zone of the Gulf migratory group of king mackerel was reached on September 23, 1994. Hence, the commercial fishery for Gulf group king mackerel from the western zone is closed effective 12:01 a.m., local time, September 24, 1994, through June 30, 1995, the end of the fishing year. The boundary between the eastern and western zones is a line directly south from the Florida/Alabama boundary (87 31 ’06 ’ ’ W. long.). Except for a person aboard a charter vessel, during the closure, no person aboard a vessel permitted to fish under a commercial allocation may fish for, retain, or have in possession in the EEZ, king mackerel from the western zone. A person aboard a charter vessel may continue to fish for king mackerel in the western zone under the bag limit set forth in §642.24(a)(1)(i), provided the vessel is under charter and the vessel has an annual charter vessel permit, as specified in §642.4(a)(2). A charter vessel with a permit to fish on a commercial allocation is under charter when it carries a passenger who fishes for a fee or when there are more than three persons aboard, including operator and crew. During the closure, king mackerel from the western zone taken in the EEZ, including those harvested under the bag limit, may not be purchased, bartered, traded, or sold. This prohibition does not apply to trade in king mackerel from the western zone that were harvested, landed, and bartered, traded, or sold prior to the closure and held in cold storage by a dealer or processor. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 642.26(a) and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: September 22, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23989 Filed 9&hyph;23&hyph;94; 1:19pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
