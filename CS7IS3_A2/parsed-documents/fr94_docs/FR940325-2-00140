FR940325-2-00140 FR940325-2-00057 The defendants will be required to file annual reports with the Court and the Government certifying that they have complied with the terms of section V of their respective Final Judgments. Entry of the proposed Final Judgments will terminate the action against all the defendants, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction over the matter for further proceedings that may be required to interpret, enforce, or modify the Judgment, or to punish violations of any of its provisions. II Description of the Practices Involved in the Alleged Violations At trial, the Government would have made the following contentions: 1. The hospital defendants, St. Benedict's Hospital, IHC Hospitals, Inc. (``IHC''), Holy Cross Hospital of Salt Lake City, Pioneer Valley Hospital, Inc., Lakeview Hospital, Inc., Mountain View Hospital, Inc., Brigham City Community Hospital, Inc., and HCA Health Services of Utah, Inc. d/b/a St. Mark's Hospital, provide and sell general acute-care hospital services and recruit and hire nurses. The hospital defendants located in Salt Lake County compete with each other in recruiting and hiring nurses and purchase approximately 75% of the registered nursing services in that County. 2. On a regular basis, the hospital defendants telephoned one another and exchanged nonpublic prospective and current wage and budget information for nurses. On a number of occasions, hospital defendants told each other, including IHC, of their intent to match whatever registered-nurse entry wage IHC eventually adopted. 3. On at least eight occasions between 1984 and 1992, some or all of the hospital defendants attended meetings organized by USHHRA for the express purpose of exchanging nonpublic prospective and current wage and budget information about registered nursing wages. 4. Annually, IHC collected current and nonpublic prospective wage and budget information from the other hospital defendants for use in a published wage survey that was distributed to the other hospitals. IHC used this information to limit its registered-nurse wage increases. 5. Annually, the UHA collected current and, in some years, prospective information pursuant to a survey designed by the hospital defendants. This information was published and distributed to the hospital defendants, which use this information to limit registered-nurse wage increases. 6. As a direct result of these wage and budget exchanges, the hospital defendant's registered-nurse entry wages in Salt Lake County and elsewhere in Utah were kept artificially low, and registered nurses were paid these lower wages from 1984 through June, 1992.
