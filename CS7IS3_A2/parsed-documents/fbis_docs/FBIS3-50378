[Boross] One of the most important events during the breakdown of the world system that called itself communist was the establishment of German unity. It also resulted in the greater international political importance and responsibility of the FRG. This responsibility is particularly important today since a bloody war is raging in our region and extremist views are rousing excessive passions. In our opinion, the economic power, the political weight, and the geographical situation commit Germany to assuming an even more active and courageous role in the interest of European stability in Central Europe. The competition between two world powers confronting each other was terminated by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, this leads to a reconsideration of the world's security structure. It is above all NATO's task to create it. When we stress that European integration is the priority of Hungary's foreign policy, we also understand by it our accession to NATO as our basic objective. [Ferenczy] Are you concerned about the development in Russia? [Boross] It is, of course, vital for Hungary and the whole of the international community that the democratic changes in Russia cannot be reversed. The newly adopted constitution guarantees this. We hope that it will be possible to finally solve the political discussions provoked by extremists within the framework of laws, by peaceful negotiations, and in the course of mutual compromises by the development of the institutional system of the new, democratic rule-of-law state. In this way, the danger of chaos and civil wars, which, in addition to its unpredictable political consequences, would reduce the chances for accession to Europe, would be averted. The advance of individual extremist forces in the elections is not disastrous, but only a signal, which, however, has to be taken seriously. [Ferenczy] Why are politics failing in the Yugoslavia conflict? [Boross] The south Slav conflict may involve the following dangers for Europe: -- The aggressive war of conquest is again becoming an accepted means for the solution of political, ideological, and religious differences. -- In the public Western media a mental iron curtain may develop, that is to say, the view that Eastern Central Europe is to solve its accumulated problems itself because the West does not intend to import a bankrupt's estate, could prevail. -- The most serious practical consequence is the influx of people who have been expelled from their homeland or are on the run to neighboring and developed Western countries -- up to the point of a mass movement. As a result of this phenomenon, extremist and fascist views and groups might gain ground, which is a challenge that has to be taken seriously by the rule-of-law states.
