Blix: If I take a look at the international media, I actually have the feeling that the spread of nuclear weapons is the biggest danger in the world, and that there are numerous states in the world that are only waiting to buy or build their own nuclear weapons -- without any control. However, one must also see the progress: A number of former risk states, including Brazil or Argentina, but also South Africa, have voluntarily given up their nuclear ambitions. There will be nuclear-free zones in Africa and Latin America, and even in the Middle East, talks on such a zone are under way. Bitzan: Has the collapse of the Soviet Union not made the proliferation of nuclear weapons uncontrollable? Blix: It has certainly increased the danger. Ukraine, for example, has not joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Then there is also the risk of the "leakage" of know-how and of nuclear material from the former USSR. Yet so far we have not seen a single case of the illegal export of enriched uranium, which is required for atomic bombs. As far as plutonium is concerned, the quantities were very, very small -- grams or milligrams. An increasing number of developing countries are able to develop nuclear weapons if they use all their funds on this project. Yet the danger that has often been conjured up -- that this could happen overnight -- does not exist at all. Bitzan: Do you believe that Saddam Husayn might again build a bomb? Blix: After many years of work, we reassessed Iraq's nuclear program. We know how the supply worked, where the materials and the know-how came from. We are certain that something like that will not happen again as long as the control continues. Bitzan: What were the reasons for the differences between the IAEA and North Korea? Blix: During inspections and analyses, we discovered, as early as in 1992, that more plutonium existed than was declared. Only a few additional grams, but also kilograms might be involved. We do not know. This is an unpleasant development and it strengthens our doubts regarding their statements. Our long-term problem is: How much plutonium do they possess beyond the quantities already declared, and where is it? The current conflict has a different background. Our inspections were stopped at the most important site -- in the laboratory where used fuel rods are being separated and reprocessed. We were not allowed to carry out the required tests. North Korea cited the fact that the inspectors demanded more than was stipulated in the agreement as one reason for its behavior. This is a completely unfounded accusation. At the moment there are no positive signs coming from Pyongyang. Bitzan: Will there be any sanctions? Blix: The initiative now lies with the UN Security Council. There is the firm wish among the Security Council to urge North Korea to allow the inspections. However, I do not think that there is currently a tendency toward sanctions. Nor do I believe that the United States is interested in a military escalation. It is making great efforts to explain that the "Patriots" are only of a defensive nature, and that they are only the response to the harsh language of the North. Bitzan: North Korea has repeatedly threatened to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Has this danger now increased? Blix: North Korea has threatened to do so, but so far it has refrained from taking such a provocative step. However, this would not change the reality: The world wants to ensure that it cannot produce any nuclear weapons. The pressure on Pyongyang would be the same.
