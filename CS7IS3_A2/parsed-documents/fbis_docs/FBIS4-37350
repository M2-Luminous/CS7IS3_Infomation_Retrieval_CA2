The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from the cities of Bandar-e Mahshahr, Dorud and Azna, Miyaneh, and Rudbar spoke as preagenda speakers. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a short speech in which he offered condolences to all Shiites on the martyrdom of Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him). Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our respected readers to the detailed proceedings. Kemal Daneshyar, Deputy From Bandar-e Mahshahr The roots of inflation and high prices include the failure to control the prices of goods and the failure to deal decisively with violators. The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Daneshyar, deputy from Bandar-e Mahshahr. During his speech he said: The most important economic problem is inflation and high prices. Most of that was unavoidable and inevitable, but unfortunately, contradictory and extremist economic policies and extremism and excesses have had their effects in this matter. An example worth mentioning is the previous government's severe and extreme approach to the imposition of price controls, compared to the policy of deregulation and releasing prices to float in the current government. Continuing, he said: Supervision, monitoring, price setting, and dealing with violators, people selling at high prices, and hoarders must be done as soon as possible in a decisive and calculated way. The speaker then discussed uprooting inflation and high prices. He said: The failure to control the prices of goods; the failure to deal decisively with violators; people selling at high prices and godless hoarders; ostentation; useless expenditures by officials; working too little; promoting the culture of too much consumption; weak management on the part of some executive officials, especially the failure to supervise quality control of the goods produced by domestic industries; the enormous expenses from the imposed war; military reconstruction and preparation in view of the malicious, Satanic qualities of the enemies of Islam; the rapid population increase to double the size of the last decade, along with the rapid increase in the consumer market; the failure to increase the gross national [product] to match the population increase and demand; the destructive effects of the wrong policies of the wretched monarchy's one-product economy; continued economic, military, and political plots by the enemy, especially the reduction in the price of oil and the economic embargo against Iran; are among the factors and roots of inflation and high prices. In this same regard Daneshyar said: It is a very difficult task to determine the percentages of the above factors, inflation and high prices. Continuing, the deputy from Mahshahr said: In view of the destructive and corrupting effects of using Western television programming and using satellite antennas, since in practice no technical or practical procedure has yet been recognized to intercept it, solutions proposed, including prohibiting the use of satellite antennas or strengthening and promoting the spirit of faith among the individuals in society to keep them from watching these destructive programs, definitely will not serve as the final solution. In this same regard, the speaker then added: The Foreign Ministry has proposed via the United Nations and with the help of friendly countries, as a means of protecting the innocence and morality of human beings to prevent the destructive and corrupting effects of television programs broadcast from Western transmitters, to provide and implement restrictions, prohibitions and penalties against those who broadcast this type of vulgar programming. Daneshyar also called upon the Shiite and Sunni clergy and the clergy of other religions of the book, especially the Christian clergy, to act jointly to confront this destructive cultural invasion. The deputy from Mahshahr then discussed the consolidation of the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade and the Ministry of Agriculture. He said: In view of the fact that this proposal has weakened the performance of these two ministries, I propose, since most of the deputies are opposed to the motion to consolidate the two ministries, that this matter be taken off the agendas of the commissions and the Majles as soon as possible and that these debates be put to an end. Continuing, the speaker discussed the problems in his electoral district. He said: In view of the reduced precipitation and the drought in the region, I ask the officials and especially the minister of agriculture and the chief of the Agriculture Bank to help the farmers and to allocate banking resources. Likewise, the important roads in the municipality of Mahshahr, including the freeway from Bandar-e Emam to Ahvaz, the freeway from Bandar-e Emam to Mahshahr, and the road from Omidiyeh to Ahvaz are causing problems because of their poor quality, and I ask the minister of roads and transportation to deal with the matter. In conclusion, the deputy from Mahshahr asked Mr. Karbasian, chief of the Social Security Organization, to expedite construction of the Omidiyeh Hospital, which was planned under the First Five-Year Plan and is proceeding slowly. Jahanshah Sadiq, Deputy From Dorud And Azna In designing the Second Five-Year Plan the Majles must keep society's low-income classes in mind. The next speaker was Sadiq, deputy from Dorud and Azna. He offered condolences on the occasion of the martyrdom anniversary of His Holiness Emam Javad (peace be upon him) and discussed the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: In this regard, friend and foe are watching the Majles and are waiting for the results of the Majles studies. Fortunately, in this regard the Majles has lighting its way the guidance from the exalted leader as an important element of support. Naturally, it must keep the affairs of the oppressed and low-income classes of society in mind at every stage. In addition to that it must strive in every way possible to reduce dependence on oil revenues in the Second Five-Year Plan, which has become an implement in the hands of the enemies of the Islamic Republic of Iran as a destructive political item. This cannot be done without increasing nonoil exports, and comprehensive government and Majles support must be given to domestic products, especially the production of crops and products that can definitely be produced in the country but that are imported with excessive foreign exchange expenditures. He added: A fundamental question today is, are we going to repeat the same mistake that was made under the First Five-Year Plan, which is giving excessive support to industry while remaining indifferent to investment in the agricultural sector? There is no doubt that investment to a reasonable extent in the industrial sector is both necessary and inevitable, but which industry? He added: Isn't it true that nonoil exports from the agricultural sector were 123 percent of the target set in the First Five-Year Plan, and yet exports in the other industries, especially in the industrial sector, did not even reach 50 percent of expectations? If, despite all the unkindness towards the agricultural sector, this sector was able to achieve all the goals set for it in the First Five-Year Plan, it is because today we have the message from the agricultural sector that investment in this sector is the most reasonable step to which we must give attention. Continuing his remarks, Sadiq said: Unlike industry, agriculture is instantly obedient to the nation's executive system. The production line can be changed any instant. It can be planned in accordance with the nation's needs, while to change the production line in industrial factories requires changing many of the systems prevailing in the factory and the expenditure of huge sums. To give attention to the agricultural sector is to apply the guidance from the late Imam about making efforts to achieve the nation's self-sufficiency and obeying the guidance from the leader of the revolution about giving attention to agriculture, and nothing other than this is expected from the Majles. He then discussed the decisions made concerning this province by the president of the republic and the exalted leader during their recent trip. He said: The people of Lorestan are joyous about the attention from the exalted leader and the president of the republic in the framework of the success implementing the projects and programs to save the province from deprivation. However, making the successes, which have been achieved, requires effort, persistence, and expeditious measures by the respected ministers and the relevant executive organizations, and the people continue to watch them expectantly. We have said repeatedly that the petrochemical and refinery complexes were to have been built in Lorestan, but unfortunately the justification is not clear for moving this project to Arak, when it could have solved many of the problems of the province of Lorestan. The deputy from Dorud and Azna asked officials to provide gas service to Lorestan, and he discussed the efforts by the minister of the interior to elevate Azna to a municipality and the president of the republic's agreement. He said: The lands given to staff employees and educators have remained in their hands due to the preparation project. They have sold much of their furniture and resources to pay the fees to prepare the land, yet they are still unable to do the preparation work. Seyyed Hoseyn Hashemi, Deputy From Miyaneh The Second Five-Year Plan must clearly specify the goals of privatization. The third preagenda speaker was Hashemi, deputy from Miyaneh. In his speech he discussed the aggression against Muslims in the world. He said: The imperialist world has made a serious decision in different ways to weaken the Muslim world, and to prevent in any way possible the expansion of the ideas of revolutionary Islam and the Islam of Muhammad (peace be upon him). On the other hand, despite all the imperialistic effort, every day we see more harmony in the Islamic nation and the expansion of this great Islamic thinking everywhere in the world. He condemned the PLO treaty with Israel and discussed the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: Although we had good successes implementing the First Five-Year Plan in the agricultural, industrial and mining sectors, these successes reduced our need for imports in many areas. A more desirable process must be implemented in studying these experiences and careful expert work in the Second Five-Year Plan. He added: An example is the policies in the system for alleviating deprivation in the nation's deprived and underdeveloped areas, which is being done to implement social justice. It is appropriate to give special attention to this in the Second Five-Year Plan, taking inspiration from the views of the exalted leader. We can guide capital into these areas by making appropriate policies such as special tax and insurance exemptions and special allocations for service lines, water prices, consumer electrical power, and providing banking facilities on easier terms and at lower fees. Concerning the matter of privatization, he noted: The transfer of government units in the current way, mostly by organizations, bodies, banks and other entities, each of which is a part of the nation's public system, will not bring us to our goal in this regard. Therefore, the Second Five-Year Plan must clearly specify the goal of privatization. Is it to eliminate private sector currency in circulation, or to start up new units and transfer existing government units? He discussed the use of existing capacities, completing half-complete units and rebuilding government and private units and building them anew. He said: These units must have a specific policy throughout the Second Five-Year Plan, one of which must be regarding exports as the main key to solving the production problem, and that needs a special policy to support exports in the Second Five-Year Plan. Especially with the unification of the foreign exchange rate, a good process has been set in motion, but it is not enough. We have had little success in the area of manufactured industrial goods such as capital and intermediate goods. Continuing, the deputy from Miyaneh discussed the consolidation of the industrial ministries. He said: I do not consider the current effort to consolidate as being appropriate. I recommend that in the first phase the Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of Heavy Industries be consolidated and that the Ministry of Mines and Metals operate independently for a time so it can find its place in the nation's economy, especially in the area of nonoil exports. Jamshid Qanbarian, Deputy From Miyaneh It is hoped that with the activation of the Azerbaijan Steel Complex Project the problem of employment in the area will be solved. Another preagenda speaker was Qanbarian, deputy from Miyaneh. He expressed thanks for the appointment of Mr. Hamedi as Friday Imam of Miyaneh and offered congratulations on the arrival of Teacher Day. He said: One of the region's main problems is absolute unemployment and intense emigration. Unfortunately every year several villages are emptied of their residents because of this same emigration, in such a way that this region now has negative population growth. He added: The only solution is to create employment in the area, and it is hoped that with the activation of the Azarbaijan Steel Complex project this social problem will be solved in the area. In the same regard I give the utmost thanks to the exalted leader for his comprehensive support for solving the executive problems in this project. He thanked the Ministry of Petroleum for its success implementing the project to deliver gas service to Miyaneh, he thanked the minister of post, telegraph and telephone concerning the unstinting activities of the ministry's officials in the region to meet telephone communications needs and the president of the republic's Deprived Regions Office for granting recognition as deprived regions to the villages in the warm southern region. He then said: Due to the lack of an active police presence throughout the roads and freeways, the drivers of tractor-trailer rigs and heavy trucks have destroyed driving security without police monitoring. Every day tens of innocent people lose their lives on these roads, and the minister of the interior is expected to pay special attention to this matter. Faramarz Golshani, Deputy From Rudbar What makes the earthquake victims happy is having officials in their midst. The final preagenda speaker was Golshani, deputy from Rudbar. He discussed the passage of four years since the Rudbar earthquake and the approaching anniversary for this disaster. He said: The only thing that makes the people happy is having national officials in their midst. Last year the speaker of the Majles and deputies and officials came, and this year we are also to have the honor of their presence. They will see the great reconstruction that has begun at the government's capable hands and to help alleviate the shortages. The speaker discussed the president of the republic's impending trip to Rudbar. Continuing, he discussed the shortages in this earthquake-stricken municipality. 1. There are still 65 schools that were destroyed by the earthquake and have not yet been rebuilt, and the students from these schools are studying in Suleh and in inappropriate places. 2. Sixtyy-six of the municipality's rural areas lack electrical power, 96 rural areas lack sanitary drinking water, and 200 kilometers of rural roads are also in need of asphalt. 3. Fifty percent of the credits to build 84 mosques, 31 of which are under construction, is needed. 4. The financial situation of the people is such that there is no possibility of meeting the expenses of municipal government through normal revenues. Therefore, urban development needs reinforcement of the tax base. 5. Continuing, he added: Inadequate allocations of loans and materials for home construction and other problems have caused most housing units for earthquake victims to be abandoned after 70 to 80 percent completion. Therefore, loans of at least 200 million rials for each urban and rural family would complete half-complete homes. 6. The people of the municipality are from the low-income classes, and in view of the extensive losses the earthquake has brought to them, they are unable to repay pre-earthquake housing and business loans. Mr. Golshani asked for loan forgiveness and also for the extension of repayment periods on postearthquake loans until the end of the year 1373 [20 March 1975]. Continuing, the speaker added: The 100-bed Rudbar hospital was destroyed by the earthquake, and the current hospital has been created in Suleh. It does not have the appropriate quality and is in need of credit procurement. The cities of Rudbar, Rostamabad, Manjil, and Lushan lack a suitable drinking water network, and the cities within the municipality's boundaries do not have a sewage system. Credits need to be obtained to fight pestilence, irrigate date trees and plant rice in the area and to rebuild the cities. The speaker continued: Before the earthquake about 1 million loans existed in the municipality, and this number has decreased to one-quarter of that figure. Livestock keepers are in need of serious support. Despite the fact that the minister of petroleum has broken ground for the project, construction work on providing gas service to the cities of Rudbar, Rostamabad and Tut-e Kabon has yet to begin. At the end of his speech he said: I ask that when the president of the republic comes to the area these projects be supported and receive financial assistance. Legislation The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the first consultation of the Agriculture Commission on the motion to create the Supreme Agriculture and Rural Development Council, the general form of which was not approved and was rejected. It is worth mentioning that in the aforementioned motion, the duties of the Supreme Agriculture Council were described as follows: "Dealing with executive problems in the programs pertaining to the agricultural sector, supervision of the performance of programs in the agricultural sector, supervision of the procurement and organization of statistics and information having to do with the agricultural sector's needs and supervision of their precise implementation, policy making to create conversion industries and installations to store agricultural crops, supervision of the timely procurement of credits and facilities for the agricultural sector, and other things." One of the reasons used by those opposing this proposal is that there is no reason to put the various sectors in the hands of a council. What good have the existing councils done for the people? Therefore, the councils do not solve any problems, they create problems. Likewise, the supporters claim that it is necessary to have a council led by the president of the republic to support agriculture, in order to solve these problems that exist. The second item on the agenda was the report from the Supreme Education Council concerning the Bill To Amend Article 2 of the Law on Procedures for Procuring Faculty Needed at the Nation's Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning, enacted in 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987], the general form of which was put to a vote and approved. Article 1 of the bill states: "The phrase `and animal husbandry' is added after the phrase `medical group fields' in the text of Article 2 of the Law on Procedures for Procuring Faculty Needed at the Nation's Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning, enacted 3/1/1365 [22 May 1986]." It is also worth mentioning that professors in the animal husbandry fields may, as in the medical group fields, make use of the facilities and benefits in this law, and this will have a striking effect in raising the level of quality in this field. The next item on the agenda was the report from the Commerce Commission concerning the Bill To Amend Note 1, Article 5, of the Law Amending the Guild System Law Enacted 2/31/1368 [21 May 1989]. The amendment to this bill says: "Within one year of the date this law's enforcement becomes obligatory, all the companies subject to the Guild System Law are required to obtain business licenses from the relevant union. Newly established companies are required within one year of their registration to obtain a business from the relevant union in order to begin operations." The fourth item on the agenda was the report from the First Consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission Concerning the Motion To Suspend the Period of Obligatory Service for Graduates from the Judicial Affairs Colleges in the Nation's Public Prosecutor's Offices and Judicial Courts, continued consideration of which was postponed to the next session. The aforementioned motion states: "Under this law, graduates from the judicial affairs colleges affiliated with the Ministry of Justice of the Islamic Republic of Iran who have not performed their service as soldiers, upon the recommendation of the judicial power and with the agreement of the General Armed Forces Staff, provided they commit to at least five years of service in the judicial power, are exempt from service under the flag in peacetime after the completion of the commitment." Arrival Announced of Question From a Number of Deputies Concerning the Reason for Increasing Telephone Rates Arrival was announced of the question from a number of deputies, including Sharifi, deputy from Arak; Tavakoli, deputy from Khomeyn; Yusefpur, deputy from Ardel and Fars; Majidi, deputy from Fasa; and Noruzi, deputy from Molayer; to the minister of post, telegraph and telephone concerning the reason for the collection from telephone service subscribers of telephone tariffs in excess of the amount approved by the Majles. Weekly Programs of Majles Commissions Introduction: Printed below for your consideration are the weekly programs of the Majles commissions this week. Education and Training Commission Study of the Motion To Supervise Foreign Trips by Government Workers Islamic Guidance and Art and Media Communications Commission Invitation to the insiders in the Sacred Defense Cinema Society Plan and Budget Commission Study of the nonoil exports sector in the Second Five-Year Plan Motion To Control the Prices of Goods and Services Labor and Social Affairs Commission Motion To Prohibit the Use of Western Terms, Names, and Expressions National Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission Continued study of the articles from the Bill on Employment Regulations for the Police Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Post, Telegraph and Power Affairs Commission Invitation to Engineer Gharazi to answer the question from a number of deputies concerning communications and postal tariffs Majles Notes Presentation of the Question to the Minister of Mines and Metals Concerning the Performance of the Mobarakeh Steel Complex Next week the question from the deputy from Hamadan to the minister of mines and metals concerning the Mobarakeh Steel Complex and its affiliated complexes will be on the open Majles agenda. In this regard Mr. Habibian told our parliamentary correspondent: I submitted three questions for the Majles to the minister of mines and metals. The first question asks about the level of steel production and to what extent it conforms to the goals in the First Five-Year Plan. In this regard there are indications that performance was not in accordance with the First Five-Year Plan. In the commission the respected minister of mines and metals was also asked to provide information about this sector, but so far, about a month later, the necessary information has not been made available to us. The second question is about the procedure for selling steel, and the question is, have the domestic markets been saturated, that steel is now being exported? The third question, which is more important and worries us more, is the question of steel shipments. In recent months these shipments have gone to parts of the world such as China to be sold and have then returned to the country after a time, and in this regard large sums have been paid for demurrage (reparations paid for losses caused by shipping delays). Majles Oversight of Nonessential Foreign Trips Concerning Majles oversight of nonessential foreign trips, which will be done based on Note 13 of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] National Budget Law, Mr. Beytollah Ja'fari, deputy from Urmia, told our correspondent: The motivation for Majles oversight is that we want to be able to study and make decisions concerning the number of people going and whether or not the trip will have positive effects for the country in terms of its essential purpose. According to the general evaluation that was made, the number of delegations sent abroad was in excess of the number necessary and in most cases ancillary tasks were undertaken beyond the main goals of the trip, and this has caused the imposition of millions of dollars in nonessential expenditures on the nation's budget.
