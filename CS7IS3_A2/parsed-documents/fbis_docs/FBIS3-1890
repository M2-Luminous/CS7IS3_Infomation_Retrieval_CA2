Chinese Constitution clearly stipulates that all the power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. According to the Constitution, the Chinese citizens enjoy extensive political, economic, cultural and social rights. They also enjoy various kinds of freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, press, assembly, demonstration and religious believes, etc. The Constitution provides for the equality of all the 56 nationalities in the country irrespective of their population sizes and prohibits oppression of and discrimination against any nationality. In the light of its own specific conditions in the country, the Chinese Government is stepping up efforts to build up democracy and legal system with the view to further promoting social development and upholding the people's rights and interests. Like many other countries, in contemporary history China was subjected to aggression and plundering by foreign powers. Before 1949, the Chinese people were for a long time victims to the enslavement and oppression in the hands of imperialists, feudalists and bureaucratic-capitalists. They lived in dire misery without any human right or fundamental freedom at all. Since the founding of New China, the Chinese Government has been working to uphold national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and attaches great importance to safeguarding the rights of the Chinese people to subsistence and to development. Over the past four decades, China has scored widely-acknowledged successes in its economic construction. Particularly since the adoption of the policy of reform and opening-up to the outside world in the late 1970s, China has been developing its economy at a fast pace, making a steady improvement in the people's living standard. Chinese citizens today enjoy much more human rights and fundamental freedoms than anytime in the past. This fact has been acknowledged by all unbiased persons. China is a developing country with a huge population. In spite of the significant progress made in all field through decades of efforts, we are still faced with many problems. Because of disparities of development level among regions, some regions in the country are falling far behind others. The country has a net population growth of about fifteen to sixteen millions per year. Overpopulation has reduced the ratio of resources for each person. Bearing in mind those hard facts, the Chinese Government has always accorded primary importance to the development of its national economy and the improvement of the people's living standard. The development of economy and the improvement of the people's living conditions is a basic guarantee for greater enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Political reform must conform to the country's specific conditions, ensure social stability and promote smooth economic development. At present, the Chinese people are focusing their energy on economic development, meanwhile endeavoring to strengthen democracy and legal system and carrying out political reform. In view of different historical and cultural backgrounds and different stages of development of different countries, we hold that all people have the right to choose the social systems and development paths suitable to the conditions of their own countries. No country should impose on others its own ideology and development pattern. In the field of human rights, we believe that in the spirit of international cooperation and equal consultations as underlined in the Vienna Declaration and programme of action, all countries should strive for greater understanding and broader cooperation by means of dialogue on the basis of equal footing and mutual respect. We are strongly opposed to any interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state or the exertion of political pressures under the pretext of human rights. Some Western countries, in repeatedly concocting a draft resolution on the so called human rights situation in China, are deliberately turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to China's progress and development and to the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying a broad range of human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is a typical example of politicizing human rights issues and of applying pressures on China under the pretext of human rights. The Chinese Government is firmly opposed to such attempt.
