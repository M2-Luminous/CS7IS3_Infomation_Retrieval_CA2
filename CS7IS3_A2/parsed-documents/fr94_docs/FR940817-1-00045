FR940817-1-00045 FR940817-1-00013 Section 66.79 The proposed §66.79 would establish the competency requirements for applicants attempting to obtain a certificate or rating under this part. This proposed section is based on current §65.79. The proposed revisions to the current section establish a basic competency requirement for an aviation maintenance technician by requiring the applicant to demonstrate competency in performing tasks appropriate to the rating sought. The proposal would also clarify the existing regulation to ensure that an applicant passes both an oral and a practical test appropriate to the rating sought. Section 66.80 The proposed §66.80 prescribes specific requirements for the testing of certified aviation maintenance technician school students. This proposed section is based on current §65.80 with no substantive differences. Section 66.81 The proposed §66.81, based on current §65.81, would define the privileges and limitations of a certificate holder under this part. The proposed revision to the current privileges and limitations of certificate holders would clarify and expand the manner in which an aviation maintenance technician may become qualified to supervise the maintenance, preventive maintenance, or alteration of any aircraft, or approve and return to service any aircraft or appliance, or part thereof, for which that person is rated. The proposal would provide the holder of an aviation maintenance technician certificate with additional means to qualify for the exercise of these privileges. In addition to the means specified in the current §65.81, the holder may exercise the privileges mentioned above if the aviation maintenance technician has received the equipment-specific training or has performed the work under the direct supervision of a certificated and appropriately rated aviation maintenance technician or certificated aviation repair specialist who has also received equipment-specific training. Additionally, the proposal would clarify §65.81 by permitting the holder of an aviation maintenance technician certificate to exercise the privileges of the certificate and ratings by demonstrating the ability to perform the work to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The current regulation requires actual performance of the work. The proposed regulation would require that the work recognized under proposed §66.81 be performed after the individual has been certificated as an aviation maintenance technician. Work performed while an individual is in training for certification as an aviation maintenance technician may not necessarily be of the same quality required for the return to service of an article, and therefore would not be credited toward satisfying the requirements specified in §66.81. The proposal also would require that a certificated aviation maintenance technician understand all current maintenance instructions (as opposed to maintenance manuals) for the specific operation concerned in order to exercise the privileges of the certificate and rating. Section 66.83 The proposed §66.83 would prescribe the specific currency requirements for aviation maintenance technicians. This proposed section is based on current §65.83, Recent experience requirements. The proposal would provide the holder of an aviation maintenance technician certificate with additional means to maintain the currency required to exercise the privileges of the certificate and ratings. In addition to the means currently specified in §65.83(a), the proposal would allow the aviation maintenance technician to maintain the currency required to exercise the privileges of the certificate, if the person served as an aviation maintenance instructor under an aviation maintenance training program acceptable to the Administrator, directly supervised other aviation maintenance instructors, who are serving under an aviation maintenance training program acceptable to the Administrator, or served under the supervision of a certificated aviation maintenance technician. The proposal also would allow the use of any combination of the proposed and current methods to maintain currency. The proposal would create a new subparagraph that would require the successful completion of refresher training or training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician if the individual desires to exercise the privileges of the certificate or ratings for compensation or hire. The refresher training may consist of an aviation maintenance technician refresher course, an inspection authorization course, or a series of courses, acceptable to the Administrator, of not less than 16 hours of instruction. Training appropriate to the work to be performed must also be acceptable to the Administrator and consist of not less than 16 hours of instruction. The proposal would not require all aviation maintenance technicians to complete the new training requirements. An aviation maintenance technician, who within the preceding 24 months exercised the privileges of the certificate and ratings for a certificate holder authorized to operate under the provisions of Parts 121, 127, 135, or for a U.S.-certificated repair station that performed work in accordance with §145.2(a) or conducted a maintenance and preventive maintenance training program, would not be subject to the proposed training requirements. Additionally, aviation maintenance instructors teaching under an aviation maintenance training program that is acceptable to the Administrator need not complete the proposed training requirements. The proposal sets forth an additional provision that would permit the aviation maintenance technician to exercise the privileges of the certificate for compensation or hire if the certificate holder successfully completes a requalification course acceptable to the Administrator.
