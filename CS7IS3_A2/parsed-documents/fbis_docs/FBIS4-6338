FBIS4-6338 "dreas076_h_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Singapore Government Denies U.S. Teenager `Tortured' Government Denies U.S. Teenager `Tortured' BK2004021494 Hong Kong AFP in English 1514 GMT 19 Apr 94 BK2004021494 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Singapore, April 19 (AFP) -- The Singapore Government Tuesday denied US media reports that an American teenager was tortured and forced to confess to acts of vandalism for which he has been ordered caned by a Singapore court. The Ministry of Home Affairs said that a probe by a special police unit carried out in October last year found no evidence to substantiate the claim that 18-year-old Michael Fay from Dayton, Ohio, was abused during interrogation. "The IIS [Internal Investigation Section] investigation revealed no evidence of police abuse," a ministry spokesman said, responding to queries from AFP. The IIS, or Internal Investigation unit, is charged with probing public complaints against the police. The Home Ministry's denial came in the face of escalating media attention on a US demand that Singapore cancel the court order that Fay be given six strokes of a rattan cane, which could leave him permanently scarred. "Michael Fay was examined in hospital and also by doctors who had been examining him daily during his remand. No injury was detected," the spokesman said. The spokesman said that the probe was ordered after the US embassy here lodged a verbal complaint that Fay and two other American boys being similarly investigated for vandalism suffered severe abuse. The US Embassy was given a full account of the probe's findings but "did not respond nor pursue the matter further," the spokesman said. THE NEW YORK TIMES said Monday that Fay had insisted to family and friends that he was forced to confess to spray-painting cars during a police beating, claiming that he was innocent. Fay is serving a four-month jail term at Queenstown Prison while lawyers prepare an appeal for clemency in a bid to get the authorities to drop the painful, potentially skin-splitting lashing. The appeal is expected to reach Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong on Wednesday. The spokesman said that Fay's conviction was based on a guilty plea he entered to charges of spray-painting two cars, pelting the vehicles with eggs and keeping stolen property, not on his confession statement. "In short, the statement had no bearing on Michael Fay's conviction," he said. The spokesman said that allegations that Fay was being singled out for punishment because the government wanted to send a message to Singaporeans about "decadent Western ways" were also unfounded. He said that 14 others, among them two foreigners, were caned for vandalism between 1989 and last year. Another American, a Hongkonger and two Malaysians arrested along with Fay were also facing charges of vandalism. "It is therefore absurd to say that Michael Fay is being singled out, and then concoct some theory to support this allegation," the spokesman said. Fay has drawn extensive publicity since his conviction last month, and Singapore has received appeals urging it to spare the rod from President Bill Clinton, several US senators and human rights groups like Amnesty International. US newspapers have described caning as barbaric, and THE NEW YORK TIMES has urged American multinationals operating here to pressure Singapore to drop the caning.
