International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai may also participate in a signing ceremony, the sources said. The ceremony will take place from April 12 to 15, with representatives from the 118 signatory countries of the Geneva-based GATT and the European Union [EU] taking part, the sources said. During his stay there, Hata is expected to make a speech and meet with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and other cabinet ministers of major Japanese trading partners. The discussions are likely to center on Japan's fresh measures to boost imports the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is planning to adopt soon. Japan's current account surplus reached a record 130 billion dollars last year, the main factor behind its trade disputes with the United States and Europe. On April 14, the sources said, participants at the ceremony will affix signatures to Uruguay Round agreements on agriculture, the mining and manufacturing sector, services, intellectual properties and the setting up of the World Trade Organization (WTO), a successor to GATT. These pacts are likely to take effect next January when the WTO is to be inaugurated, they said. At the final session of the Uruguay Round trade talks, representatives from the 118 countries and the EU may adopt a declaration calling for freer global trade, the sources said.
