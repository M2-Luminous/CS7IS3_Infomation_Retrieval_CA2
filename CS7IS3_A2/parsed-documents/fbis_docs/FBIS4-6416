Mikazuki made the comment at a news conference after 20 cabinet ministers wrapped up a meeting that is expected to be their last get-together under the short-lived Hosokawa administration prior to the imminent selection of a new prime minister. Mikazuki said Hosokawa's fall from grace is due to mounting parliamentary criticism over Hosokawa's "money scandal," in which Hosokawa was blasted by the opposition for receiving 100 million yen as an unreported political donation from a mob-linked trucking group. "It is a very ironic thing" that Hosokawa, who had swept to power on the strength of his public image as an anti-graft crusader, was forced to quit over a string of money scandals, the justice minister said. However, Mikazuki, who is expected to retain his justice post under a new coalition government, vowed to bring to a successful conclusion the ongoing investigation into a spate of bribery scandals involving the nation's top construction firms and politicians. "My mandate is to crack down on money-related political corruption on the basis of laws and evidence, namely to settle the general contractors' bribery scandals in a manner that could win public understanding," he said. Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura is under indictment on a charge of accepting a bribe in exchange for using his influence to deter the Fair Trade Commission from filing a criminal accusation against an alleged bid-rigger. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura encouraged the ruling coalition to wage a successful "restart" on the basis of "reflections" over some blunders committed over the past eight months. He criticized some political forces in the coalition for pushing a proposal to amalgamate all coalition parties into a unified large party or parliamentary group to win an upcoming general election "with an eye to single-seat constituencies." "Momentum to keep the unity of the coalition parties had been in place until the (common) goal of accomplishing political reform was attained," he said at a news conference. Takemura noted that such momentum dissipated quickly as "momentum to disintegrate the coalition rapidly came to the surface" following the enactment of the political reform bills. Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki told a separate news conference the Social Democratic Party is chiefly responsible for the squabbles that provisionally threatened to blow up the unity of the coalition. "The solidarity of coalition parties was undercut as the Social Democratic Party started a race without any training and became short of breath midway," Kanzaki, of Komeito [Clean Government Party], said. The minister was apparently referring to gaps in the coalition between the socialist-led camp and the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-led conservative camp over such key policies as tax system reform and Japan's stand on the proposed economic sanctions on Pyongyang over its suspected nuclear development program.
