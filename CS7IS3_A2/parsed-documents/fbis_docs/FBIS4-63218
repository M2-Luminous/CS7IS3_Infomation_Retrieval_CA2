According to the sources, head of the Russian delegation, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economics Aleksandr Shokhin "due to purely internal circumstances" cannot undertake the trip to Seoul on the aforesaid dates. An appropriate explanation has been conveyed to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. At the same time, a suggestion has been made to hold the session in Moscow before the forthcoming June 1 to 4 visit to Moscow by South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, especially as a number of important problems of economic cooperation between the two states are expected to be discussed at the session on the eve of the high level visit. "We are now waiting for a response to this proposal," the high-ranking Russian diplomat, who wished to remain unidentified, said. He emphasised that the Russian side is deeply interested in holding the commission's session and attaches great significance to it. In turn, sources in the Russian Government told ITAR-TASS that Aleksandr Shokhin could not fly to Seoul, as he has been charged with "very important tasks" by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The possibility of replacing Aleksandr Shokhin by another Vice-Prime Minister Viktor Yarov at the session was also considered. But later it was decided that since Aleksandr Shokhin has a better understanding of the range of problems, it will be "illogical to replace him by another person at the last moment." The informed government sources noted that Aleksandr Shokhin is "fully involved" in making preparations for the visit to Moscow by Kim Yong-sam. For the time being, planned for the next week visit to Beijing by Shokhin remains in force which is to take place directly before the beginning of Viktor Chernomyrdin's official visit to Beijing from May 26 to 29.
