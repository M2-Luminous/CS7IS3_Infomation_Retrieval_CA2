Butrus-Ghali called on Yasushi Akashi to carry out a "preparatory study" in response to a renewed North Atlantic Treaty Organisation warning of air strikes, a United Nations spokesman said here. The study will cover the military and civilian implications of possible attacks by NATO planes, the spokesman added. The decision to use air strikes if deemed necessary -- and if approved by Butrus-Ghali -- was taken at the 16-nation NATO summit in Brussels which ended Tuesday. Alliance leaders warned they might call for air strikes against Bosnian Serb troops to end the 21-month siege of Sarajevo, and force the reopening of Tuzla airport and of the road link to the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica. Earlier Wednesday THE WASHINGTON POST reported Butrus-Ghali sharply rebuked the UN commander in former Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot, for saying in a French newspaper interview he had repeatedly asked the UN chief for authority to order airstrikes. Meanwhile leaders of the international community and ex-Yugoslavia's warring parties remained sceptical about the use of air strikes and over any peace benefits that might accrue from such an intervention. In Prague US president Bill Clinton said prospects for peace in Bosnia had diminished as "for the first time all three parties seem to believe they have something to gain by fighting," and that a political settlement was currently "difficult" to envisage. In Paris French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Butrus-Ghali has promised that planned actions by UN troops in Tuzla and Srebrenica would proceed "as quickly as possible." But Juppe added "It is not a matter of launching air raids against Tuzla or Srebrenica," but primarily of ensuring the safety of troops in those areas. The countries contributing troops for these missions -- Britain, Canada and Denmark -- were divided Wednesday over the issue of air strikes. British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told BBC radio London was "unenthusiastic" about air strikes and wanted NATO to show great caution before resorting to that option. Rifkind said: "One has to be very cautious indeed about the use of air power, precisely because... we have forces on the ground." The Canadians had also expressed great caution, he added. And British Prime Minister John Major told MPs he declined to extend Britain's commitment of troops to help with UN humanitarian aid in Bosnia until their security could be guaranteed. But in Copenhagen, Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said Danish UN troops were "ready for Serb attacks in case of NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions in Bosnia." And a Danish Defence Ministry official told AFP that 10 Danish tanks and 36 Swedish armoured vehicles blocked by Bosnian Serb forces in Pancevo, Serbia -- along with 300 Danish and Swedish soldiers -- since October were ready to proceed to Tuzla, their final destination, by "indirect routes." Meanwhile in Sarajevo, where at least seven civilians were killed and 49 wounded Tuesday, Ejup Ganic, the nominal vice president of Bosnia, told AFP the NATO declaration contained "certain aspects which lead us to think things will go better" for the Moslem-dominated Bosnian side. But he added that he failed to see "when and under which circumstances" air strikes could be carried out. The city's OSLOBODJENJE daily said the city's mainly Moslem population was sceptical, and that the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army "would suffer nothing but harm if it trusted the NATO threat." The scepticism was echoed in Belgrade, where Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, a spokesman for the army of rump Yugoslavia -- comprising Serbia and Montenegro -- told the Bosnian Serb SRNA agency that air strikes were not very likely because no accord exists on how they should be carrried out." He added that any foreign intervention would only "exacerbate the war." Butrus-Ghali had admitted Wednesday in an interview with French daily LE FIGARO that he had "no idea" how NATO air strikes could be put into effect.
