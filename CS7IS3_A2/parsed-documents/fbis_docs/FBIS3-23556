It will have to be guerilla warfare." This is how Aleksey Shulunov, president of the League for Assisting Defense Enterprises, ended our nighttime conversation. It was published by PRAVDA 19 January. A month has passed. Reflections in the upper echelons are turning the defense industry and conversion into abandoned salt mines. Guerilla warfare is becoming slave labor. The mass stoppage of defense enterprises has begun. As a sign of protest? No, Russia's armorers, in line with their centuries-old traditions of selfless service to the fatherland, are not contemplating a strike. It is just that the majority of production units have been rendered insolvent. Certain high-ranking compatriots and foreign consultants suggest that this is the outcome of unwise moves in an over-hasty conversion process. But the old defense complex in its current form is no longer a military-industrial complex. Some 80 percent of its output is civilian. Moreover, in a number of sectors this output is capable of competing on the world market. The point is, it seems, that it is not the actual enterprises which have been rendered insolvent but the state. When summing up the results of 1993, it was made clear that our government has a striking talent for tightfistedness. It has managed to run up debts to the defense sector amounting not to the 700 billion rubles [R] mentioned previously, but to R1.5 trillion. And given that the matter has not gone as far as the courts (the Prosecutor's Office has enough riddles from the past to solve), there is no hurry to advance state defense orders for 1994, or, more especially, to release credits for conversion projects. Moreover, in this year's budget submitted by the Ministry of Finance, allocations for national defense needs continue to be pared to a minimum. They have been reduced to 46 percent of last year's level. It should be noted that this calculation is not in dollars, but in rubles. When converted into world currency, it will amount in all to just 10 percent of last years's state expenditure. Unlike the fledgling entrepreneurs, armaments workers can do their sums with the utmost accuracy. Otherwise Russia would not still be in possession of advanced military hardware. So it is that by their estimation -- which is apt and unbiased -- all these things signify the total destruction of the country's defense complex. Savings in this sphere have already surpassed what is feasible: The average wage in Russia last year was R58,400, while defense sector workers earned just R28,400. And although they grumbled, they remained patient, understanding that pre-market battles are being waged. But now, in just three or four months, around 20 million people will find themselves completely bereft of the means to survive. The consequences of this type of social explosion are unpredictable. Especially as it is not clear where the government will find trillions of rubles to meet the costs of driving this mass of the most highly skilled workers, designers, and technicians into unemployment. Or has the government drafted decrees to defer all this as state debts over the next five years or so? The conversion of defense enterprises is becoming nonsensical. Taxes, price deregulation, interest rates for bank credits, duties, and other government deductions reduce the capacity of the domestic market and artificially generate a sales crisis. The living standards of 90 percent of the population and people's purchasing power are at the lowest possible level. When fighting for survival, who needs household gadgets, crockery, television sets, motorcycles, bicycles, sewing machines, and so on and so forth? Efforts to survive at the expense of the export of military hardware and arms have come to nothing. Moreover, the matter no longer concerns the sale of the latest weapons, but annual assistance in the safe operation of nationally produced combat hardware purchased not so long ago by the countries of Asia and Africa, and being used with relish by the states of Europe. Russia could earn around $5 billion for the prompt supply of spare parts alone. Furthermore, many of these armaments are in need of upgrading. For instance, it is time to reequip combat aircraft with the latest missiles and more accurate weapon sights. However, according to information received, the Israelis and the British are already mounting French and U.S. missiles onto our MiG-21's. Whereas copyright dictates that Russian missiles be used. But our government's inconsistency in military trade forces foreign consumers to disregard Russian rights. The result is depressing. Last year, the value of sales for routine repair work, and exports of consumables and spare parts was just $2.2 billion, instead of $5 billion. Meanwhile, the impact of last fall's decision to set up the new "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, which is subordinate not to the Defense Ministry, nor to the State Committee for the Defense Industry, and not even to the government head, but to the President, was felt. And what came of this was not state discretion, but utter confusion which goes above and beyond secrecy. The League for Assisting Defense Enterprises deemed it necessary to discuss ways of implementing the laws proclaimed by the Constitution. At the beginning of February it convened an enlarged session of its presidium. This involved leaders of the League's regional branches from Moscow, Nizhnyy Novgorod, Tula, Rostov-na-Donu, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Saratov. And the directors of the largest enterprises from Moscow and Bryansk regions. There was even an envoy from St. Petersburg, even though it is still undecided there whether to join the league or operate autonomously. First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin traveled to the conference, as did Yuriy Glybin and Gennadiy Yampolskiy, deputy chairmen of the State Committee for the Military Industry; Security Council Commission Chairman Mikhail Maley; and even Viktor Samoylov, manager of the newborn "Rosvooruzheniye." There were almost 60 of the most authoritative and knowledgeable slave laborers of Russia's defense industry. Journalists, unfortunately, did not have the chance to attend the conference. However, according to the testimony of visiting participants, who did not touch upon secret matters, the industrialists themselves were able to exchange all the details of their enterprises' impending period of slave labor. They coincided absolutely. And they outlined the formidable impasse of the world's largest industry. Then they demanded explanations: After all, Premier Chernomyrdin gave instructions that last year's state debts should be repaid by 1 February. But so far not a single ruble, not even a defunct kopek, has been forthcoming. Andrey Kokoshin admitted that absolutely nothing was paid out in January. But the Defense Ministry will pay off at least 60 percent of its debts in the first quarter. Payments will start as of 10 February. At the same time he announced that he intends to petition the government to increase budget expenditure on defense. But whichever way you look at it, there are as yet no guarantees. Viktor Samoylov for his part brushed aside the urgency of the need to supply spare parts abroad and service our military hardware sold there. He stressed that it is not worth discussing this yet, as it is a very complex question. Yuriy Glybin noted that many problems have accumulated, but that it is necessary to concentrate on one: The oddities of the budget proposed by the Ministry of Finances. Finally, Mikhail Maleyev revealed that the Security Council has in fact examined the requests, demands, and proposals submitted by defense enterprises back in November. And in the course of just two hours, everything was resolved successfully. The president confirmed his council's decisions. But although the instructions issued under these decision were addressed to specific individuals, nobody is in any hurry to act upon them, and some have no intention of carrying them out. The time might be ripe if not to start legal proceedings, then at least to apply some form of punishment.... The results? There are none as yet. A letter was sent to Government First Deputy Chairman Oleg Soskovets on behalf of the league 14 February. It stressed: "We earnestly request that you take all measures within your power...to support the prioritypsectors of the country's economy. We consider it essential that the funds allocated to defense needs in 1994 should exceed the level of planned allocations for 1993 in comparable prices by a factor of 1.3 at the very least." It was signed by the chief designers of nine of the largest science and production complexes and associations, including "MiG," "Antey," the A.A. Tupolev Aviation Science and Technology Complex, the "Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau," and others. Oleg Nikolayevich showed an interest. A meeting was set for 16 February. But it did not take place. Soskovets was occupied with urgent matters until late into the evening. A new week began. Will something happen today, or tomorrow?... Admittedly, the hope remains that after the President's message to parliament opening the discussion by the People's Deputies of the budget for this year, the chance will emerge to take account of the league's appeal, which was handed over to State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin. People, while you stll have your senses, save your fatherland. Do not repeat the experience of Slovakia.
