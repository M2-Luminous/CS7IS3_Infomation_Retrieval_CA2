FR941117-1-00011 FR941117-1-00004 The psychiatric L 21 benefit, at section 1905(a)(16) of the Act, is the only statutory exception to the IMD exclusion. The psychiatric L 21 benefit is optional, and it is currently covered under 41 State plans. The psychiatric L 21 benefit must, however, be provided in all States to those individuals who are determined during the course of an Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) screen to need this type of inpatient psychiatric care. Under the EPSDT provisions at section 1905(r)(5) of the Act, as amended by section 6403 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public Law 101&hyph;239, States must provide any service listed in section 1905(a) of the Act that is needed to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental conditions discovered by EPSDT screening services, whether or not the service is covered under the State plan. While some inpatient psychiatric services can be provided in the psychiatric units of general hospitals as ``inpatient hospital services'' under section 1905(a)(1) of the Act, the services provided under the psychiatric L 21 benefit, and which meet the regulatory requirements in subpart D of part 441, must also be available for children and adolescents who are determined to need these services as a result of an EPSDT screen. Because of the section 1905(r)(5) requirement, even States that do not elect to include the optional psychiatric L 21 benefit in their State plans must be aware of its provisions so that inpatient psychiatric services can be provided to EPSDT-eligible individuals who are determined to require them. Under current law, Medicaid payment for psychiatric services can be available under a variety of services and settings listed in section 1905(a) of the Act. Optional inpatient psychiatric services are available for individuals age 65 or over in IMDs which are inpatient hospitals or nursing facilities (section 1905(a)(14) of the Act). Payment is available for medically necessary inpatient psychiatric services provided to Medicaid recipients of all ages in general hospitals, since such hospitals are typically not IMDs. Outpatient psychiatric services can be covered in the outpatient hospital setting or under the optional clinic or rehabilitative services benefits (see sections 1905(a)(2)(A), 1905(a)(9) and 1905(a)(13) of the Act). Finally, the physicians' service benefit under section 1905(a)(5)(A) of the Act can include psychiatrists' services. Under section 1905(a) of the Act, Medicaid payment is available for case management services, as defined in section 1915(g)(2) of the Act, which can be used to coordinate needed mental health services. Case management services assist individuals in gaining access to needed medical, social, educational, and other services. Moreover, under section 1915(g)(1), such case management services may be targeted to chronically mentally ill persons. Although coverage of case management services is generally optional for States, the case management services under section 1905(a)(19) must be provided under the EPSDT authority cited above if the need for these services is discovered during an EPSDT screen (see section 1905 (r)(5)). Section 4722 of OBRA '90 amended section 1905(a) of the Act to provide that no service shall be excluded from the definition of ``medical assistance'' solely because it is provided as a treatment service for alcoholism or drug dependency. (Under the International Classification of Diseases, which HCFA relies on for classification purposes, alcoholism and chemical dependency are classified as mental disorders.) This provision does not override the IMD exclusion, nor does it require a State to include chemical dependency treatment under any other optional benefit unless it chooses to do so.
