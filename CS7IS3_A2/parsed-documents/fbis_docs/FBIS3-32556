The government is bidding to offset a drop in revenues caused by the planned elimination of the value-added tax (VAT) that is levied on all consumers. President Caldera has called the VAT "an unfair burden on the less fortunate classes." The VAT, which went into effect in January and later was temporarily suspended until 28 February, will continue to be levied on importers and wholesalers. As for consumers, the VAT will be replaced by a tax on luxury goods. A tax of 18-20 percent will be levied on a lengthy list of items that includes cellular telephones, television sets, motorcycles, planes, helicopters, yachts, jewelry, thoroughbreds and race horses, fighting bulls, and five-star hotels. The government already approved a 10-percent reduction in the national budget, which according to the original draft amounts to about 1.5 trillion bolivares (about $15.5 billion), to offset the impact caused by the partial elimination of the VAT. This $1.5-billion reduction would basically affect funds earmarked for nonpriority public works. These works, however, would not be completely halted, because a system of concessions would be implemented to promote the direct participation of the private sector. If these measures do not suffice to balance fiscal accounts, which are currently estimated to show a deficit of about 500 billion bolivares (about $5.1 billion) by year's end, the government would consider the possibility of levying a tax on banking operations. This tax, which was included in the early plans by some Caldera advisers, has been postponed for now, but governmental sources pointed out that it could be implemented by mid-1994 if the desired results are not achieved by that time through the initial measures. At any rate, budget cuts, new taxes, and the partial elimination of the VAT must all be approved by Congress, where President Caldera lacks sound support and where it is feared that he might find strong opposition.
