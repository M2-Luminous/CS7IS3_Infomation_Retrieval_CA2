In regard to the Security Council resolution, Israel hopes it will pave the way for the resumption of these talks. Israel was first to condemn the horrendous massacre in Hebron and will continue to take decisive action against extremists and dangerous elements. Israel will encourage any measures to restore stability in the territories -- as far as they are in conformity with the DOP -- and do its utmost to carry out its responsibility for the security of all Arabs and Israelis in the territories. Finally, Israel's position on Jerusalem is well known: Jerusalem is and will be the united capital of Israel. Any reference to it as part of the territories is unacceptable.
