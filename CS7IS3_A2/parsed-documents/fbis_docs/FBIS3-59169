In addition to national defense, it will in the future participate in the NATO reaction forces and in UN missions. "Not very big, but topnotch." This motto, which has been taking quite a battering in the course of the cutbacks taking place all over, could also serve as a campaign slogan of the Royal Danish Air Force. Unlike other countries, however, it appears that Denmark may also be able to turn this idea into reality. Here, too, of course, there is a need to economize and to reduce in size, but the objective of keeping the combat effectiveness of the Kongelige Danske Flyvevabnet at a high level is not being overlooked in the process. Organizational belt-tightening and cutbacks in personnel, together with alert unit reductions in surface-to-air missile units, are to help keep the impact on the quality of the flying component as small as possible. Nevertheless, this component, too, must accept a quantitative decrease. Following the deactivation already in 1992 of the Saab F-35 Draken-equipped 725th Squadron, the second of the two Draken squadrons formerly stationed in Karup ceased its flying operations at the end of 1993, thus making the Flyvevabnet a purely F-16 Air Force. Until 31 December, the 729th Squadron still had the dual role of reconnaissance and fighter-bomber unit, which it carried out with a mix of F-35 fighter-bombers, RF-35 reconnaissance aircraft, and TF-35 trainers. As of 1 January 1994, the reconnaissance role will go to the 726th Squadron in Aalborg; a reconnaissance pod developed by Danish industry will provide the F-16 with the necessary capabilities. Aalborg is home to two F-16 squadrons. In addition to the 726th Squadron, the 723d Squadron is also stationed here in the northern part of Jutland. The other two Fighting Falcon units of the Flyvevabnet, the 727th Squadron and the 730th Squadron, fly their missions out of Skrydstrup. All four squadrons utilize their F-16A both as fighters and as fighter-bombers, and additionally assigned to each squadron are a number of F-16B as combat trainers. Officially, an F-16 training unit as such does not exist: In Skrydstrup, however, there is a training component for the retraining of new F-16 pilots, in which flight instructors from all the Fighting Falcon squadrons have been drawn together. Of the originally assigned 54 F-16A and 16 F-16B, 63 still exist. Five single-seaters and two twin-seaters were lost during accidents. Three used Fighting Falcons are to be newly procured as replacements for the aircraft that were lost; the purchase of seven more is being considered. To this end, Denmark is currently negotiating with the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States. From 1994 on, all Danish F-16 aircraft will undergo the multinational midlife-update program which is being carried out by the original F-16-operating countries Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States, since the Fighting Falcon are, after all, to remain in service with the Flyvevabnet for another 20 years or so. Only of limited size is the transport and SAR [search-and-rescue] component of the Flyvevabnet, which is based in Vaerloese near Copenhagen. The 721st Squadron has three Lockheed C-130H Hercules and three Grumman Gulfstream III assigned for transport missions, as well as a number of Saab T-17 Supporters as liaison aircraft; eight Sikorsky S-61A Sea King helicopters fly search-and-rescue missions for the 722d Squadron. Search-and-rescue field detachments are located at Aalborg and Skrydstrup, each with one Sea King permanently assigned. In addition, one S-61 is stationed at Roenne on the island of Bornholm in the winter. The air transport fleet is tailored to the special geographic situation of the territories belonging to Denmark; aside from tactical air transport operations, it also monitors fishing operations in the area of Greenland. The flying school of the Royal Danish Air Force, in which classification training of future pilots is carried out with T-17 aircraft, was reassigned on 1 February 1993 from Avnoe to Karup. Following their screening at the flying school, students qualified for jet aircraft go to Sheppard in Texas to undergo the Euro-NATO joint jet pilot training program. For Denmark as well as most of the other NATO countries of Europe, participation in this program continues to be the most economical and most effective means to train their jet pilots. There are no female jet pilots in the Flyvevabnet as yet; there are, however, female helicopter pilots for the Westland Sea King. Organizationally, the Danish Air Force consists of two main components. Responsible for flight operations is the Flyvertaktisk Command, known in NATO parlance as the Tactical Air Command Denmark (TACDEN); responsible for support is the Flyvemateriel Command. Since 1 September 1993, the tactical component has undergone a belt-tightening process and has been patterned after this structure: TACDEN now likewise consists of an operational and a logistic component. Aside from the operational bases at Aalborg, Karup, Skrydstrup, and Vaerloese, the two airfields at Tirstrup and Vandel that are earmarked for use by allied reinforcement units--the latter occupied in peacetime by Army aviation units--and the flying squadrons, eight surface-to-air missile batteries equipped with the improved Hawk, all units responsible for airspace surveillance, as well as the schools of the Flyvevabnet, are also subordinate to the TACDEN. In the operational area, the reduction of the Danish Air Force from the original 9,500 to the current 8,000 was achieved primarily through the deactivation of the two Draken squadrons and reductions in the number of active surface-to-air missile personnel. As a result, the Air Force depends more than ever today on mobilization. The 8,000 personnel on active duty are joined by 11,000 reservists plus 10,000 members of the Danish home defense force and the airspace observer corps, thus giving the Flyvevabnet a total of 29,000 members in a national emergency. The reorganization of the NATO structure also brought about a change in the organizational assignment of Denmark and its armed forces: Since 1 October 1993, the Flyvevabnet has been subordinate to the allied Central Europe command sector. The mission of the Air Force was not changed in the process, it was simply expanded through its participation in the crisis reaction forces of the alliance. In peacetime, the surveillance of Danish airspace is assured by two F-16 aircraft which, alternating between Aalborg and Skrydstrup, are kept for a week at a time on five-minute alert status around the clock for air-policing missions. In addition, two reconnaissance aircraft are kept on four-hour alert to photograph foreign vessels spotted off the coasts of Denmark. These alerts were not changed in any way following the end of the East-West conflict.
