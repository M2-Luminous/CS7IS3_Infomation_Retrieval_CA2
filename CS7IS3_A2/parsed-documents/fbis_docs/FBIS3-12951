We realize the annihilation of the Palestinian people will enable the Israeli entity to achieve the peace it wants. We realize that the annihilation of Muslims in Yugoslavia makes peace the right of those the Westerners call Bosnian Serbs. We also realize that the continuation of the racist embargo of the Iraqi people will lead to the death of all the Iraqis. Through this, international legitimacy -- the respect for which the United States is seeking to impose on the enemies of Washington to the exclusion of all others -- would be achieved. The Americans are the only ones who can make peace in the Middle East. By virtue of the fact that the Americans have a strategic alliance with the Israelis, the anticipated peace will be one that achieves the interests of both allies. Moreover, when Goldstein, the hero of the Ramadan massacre, sees that the world is applauding the killers in Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Iraq, then it is natural for him to consider those killers -- who are slaughtering people in the name of protecting them and are launching wars of annihilation under the pretext of defending international legitimacy -- as his model. It is no coincidence that Goldstein should have been born and raised in America and have a Zionist behavior and mentality. Such a combination is what produced the killers in Baghdad, Mogadishu, and Sarajevo and before that in the capitals of South America and Southeast Asia. Those who are talking about opening the road to peace via the slaughtering of Palestinians are talking about a policy that satisfies the new world order but does not satisfy the sentiment of millions of Arabs, whose Islam and Christianity as well as their basic rights, foremost of which is their right to live, are fought by Zionism and its allies. The United Nations, which refuses to condemn the Zionist crime, is not to blame, because there are those among us who, since the first moment of the massacre, have been seeking to acquit the Israeli Government and Army and lay all the blame on one settler called Goldstein without any reference to his many accomplices. Those who are laying all this blame on Goldstein are demanded to respect the blood of martyrs if they do not want to respect the peoples' intelligence. They are also demanded to frankly read the files of Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres, in the chest of each of whom dwell one hundred Goldsteins. Zionist extremism and the desire to liquidate and wipe out all Palestinian people in order to achieve peace are not the ideas and behavior of one settler. They are the ideas and behavior of an entire entity that was brought up under Western imperialism, specifically U.S. imperialism. Here it is practicing what this imperialism has been practicing since the beginning of this century. The international community, which is watching our annihilation with all this bias, will not secure protection for the Palestinians by sending a few hundred international observers.
