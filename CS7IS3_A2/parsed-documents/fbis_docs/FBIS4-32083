The Ministry of Industry and Trade has confirmed this. The arms consortium took recourse to this maneuver after it learned that government authorities were about to reject the issuance of the arms-trading permit. The Defense Ministry had serious objections against Jan Vlcek, director of the company. At the former Federal Defense Ministry, he was engaged in X-Trade, a subsidized organization of the Army that sold off surplus military technology to foreign countries. In view of the dubious activities of the representatives of this consortium in Iran recently, the Foreign Ministry wanted to support the stance of the Defense Ministry. In its confidential document, they even said that the RDP Group did more harm than good to the interests of the Czech Republic. "We recommend that this company be urged to show `restraint' in its activity," diplomats said. The licensing administration of the Ministry of Industry and Trade was to announce a negative stance to the RDP Group by the end of this week. In that case, the RDP Group consortium, which associates about 40 arms enterprises, was under the threat of not being able to conduct trade in arms at all for at least a year. According to the law, a firm whose application has been denied must wait one year to reapply for permission to export military material. Not being allowed to trade in military material would significantly damage the RDP Group because trade in arms was one of its goals when the consortium was established--apart from coordinating domestic production of military technology and participating in the replacement of the Army's arsenal. Experts estimate that, in the course of one year, the arms company would lose transactions worth millions of korunas. The RDP Group wants to reapply for the trade license in military material as soon as possible. After former diplomat Viktorie Hradska has been appointed to Vlcek's position, arms manufacturers expect that ministries will be more inclined to meet them halfway.
