The Zairean paper LA REFERENCE said the United States, styling itself the "only superpower" in the world after the collapse of the Soviet Union and East European socialist countries, is trying to bring all countries under its control, and that North Korea has become a target of such strongarm politics of the United States. The Nigerian paper DAILY CHAMPION said the United States has broken down the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks and deployed Patriot missiles in South Korea, and this will only heighten the crisis. A recent issue of the Nepalese paper NEPAL NEWS said the United States decided to resume the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and deployed Patriot missiles recently under the pretext of the North's fictitious "nuclear issue". This shows that they have become an object of hatred by answering North Korea's peaceful efforts with confrontation, wrote the paper. The may issue of the Nepalese magazine PURATIDHWANI said the United States invented Korea's "nuclear issue" and has aggravated the situation of the Korean peninsula on that pretext with the aim of destroying the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a genuine socialist country embodying the chuche idea. The April issue of another Nepalese magazine MULYANGKAN said the United States' impudent demand for an opening of North Korea's military sites is, to all intents and purposes, a provocative move to force a new war.
