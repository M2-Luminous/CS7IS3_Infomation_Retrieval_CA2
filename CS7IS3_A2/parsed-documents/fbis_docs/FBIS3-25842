The buildings, providing 17,000 square meters of space, are designed for the study and residence of the 163 overseas students at the college. The college is the chief educational center of traditional Chinese medicine in China. The overseas students who have enrolled since September 1992 come from 18 countries and regions in the world, including the United States, Germany, Denmark, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Singapore. Yu Tiecheng, assistant to the president of the college, said that with more and more people becoming interested in traditional Chinese medicine, the college will expand its enrollment of overseas students. He said that the students to be enlisted into the college next year will reach 500. Last year there were more than 400 overseas applicants for study at the college. But the shortage of buildings limited the capacity of the college, which took on only 70. The construction project includes 12,000-square-meter residential buildings and a 5,000-square-meter classroom building. Sponsored by the Tianjin Traditional Medical College, the International College of Traditional Chinese Medicine offers undergraduate and post-graduate courses of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese pharmacy.
