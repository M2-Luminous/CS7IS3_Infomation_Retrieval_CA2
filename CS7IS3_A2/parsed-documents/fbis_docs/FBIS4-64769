Tihomir Vinkovic reports: [Vinkovic] We discussed all open issues, Croatian Foreign Minister Granic said, and added that the talks will be resumed tomorrow at 1000 [0800 GMT] I believe that we will successfully complete the negotiations tomorrow evening or on Monday morning [9 May] at the latest, Minister Granic said. Asked if the Muslims persisted in their demand that both the president of the federation and the prime minister be Muslim, Kresimir Zubak, the Croat representative from Bosnia-Herzegovina, said: Yes, but they also have some new ideas. It has been learned that no names were discussed today, only the principles of the Washington agreement, that is, which post will be held by the representative of which nation. After the talks, Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic briefly said that the talks were constructive and held in a good atmosphere. We might find out tomorrow whether these statements hide optimism or just the usual diplomatic vocabulary.
