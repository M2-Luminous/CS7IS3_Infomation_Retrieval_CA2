FBIS4-25852 "drchi115_v_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 TAIWAN Taiwanese Fishing Boat Detained by Argentine Authorities Taiwanese Fishing Boat Detained by Argentine Authorities OW1506081394 Taipei CNA in English 0737 GMT 15 Jun 94 OW1506081394 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Edward Chen and Sofia Wu] [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- A Kaohsiung-based fishing boat is being detained at the port of Madryn in southern Argentina for allegedly intruding into that country's 200-nautical-mile economic zone, fishery officials confirmed Wednesday [15 June]. The "Man Wei No. 111" was caught by an Argentine naval patrol ship on Saturday, the officials said. The ship was guided to Madryn Tuesday for investigation. A CNA dispatch from Buenos Aires, quoted the ship's agent in Argentina as saying that the ship and its 28-member crew are all in good condition. The report said the satellite location recorder installed on the Man Wei No. 111 clearly showed the ship was located at a point 201.3 nautical miles off the Argentine coast when it was intercepted by the Argentine patrol boat. Moreover, its radar was not on, indicating that the ship was not operating. Man Wei's captain, Tsai Tien-fu, had asked Argentine naval officers to sign a statement affirming the ship's location reading when it was intercepted to show that the boat was in international waters, the report said. Argentine naval authorities are still questioning Man Wei's crew members for more information about its operations. They may ask the Argentine court to make a ruling later this week, the report said. Huang Lung-yuan, Taiwan's representative in Argentina, said he will provide the Man Wei crew with all necessary support and assistance. Meanwhile, fishery administrators said domestic squid prices have risen by nearly 60 percent in recent months because of dwindling catches. Taiwan's squid catch stands at about 130,000 metric tons so far this year, down 30 percent from the year-earlier level, the officials said. With fewer catches, the local squid wholesale price has climbed to about NT$40 (U.S.$1.48) per kilogram, compared with NT$22 (U.S.$0.81) recorded last year. The officials attributed the decrease in squid catches in part to a United Nations ban on the use of driftnets in squid fishing. Moreover, the officials said, Argentina's attack and sinking of a Taiwan fishing boat in waters near its economic zone in May also adversely affected Taiwan's squid catches this year. As the annual squid fishing season finishes at the end of this month, the officials said, domestic squid prices may rise further. The unusually strong squid demand in Europe and Mainland China this year iy also a reason behind the recent price hikes, the officials added.
