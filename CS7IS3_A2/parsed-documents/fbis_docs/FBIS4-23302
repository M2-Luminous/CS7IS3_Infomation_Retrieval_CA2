Recently there have been more clashes. Many civilians have been killed. Does this situation call the national peace pact into question? This is what Muriel Pomponne asked Ag-Athom Ag Alhassane. [Begin recording] [Alhassane] This does not call the national pact into question, but it has to be recognized that the national pact has run into some difficulties since it was signed. These are inherent in the behavior of certain persons who can be found on each side, and who want to sabotage it. [Pomponne] Can you, as a movement, affirm that you are not calling the national pact in question? [Alhassane] As a movement we are indeed reaffirming our commitment to the national pact, and to its implementation. The Algiers meeting the other day is for us the consecration and the conclusion of important arrangements in the national pact. Among the decisions taken, the most important is the integration of our fighters, and the dismantling of the bases, because once this second integration is implemented, the movement's bases will be dismantled and we will move toward the dissolution of the movements. [Pomponne] There are no differences of opinion between you and the Malian government? [Alhassane] At the moment there are no differences between us and the Malian government. [Pomponne] There is talk at the moment of armed militia among the sedentary population. How do you explain the hostility of this population? [Alhassane] Well, we don't know how to explain this hostility. These are militia who were in fact already organized in the form of self-defense brigades, and in some villages we had already seen people (?being killed) last year, and we had always closed our eyes to that. This has gone on until now, and it is going on, and we are trying as hard as we can to restrain ourselves and not to respond, because we think it is sort of provocation, and we know that it is not in fact the people who actually belong to the sedentary population who are behind this sort of action. [Pomponne] Are you expecting the government to take any measures to put an end to this violence? [Alhassane] Yes, we think the government is responsible for providing security for everyone, both the white population and the black population, and that is why the movement is going to try as hard as possible not to start fighting these militia, since we know, we think this is the state's business, and we are leaving the state the time to take the necessary measures. [Pomponne] But you, the movements, are often accused of being the cause of the insecurity. How do you respond to these accusations? [Alhassane] We cannot say that the movements do not bear a share of the responsibility for this insecurity. But what has to be recognized, and what people don't understand, is that there is the movement, and then there are other groups that are hard to keep under control, and who carry out this sort of deed. It is very difficult to see the officials of the movement, or the movement as such, carrying out this sort of deed. People must understand that when you have a rebel movement, or a problem that has gone on for some time, there are always remnants and you need time to bring them under control. That is what we are asking people to understand, and everyone must (?make an effort) to understand this. [end recording]
