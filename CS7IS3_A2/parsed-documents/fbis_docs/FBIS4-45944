Even as there appear signals to suggest that the two are trying to repair the damage, that superlative fighter, the F-16, is once again set to send New Delhi's ties with Washington to a new low. After a long winter of discontent, Indian and American relations were about to look up with the U.S. assistant secretary of state for South Asia, Ms Robin Raphel, whose remarks on the accession of Kashmir to India began the downward spiral, deciding to visit India to clear the air. Her trip, though not quite in the spirit of Henry going to Canossa, is being touted as part of an effort by the Clinton administration to restore the credibility of its South Asian policy. By engaging her Indian interlocutors, it is hoped that the bad feelings about her and her boss President Bill Clinton's remarks will be ended. Sticks & Stones So far New Delhi has comforted itself by the thought that words do not break bones. But it would now appear that Washington might be taking recourse to sticks and stones as well. The proposal for a "one-time" waiver of F-16 aircraft and other military equipment for Pakistan not only creates an enormous "public relations" problem for a government trying to keep its relations with Washington on an even keel, but will affect the military balance, thereby compelling a response in kind. An expenditure of $2 billion in the next two years in purchasing military hardware would almost certainly torpedo Dr Manmohan Singh's economic reform programme, if nothing else will. [passage omitted] It is not clear why the United States expects India to sign on the dotted line. While it has on occasion dampened Indo-Pakistani tensions arising from the Kashmir problem, it has not shown itself to be a particularly impartial or even mature actor. Having resisted the Pakistani effort to internationalise the issue in Geneva, New Delhi cannot be expected to cave in and accept an international conference to resolve the dispute. Even if the Rao government was willing, it would find its room for action circumscribed by the Parliament resolution on Kashmir. Short Memories Nor is it likely that the Rao government will be able to accept any new non-proliferation move being initiated by the Americans. Public memories tend to be short, but not short enough to forget that in the 1980s F-16s were supplied to check Pakistan's nuclear ambitions and when they failed to do so for three years American Presidents lied to Congress and the world by annually certifying that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device. In any case, capping will not take into account devices and fissile material that may have been produced since 1987, when, according to Mr A.Q. Khan and, more recently, the former Pakistani army chief, General Mirza Aslam Beg, Pakistan first made the bomb, and now. There is little alternative for India but to engage the United States in a dialogue even while spelling out clearly that it will not undertake policies that fall below the threshold of India's national interests, be it in Kashmir or elsewhere. On non-proliferation, the Prime Minister has already outlined India's wider concerns about Russia and China. As soon as the proposed international convention to ban the production of fissile material for weapons comes into force, India will, as its leading supporter, accept inspections of its nuclear facilities. But in asking India to do so as part of the "F-16s for capping" agreement, Washington is asking it to bear the obligations while rewarding Islamabad. It was not India but U.S. law which blocked the aircraft from going to Pakistan. Asking New Delhi to pay the price for Washington's convoluted Pakistan policy is insulting, to say the least, and no embassy or high-level visit is likely to be able to convince anyone otherwise.
