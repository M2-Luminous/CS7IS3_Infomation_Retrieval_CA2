In his opinion, a final assessment of the agreement should be given only after a text of the agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States becomes available. Mr. Shybiko is deeply convinced that Ukraine should remain a nuclear state for the near future and should accede to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons as a nuclear state.
