(ITAR-TASS). Russia is to provide the Indian Air Force with the first lot of MIG-29M fighter-bombers in the near future under the terms of a contract calling for selling to India 30 of these units and six MIG-29UB (combat training) types costing a total of 25 billion rupees (about 780 million dollars). This was disclosed here by high-level Indian sources. According to these sources, MIG shipments will be initiated as early as this summer. The aircraft will effect a considerable improvement in combat capability of the Republic's Air Force, since "they can effectively both perform interception and deliver strikes against ground targets located in an enemy's deep rear." Sergey Anishchenko, the Delhi representative of the state company Rosvooruzheniye, made a corroboration of the above to the ITAR-TASS correspondent, stating that the Russian side did indeed dispatch to its Indian partners an offer to supply the MIGs, with 10 units to be furnished via state credit and 20 units on commercial credit. Since Moscow has not yet received an official reply, he characterized the abovementioned delivery time as "overly optimistic." However, S. Anishchenko expressed the hope that a reply may be forthcoming in the next few days as a result of an official visit to Russia to be made by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao in the end of June. Russian military cooperation has definitely been on the rise in the last few months after several years of a downward slide. In the middle of May, the Indian Ministry of Defense announced that the MIG Aviation Scientific Production Complex imeni A. Mikoyan, operating in an atmosphere of stiff competition with English, French, and Israeli companies, won a bid for refurbishing more than 100 MIG-21BIS aircraft, which constitute the backbone of the Republic's Air Force. Rosvooruzheniye General Director Viktor Samoylov recently signed here a series of agreements relating to constructing in the docks of Goa and Bombay a series of fast attack watercraft and frigates.
