The Bundestag Commission for German Economic Ties with East Europe has just produced a report on the results of a poll on the development of economic relations with CIS states and former Soviet states (a comprehensive report is to be released in the spring). What has been established less surprisingly is that of all the CIS states, Russia still remains the most important trading partner for German exporters. With exports totaling almost 5 billion German marks [DM], the volume of trade is almost twice as high as it is for exports to all the other CIS countries, which are considerably below DM2 billion. Russia is followed by Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the Baltic states. On the imports side, Russia is of even greater importance: More than 80 percent of German imports from the CIS come from Russia and amount to somewhat more as DM5 billion. Fewer Problems With the Baltics The poll shows that fewer problems have only been encountered in trade with Baltic states and some German companies have reported that they are satisfied with their Baltic trading partners. In the case of all other CIS members states, the problems are similar to those experienced in trade with Russia. Many companies believe, however, that positive political and economic conditions are also lacking in the Baltic states. In contrast to other former Soviet states, assessments of Baltic partners in terms of deliveries and payment range from satisfactory to good. Less Readiness To Pay According to the poll, a serious factor in the development of trade relations with Russia is that Russian partners have become much less willing to pay. This applies to almost all partners and has in the meantime become the most important factor disrupting trade with Russia. There have been cases of payment extending over a long period of time, and delays have already led to the use of Hermes guarantees. In the case of barter trade, there has been a considerable deterioration in the quality of goods. An old experience is being confirmed: There is a lack of clarity about decisionmaking structures at both company and state administration levels. The general trend to decentralization is also partially being countered by recentralization trends. In the personnel field, the motivation of Russian employees is considered high, technical training adequate, and management skills low. In almost all countries, it is considered that competitors from Western states possess advantages in the form of state subsidies or a combination of commercial loans and state loans (soft loans) on favorable terms.
