She said that his victory constitutes the definitive word on the future of South Africans and on the equality of men, not only on that continent but in all the world. The Cuban vice foreign minister noted that in that triumph there is something of the work of Cuba and of the thousands of Cubans who died in Angola defending the human rights of the African people. This is why it represents for her country much more than a mere electoral triumph. She noted that Cuba would like to have diplomatic relations with an ANC government in South Africa. It is in the interests of both countries, but we must wait for that government to take office and for the situation to evolve, she said.
