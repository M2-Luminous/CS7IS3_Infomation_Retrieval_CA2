The report in THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH received here Wednesday, said the cash payments from ASIS continued over many years beginning when the MPs were junior politicians and increasing as the recipients grew in stature. The clandestine payments and their management show ASIS has taken upon itself to meddle directly in the internal political affairs of a foreign nation without specific authorisation, the former field agents claim, the report added. It also quoted the former ASIS agents as saying that what started as simple bribes snowballed over the years with little reassessment of the value or morality of the payments. THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH said the allegations were made during its probe into upheavals now confronting ASIS and were supported by several former personnel during a series of interviews. The former secret agents were demanding a royal commission of enquiry into ASIS claiming that it had dangerously minimal accountability and was veering out of control. All have various reasons to hold grudges against ASIS but say their careers were ruined by malicious gossip which points to serious internal problems, the report added. Meanwhile, the Australian federal government refused to comment on the exposure by THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH. THE CANBERRA TIMES reported that a spokesman for Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, responsible for ASIS, said the government never commented on intelligence matters.
