Passenger trains will be stopped for one day. When will that be? We will find out from the posters at railway stations. At any rate, "on Monday [7 March] people can still travel by train," said Railway "S" head Krzysztof Maminski. A few days following this strike, there is supposed to be "a long strike, blocking freight traffic and thus paralyzing the economy, but it will not be cumbersome to the people." "S" merely says that the strike action will be conducted by the plants of the metal branch, energy, mining, communications, and railways, as well as selected regions, districts, and enterprises. "S" will not reveal who will go on strike, when, and for how long. It is going to reveal the details no more than 10 hours before the strikes actually begin because "all of the things that have been practiced on the union before are starting all over again." "Traveling all over the country are gentlemen with attache cases who put out strikes and promise wonders," said National Committee Spokesman Piotr Zak. Asked whether the people will bear the costs of the "S" action, Zak gave assurances that, even though "strikes are always cumbersome," they will try to "limit this cumbersomeness": "One can, for example, imagine limiting energy supplies not to private houses and apartments but only to offices...." "Will the central administration be paralyzed?" journalists asked. "Now, has it not been paralyzed already?" replied "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski. Miners are planning three forms of the strike: They will not go underground; they will, but they will not work, or they will work, but they will not sell the coal. "The purpose of our strike is not to overthrow the government or this political configuration," said Silesian "S" Head Marek Kempski. On 7 March, the "S" action is supposed to begin with a collection of money for the strikers. Not only "S" members but all of the people participating in the strike will be entitled to remuneration for the strike. Asked whether the trade union is strong enough to undertake such a large-scale action, Krzaklewski replied that "all of the structures in Poland are going through an organizational crisis; however, in comparison with others, we are effective; hence the fight with the union." He also evaluated that the determination of the work force is so great that, "if our union and each plant had a strike fund, they would all go on strike." He is not afraid of chaos. "I am afraid of a 200,000-person demonstration in Warsaw. I would not like the people to go out on the streets; therefore, I prefer that they protest in their plants," said Krzaklewski. "S" will not conclude any branch or regional agreement, if talks on all-national demands of the entire union are not held. Neither will it respect any agreement signed by the union, if it does not include the all-national demands. Krzaklewski added that, since November 1992, the union had been in collective bargaining with the government, concerning compensation for the costs of living; Silesia demanded that in its strike, and now "S" has the full right to go on a general strike. "This time we will complete our action when decisions, not paperwork agreements, are made." The Cegielski Factory in Poznan will not take part in the "S" strike. Marek Lenartowski, head of the plant "S," which belongs to the "Network," said that "a strike will pour oil on the flames," and the planned action is "an ambition-dictated activity of the chairman and the union leadership."
