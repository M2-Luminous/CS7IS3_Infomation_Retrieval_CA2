"Is it better for an investor to be a shareholder in a profit-making regional airline or in a loss-making international group?" Schisano replied to reporters who asked him about his opinion on the ever growing merger trend in the airline industry. Schisano, who was recruited to the ailing public airline from Texas Instruments on January 27, gave reporters an outline of his own restructuring plan, after stating three weeks ago he was willing to review a different plan drawn up by his predecessors and rejected by the trade unions. Schisano said he wants to bring Alitalia toward a balanced budget in one year and does not want to think about alliances with other carriers until finances are in the black. This is possible only by increasing efficiency, cutting per unit production costs and building an Alitalia terminal at Milan's international airport to combat increasingly aggressive foreign competition. "The review of the new plan will be completed by the end of April, the plan will go into effect immediately and should show its first results in one year," Schisano claimed. But until then, he stressed, it is inappropriate to talk about international alliances: "Where I come from," he said, referring to Texas Instruments, "there were no sister companies, only competitors, and competitors must be treated as such. Partnerships can exist only if there are reciprocal interests but Alitalia is in no condition to choose a partner." Schisano also said he had no objections to the privatization of Alitalia but he stressed the importance of increasing the company's advantage at the Milan airport. "All of northern Italy is a strategic market and for years now has been invaded by tough European competitors. Because it does not have a terminal in Lombardy, Alitalia has been losing two million passengers a year in the country's most industrialized area. That's three billion lire a day up in smoke, or one trillion lire in revenues every year." He invoked "political" decisions to get the terminal project, dubbed Malpensa 2000, moving again after a massive kickbacks scandal virtually blocked development. The plan includes transportation links between the airport and Milan. "I've been hearing talk about this for the last thirty years and nothing's been done yet," he added. Schisano earlier this month promised to pay the wage increases that were frozen by the former CEO [chief executive officer], Giovanni Bisignani, and to review the controversial restructuring plan. He also said Alitalia, which is owned by the public group, IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction], has "such severe internal problems" that it may not be able to exploit chances of recovery. He told unions however that this does not mean that the general guidelines of the first restructuring plan will be overhauled, but rather that the general climate of "demotivation" and "disarray" among personnel must be changed. The unions rejected the restructuring plan drawn up by the previous company management and approved by the IRI board. But new management, put in place in a major top-end reshuffle in January, has claimed it does not want industrial relations to degenerate further. Alitalia is expected to post 400 billion lire (238 million dollars) in losses and debts of two trillion lire (1.19 billion dollars) for 1993, following first-half losses of 214 billion lire (127.3 million dollars) reported in September. Schisano has not replied to union requests to make company shares available to employees and has not denied plans to cut between 1,200 and 1,400 jobs. Alitalia wants to place some 800 workers into early retirement.
