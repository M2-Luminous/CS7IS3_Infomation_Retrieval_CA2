Terlon is as good as the foreign analogs in physical properties. At the present time Terlon is being produced on an experimental basis as a high-strength fiber, both long and short staple. Terlon is said to be superior to the Kevlar and Tvaron in having a lower (5-10 percent) density, higher bonding strength to rubber for tire cord, and better fibrillation for making pulp. According to data from the Gorky Labor Hygiene and Occupation Disease SRI, Terlon polymer has no irritating, sensitizing, or fibrogenic action and therefore its maximum allowable concentration has been set at 10 mg per cubic meter (equivalent to inert dust). The present work lists the many places where Terlon fiber may be substituted to provide environmentally beneficial effects. For example it may be used in radial tires, as a reinforcement in conveyer belts (in place of steel), and in the manufacture of heat and fire resistant special clothing for welders, metallurgists, and firemen. Short staple fiber and pulp made of Terlon may also be used in place of asbestos in brake mechanisms, gaskets, and fillers. References 3 (Russian).
