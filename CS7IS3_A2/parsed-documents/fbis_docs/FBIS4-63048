FBIS4-63048 "drsov097_b_94016" FBIS-SOV-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Report on Presidential Security Service Report on Presidential Security Service LD1805084194 LD1805084194 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 1625 GMT on 17 May, in its "Details" program, broadcasts a 10- minute report on the work of the Presidential Security Service by correspondent Eduard Gindileyev. Gindileyev begins his report by saying: "We know nothing about the presidential guard. We do not know, for instance, that quite recently the president's personal chauffeur and one of his closest bodyguards were replaced. And one and a half months ago the deputy chief of the Kremlin guard was dismissed. We know nothing of this, and we are not meant to know. "The SBP [Sluzhba Bezopasnosti Presidenta] is the abbreviation for a new Russian special service, or rather a new name for an old unit. It is the Presidential Security Service, the tip of the iceberg of the former Number Nine [Devyatka], the ninth directorate of the USSR KGB, later the Main Guard Directorate of the Russian Federation. "As an independent federal body subordinate only to the Russian president, the SBP has been functioning since 11 November last year. After the second putsch, Boris Yeltsin clearly decided to close the ranks of the Kremlin guard more tightly. After all, during the period of the October events, two special subunits of the Main Guard Directorate, Vympel and Alpha, did not obey the president's orders to storm the White House. Now Vympel has been transferred to the Interior Ministry and not much is left of it. The Alpha command held out with difficulty in the Kremlin. Relations with it are fairly cool. But there is also an official explanation for the reorganization of the former Number Nine." At this point the video shows a man being interviewed, captioned as Andrey Oligov, Russian Federation Presidential Security Service. Oligov says: "The creation of the new federal body called the Presidential Security Service is a logical step in the general reorganization of the special services of the former Soviet Union and the special services of the Russian Federation. You are well aware that the State Security Committee which existed for a long time and which operated within the system of the USSR now exists in Russia as several special services, each of which is engaged in specific functional duties linked either with intelligence operations, or counterintelligence operations, or information operations. In view of that, a new federal service is being created which will fully ensure the security of the president of the Russian Federation, and according to his instructions, be responsible for guarding top state leaders." Correspondent Gindileyev then continues: "After the presidential decree on the reorganization of the Main Guard Directorate of the Russian Federation, its chief -- Commandant of the Kremlin (Mikhail Barsukov) -- was somehow moved out of the spotlight. The spotlight was taken over by (Aleksandr Korzhakov), chief of the president's personal guard, who was already strong from a political point of view. The 44-year-old Korzhakov is the closest man to Yeltsin in the Kremlin. He was already guarding the future Russian president when the latter was a candidate member of the CPSU Politburo. He left the ninth KGB directorate at the same time as Yeltsin left the party Central Committee. He was remembered for that, both by the KGB and by Yeltsin." The video then shows film footage of Korzhakov working with Yeltsin on various occasions, following which the interview with Oligov continues. Oligov says: "Like any special service, the Presidential Security Service has its own structure. In it there are subunits which ensure the president's security directly, that is, effectively an institution of bodyguards. In order for that subunit to function, naturally a very powerful support base is needed -- this includes an analytical subunit, a special staff which performs not only dispatching functions but also simultaneously processes the information coming in. There is also an operational subunit, that is, the Presidential Security Service is empowered by the operational investigation law to carry out operational investigations -- to gather information related to terrorism, and in general to investigate threats which could harm the president's security." In answer to a question about whether the Presidential Security Service is growing into a "super special service", Oligov replies: "The very fact of the division of the Main Guard Directorate into two departments -- the Main Guard Directorate and the Presidential Security Service -- on the contrary illustrates the narrower specialization of subunits doing their own specific jobs. So I think it is wrong to say that the presidential Security Service will grow and become some kind of monster, some kind of entirely new special service. It has clear tasks, and not a great number of staff." Gindileyev concludes his report by noting that, according to unverified figures, approximately 2,000 people are now working under General Korzhakov. These include a number of soldiers on compulsory service who have served in CIS trouble spots. "However," Gindileyev says, "basically the SBP remains an elite, and the most closed secret service in Russia." During the report the video shows, as well as Andrey Oligov being interviewed, and shots of General Korzhakov working with Yeltsin, feature movie pictures of a motor convoy under attack, the presidential box at the Bolshoy Theater being prepared for Yeltsin's arrival, men training with handguns, personnel on guard at an airport, and men performing martial arts exercises.
