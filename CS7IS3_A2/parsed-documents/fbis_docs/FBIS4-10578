A legal expedition, headed by Judge Nelson Mora, initially discovered seven [number as published] babies in the day care center. Later, 16 babies were discovered in the Gran Hotel del Paraguay. It is estimated that 11 babies might be in an illegal situation. The operation began at noon on 12 April at the "Villa Esperanza" day care center at the intersection of Libertad Avenue and 25 de Agosto Street in Fernando de la Mora District. Three boys and four girls, ranging from three to six months of age, and a 22-day-old baby were in the day care center. The woman running the day care center did not have any documents on the babies. Therefore, the judge banned the babies' removal from the day care center. The babies' adoption proceedings are being handled by Judges Jorge Amarilla, Ninfa Alcaraz, and Juan Angel Bernal. At the day care center, the court officers discovered the records of three other babies: Natalia Caballero, Javier Olmedo, and Maria Elba Ramirez, all of whom are four months old. According to Norma Saldivar, the woman running the day care center, these babies were at the Gran Hotel del Paraguay with their respective adoptive parents. These babies were scheduled to travel abroad on 12 April. Therefore, the judge ordered the immediate suspension of their adoption proceedings and went to the luxury hotel. At the hotel, the judge, to his great surprise, confirmed that not only the three babies mentioned by Norma Saldivar were there, but many more. He immediately ordered an inventory to determine the number of babies there and if any of the three babies, whose whereabouts were reported as unknown [as published], were there. The three babies were actually at the hotel, along with 13 other babies, all of whom already were with their adoptive parents. Four of these babies reportedly are in an irregular situation. The adoption proceedings for the rest of the babies reportedly are under way or have been completed. According to the documents carried by the people involved, it was learned that all the babies are bound to leave for the United States, specifically to Michigan, Ohio, Atlanta, and Minnesota. Since the babies' origin is doubtful, the judge summoned the attorneys handling the adoption proceedings to present the babies' documents by 0800 today at the latest. Judge Mora ordered that the mothers of the babies involved present themselves to the court to testify in order to confirm the conditions under which they delivered their babies for adoption.
