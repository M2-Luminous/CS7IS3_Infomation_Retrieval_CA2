Many candidates are very concerned about the conclusions drawn by pollsters suggesting that 40 to 50 percent of all Colombians have no interest in the four elections to be held in 1994. The number of undecided voters is also high. Under such conditions, if politicians do not adopt a more convincing attitude toward the voters, more could abstain than in previous years, these same analysts say. Neither presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano nor his campaign managers and advisers agree. They predict that enthusiasm among Liberals will pick up in 1994 and equal that seen in previous campaigns. They claim that Liberals could make up 55 or 60 percent of the total number of voters. They estimate that over 3.5 million Liberals will vote, 2 million for Samper and the rest split by the remaining four precandidates still in the race by 13 March: Humberto de la Calle, Carlos Lemos Simmonds, Rodolfo Gonzalez, and David Turbay. It is rumored that Luis Guillermo Sorzano is preparing to launch his candidacy for the Senate although he has delayed the announcement. Election Calculations They estimate that some 6 million persons will go to the polls to cast their ballots for the various parties and groups in the congressional elections. For obvious reasons, that figure could be somewhat lower for the presidential elections because the lure and intensive work of congressional candidates will be missing. However, at the last minute, the element of the mayoral and gubernatorial races could possibly rouse voters out of their apathy. The Conservative election between presidential candidates called by the union of the "rebel quintuplets": Rodrigo Marin, Rodrigo Llorente, Juan Diego Jaramillo, Gabriel Melo, and Roberto Gerlein, but rejected by those following the guidelines of the Conservative leadership supporting Andres Pastrana, could rally some 600,000 votes, according to its organizers' estimates. However, when one considers that the Conservative Party could win nearly 160,000 votes for Congress, the party could find itself in a difficult situation due to the split into two major blocs for the 8 May elections. One group would back Andres Pastrana while the other would rally behind the candidate chosen from among Rodrigo Marin, Juan Diego Jaramillo, Rodrigo Llorente, Gabriel Melo, and Roberto Gerlein. Under these conditions, the Conservative picture does not look particularly promising because Alvaro Gomez Hurtado is expected to make his political move following the 13 March elections and there is no indication of which way he will go. While Gomez Hurtado has not sided with either faction, his silence is an obvious sign of indirect support for the "rebel" election. It will not be easy to control Congress for the coming elections because senatorial candidacies are nationwide. This fact forces candidates to spread out all over the country, changing the terms of regional politics. In addition, the separation of congressional elections from those for councils, assemblies, mayoralties, and governorships leads one to think that terrorist groups might do their utmost to disturb law and order. Everything To Win Although public opinion polls point to a possible tie between Samper and Pastrana on the first presidential ballot, it should be noted that after the Liberal nomination, the Liberal precandidates now opposing Samper will back him. In contrast, Pastrana will face a split in his party that appears to be irreversible. While Pastrana could possibly win a few Liberal or independent followers, he will not have other elements in his camp like those that backed Belisario Betancur's national candidacy in his race against Alfonso Lopez Michelsen. The latter was a candidate who faced Liberal resistance and, above all, a very strong rival in the ranks of his own party: Luis Carlos Galan, who is a far cry from Enrique Parejo. Among his political assets for 1994, Samper can also rely on the fact that Gaviria's positive image resulting from the blows the latter dealt to drug trafficking will help him more than they will Pastrana. This is so even though he has had to put some distance between himself and this government on such issues as agrarian policy, the economic liberalization program, and social security reform. He also hopes to get on well with the followers and leadership of the Democratic Alliance M-19, mainly because of similar positions on many social, economic, and political issues. Favorable Star Andres Pastrana, to whom the past two weeks have not been kind because of the revolt of the quintuplet union and because of what happened to his cousin, Gustavo Pastrana Gomez, diplomatic adviser in Uruguay, is confident that his good rating in public opinion polls will hold until May because to date, his campaign has been waged more on image than on any platform. His visit to Venezuela on Wednesday was an attempt to win back points and divert attention to other issues. In that international action he had the support of Development Minister Luis Alberto Moreno, his future campaign director. All predictions revolve around two key persons in the campaign: Andres Pastrana and Ernesto Samper, assuming that no blows will be struck in the elections. However, Enrique Parejo, Miguel Alfredo Maza Marquez, Antonio Navarro, Humberto de la Calle, and Carlos Lemos are confident that the rules of play will change in their favor and that the "sure bets" are in for a surprise. "They have ruled us out ahead of time, but they are going to get the surprise of their lives," Parejo says, dreaming of an election fluke. "It's not over yet," De la Calle argues. Lemos is quieter, perhaps because he is beginning to be named for the vice presidential spot in Julio Cesar Sanchez's proposal, the key to a "winning team" with Samper.
