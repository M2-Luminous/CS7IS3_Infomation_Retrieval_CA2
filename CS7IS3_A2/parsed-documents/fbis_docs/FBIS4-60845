The matter was not brought up at all at the Damascus talks, Sergey Sidorkov, head of the Russian Government's Department for Defense Industries and Defense Conversion, who accompanied Soskovets on his Syrian trip, told INTERFAX. Moreover, Syria agreed to pay for its orders to Russian enterprises in advance, he said. But all such matters -- the volume of, and schedules for, supplies to Syria, including those of spares for armaments already sold to Damascus, payment procedures, etc., -- will be handled by a special intergovernmental commission, he said. Sidorkov said no concrete plans for Russian arms sales to Syria had been negotiated during Soskovets's visit. The bulk of Syria's $10-billion debt to Russia is in arrears for weapons bought from the Soviet Union in the 1970's and 1980's. Syria is willing to pay the debt to Russia as the Soviet Union's legal successor.
