Some people misunderstood that the price rises were caused by the new taxation system. On this issue, a person in charge of the provincial taxation bureau pointed out a few days ago that taxation system reform would not cause price hikes and that localities should take measures to stop the practice of raising commodity prices at will. The person in charge cited some examples to explain this problem. The new taxation system preserves enterprises' previous tax rates. Apart from this, to reduce fluctuations resulting from taxation system reform, the state has worked out a necessary transitional policy. Therefore, it is groundless to think that the new taxation system has caused a new tax burden on enterprises or price hikes. Why did some commodity prices rise? This person said that some tax payers did not act properly and some people even purposely raised their commodity prices by taking advantage of taxation system reform. Therefore, the person in charge of the provincial taxation bureau hoped that people in all circles would supervise this malpractice and report it promptly.
