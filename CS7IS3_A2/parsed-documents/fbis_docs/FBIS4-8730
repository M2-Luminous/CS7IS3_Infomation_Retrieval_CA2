The committee assumed a very critical stand regarding both the process and the results of the screening. We asked Deputy Vladimir Suman (Civic Democratic Alliance), chairman of the Defense and Security Committee, for an explanation. [Hracek] Sir, during the assessment of the results of the screening of the Czech Army officers at the open session of the Defense and Security Committee, you have commented rather skeptically on the approach used. What led you to this criticism? [Suman] You must know that our committee adopted a resolution, in which it expresses its dissatisfaction with the results of the special screening of the professional soldiers. Several serious factors led us to this stand. True, the examinations were broadly implemented and included practically all professional soldiers. This means that thousands of people passed the test. It seemed remarkable to us that of this large number, only 60 officers were described as unsuitable for service -- that is approximately 0.3 percent of those who passed the screening. Another important reason for our dissatisfaction was the method of implementing the examination. Our committee received information from many places that in numerous units people very closely connected with the Ommunist regime were appointed to the screening commissions. We know, for instance, that in one of the army units the examinations were conducted by a former member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia [KSC] Auditing Commission and also a former chairman of the Division Committee of the KSC. In some instances, these people screened professional soldiers who never joined the party. This situation led to the refusal by some officers to be screened under these circumstances, while others passed the screening but left the army in protest against this principle. At a session of the committee, Deputy Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party) quoted from a letter from these officers. [Hracek] Is there an overall report on the current appointments to all leading posts in the army at all levels? [Suman] The Defense and Security Committee requested from [Defense] Minister Baudys a list of all people who were, as of 1 November 1989, agents of counterespionage or military counterespionage. The list should include the staff of the KSC political instruction apparatus and former military screening officers. Each name entry should include the army function under the communist regime and the reasons for leaving the army, if applicable. We are also interested in whether these people work in the army. [Hracek] Are you worried that in case of a crisis, our country could be internally threatened by these people who still are in the army? [Suman] In a discussion with the defense minister, we reached the conclusion that the majority of our officers would defend the sovereignty of the Czech Republic. Regarding internal security, I believe that the economic and political character of this state has been decided without any chance of the return of the former regime.
