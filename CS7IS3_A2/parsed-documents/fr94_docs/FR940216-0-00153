FR940216-0-00153 FR940216-0-00010 d. Conventional gasoline compliance baselines. The Clean Air Act refers to gasoline sold by a refiner, blender or importer (section 211(k)(8)(A)), but does not specify an averaging unit for baseline determination nor whether gasoline and the resulting emissions should be treated on a refinery or refiner basis, thus authorizing EPA to adopt the most appropriate method of complying with the anti-dumping requirements. EPA considered three possible options for baseline determination_refinery basis, refiner basis, or some combination of the two. During the regulatory negotiation, it was agreed that EPA would propose allowing a refiner to elect to establish an individual baseline. In the April 1992 proposal, EPA proposed that refiners could choose either refiner-wide averaging or refinery-by-refinery averaging, but not a combination of the two. This was to avoid situations where multi-refinery refiners could game the system and potentially gain a significant competitive advantage over single-refinery refiners. Although, as stated, EPA expressed concern about multi-refinery refiners' having an advantage over single-refinery refiners, few commenters agreed with EPA's April 1992 proposal. Of those that did agree, some suggested that all refineries should be required to comply with their individual baselines, to minimize any advantages for multi-refinery companies over single refinery companies. However, most of the comments received on this issue claimed that EPA had not interpreted this provision correctly from the Agreement-in-Principle. The agreement, according to the commenters, allowed refiners to decide how to aggregate their refineries' baselines. Some suggested that if aggregations are only allowed as proposed, compliance with the simple model, complex model and/or anti-dumping requirements would be difficult. Upon further consideration of this issue, EPA is allowing refiners to choose to have one or more individual refinery conventional gasoline compliance baselines and one or more ``refiner'' baselines (i.e., more than one grouping of two or more refineries to form a compliance baseline). Because the decision to group or not group refineries is a onetime decision, and because a refiner's total emissions will be conserved, the possibility of gaming will be reduced. When two or more refineries are grouped for the purpose of having a single conventional gasoline compliance baseline, the refineries shall be considered ``aggregated'', and the resulting baseline shall be an ``aggregate'' baseline. Aggregate baselines are determined by volume-weighting the baseline emissions and sulfur, olefin and T90 values of the aggregated facilities. If aggregated, all NO X baselines in an aggregate must be determined either on a nonoxygenated or an oxygenated basis, using the corresponding nonoxygenated or oxygenated baseline parameters. The choice of whether a refinery has its own individual baseline or is part of an aggregate baseline is a one-time decision, i.e., refineries cannot be re-aggregated annually. Also, an individual baseline (including both parameter and emission values) must be calculated for each refinery, whether that refinery will be part of an aggregate baseline or not. This is required because reformulated gasoline compliance under either the simple model or early use of the complex model is on a refinery basis. Also, individual baselines must be known in the event that a refinery is sold or shut down, or other reason why the baseline would need to be recalculated. EPA also proposed to require individual refinery baselines for refineries located in specific isolated geographic areas where localized dumping was occurring. EPA is retaining this proposal in the final rule. Few comments were received on this issue and are addressed in the RIA. e. Baseline recalculation. In its April 16, 1992 proposal, EPA proposed certain instances when baselines would have to be recalculated. Few adverse comments were received. In the case of a refinery which is shut down after 1990, EPA had proposed that an aggregate baseline which contained the shutdown refinery would not change unless the shutdown refinery was sold. However, upon further consideration, EPA believes that it is more appropriate, and more consistent with the other recalculation requirements, to remove a shutdown refinery's contributions to an aggregate baseline. EPA is thus promulgating this requirement with the other proposed requirements. D. Baseline Auditor In the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA expanded on the qualifications and responsibilities of the baseline auditor which each refiner or importer must utilize to verify its baseline. Refiners and importers utilizing the anti-dumping statutory baseline, if so allowed, are not required to have a baseline auditor.
