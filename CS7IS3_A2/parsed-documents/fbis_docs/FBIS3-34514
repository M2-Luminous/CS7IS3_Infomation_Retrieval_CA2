Dr. al-Majali said the government would provide the general prosecutor with all information it has on the case and ask him to collect other relevant information from the public and the Lower House of Parliament. Instructions will be issued to all government departments to "put all official documents they have at the disposal of the general prosecutor," Dr al-Majali told the House at the end of a three-day session held to discuss Dr. Malhas' charges that appeared in a weekly tabloid over two weeks ago. Dr. al-Majali said people suspected of violating regulations related to food and medicine standards would be referred to court. House Speaker Tahir al-Masri asked the Public Freedoms and General Health committees to provide the House with a report on the results of investigations that they have launched into the issue in two weeks. "The executive authority has prime responsibility in initiating reform and taking immediate and decisive measures (on the food and medicine situation). The responsibilities of the (House) are no less important and the House has to shoulder them through following up and monitoring the measures the government will take and putting them in the right direction," Mr. al-Masri said at the end of the session in which 37 deputies spoke on Dr. Malhas' charges. "If it becomes necessary, the House will take all measures that the Constitution and laws make available to it (to ensure this)," Mr. al-Masri said. Mr. al-Masri said the public's response to Dr. al-Malhas' charges show their thirst for reform in all government agencies, and asserted that the House would continue to check the government's actions "in all fields." Twenty-seven out of the 37 deputies who spoke on the issue supported Dr. Malhas, while seven severely criticised him for "failing" to substantiate his charges and not presenting a reform programme. Four legislators adopted neutrality but demanded thorough investigations into the charges that have landed the government in its worst political crisis since it won the confidence of the house in December. Many opposition deputies lashed out at the government during the debate, saying the government was "incapable" of initiating reform. Over 19 deputies, including the Islamic Action Front's (IAF) members, urged a vote of no-confidence in the government over the issue. Deputies who opposed Dr. Malhas criticised him for failing to go through "proper channels" to raise the issue, failing to prove his charges and shaking public confidence in the safety of food and medicine and "hurting Jordan's reputation and its national economy." Those who supported the minister expressed appreciation of his "courage" in speaking out about alleged corruption and determination to fight what he described as a "mafia" of drug and food merchants who sought fast profits at the expense of the people and their safety. Some deputies lashed out at the Ministry of Supply for allegedly allowing the entry of shipments of sub-standard food into the market, with one lawmaker saying he would request a "general discussion" of the situation at the ministry in order to investigate alleged cases of violations of the law. In his speech to the House, Dr. al-Majali reaffirmed the government's commitment to protect the citizens in cooperation with the House. But he took a firm stand against deputies who questioned his cabinet's abilities and determination to fight corruption and bring about reform. Responding to the severe criticism that deputies made of his cabinet, Dr. al-Majali said some deputies seized "the opportunity to shake the status of the government. But we say here in front of you (that) we hide nothing from you and have provided you with all (the information) you demanded... we have nothing to hide or to fear." Dr. al-Majali said some deputies were still addressing the government with slanderous language. "But we will not respond to these accusations and will stick to (proper) norms of talking... out of our concern for consolidating democracy," which benefitted from the debate that took place in the House over Dr. Malhas' allegations, Dr. al-Majali told the lawmakers. Dr. al-Majali said that cases of corruption and abuse of office in Jordan were an exception, saying that they do not exceed similar violations in any other country. "I assure you that our food is safe and that our medicine is safe," said Dr. al-Majali. But, he said, the government would take more measures to ensure the safety of food and medicine and raise the standards governing the safety and quality of food and medicine. He said the government would prepare draft laws to establish separate food and medicine directorates and to prevent monopolies in producing and marketing food and medicine. He said the government had asked the finance minister to take measures against medicine merchants if it was proven that they charged exorbitant profits. In comments to the press and later in a speech to the House, Dr. Malhas said there was a deficiency in laws governing the sale of drug and food in the country and some traders were reaping exorbitant profits. In a response to the deputies' speeches on Sunday, Dr. Malhas reiterated these charges but said the Ministry of Health, with the suport of the government, had started a process of reform that would plug all loopholes in legislations. "The government will not allow the entry (into the market) of any food and medicine shipments that does not meet (standards and specifications)," Dr. Malhas told the House. Dr. Malhas said the ministry in 1993 referred thousands of violators of the law to courts and would continue to take measures against any new violations. Dr. Malhas denied that he was in disagreement with the prime minister over the need to fight corruption. He reiterated earlier statements that the disagreement with Dr. al-Majali that he mentioned in his press interview was restricted to the interpretation of the law on pharmacies. Dr. al-Majali also denied that he had any differences over the issue with the health minister. Former Minister of Health and serving Deputy 'Arif al-Batayinah agreed with Dr. Malhas that pressure was "sometimes" applied on the Ministry of Health but said available laws empower the minister to resist such pressures. Dr. al-Batayinah cited incidents that occurred during his work as minister of health and director of the Royal Medical Services to prove that laws were sufficient to ensure the safety of food and medicine and to refer violators of the law to courts. He also confirmed that foreign countries sometimes apply pressure to get their exports to Jordan approved for sale, citing an alleged threat by the Indian minister of trade that if Jordan did not approve an already rejected shipment of Indian meat, "our exports of phosphates will be negatively affected." But as minister of health, he said, he rejected the shipment and nobody could force him to accept it. "Wouldn't it have been better for the health minister to refer the violators to court unless a certain group prevented him from using his authority," said Dr. al-Batayinah. Deputy Nazih al-'Ammarin, who pledged support for Dr. Malhas, also provided examples to show the drug merchants charge exorbitant profits. He said manufacturing, importing and sale of medicine were in the hands of few "sharks" who resist reform. "There is a confidence gap between the citizens and officials and hence is the big noise that this issue has caused," said Deputy Muhammad Abu-'Alim, voicing support for Dr. Malhas in the fight against corruption. "I thanked God when I heard about the food and medicine that are unfit for consumption because most people in the Jordan Valley do not eat meat," said Deputy Jamil al-Hushush in a reference to poverty in his constituency. "Our children do not drink powered milk," said Mr. al-Hushush as about 20 farmers from the valley declared a hunger-strike to demand measures to help them fight poverty in what they called a "disaster area."
