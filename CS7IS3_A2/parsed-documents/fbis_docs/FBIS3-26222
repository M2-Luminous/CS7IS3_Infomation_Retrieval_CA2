This title implies a great price; it is a title formed by the blood of 84 young working boys and girls. A big fire at Zhili Craft Manufacturing Factory in Shenzhen's Kuiyong swallowed these young people. The big fire, which broke out on 19 November 1993, caused the largest number of death by a fire in Guangdong in more than a decade. The red flames have already burned everything to debris, and the workers who were wronged and driven to death cannot live again, while a series of problem caused by the big fire are far from being over. The big fire started at 1325 in a stack of cloth in a workshop on the first floor of the factory, and it burned for three hours. It was lunch time and some 300 workers were on duty. Why did it turn into a tragedy which shocked people at home and abroad? The investigation report by the relevant department shows that it was a incident of serious responsibility in which a Hong Kong investor ignored regulations and the workers' safety, and made them work in risky conditions. A newspaper in Hong Kong also commented: "The Hong Kong boss cares about only earning money, not about the lives and safety of workers," and "it was 10 percent a natural disaster, and 90 percent a misfortune created by man." First, the Hong Kong businessman violated laws and regulations in putting the production workshop and warehouse together under the same roof of a factory building. Second, he did not report the fire prevention plan of the factory to Shenzhen's fire department. According to information, the cargo elevator shaft originally designed by the factory was an open style, which resembled a big chimney and failed to meet the requirement of fire prevention; the fire department rejected the plan after an examination and asked the factory to come up with a new plan. But the boss did not comply; he ignored the workers' safety, and built and used the elevator without authorization. At the east and west ends on the second and third floors of the factory were staircases, which could be used to evacuate the workers in case of emergency, but the boss blocked these exists with sliding doors which he locked in order to supervise workers and safeguard stockpiles. Only the staircase at the west end was left open for use; among the four exits on the first floor, three were locked, and only the one facing the west was left unlocked for use. Therefore, when the fire broke out on the first floor, in just a few minutes the poisonous gases caused by the burning of polyurethane foam, acrylic fiber, and cotton flannel, were sufficient to poison and suffocate the workers who tried to escape through a crowded long and narrow passage which was only 0.8 meter wide. Third, as early as 9 March last year, the city's fire department issued a notice to the factory reminding it of the serious potential fire hazards inside the factory, and suggesting 13 improvement measures, which the notice said should be implemented in one month's time. The Hong Kong businessman implemented only six of the measures, and used improper means to acquire a qualifying certificate which said the factory met the standards upon examination of possible fire hazards. He just stalled. The Chinese factory manager, who was responsible for supervisory duties including fire prevention, not only failed to stop the law-breaking behavior of the Hong Kong businessman, but helped him to acquire the qualifying certificate through trickery. The governor of the town also came out personally to "say some good words," exerting pressure on the fire department. Just these three points are sufficient to cause many doubts which puzzle the people and provoke thought. Why did the Hong Kong businessman dare to turn a blind eye to the government's laws and regulations? What was the reason for the Hong Kong businessman to consistently ignore the safety of the workers? For what reasons did the Chinese manager of the factory help the Hong Kong businessman to practice fraud and the governor of Kuiyong to "say some good words" for him? Has criminal responsibility of the fire been looked into? Have problems relating to the relevant Chinese personnel been looked into? Should the local government department and trade union be held responsible? What is the lesson to be learned? How should we manage foreign-funded enterprises according to law? How can the rights and interests of workers in foreign-funded enterprises be protected? Questions such as these show that there are a lot of things we should do but have not done. The lesson is a long story. What must be noted is that the big fire at this craft factory was not an isolated phenomenon. Before that, fires had broken out in foreign-funded enterprises in Shenzhen, Fuzhou, Dongguan, and other places, causing deaths and serious injuries. In addition, according to the investigation by a relevant department, within foreign-funded enterprises, there have often been serious infringements upon the legitimate rights and interests of workers, such as lack of the minimum safety and work protection equipment in workplaces, frequent industrial accidents, insulting and swearing at staff and workers, compulsory overtime work, and random deduction and embezzlement of workers' wages. All these incidents are calling: It is time to pay attention to strengthening management of foreign-funded enterprises. The open-door policy is a long-term policy in our country. In more than a decade, our country has opened the door widely, and eagerly welcomed investors from outside the border to establish enterprises on the mainland; the country has also diligently improved the investment environment and provided convenient conditions, and treated investors with courtesy. However, foreign businessmen must abide by China's laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations on labor safety, and operate according to law, then they can be protected. If they turn a blind eye to China's laws and regulations, ignore workers' safety, and even do whatever they want to the extent of causing serious incidents, then the persons to be held responsible can hardly avoid being blamed. When Chinese staff and workers work in foreign-funded enterprises, their political and economic rights and interests are protected by our country's constitution and laws; showing respect to the legitimate rights and interests and social status of Chinese staff and workers according to law is the wise and correct choice to be made by investors from outside the border.
