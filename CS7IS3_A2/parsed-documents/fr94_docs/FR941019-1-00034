FR941019-1-00034 FR941019-1-00004 Notwithstanding this growing market interest in access to qualitative performance information, registrants have expressed significant concern that disclosure of such information may expose them to greater litigation risk. 50 To the extent that this type of ``soft'' information does not fall within the current safe harbor definition of ``forward-looking statements,'' however, it would not receive the protection of Rule 175 or 3b&hyph;6. 50 See, e.g. , Letter from Frank J. Borelli, Treasurer, Financial Executives Institute to Edmund L. Jenkins, Chairman, AICPA Special Committee on Financial Reporting, dated Aug. 8, 1994 (objecting to Jenkins Committee proposals for expanded disclosure of additional forward-looking and qualitative performance information due in part to litigation exposure). See also Eccles & Mavrinac , supra note 44; Stewart, supra note 44. The Conference Board has established a working group headed by Dr. Carolyn Brancato and comprised of U.S and foreign companies, institutional investors, analysts, and U.S. regulators. Charged with developing a systemic approach to disclosure of corporate performance, both on a financial and non-financial basis, by the spring of 1995, the Group is exploring ways of: (a) Encouraging companies to report their use of qualitative performance criteria despite the perceived litigation risk; and (b) educating institutional investors, analysts and others as to the utility of such information and its relationship to such quantitatively measured indicia of corporate performance as earnings. II. Judicial Approaches Toward Liability for Forward-Looking Statements Contemporaneously with the evolution of the Commission's policy on disclosure of forward-looking information, the federal courts have adopted a variety of approaches toward private antifraud claims arising from such disclosures. 51 51 The safe harbor provided by Rules 175 and 3b&hyph;6 has been implicated in only a small portion of cases involving forward-looking statements.
