FBIS4-53939 "dreas100_d_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 South Korea Government Stresses Labor-Management Cooperation Government Stresses Labor-Management Cooperation SK2305105394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0641 GMT 23 May 94 SK2305105394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The government stressed the need for labor-management cooperation at a high-level policy meeting held Monday to review the five-year "new economy" development plan, in the belief that labor may hold back an economy which is recovering from recession at a relatively rapid pace. Specially invited to attend the meeting were the top executive officers of 30 large business groups and their union leaders, who viewed a film showing how Goldstar Co. has achieved worker-management cooperation after experiencing harsh labor disputes in the late 1980s. Last year, the government had to stimulate the economy to lift it from a drawn-out recession and encourage industrialists to demonstrate an enterprising spirit as few signs of recovery were evident. In 1994, however, the government has shifted its policy focus to inflation and labor as the economy shows signs of a relatively rapid recovery. Earlier this year, the government was battling inflation triggered by hikes in public utility fees. As a result, inflation began slowing down in April and was brought under control in May. Compared with the extreme labor actions at Hyundai group companies and other large factories last year, disputes by workers have been moderate so far this year. But the government is worried about a recurrence of violent labor strikes as the economy is moving upward. As of the end of April, about 30 percent of large companies had completed collective wage bargaining, up 8 percentage points over a year earlier. Only 16.8 percent of the companies affiliated with the 30 large business groups, however, had done so. Moreover, Hyundai group and shipbuilding industry unions are moving to organize a separate industrial union from the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), while the unions of some large companies have already announced their defection from the FKTU. There are thus indications that the FKTU-led labor community is facing a drastic restructuring -- to the extent of charting a new course for the labor movement. Under these circumstances, the government hopes to turn labor-management relations from conflict to cooperation this year. Toward that end, it has decided to take steps to reduce industrial accidents, expand vocational training programs and improve working conditions. In implementing these measures the cooperation of employers, especially the chairmen of the 30 large business groups, is badly needed, and this is why the government invited the 30 corporate leaders to Monday's high-level policy meeting. Noted in the meeting were the economy's upward movement at a relatively fast pace and the need for early industrial restructuring to prepare for the end of the era of the three lows -- low oil prices, low interest rates and low exchange value of the won. During the first three-lows era in the 1980s, the economy failed at industrial restructuring, bringing about a downturn in 1990. To keep the economy from suffering another such downturn, the government plans to restructure industry while it is still brisk on the strength of the three lows. The economy is finally on the rise after emerging from a long tunnel lasting over three years. The government plans to start restructuring industry during this upswing to prevent the recurrence of a slump due to the failure of such restructuring efforts in the late 1980s.
