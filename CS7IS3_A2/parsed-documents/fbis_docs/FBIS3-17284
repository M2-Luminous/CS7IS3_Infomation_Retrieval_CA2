During their meeting in the Russian capital Monday [21 March] and Tuesday, Lithuanian and Russian negotiation teams initialled a bilateral agreement on border crossings. At a press conference in Vilnius Wednesday, Bulovas said the Lithuanian group paid primary attention to the implementation of the Lithuanian-Russian agreements signed last November and the fate of Lithuanian savings kept in the former Vneshekonombank and the Soviet Savings Bank. The Lithuanian negotiator said the Russian delegation focused on problems related to the Kaliningrad region. In Bulovas' words, his Russian counterpart Viktor Isakov complained of a number of problems as if encountered by the region, but when a separate group discussed Kaliningrad matters, only two problems remained -- customs duties and Russian transit through Lithuania by rail and by road. Both issues should be discussed in April, the Lithuanian diplomat said. Russia also raised the problem of military transit. The Lithuanian group said there are no intentions to sign a military transit agreement, but there will be transit regulations instead. The Russian side said it would like experts to hold consultations on military transit in May. This request was registered in the meeting's protocol but Lithuania did not promise anything, Bulovas said. Lithuanian negotiator Raimondas Barcevicius, who deals with commercial and economic matters, said presidents may have to intervene to achieve enforcement of economic and commercial treaties. Barcevicius said the agreement on the most favored nation trade status does not function because it has not been ratified by Russia. Moreover, he said, export to Russia became even more difficult in March when Russia changed its customs regulations. In Barcevicius' opinion, it becomes useless for Lithuania to renew its agreement with the Moscow city administration. The negotiator said Russia uses its new parliament as a cover to link the ratification of the most favored nation trade status agreement with a number of other problems. Barcevicius said similar problems are encountered in dealing with the return of lost savings. Ricardas Seidelis, also a member of the Lithuanian group, said Russia tries to link the return of savings with the problem of covering internal debts of the former Soviet Union. Seidelis said Russia's reaction was stormy when Lithuanian negotiators noted the matter might be referred to international arbitration. In his words, the Russian delegation immediately assured that the problem can be solved without any international interference.
