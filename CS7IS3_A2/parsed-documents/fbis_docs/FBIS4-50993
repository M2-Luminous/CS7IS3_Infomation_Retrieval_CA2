FBIS4-50993 "drchi100_p_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-100 Daily Report 3 Apr 1994 Central-South Region Hainan 1993 Procuratorial Work Report Hainan 1993 Procuratorial Work Report HK2405010894 Haikou HAINAN RIBAO in Chinese 3 Apr 94 p 2 HK2405010894 Haikou HAINAN RIBAO Chinese BFN [Report by Qin Xingmin, chief procurator of the Hainan Provincial People's Procuratorate, to the Second Session of the First Hainan Provincial People's Congress on 3 March 1994: "Work Report of the Hainan Provincial People's Procuratorate"] [Text] Deputies, In 1993, the provincial procuratorial organs at all levels conscientiously carried out the work deployment of the provincial party committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, put into practice the guidelines of the First Session of the First Provincial People's Congress, effectively performed the basic duties of procuratorial organs regarding "cracking down on crime, protecting the people, supervising law enforcement, and serving the economy," stuck to the work principle of "strictly enforcing the law and taking firm control of handling cases," firmly grasped the work focuses of anticorruption struggle and severe crackdown on serious criminal offenses, and intensified the supervisory work of law enforcement and the building of procuratorial personnel, so that new progress was made in all fields of endeavor. I should now like to brief you on the conditions of our major tasks as follows: I. Resolutely Carrying Out the Unified Deployment of the Party's Central Committee and Provincial Party Committee on Anticorruption Struggle and Concentrating Our Efforts on Checking and Acting on Major Important Cases of Corruption and Bribery In 1993, procuratorial organs at all levels across the province accepted and heard 527 cases of economic crimes including corruption, bribery, and so on, and placed 177 cases on file for investigation and prosecution. Of the total, there were 89 corruption cases, 17 bribery cases, and 49 cases of misappropriation of public funds; there were also 134 major cases involving 10,000 yuan or above, which accounted for 75.7 percent of the total cases filed for prosecution, higher than the national average of 29 percent. Of the major cases involving more than 10,000 yuan, five cases involved between 500,000 and 1 million yuan, and nine cases exceeded 1 million yuan. In these important cases, seven cadres at and above county departmental level were investigated and acted upon. In addition, 13 cases of tax evasion or tax resistance and five cases of forged trademarks were filed for investigation and prosecution and legal proceedings were also instituted against 129 offenders. Economic losses recovered for the state and the people amounted to 74.24 million yuan. Taken as a whole, relatively remarkable achievements have been made by the province's procuratorial organs thanks to their clear-cut guiding ideology on the anticorruption struggle. After Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech at the Second Plenum of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was published, the provincial party committee called an enlarged meeting of the standing committee to make arrangements for the anticorruption struggle, thus creating a favorable macroclimate for the struggle. In light of the deployment made by the provincial party committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the party group of the provincial people's procuratorate successively called a number of special meetings to study the anticorruption struggle. Our general idea was: While waging the struggle, the procuratorial organs should fight on two fronts -- 1) in society, we should resolutely punish economic criminals involved in corruption, bribery, and so on, increase the crackdown intensity, and stop the corrupt phenomena from spreading; and 2) within the ranks of cadres, we should intensify education on honesty and self-discipline, concentrate our efforts on rectifying malpractices, severely check and act on the corrupt elements who seek personal interests by abuse of power, and purify the contingent of procuratorial personnel. In line with this idea, we made concrete assignments for the procuratorial organs throughout the province to carry out the anticorruption struggle in timely fashion. As a result, the province's procuratorial organs at all levels took prompt action to conscientiously put into effect the central instructions on the campaign against corruption and, in light of the requirements set by the provincial party committee and the people's procuratorate, concentrated their energy on investigating and dealing with the major important cases, thereby starting an upsurge in handling cases. The number of cases filed for investigation and prosecution since last August increased substantially compared with the first half of the year. The number of cases accepted and heard during the five months from August to December was 159 more than that in the previous seven months, while the number of cases filed for investigation and prosecution and the number of major important cases identified and dealt with were 29 and 30 cases more respectively than those in the previous seven months. Several exceptionally big cases which had a bearing on society were also checked and acted upon, which included the frame-up and bribe-taking case of Li Shanyou, former deputy secretary general of the provincial government office; the fund misappropriation and bribe-taking case of Jia Xiaoming, former clerk of the international business department of the People's Construction Bank of China, Hainan Branch; the embezzlement and bribe-taking case of Lin Guangsen, general manager of Hainan Kanghai Industrial Corporation; and so on. In addition, we also organized various forces to participate in checking and dealing with the "17 December" extraordinarily serious tax fraud and the exceptionally big swindling case of the Great Wall Science and Technology Industrial Company which shook the entire country. While paying serious attention to placing cases on file for investigation and prosecution, procuratorial organs at all levels also took the settlement of cases as a significant aspect which reflected the achievements of investigating and dealing with major and important cases in that stage. They investigated and wound up a number of cases in a timely manner and, in coordination with the courts, prosecuted and openly dealt with a number of criminal offenders. For example, the Haikou City People's Procuratorate concentrated its picked personnel on handling and winding up the most serious bribery case since the PRC's founding at a fast speed by working extra hours, where five principal criminals, including Xue Genhe, were sentenced to death according to the law in late September and three other criminals were sentenced to imprisonment for set terms. Another criminal, Jiang Wei, former head of the provincial planning department, who was investigated by the anticorruption bureau of the provincial people's procuratorate for his involvement in the extremely big bribe-taking case, was prosecuted by the people's court and sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for life in mid-October. In summing up the anticorruption work over the past year, particularly since last August, we have adopted the following principal measures: 1. We conscientiously intensified leadership and guidance over the anticorruption work. At the beginning of last year, the provincial procuratorate sent four work teams led by members of the party group to go deep into the grass-roots units, inspect their work, and provide them with guidance. In the second quarter, it again enlisted four work teams to help grass-roots units screen the accumulated cases and place new cases on file for investigation. In April, a forum of the provincial chief procurators was held to put into effect the guidelines of the Supreme People's Procuratorate on the intensification of the anticorruption struggle. The provincial people's procuratorate issued a circular to the lower levels on the enhancement of anticorruption work and a provincial meeting on case reporting work was also held at the end of that month. In July, we convened the second provincial procuratorial work meeting, at which we adopted the "Decisions on Further Enhancing Anticorruption Work To Serve the Socialist Market Economic Development in the Special Economic Region" and the "Decisions on Launching Law Enforcement Activities Among the Procuratorial Organs Throughout the Province" with the contents of enforcing the law in a strict, open-minded, honest, and civilized way. In the second half of August, we called an emergency teleconference on anticorruption work to promptly transmit to the lower levels the spirit of the central authorities on the campaign against corruption, proposing nine concrete measures for anticorruption struggle in accordance with the actual conditions of Hainan, including: Calling for provincial procuratorates at all levels to publicize their telephone numbers for case reporting once again; practicing a system under which mass reporting was accepted 12 hours a day and chief procurators would receive informants on certain days; setting up a command and coordination center for investigating and handling major important cases; publishing FANTAN KUAIXUN [NEWSLETTER ON CAMPAIGN AGAINST CORRUPTION]; dividing the province into eastern, central, and western battlefields and enlisting special forces to give guidance to the handling of cases in the respective battlefields; stressing the importance of chief procurators' taking the initiative in handling cases, particularly the major and important ones; and so on. According to statistics, of the 25 procuratorates in the province, 31 cases involving corruption, bribery, and others were investigated and dealt with personally by chief procurators and 59 cases were handled with their participation. By so doing, they set a very good example for the procuratorial personnel. In November, we again held meetings in the abovementioned three battlefields, calling for procuratorial organs at all levels across the province to firmly grasp the work in the last two months of the year and concentrate efforts on investigating and solving some more cases, prosecuting some other offenders, and coordinating with the courts for public trials for a number of cases to reflect the achievements at that stage. 2. We took powerful measures to mobilize the masses to report cases. Early last year, the provincial people's procuratorate and HAINAN FAZHI BAO jointly sponsored an "award competition on legal knowledge of the campaign against corruption and bribery" and comparatively good social results were scored. In the course of implementing the central guidelines on anticorruption since August, the procuratorial organs at all levels throughout the province had positively coordinated with various party committees and governments in conducting propaganda and mobilization work on a relatively grand scale, and various localities had made use of newspapers, radio stations, television stations, and other media to openly reveal a number of typical cases. Chief procurators also made televised or broadcast speeches. In the meantime, telephone numbers for case reporting were made public again and boxes for case reporting increased in number. Some county and city procuratorates also sent propaganda cars to tour villages, factories, mines, and farms to extensively mobilize the masses to report economic crimes of corruption, bribery, and so on, thereby releasing the enthusiasm of the masses for case reporting. In September alone, 173 cases were reported and accepted for hearing, which was 3 times more than the figure for the previous eight months, i.e., 55 cases on average. In October, the number of cases increased by 18 percent over September. During the five months between August and December, 788 cases were accepted and heard, 92.7 percent more than in the corresponding period of the previous year, and 379 cases more than those for the first seven months in 1993. This was the peak period with the largest number of cases reported and accepted since the founding of the reporting centers of the provincial procuratorial organs. Moreover, there was a special feature of "three mores and one greater," i.e., more signed reports on cases, more clues provided for major and important cases, and more reports concerning key departments, with a greater value for investigation. 3. We stressed the key points and concentrated our efforts on investigating and dealing with the criminal cases concerning the key departments. In light of the requirements of the central authorities, procuratorial organs at all levels focused the crackdown on the criminal cases such as corruption, bribery, and so on committed by personnel in party and government organs, as well as in judicial, administrative, law enforcement, and economic management departments. During the five months between August and December, procuratorial organs throughout the province placed 44 corruption and bribery cases involving personnel from the abovementioned departments on file for investigation and prosecution, accounting for a quarter of the total cases on file. Of this total, there were 14 cases that involved 20 personnel from the judicial department for their conduct in extorting confessions from legal offenders or government workers by torture, or of releasing them privately in dereliction of their duties. There was a great and shocking impact on society when these cases were checked and acted upon, which attained good legal and social results and further demonstrated the determination of the party and government to punish corruption. 4) We lost no time in tracking down embezzled money and did our utmost to recover the economic losses of the state. In checking and acting upon the corruption and bribery cases, procuratorial organs at all levels not only persisted in severely punishing criminals in accordance with the law but also surmounted all difficulties to trace and recover embezzled money in good time. Take the Xue Genhe case as an example. After most of the embezzled money, totaling 33.44 million yuan, had flowed out into a dozen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions all over the country, the personnel in charge of the case overcame various difficulties, particularly the obstacle of local protectionism, to track down and seize nearly 30 million yuan. Another 14 million yuan was also chased after and recovered from the Jia Xiaoming and the "17 December" extraordinarily serious tax fraud cases, which were handled by the anticorruption bureau of the provincial people's procuratorate. Illicit money and stolen property equivalent to 74.24 million yuan were recovered last year, which witnessed the largest amount of economic losses to be recovered by the procuratorial organs since the founding of the province. In short, since last year, and since last August in particular, the province's procuratorial organs have taken the initiative in firmly grasping the work to punish corruption and check and act on major important cases so that the campaign developed in depth in a healthy and orderly way. However, judging from the conditions of investigating and dealing with cases by the procuratorial organs, the tasks of the anticorruption campaign were still extremely arduous and heavy. Though we should affirm our achievements, we must not be blindly optimistic. The principal characteristics of the cases of corruption, bribery, and other economic crimes which occurred in the province were as follows: First, the amount of money involved in the economic crimes was increasingly larger. Over the past few years, the proportion of major cases that involved an amount of more than 10,000 yuan, which had been filed by the province's procuratorial organs for investigation and prosecution, had exceeded 70 percent, ranking in the forefront of the entire country. This reflected the extreme rapacity of the criminals. Second, there were a large number of crimes committed in defiance of the anticorruption campaign, as 70 percent of the crimes were committed last year after the crackdown began, which manifested, to a certain extent, hfow rampant the criminals were. Third, the bribery offenses either took the form of covert activities like "between you and me" or the form of overt or semi-overt actions under the pretext of engaging in the market economy. Some people took advantage of the power in their hands to seek personal benefits, refused to perform official duties without being paid, or even openly asked for and accepted bribes under pretexts of every description. Fourth, criminal cases in the economic hot spots increased and the tactics were repeatedly changed. Some lawbreaking elements committed crimes by availing themselves of loopholes in the reform and opening up, the transformation from old to new structures, and the still unsound management mechanisms. For instance, some personnel in securities departments embezzled money by making use of "time differences" or "price differences" in stock trading; others misappropriated public funds for speculation in stocks, land, houses, and so on to reap exorbitant profits. The new situation and problems had increased the difficulty of the procuratorial organs in their law enforcement activities and, at the same time, set even higher demands on them. Fifth, the corruption and bribery criminals generally committed a variety of crimes. They usually embezzled public funds and asked for and took bribes and so on. After obtaining large sums of money, they squandered it by eating and drinking extravagantly, gambling, and patronizing prostitutes, so that the state property suffered great losses. At present, the anticorruption struggle is developing in depth, the masses hate the corrupt phenomena bitterly, and their enthusiasm in the struggle is very high. However, people will also discover that in some enterprises, there are cases which have not been reported because they were afraid of washing their dirty linen in public as this would tarnish their image and affect their rating. Hence, they would rather gloss things over within the enterprises to avoid trouble or report the cases only after the offenders had run away with the money. Some of them worried that they would draw fire on themselves if they exposed such offenses, and others dared not report those corrupt elements with power and influence, lest their own economic interests be damaged. What is more, in investigating and dealing with the major important cases, more often than not, the procuratorial personnel encountered some interference and obstruction because some people considered the anticorruption struggle as conflicting with reform and opening up. They were anxious that the investigation and prosecution of cases by procuratorial organs would adversely affect reform, opening up, and economic construction. This added manmade difficulties to the handling of cases. As viewed from the conditions of work performed by the province's procuratorial organs, there was still a long distance to go from the requirements of the central authorities and provincial party committee and from the expectations of the people's deputies and the broad masses. In procuratorial organs at various levels there were some major important cases which had been placed on file for investigation and prosecution but had not been wound up in good time; some evidence in cases reported by the masses had not been fed back as preliminary investigations had not been conducted; and, in a few localities, lots of work had been done but very few results in handling the major important cases had been scored. In addition, the tight funds for handling cases and the backward means of communications and investigation also restricted the solution of cases to a certain extent, thus hindering the progress of the anticorruption struggle. These problems should be conscientiously resolved in out future work. We are firmly confident that under the leadership of the provincial party committee and party committees at various levels, under the supervision of the people's congresses at various levels, and with the support of governments, cadres, and masses throughout the province, still greater achievements will certainly be attained in investigating and dealing with the major important cases and remarkable results will certainly be obtained in the anticorruption struggle in our province. II. Cracking Down Unremittingly and Severely on Serious Criminal Activities and Safeguarding Social Stability in the Hainan Special Economic Region It was another work focus of the procuratorial organs to severely crack down on serious criminal activities. Since last year, procuratorial organs at all levels throughout the province have persistently taken the "severe crackdown" struggle and participation in the overall control of social security as an important task to safeguard social stability in the special economic region and ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. Accordingly, new achievements have been attained. In 1993, the province's procuratorial organs at all levels accepted and heard 2,578 people, whom the public security organs proposed to arrest and 2,239 people of them were finally arrested. Besides, they also accepted and heard 2,659 people transferred from the public security organs for prosecution and legal proceedings were initiated against 2,301 of them after examination and investigation. In the "severe crackdown" struggle we stuck to the principle of dealing with crimes severely and rapidly according to the law, with stress on cracking down on serious criminal cases and organized underworld gangs, including murder, robbery, rape, causing explosions, armed violence, and so on, so that their arrests were approved and prosecution initiated in good time. During the whole year, 519 criminals in major or exceptionally serious cases were arrested, accounting for 23.2 percent of all criminals arrested. In order to reflect the principle of dealing with crimes severely and rapidly in procuratorial work, the people's procuratorates at all levels throughout the province persistently practiced the system of attending to major and exceptionally serious cases ahead of time. This meant: 1) participating in the activities of on-site inspections, examining corpses, and so on; 2) participating in the preliminary trials of defendants and questioning important witnesses; and 3) participating in discussions with investigation departments concerning the nature, evidence, and other matters in some major difficult cases. According to statistics, at the stage of obtaining approval for arrest, the procuratorial organs throughout the entire province attended to several major or exceptionally serious cases ahead of time, in which 247 people were involved; and at the initiating prosecution stage, they also attended to cases involving 81 people ahead of time. Take the extraordinarily serious case committed in Haikou City as an example, the defendant Zhang Weisen stole two submachine guns, three pistols, and 600 rounds of ammunition from the Xiuying Frontier Station. As the Haikou City People's Procuratorate sent personnel to attend to the case ahead of time, it took only three days to have the case prosecuted and lodged with the court after the public security organ wound up the case and transferred it to be examined for prosecution. We intensified supervision over investigation and trial in the work of obtaining approval for arrest and prosecution. With regard to the intensified supervision over investigation, this focused on the malpractices of sparing some crimes without being investigated and dealt with and of imposing fines in lieu of penalties. With regard to the intensified supervision over trials, this focused on the malpractices whhereby those guilty of crimes were acquitted, those having committed serious crimes were given mild punishment, and those having committed minor crimes were punished drastically. Over the past year, with the supervision of procuratorial organs over investigation, decisions had been made to reject applications for the arrest of 104 people, as legal requirements for their arrest had not been met; while 64 people who should have been arrested but were not reported by public security organs for approval, were arrested by follow-up decisions. A total of 104 cases involving 422 people were returned to the investigation department for supplementary evidence mainly because the facts of their crimes had not been distinctly established and evidence was inadequate. As regards investigation activities in violation of the law, we made written or oral suggestions to correct them in good time. Owing to our supervision over trials, decisions had been made to exempt 23 people from prosecution, while 14 offenders who should have been indicted on criminal charges but had not been reported to the procuratorial organs, were finally prosecuted. Besides, opposition was made to 35 cases which were wrongly adjudicated, of which 11 cases were settled by the court and verdicts in six cases involving 10 people were readjusted. We took an active part in the struggle and rectification in specific operations. Proceeding from the local reality, the procuratorial organs at all levels across the province coordinated with the public security organs and courts in the unified action of "unearthing criminal gangs, striking at convicts on the run, chasing escaped criminals, and solving serious cases," as well as in the struggle in specific operations aimed at combating theft, besieging "train robbers and highwaymen," cracking down on the abduction of women and children, prohibiting prostitution, and so on. Rectification in specific operations was conducted in areas where problems were numerous and public order was in chaos, to effectively safeguard social stability in the province and ensure the safety of the people during major festivals. We paid serious attention to the ratification of arrest and prosecution to guarantee the quality in handling cases. First, we further established and improved various handling procedures and laid firm hold of rules and regulations to ensure the quality. Second, we stepped up investigation and study of the new situation and problems and correctly distinguished between crimes and noncrimes. For instance, aiming at the problems in some localities where a lot of cases had been returned for investigation, pronounced not guilty, or exonerated from accusation without good reasons, we carried out investigation and study and proposed improved measures to step up the inspection of crucial cases and key units. The province's subprocuratorate held a seminar to discuss the knotty problems that had cropped up in areas under its jurisdiction in a bid to better resolve the problems encountered in handling difficult cases. Third, we took firm control of the work of prosecuting criminals in court in order to elevate the overall level of public prosecutors' ability in argument and prosecution in court. While waging the "severe crackdown" struggle, procuratorial organs at all levels firmly grasped the implementation of various measures for the overall control of social security in their work. In handling cases, they paid attention to discovering the hidden trouble in the management work of relevant units, made suggestions from the procuratorial points of view in a timely manner, and helped relevant units plug loopholes to reduce crime. In light of the procuratorial work, they positively conducted law propaganda in various forms and practiced a system of paying visits to, making observations of, providing help for, and carrying on education among the exonerated individuals and criminals serving sentences out of prison to prevent them from committing new crimes and to reduce the unstable factors in society. They also handled letters and visits from the masses in a timely manner and conscientiously conducted education to straighten out their sentiments to avoid sharpening the contradictions and to expeditiously eliminate various unstable factors. In coordination with relevant departments, they set up contact points for the overall control of social security and launched activities to build a clean and honest administration with concerted efforts. Moreover, they set up prevention organs in the anticorruption departments, placed the work of preventing corruption, bribery, and other economic crimes as an important item on the agenda, and studied measures for putting an end once and for all to the breeding of corrupt phenomena. Safeguarding political and social stability in the country is an important guarantee for reform and development. Generally speaking, social security in our province is good at present. However, we must also note soberly that the social security situation in our province is still grim, as the occurrence of serious criminal activities is showing a rising trend and serious cases of violence such as murder using firearms, robbery, and so on are still running rampant. Comparing 1993 with 1992, the number of serious cases rose by 7.3 percent and that of extraordinarily serious cases by 8.9 percent. Criminal activities conducted by gangs are also rather serious, particularly by those engaging in theft and robbery along railroads and highways and those composed of hooligans, some of which have become underworld gangs. Along with constantly deepening reform and the readjustment of interest relations, new contradictions and problems will continue to crop up and factors affecting political and social stability in our province may increase. Since the tasks of the "severe crackdown" struggle are still extremely formidable, we absolutely must not relax our efforts to deal heavy and rapid blows at the serious crimes in accordance with the law. The procuratorial organs at all levels across the province must bring into full play their major functional role as instruments of the people's democratic dictatorship in safeguarding the political and social stability in our province while persisting in implementing the "severe crackdown" principle and closely coordinating with the departments of public security organs, courts, and so on. III. Seriously Checking and Acting on Criminal Cases of "Infringing on Rights," Neglecting Duties, and Comprehensively Performing Procuratorial Work in Various Aspects -- Procuratorial work in respect of law and discipline. Procuratorial departments in charge of law and discipline at all levels across the province seriously put into practice the principle of "strictly enforcing the law and taking a firm hold of case handling," positively coordinated with the anticorruption struggle, and focused their work on investigating and dealing with the offenses of "infringing on rights" and neglecting duties, such as practicing favoritism, committing irregularities, extorting confessions by compulsion, illegally detaining people, trifling with their duties, causing accidents through negligence, and so on. Last year, 212 cases of such offenses were accepted and heard, 24.7 percent more than 1992 and 41 cases involving 58 people were placed on file for investigation, of which 19 cases were extraordinarily serious and four people were involved in vitally important cases. Direct economic losses amounting to 2.29 million yuan were recovered for the state. Wang Shengping and Cai Yongji from the Hainan Xinhua Accountants' Office accepted bribes to issue a false report on asset examination for a certain investment group in Hainan to the effect that the said "group had a paid-up capital of $10 million," with which the group conducted an exceptionally big swindle causing extremely serious consequences. Apart from investigating and affixing criminal responsibility to the abovementioned two defendants, the relevant procuratorial department also checked and acted on the persons in charge of the accountants' office for dereliction of duty and the case is now placed on file for investigation and prosecution. Actions taken by the procuratorial organs to identify and deal with criminal cases of "infringing on rights" and dereliction of duties according to the law have played a significant role in intensifying the building of socialist democracy and legal system, punishing corruption, promoting the diligent and honest performance of official duties, and safeguarding and facilitating the establishment and development of a market economy. -- Procuratorial work in respect of prisons. Procuratorial departments in charge of prisons at all levels across the province placed the supervision of law enforcement in a primary position, accepted cases involving 34 recidivists, and instituted legal proceedings against them according to the law. Actions against the law which involved 2,726 prisoners serving sentences in jails for reeducation through labor were corrected in accordance with the law. Of these, 1,797 people had been detained for longer terms and 20 people were detained without testimony. There was a total of 77 instances of potentially dangerous conditions in some of the detention centers and measures were taken to correct them. Besides, 43 cases of indictments or appeals initiated by detainees or their families were also handled. -- Procuratorial work in respect of indictments and appeals. Procuratorial departments continued to conduct activities of receiving the people in a civilized manner, persisted in practicing the system under which chief procurators personally attended to the letters and visits of the masses, and further enhanced the work of case reexamination. As a result, 2,527 cases of indictments were accepted during the year of which 2,253 cases were handled either by direct hearing and giving replies to the persons who brought in the indictments, or by transferring their cases to the pertinent departments. With regard to appeals, 525 cases were accepted and 516 were handled. The Provincial People's Procuratorate corrected the case of Chen Taixin, a people's deputy from Ledong County, for illegal detention and trial by the local public security bureau, thus safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the people's deputy, for which the provincial people's congress standing committee and the province's political science and law commission issued a special circular to affirm the correct handling of this case. -- Procuratorial work in respect of civil and administrative affairs. While improving work, reinforcing strength, and straightening out relations in organs, procuratorial departments enthusiastically conducted work in case handling. During last year, 55 cases of lawsuits in civil and administrative affairs were accepted and opposition to undeniably wrong judgments and adjudications were lodged with the court according to the law, so that the verdicts of some of them were revised. Although the work started late, this supervisory function will become increasingly important under the market economy conditions. -- Procuratorial work in respect of investigation, study, and information. Since last year, in light of the comparatively weak links in the procuratorial organs across the province in terms of investigation, study, and information, we started deepening the understanding of personnel and took powerful measures to change the situation so that greater improvements have been made in these aspects. We convened the first provincial symposium on the work of investigation and study in procuratorial departments and proposed the missions, demands, and measures for enhancing the work. The Provincial People's Procuratorate began publishing the periodical JIANCHA XIN SHIDAI [NEW ERA OF PROCURATORIAL WORK], which opened up a new realm for the enhancement of investigation and study. In addition, the procuratorate also started the first training class on procuratorial information and conducted activities on appraisal through comparison to elect advanced units and fine workers in the information business. Thanks to the serious attention paid to the work, a good atmosphere in investigation and study is taking shape in the procuratorial organs across the province so that information work has been further strengthened. IV. Sticking to the Principle of "Administering Procuratorates Strictly" and Taking Firm Control of Building a Contingent of Procuratorial Personnel Since last year, procuratorial organs at all levels across the province have conscientiously organized the study of central documents concerning the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," with a view to arming the minds of the vast number of cadres and policemen with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In particular, while carrying out the instructions and guidelines of the central authorities on the anticorruption struggle, we intensified the anticorruption work within our ranks so that all personnel were tested and tempered in the in-depth struggle. With regard to the building of our ranks, in the main we fulfilled the following tasks: First, we held a provincial meeting on political work to review and sum up the ideological and political work performed in the procuratorial organs in the past few years and assigns the tasks ahead. Second, we completed the reelection work smoothly whereby the average age of chief procurators at all levels was reduced and their cultural and professional standards were enhanced. Third, with the approval of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the provincial party committee, the pilot work for the "Regulations on Prosecutors" was conducted throughout the province. Fourth, we put into serious practice the "Decisions on Launching a Law Enforcement Activity Among the Procuratorial Organs Throughout the Province" with the contents of enforcing the law in a strict, open-minded, honest, and civilized way, which was adopted in the second provincial procuratorial work meeting last year. As a result, the consciousness of the vast number of cadres and policemen on the honest and diligent performance of their duties, strict observation of law and discipline, and their standards of law enforcement were enhanced to some extent. Fifth, we conducted conscientious education on opposing corruption and encouraging honesty among the cadres and policemen. Meanwhile, cadres at and above section head level earnestly made self examinations and self rectification in accordance with the five requirements set by the central authorities. Sixth, we reinforced the training of cadres and policemen, through which 266 cadres were trained in six training classes sponsored by pertinent business departments of the provincial people's procuratorate. Ten cadres participated in the training course at the Central Prosecutor Management College and 240 cadres studied in courses for professional diplomas. Deputies, although certain achievements were attained in the province's procuratorial work in 1993, there were still some problems and weak links in our work. Apart from those mentioned above, there was also the problem of uneven development in work. In some places where working conditions were more or less the same, the work results were quite different owing to the varying degrees of effort they had made. In the anticorruption struggle, they failed to reap prominent results in checking and dealing with the criminal cases of corruption and bribery in party and government organs, judicial departments, law enforcement departments, and economic management departments according to the requirements of the central authorities. In some areas, the tasks of pursuing and capturing escaped criminals and screening accumulated economic crimes were still extremely arduous. The conditions of office buildings used by the procuratorial organs and the facilities for law enforcement also await urgent improvement. Political education, professional training, and education on opposing corruption and encouraging honesty still need to be repeatedly deepened and strengthened. Deputies, The year 1994 is one in which reform will be accelerated in China. It is also a year full of hope. As the reform intensity in the Hainan Special Economic Region will be increased, the development tasks will be even heavier. The new situation has set still higher demands on our procuratorial work. Regarding the work in 1994, we held a provincial conference of chief procurators in early January this year to sum up our work conscientiously, analyze the situation, unify thinking, and clearly define our missions. Our general guiding idea is: This year, procuratorial organs at all levels across the province should put into effect seriously the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the Second Session of the First Hainan Provincial People's Congress, conscientiously study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," persistently seek guidance in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, stick to the principle of "doing two types of work simultaneously and attaching equal importance to both," further intensify the functions of law inspection, strictly enforce the law, take firm control of case handling, and resolutely crack down on various criminal activities, to create a favorable legal environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction in our province and provide a guarantee for the establishment and development of a socialist market economy structure. We must carry out the anticorruption struggle profoundly and concentrate our efforts on investigating and dealing with major important cases. The province's procuratorial organs at all levels should persistently take punishing economic crime, including corruption, bribery, and so on, as the most important and direct service rendered to economic construction, make mental preparations for waging a protracted battle, and focus the work on investigating and dealing with such economic crimes as corruption, bribery, and so on committed by party and government organs, judicial departments, law enforcement departments, economic management departments, as well as their personnel. New breakthroughs should be made in the area of investigating and dealing with major important cases. We must seriously investigate and deal with criminal cases involving legal persons by selecting typical examples, breaking through key points and, in accordance with the law, investigating and ferreting out various criminal activities including offering bribes, taking bribes, smuggling, evading taxes, refusing to pay taxes, making false tax reports, forging bogus registered trademarks, and so on in organs, organizations, enterprises, and institutions. At the same time, we must pay serious attention to unearthing and investigating other crimes of accepting bribes, practicing favoritism, committing irregularities, neglecting official duties, and so on committed by government workers in connection with the crimes of legal persons. In light of the characteristics in our province, we must also make serious investigation into the criminal cases committed in transfers of land, those major important cases in particular, and the criminal activities of using public funds to engage in land, stock, and property speculation, to further the anticorruption struggle in our province in a penetrating way. We must continue to adhere to the principle of cracking down on serious criminal activities rigorously and rapidly in accordance with the law. Under the conditions of practicing a market economy, political and social stability is an essential guarantee and prerequisite for pushing forward reform and development. The social security in our province at present is still very grim, which is why procuratorial organs at all levels throughout the province must continue to deal heavy blows against serious criminal activities, stick to the principle of handling cases in a rigorous and rapid manner, as well as the principle of "two basic points" according to the law, and take speedy action in arresting and prosecuting lest we should bungle the chance of winning a battle in the procuratorial work domain. We must also coordinate with public security organs and courts in the unified action of the entire province to crack down on criminal activities, particularly on those committed using firearms and positively participate in the struggle of specific operations and rectification of disorder in some key areas as organized by various localities according to actual local conditions. Combining this task with the handling of cases, we must put into practice comprehensively various measures for the overall control of social security in procuratorial work, formulating detailed rules and regulations for the implementation of "Several Stipulations on Practicing a Leadership Responsibility System in the Overall Control of Social Security" promulgated by the central authorities, so that leading cadres in procuratorial organs at all levels will really assume their responsibilities to maintain law and order in their own localities. We must intensify supervision over law enforcement and conduct procuratorial business in a comprehensive way. While paying attention to performing strict law enforcement in procuratorial departments, we should also exercise supervision over other departments in respect of law enforcement and, through investigating and dealing with cases that were not handled with strict legal procedures and through rectifying activities in violation of laws, supervise and urge other departments to enforce laws rigorously to maintain the unity of state laws and ensure their correct implementation. We must make further efforts to augment the building of the procuratorial ranks with stress on the trial implementation of the "Regulations on Prosecutors" and the in-depth activities of enforcing laws in a strict, open-minded, honest, and civilized way; repeatedly enhance the political and professional standards of the vast number of cadres and policemen; and work hard to build a contingent of procuratorial personnel who are powerful politically, competent professionally, strict in discipline, and good in style, in a bid to make new contributions to accelerating the development of a socialist market economy and the drive for modernization in our province. I hereby present the above report to you for your examination and approval.
