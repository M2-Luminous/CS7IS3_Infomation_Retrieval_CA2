For months, both London and Dublin forbore to impose a deadline for Sinn Fein to accept December's Downing Street Declaration. The two governments put up with Sinn Fein's obvious prevarication, its attempts to start negotiations without renouncing violence, and the propaganda advantage which its leader, Gerry Adams, was able to garner while the world awaited his response. Repeatedly it was explained that, whatever the provocations of Mr Adams, both the Prime Minister and the Irish Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, were prepared to go that extra mile for peace. Now, after the Heathrow attacks, they are generally perceived to have failed. Sinn Fein has issued a statement demanding talks, without accepting the precondition that the IRA should first abandon violence. The Downing Street Declaration was accompanied by unspecified threats of a security clampdown if the IRA spurned its place at the conference table. There seemed at least an implication that, in such an event, the Irish Republic would at last throw its full weight behind new security measures. Now that the IRA has called its bluff, that prospect looks remote. The Irish have promised to tighten up their extradition law, but little else. Internment and the right of hot pursuit across the border do not seem to figure even remotely on the Irish agenda, although -- as John Keegan discusses on the facing page -- joint internment would offer the brightest prospect of ending the terrorist campaign. Nor, it seems, are the Irish much interested in attempts to make political progress in the absence of Sinn Fein. There is little we can do about any of this; the Irish are our neighbours and we must live with the limitations of their polity. But next time the British Government contemplates a joint initiative with its Irish counterpart, it should remember that while Dublin is always interested in extracting constitutional concessions, it remains unable to deliver its own society -- above all its judiciary -- on the key issue of security. The only encouraging aspect of the present impasse is that, events at Heathrow notwithstanding, Sinn Fein and the IRA also look weak. They are clearly divided as to how to respond to the Declaration and concerned that it has undermined the will of a significant proportion of its supporters, both in the Republic and Ulster. Their statement at the weekend contained little of the usual bombast; indeed their plea for talks without preconditions sounded almost plaintive. They may still mount "spectaculars" but their capacity indefinitely to maintain their campaign must be in doubt, when many in their ranks think that a negotiated deal is available. The terrorist campaign is likely to persist, however, as long as Sinn Fein believes that British will is uncertain, that Dublin is disinclined to tighten the security squeeze, and that the distant prospect exists of a better deal from a British Labour government. The only course now is to leave the Declaration on the table for Sinn Fein to ponder, and meanwhile press on with the security struggle against the IRA -- with or without increased help from Dublin.
