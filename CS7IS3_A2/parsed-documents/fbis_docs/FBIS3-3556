Several power plants, including three 1.2 million-kilowatt stations in Xiangtan, Wangcheng and Yiyang, have been approved by the province's Power Industry Bureau for overseas co-operation. The bureau has also set up a special working group to raise foreign capital. Officials with the bureau said investors from Germany, Sweden, Australia, France, Britain, Canada, the United States and Hong Kong show strong interest in investing in Hunan's power industry. The New Xiangtan Power Station is expected to cooperate with investors from Sweden, and a German company is negotiating with the bureau for construction of the Wangcheng Power Plant. Last year, TIME Engineering Berhad, a member of the Malaysian Renong Group, signed a contract with Lianyuan city to construct a 250-megawatt coal-fired power station in the city. Total investment for that project was put at $230 million. Wu Haichun, general manager of the province's Power Industry Corp, admitted that Hunan has one of the country's worst shortages of electricity, but he promised that the province will make big progress this year. By the end of 1993, the province had installed capacity of 6.58 million kilowatts, double the figure in 1980. However, its per capita consumption of electricity is only 60 per cent of the national average. Wu said that from l994 to 2000, the province plans to install another 9 million kilowatts of capacity, of which 7 million will be thermal and 2 million hydropower. But to do that, Hunan needs 30 billion yuan ($3.45 billion). Wu said the province will use various methods to raise the capital. To expand the government's fund for electrical investment, the province is expected to raise electricity prices this year. It also plans to raise money from the securities market by converting power enterprises into shareholding companies. Hunan Huayin Power Co Ltd, the province's first shareholding power company, was established last year and is expected to go public. The company has issued shares worth 288 million yuan ($33 million), and most of the money raised will be used to renovate the Zhuzhou Power Plant. The province also plans to invest 2.75 billion yuan ($315 million) in electrical construction this year, compared with 1.71 billion yuan ($191 million) last year.
