The attempt on President Dzhokhar Dudayev's life on 27 May, the statement stressed, was the latest in a series of terrorist acts conducted by Russia's special services in the three years of the Chechen state's existence. [passage omitted] According to Chechen Press and Information Minister Movladi Udugov in an interview with an INTERFAX correspondent, preliminary examination has established that "this type of explosive device and its components are used for sabotage and terrorist purposes by the special services of the KGB, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, and others." On Saturday the Chechnya cabinet of ministers, chaired by President Dzhokhar Dudayev, held an emergency session and imposed a curfew in the republic. May 29 was declared a day of mourning in the republic. Yesterday the statement came out accusing Russia and asserting that, "taking cover behind false words about democracy, the Russian leadership is systematically and purposefully working to undermine Chechnya's sovereignty. All this is happening amid reports about pending talks between Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev, but no such proposals have come to the Chechnya leadership through official channels." According to representatives of the Chechnya Foreign Ministry, the true intentions of the Russian leadership consist in "backstage contacts between highly-placed Russian officials and dubious personalities who have compromised themselves with antinational actions in the Chechen Republic."
