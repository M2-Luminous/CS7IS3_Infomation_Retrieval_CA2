This approach is embodied by President Clinton's proposals for the future of the Atlantic Alliance, which he will present to the NATO summit in Brussels next week. For fear of agitating nationalist elements in Russia--and thus jeopardising President Yeltsin's reform programme--the former Warsaw Pact countries are to be denied any immediate prospect of the security guarantees they covet. Instead of clear criteria for eventual membership of NATO, they are to be offered the far vaguer "Partnerships for Peace." This consolation prize will be available to all former Warsaw Pact countries, irrespective of their ultimate suitability for membership. There are excellent reasons for rejecting the notion of granting every East European state immediate admission to NATO. One of the foremost lessons of modern history is the folly of offering security guarantees which the guarantors lack both the means and the will to implement. But, as the East European nations emerge from the shadow of their communist past and democratic societies evolve, they deserve every encouragement to believe that the West will welcome them into the fold. We have always urged that the European Community should adopt a more positive policy towards trade with the east. Yet Washington's current policy, however well-intentioned, threatens to undo many of the gains of the democratic revolutions of 1989. Not only is it unwise to predicate the security of such countries as Hungary upon events in Russia, where democratic development is far less certain; it even seems unlikely to succeed in its own flawed terms. To "defeat" Mr Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by stealing some of his clothes--as the New Year message from the Kremlin seemed to imply--is no basis for the future stability of the continent. Moreover, to concede Russia droit de regard in East Europe will strengthen, rather than weaken, irredentist elements. Partly because of a consistent "Russia first" policy towards the region, hardline forces of the military-industrial complex are now stronger than at any time since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yet the precedent of German re-unification within NATO suggests that a determined American policy to extend the zone of stability eastwards is not merely reconcilable with Western interests; it would also enable democrats in Moscow to tell the neo-communists and Slavophiles that Western policy offers no choice but continued reform, or renewed confrontation. The present American approach simply offers Mr Yeltsin an easy way out vis-a-vis the parliament. They know that Mr Clinton will support them, come what may. None of this is to suggest that Russia should be quarantined; even the Polish foreign minister has asserted that a democratic Russia is the best guarantee for European stability. But the question is how best to bring this about. We have persistently argued that the example of prosperous and free neighbouring states would do as much as anything to steer Russia's development in a positive direction. The nations of East Europe are far likelier to maintain this course if a realistic prospect is opened up of eventual full partnership with the West. NATO remains the only viable structure for assuring their security. For, important as the European Community is in economic terms, it is still--in the words of the Belgian foreign minister during the Gulf war--a political dwarf and a military worm. Mr Clinton's performance on his first visit, as president, to Europe will be as vital as those of his predecessors in the Cold War epoch.
