Gyula Horn pointed out that the Socialists will agree to govern alone if their partners get scared. Personally, Gyula Horn regards the position of prime minister as a great challenge; reacting to the reservations of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Horn said that the victorious party chairman is also usually given the prime minister's post according to West European practice. [Szombathy] Leading SZDSZ politicians have recently indicated that the SZDSZ would not form a coalition with the MSZP if the party nominates you as prime minister. Will such messages affect your intentions? [Horn] I find it strange that one of the opposition parties is dealing with such personnel combinations two weeks before the second round of elections. Let us wait for the election results, and then the distribution of posts can be part of the coalition talks. SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto visited me over the weekend and kindly expressed his sympathy regarding this... should I say?... accident of mine. Both Peto and other SZDSZ leaders expressed the view that, starting from the experience of the past four years, it would not be a good thing to have the party chairman also as prime minister. This was the basic objection of the Free Democrats. I answered that we constantly mention Western examples and a party chairman-prime minister set up prevails almost everywhere in the West, in the case of both social democratic and conservative governments. The head of the party that won the elections is generally the one who forms a government. Besides, this is an issue that we will have time to deal with after 29 May. [Szombathy] Would you accept a possible nomination as prime minister? Do you have such ambitions? [Horn] I have never asked for any position in my life; nor will I do so this time. If the MSZP decides to make me the candidate for prime minister, I will naturally accept this. This is a great challenge for anyone, and I have always liked challenges. One can only meet such a challenge with very tough and consistent work. Together with my party, I put my entire life at stake to see this country somehow prosper at long last. Hungary also suffers because there are few who care about others' problems. The past four years has shown the superabundance and harmful consequences of individual and personal ambitions. If I can live for the interest of this country, and we can do this, and if we can see to it that the overwhelming majority of our population live better, it would be a pity to reject such a task. [Szombathy] Have you considered the possibility of forming a government of experts by obtaining an adequate majority, including experts of parties outside parliament? [Horn] We have not thought of this, but essentially I support the idea of having two or three members in the next government who do not belong to any political party. This does not necessarily mean a government of experts; it only means the inclusion of figures that are professionals. One should not distribute the positions by mathematically counting the proportion of victors. I have an open mind on this issue. [Szombathy] Could it happen that you become the Socialists' candidate for prime minister, but someone else becomes prime minister? [Horn] We will not allow any of our partners to blackmail us. If the MSZP gets an absolute majority in parliament, the president will obviously ask us to form a government. I am almost certain that there will be no shortage of coalition partners. Regardless of the expected results, the MSZP thinks in terms of a coalition government. However, this does not mean a condition to which we stick by all means. If we get an absolute majority and there are no parties that, fearing a socialist imbalance, agree to form a coalition, the MSZP will accept governing responsibility alone. This is its duty because this is what it has worked for for four years! We have been struggling for the use of a better policy all the time. We would be deceiving the voters if we made a retreat with an absolute majority in Parliament. But the MSZP is a force that is acting responsibly. [Szombathy] You said that there would be no shortage of partners. Why? What other party can you count on, except the SZDSZ? [Horn] We are open toward every democratic force. At the same time, we do not want to cooperate in the next government with parties that are responsible for the current situation in Hungary, forces that lost the elections, and the current government coalition is such a force. I also said earlier that we are open to a Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] that gets rid of its extremists, although the KDNP is also responsible for the current situation. I continue to say that. As for the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], they should decide whether to continue the very extremist line of recent months or to do what they have done in Parliament very well for the past three years, namely followed a pragmatic policy based on a rational ability to evaluate things. If such debates take place in the Fidesz, we will naturally also be open to them. [Szombathy] Would you accept a minority MSZP government if you fail to find a partner and you fail to obtain a majority? [Horn] I do not think that we should accept forming a minority government, because I am convinced that we will have a partner even if we do not obtain an absolute majority. If the trend of 8 May continues, the MSZP needs very little to achieve very serious results.
