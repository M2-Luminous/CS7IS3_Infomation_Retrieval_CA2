According to local officials, Yunnan exported machinery and electrical products worth 102.75 million U.S. dollars in 1993, up 48.2 percent compared with the previous year. Bordering Myanmar [Burma], Laos and Vietnam, the province has been making efforts to make full use of its geographical advantages over the past few years. In opening up markets for its machinery and electrical products, it has adopted a policy of giving priority to the development of the Southeast Asian market while strengthening traditional markets in Hong Kong, Macao, Europe and the United States. Besides building more special production bases for machinery and electrical products in the province and sending missions to hold fairs of machinery and electrical products in neighboring countries, the relevant local departments have also adopted flexible ways of trading to boost exports of such products, including spot exchange trade, barter trade, buyer's credit and seller's credit, and have achieved marked results. For instance, the province has experienced a rise of 81 percent in its exports of machinery and electrical products to the United States. So far, Yunnan exports more than 70 kinds of machinery and electrical products, as against only a dozen kinds in 1984, since when the quality of its products for export has kept improving. The proportion of products for export with higher technical content and machinery, and instruments and meters with higher added value is increasing rapidly, the officials added.
