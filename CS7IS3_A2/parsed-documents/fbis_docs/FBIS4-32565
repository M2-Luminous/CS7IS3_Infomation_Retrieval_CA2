This therapy has led to a catastrophe in my country. The therapy failed simply because the patient is dying and it must be changed. Repression and genocide against the non-Serb population are part of the program of creating a greater Serbia on the basis of the idea of ethnic cleansing. Unfortunately, 50 years later, Europe is again witnessing the expansion of fascism. We are asking you to lift the embargo so that we can exclusively defend ourselves and ensure a lasting peace. We have not lost the war. The Serbs have tried to destroy our country and us with all available means, but they have not yet succeeded in this. Our people are capable and knowledgeable, and with their bare hands they are still resisting and keeping our main towns and vital industrial zones under their control. We are asking you to lift the embargo to create conditions for peace and for talks through balance in arms. We need arms in order to survive and not in order to win, because our losses and the genocide we suffered prevent us from speaking about victory. For this reason we say it again and again: We are not asking your troops to fight for us on the ground, this is our task, but we are begging you not to use big words that translate into small actions.
