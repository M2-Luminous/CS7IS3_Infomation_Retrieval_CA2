According to the revision, import duties on compact passenger cars will be slashed and the ban on imports from Japan and South Korea will be lifted. Officials said Japan, South Korea, and Hungary have requested specifically that Taiwan open its automobile market. On the other hand, Taiwan will emulate other countries in dealing with the imports of Japanese-made cars; that is, Japan will be required to impose a quota on such exports to Taiwan on its own in order not to disrupt market order on the island.
