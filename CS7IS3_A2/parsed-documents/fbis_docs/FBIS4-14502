FBIS4-14502 "drsov063_g_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 WESTERN REGION Belarus Presidential Election Previewed Presidential Election Previewed LD3103202294 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1447 GMT 31 Mar 94 LD3103202294 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky] [Text] Parliament speaker Mechyslaw Hryb has told INTERFAX that before 15 April everything will be prepared for nominating candidates for presidential elections in Belarus. He said for that day it is planned to approve the schedule of the procedures associated with the presidential campaign, to prepare the lists for collecting signatures of people's deputies and citizens in support of different candidates for presidency. On 15 March it is expected to approve a list of expenditures for the elections. Referring to so far unconfirmed information, Hryb said that the presidential campaign would cost approximately 160 Bn Belarusian rubles. He said that everything associated with the elections will pass smoothly and openly, without any deviations. Hryb said about the intention to invite CIS and foreign observers to monitor the campaign. When the president is elected, the state power in the Republic will be stronger and the crisis of power will end, said Hryb. He believes a clear structure of subordination laid in the system of the presidential rule will allow to rule the state efficiently through the presidential representatives in provinces. IF Note: According to the parliament decision adopted on 30 March, the elections of the first ever Belarusian president will take place on 23 June. The head of the temporary parliamentary commission for combating corruption Aleksandr Lukashenko officially said about his intention to stand for presidency. The spokesman for the Republic's prime minister Vladimir Zametalin has said that Vyacheslav Kebich is expected to make an official statement about his intention to run for presidency. The organization of Belarusian Social Democrats and the United Democratic party decided to nominate for presidency the ex-speaker of the Belrusian parliament Stanislav Shushkevich. The opposition Belarusian People's Front nominates its leader Zenon Poznyak. The Party of the People's Accord will nominate its chairman Gennadiy Karpenko, while the party Belarusian Scientific Industrial Congress -- Federal Director of the the Gorizont association producing TV-sets -- Aleksandr Sanchukovskiy. Still undecided are the parliament speaker Mechyslaw Hryb and the CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya. Minsk observers name among the main candidates for presidency Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, who consistently pursues the policy oriented for the economic integration with Russia. Staking on the popular idea of a closer union with Russia, Kebich, observers believe, has a big advantage over the bloc of "national patriots" led by Zenon Poznyak who orients on opposite ideas. Aleksandr Lukashenko, who recently accused of dealing with mafiosi two vice-premiers, three ministers and some other government officials, and also Kebich of patronizing the corrupted officials, is also popular among the people for his struggle with corruption. With the aim to discredit before the elections his main opponent Vyacheslav Kebich, Lukashenko expects to win a victory despite the fact that he does not have the structural organizations in provinces which could help him during the election campaign. Observers believe that if the court where the accused want to file a suit against Lukashenko, manages to pass a verdict against him and prove the innocence of the vice-premiers and ministers before the elections, his chances will be slim. An aspect of the presidential campaign, namely: whether a person who is prosecuted by court, may be candidate for presidency, is the popular talk in the political quarters of Minsk. Lukashenko admits that he has no so far economic program. In an interview with INTERFAX he said that he could be helped by his supporters to draw a program overnight. Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-speaker of the Belarusian Parliament, is also among the contenders. The stake on the two parties which have their structures in provinces, as well as the organization of servicemen, banned in the Republic, will allow Shushkevich to collect the necessary 100,000 signatures to stand for presidency, forecast the observers.
