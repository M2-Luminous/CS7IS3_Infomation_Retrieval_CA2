The Local Authorities Will Not Miss Their Chance in Any Event"] [Text] Here is the first impression from the second session of the Federation Council: compared to the previous one, where Vladimir Shumeyko just barely made it into the speaker's chair, giving out alluring promises on behalf of the president, now everything is moving slowly and sluggishly. It was thought that the upper house would immediately "show its teeth" to the president, the government, and the capital in general. Instead the senate began to spend hours discussing internal rules of procedures. The apparatus officers consider this as evidence of "serious and careful work of true parliamentarians." Nonetheless, they had to approve the decision on Boris Yeltsin's edict on the state of emergency in the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone without actually seeing the document: It was not even circulated. The famous proponents of autonomy, Yakutia President Mikhail Nikolayev and his Bashkir counterpart Murtaza Rakhimov, have not attended the high meeting for two days. Karelian leader Viktor Stepanov did not arrive at all. "We have not as yet bestirred ourselves," Boris Yeltsin's perennial opponent, Aman Tuleyev, admitted. The general mood of the senators themselves was summed up in a remark by Novosibirsk governor Ivan Indink: "When are we finally going to get down to business? I am talking about the economy and the tax system." Irkutsk administration chief Yuriy Nozhikov added "questions of resources and export" to this list. Federation Council members are making no secret that in demanding a meeting with Premier Chernomyrdin, they seek to understand not so much the present situation in the economy as the intentions of the government and how far it is ready to yield to pressure from the provinces. As Omsk Oblast governor Leonid Polezhayev admitted, the deputies' "abilities to protect local interests" would be greatly expanded by the creation of their regional associations. "Territorial factions," however, are in no particular hurry to emerge. So far there is only Eduard Rossel, who told SEGODNYA that 14 senators and 32 Duma members have joined the Urals Deputies Association he is setting up, while the Urals Economic Association has created within its framework a "foundation for sociopolitical studies," allocating it the requisite funds. The foundation, according to Rossel, will be responsible for "coordinating draft laws not only among the deputies but also those Urals enterprises that will be affected by these draft laws." Other regions are in no hurry to unite. Even Irkutsk governor Yuriy Nozhikov and his Khabarovsk colleague Viktor Ishayev, who have actually proclaimed a "financial state of emergency" in their regions and stopped remitting taxes to the federal budget, prefer to meet with Viktor Chernomyrdin separately. According to Mr. Nozhikov, the first watershed in the senate will be between the regional bosses and the few "dispossessed" deputies: "Unlike us, they are not responsible for the regions and therefore will start seeking a stable position in Moscow. This will be the fifth column of the central authority." As for the local authorities, they are apparently bound to divide: the interests of kray and oblast bosses still differ substantially from the wishes of the ethnic autonomy bosses. Only after that will come the time of "territorial factions." It is important that these divisions will not weaken but actually strengthen the senate: It is all the easier to promote one's interests, the more conspicuous they are. The Federation Council leadership has assured that Viktor Chernomyrdin will make a speech today.
