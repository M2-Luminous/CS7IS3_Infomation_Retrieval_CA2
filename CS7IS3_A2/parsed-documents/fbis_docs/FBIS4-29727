Police authorities at Nam Phiang Din village rescued the only survivor and his long-tail boat. The fisherman, identified as Min, was seriously injured and later sent to Sisangwan Hospital. Min told the police that he and three colleagues of the Thai Yai ethnic group were ambushed by an unknown group of armed men at about 2300 on the night of 16 June while fishing in the Pai River inside Burma about 10 km from the Thai border. Min was the only one aboard the long-tailed boat when the ambush took place so he managed to flee the site back to Thailand. He believes that his three colleagues were probably shot dead. Any attempt to retrieve the bodies of the three fishermen will be reported later.
