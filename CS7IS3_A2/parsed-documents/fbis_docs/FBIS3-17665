Colonel-General Pavel Kozlovskiy told INTERFAX in an exclusive interview that he was going to ask the law-enforcement authorities to carry out a proper investigation and, after its results are made public, to bring a defamation of character suit against Aleksandr Lukashenko, head of the Provisional Parliamentary Anticorruption Commission, who accused him of illegal dealings. Kozlovskiy said some of the executives in Defense Ministry companies had indeed committed offenses, but that all of them had been "punished." He said Lukashenko's accusations were groundless because, "following the logic of Lukashenko, formerly manager of a state farm and nowadays chairman of the Commission for Fighting Corruption, he himself could have been dismissed from his rural managerial post immediately after an anonymous report came in that a pailful of formula feed had been stolen from one of his pigsties." "The defense minister cannot be responsible for the behavior of each soldier and officer of the Belarussian army, which is nearly 100,000 strong, any more than a factory manager can bear personal responsibility for the personal integrity of each of his workers, of whom there may be many thousands," Kozlovskiy said, describing Lukashenko's accusations as "an attempt to draw the army into political intrigues and destabilize the situation in the Republic during the presidential election campaign." Asked whether the Defense Ministry needed to have its own businesses, Kozlovskiy said the funds the Armed Forces were receiving from the state were "clearly insufficient." "In order to keep the army from being ruined and strangled financially we are forced to use, for example, the potential of transport aircraft for the commercial transportation of cargo," he said. Meanwhile, the prime minister's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin told INTERFAX another five members of government accused by Lukashenko of various offenses were going to bring defamation of character suits. They are Deputy Premiers Nikolay Kostikov and Stanislav Bril, Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Vladimir Radkevich, and National Bank Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich.
