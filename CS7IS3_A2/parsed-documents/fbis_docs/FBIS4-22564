Some Results of the Republic's Economic Performance in January and Possible Consequences" [Text] First of all, the overall results in the first month indicate that the economic decline is becoming even more threatening. Compared to January of last year the national income declined by 31 percent, industrial output declined by almost 20 percent, and production stood at only 43.8 percent of the January 1991 level. The State Committee for Statistics reported that in January practically no work was done by the Mogilev Elevator Plant, the Minsk Bearing Plant, the Vitebsk Kirov Machine Building Plant, the Kobrin Instrument Plant, the Minsk Computer Equipment Association, the Grodno Azot Association, and many other enterprises. High prices on goods resulted in difficulties with sales, and overstocking. Rising prices resulted from increased costs of production, in particular the higher cost of fuel and energy. The State Committee for Statistics reported data on the rising earnings and costs of production of the goods sold in the past year. These figures are as follows: while overall earnings for the year rose by 11 times (also, incidentally, primarily because of the price factor), costs rose by 13 times. This reflects a drop in profitability and labor effectiveness. Despite greater efforts than before, we are getting less output. The remedy is clear--either reduce costs or convert to the production of more profitable goods or, better yet, do both simultaneously. Our state, however, with its social form of property ownership and consequently vague forms of responsibility, is hardly capable of either. A typical example: despite the extreme energy-intensiveness and sky-high costs of energy, energy consumption relative to the national income last year dropped only slightly--compared to 1992, the national income and energy consumption stood at 90 and 89.1 percent, respectively. Let's look again at January's indicators. A total of 30.6 percent fewer consumer goods were produced than in January of last year. Trade turnover (in comparable prices) stood at only 49 percent (consumer demand dropped by more than half!). The State Committee for Statistics explains it this way: the drop in sales of goods in the domestic market resulted from the decline in their production, rising prices, and a drop in the population's real income. Obviously, however, the latter two factors taken together were by far the most important. In recent months, prices have risen much faster than income. In December, prices rose at twice the rate, and in January by almost four times. Specifically, people's money income in January rose by 11 percent while prices rose by 40.7 percent. What can we expect next? Obviously, the economic situation--and with it people's standard of living--will get worse. In February we have witnessed the government's attempts to halt rising prices and, consequently, inflation (recall the well known decision about bakery operations). Nevertheless, we can expect an even higher price rise in the next few months. This will result, in particular, from the recent credit infusion of more than a trillion into the agrocomplex and the government's plans to throw an additional trillion into it (note, incidentally, the proposed approach to the distribution of the additional trillion--it is to be proportional to the area of agricultural lands which the farms have...). Already, as a result, credits to the agrocomplex alone will almost equal all the credits to the whole national economy for all of last year (the remainder of the loans as of 1 January came to 2.3 trillion rubles). Meanwhile, the situation has become much worse with circulating capital in trade and industrial enterprises, which, as we know, are also in need of credit.... The credit mass is turning into an avalanche, there is more and more money and fewer and fewer goods and commodities. According to some economists, inflation may reach as high as 80 percent in next few months. This is very likely. Hence, we are still going to be paying very high prices for today's "cheap" bread.
