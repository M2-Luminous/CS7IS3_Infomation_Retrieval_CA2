In an editorial entitled "The Truth Will Prevail," AL-'IRAQ today says this terrible scheme was assigned to agents of the foreigner after they abandoned all nationalistic feelings and mortgaged their will to serve the enemies of Iraq and its unity and stability. The paper adds: Observers are raising big questions about the objectives behind the various recent security breaches in Kurdistan and the role of the foreign hands that move the agents to sabotage security and stability and push the region to a phase of escalating fighting that will substantially harm the basic interests of the Iraqi Kurds. The paper expects eliminations and countereliminations among the so-called parties to grow into a more serious phase that will threaten the lives of citizens in Kurdistan. The destructive consequences of this phase, the paper says, may affect the entire situation there. The paper notes the suffering of the citizens of Iraqi Kurdistan as a result of the fighting among the agents which is reaching villages, towns, and districts in Irbil and al-Sulaymaniyah. The paper notes a sharp and clear contrast between the state of tranquillity, stability, and security that prevailed in Kurdistan under the 17-30 July Revolution and the free, dignified life it had under the canopy of the homeland on the one hand, and the current dark and tragic state after the agent cliques took control, on the other. The paper concludes its article by saying that this fact exposes the allegations and phony slogans that were raised to serve as pretexts.
