Reacting to a statement made by Mr. Nkumbula at a National Party press conference that government is hindering freedom of the press, Information Deputy Minister Mr. Eric Silomba said the allegations were false. He wondered why Mr. Nkumbula could say this when he was covered adequately by the press during the National Party convention in Mongu. Mr. Silomba said it is not the government's intention to block any political party from publicity. Mr. Nkumbula claimed today that a free press will never exist in Zambia as long as media heads are appointed by the party in power.
