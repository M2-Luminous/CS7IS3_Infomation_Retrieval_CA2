FR940405-1-00046 FR940405-1-00013 Asano et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;18] demonstrated the acute physiologic changes which occur as a result of exposure to ETS. Nonsmokers had more pronounced changes in eye blinking rates (a measure of eye irritation), expired carbon monoxide, increased heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Studies of ETS and chronic health effects in adults differ by how they define ``never smokers'', ``exsmokers'', and how other various levels of ETS exposure are defined, either in nominal, ordinal or interval scales; and whether or not they take into account exposure both in the workplace and at home. The potential for misclassification bias occurs when ``nonsmokers'' are loosely defined and used as the comparative group to passive smokers. Several studies considered the confounding impact of environmental air pollution [Ex. 4&hyph;278], indoor cooking fuels [Exs. 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;62] or occupational exposures to dusts and fumes [Exs. 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;178, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210, 4&hyph;321]. There have been fewer longitudinal studies [Exs. 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;278, 4&hyph;295] as compared to the majority which have been cross-sectional studies. The duration of exposure, which is critical to producing a measurable health effect, was quantified by number of years directly in several studies [Exs. 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;173, 4&hyph;295, 4&hyph;321], or indirectly by the age of the population under study [Exs. 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210]. In those studies which had carefully assessed for level of exposure and had specified a duration of at least 10 years, significant pulmonary function decrements were noted in both men and women [Exs. 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;148, 4 176, 4&hyph;321]. Overall, changes in pulmonary indices are more likely to occur in men than in women, however, several studies have documented statistically significant physiological changes in pulmonary function occurring in women [Exs. 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;178, 4&hyph;321]. Understanding the significance of findings is complicated because studies used a variety of measures from spirometry. Although most studies evaluated FVC (forced vital capacity) and FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in one second), fewer studies have measured FEF 25&hyph;75 or FEF 75&hyph;85 [Exs. 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;180, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210, 4&hyph;321]. These later measures have been suggested as being more sensitive to detecting changes in the small airways where effects of ETS are most likely to occur [Exs. 4&hyph;46, 4&hyph;216, 4&hyph;230, 4&hyph;231]. However, there is no clear consensus in the medical literature as to the routine clinical use of FEF 25&hyph;75 or FEF 75&hyph;85, or their diagnostic value in independently detecting small airway disease [Ex. 4&hyph;8]. Estimates of the decrement in FEV 1 due to ETS exposure in passive smokers as compared to never smokers, ranges from 80 milliliters (ml) [Ex. 4&hyph;148] to 190 ml [Ex. 4&hyph;37]. When this decrement is expressed as a percent of FEV 1 , it has been estimated to be 5.7% in males, or 7.3% when these same subjects were matched for age [Ex. 4&hyph;210]. As a means of comparison, the average loss in lung volume per year due to aging alone is estimated to be 25 to 30 ml [Ex. 4&hyph;329]. The American Thoracic Society [Ex. 4&hyph;8] specifies that spirometry equipment have a level of accuracy within 50 ml. Since pulmonary function maneuvers are very effort dependent, intra-individual variation between the three best efforts should be within 5% to be acceptable. The importance of these spirometry criteria is emphasized by the fact that the FEV 1 may result in being 100 to 200 ml lower than when a maximal effort is given by the subject. Furthermore, a decrease of 15% must be achieved before certain pulmonary indices are considered outside of normal limits. Given this perspective, although changes in pulmonary function tests may truly occur as a result of exposure to ETS over a number of years, the actual clinical impact may not be apparent in the healthy, young individual. Older individuals and those with preexisting pulmonary disease are more susceptible to the pulmonary effects of exposure to ETS. Outside of respiratory changes being documented through pulmonary function testing, other symptoms have been found to be significantly associated with ETS exposure. Hole et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;148] found a significant increase in the prevalence of infected sputum, persistent sputum, dyspnea and hypersecretion in passive smokers as compared to controls. Furthermore, rates increased as those exposed were stratified by level of exposure to passive smoke from low to high. Kauffmann et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;178] noted a significant increased risk for dyspnea in American (Odds Ratio (OR)=1.42) and French women (OR=1.43), and an increased risk for wheeze in American women (OR=1.36). Schwartz and Zeger [Ex. 4&hyph;278] found an increased risk for phlegm or sputum in a 3-year longitudinal study (OR=1.41). This risk was raised to 1.76 when asthmatics, who may be medicated, were excluded from the analysis. As small airway disease progresses to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (also referred to as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD)), the impact of ETS becomes more detectable. Kalandidi et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;173] reported an adjusted odds ratio of 2.5 (90% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.3 to 5.0) for Greek women never smokers exposed to their husbands' tobacco smoke. While there is a clear trend, and in several studies a statistically significant finding of a demonstrated decrease in pulmonary function indices, or an increase in respiratory symptoms in passive smokers, the impairment nonsmokers suffer by the exposure may not be immediately obvious. It is important to note that these findings have been demonstrated in otherwise healthy individuals. Based upon the finding of White and Froeb [Ex. 4&hyph;321], Fielding and Phenow [Ex. 4&hyph;102] have described such changes as being equivalent to those found in light smokers, who smoke from 1 to 10 cigarettes per day. Where a decrease of 100 to 200 ml of FVC or FEV 1 may be clinically insignificant in healthy persons, such a change may be significant for workers with already impaired pulmonary function [Exs. 3&hyph;438D, 3&hyph;440A, 4&hyph;76, 4&hyph;182]. These changes may be the pivotal point at which a worker becomes unable to continue to work. Cellular effects on the pulmonary tissue have also been observed in animals exposed to ETS during experimental studies. Several studies reviewed by OSHA have demonstrated that chronic cigarette smoke exposure produces an accumulation of alveolar macrophages (AM) (the presence of AM indicates a body's response to environmental insults), within the respiratory bronchioles of many animals species. This effect is similar to that seen in human smokers [Exs. 4&hyph;31, 4&hyph;58, 4&hyph;109, 4&hyph;110, 4&hyph;140, 4&hyph;147, 4&hyph;150, 4&hyph;179, 4&hyph;212, 4&hyph;249]. Increased elastase secretion by alveolar macrophages from mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke has also been observed [Ex. 4&hyph;322]. Accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) is also an indication of the body's response to environmental insults. PMNs were found in the alveolar septum of cigarette smoke-exposed hamsters, similar to the PMNs observed in the lungs of human smokers [Ex. 4&hyph;204]. In contrast to the focal nature of the alveolar macrophages accumulation, the accumulation of PMN is diffuse. Studies of PMN leukocyte function have not been systematically evaluated in smoke-exposed animals. Other studies also show effects of ETS exposure at the cellular level. For example, young lambs exposed to ETS for one month did not develop detectable pulmonary system effects or alteration in lung mechanics or airway responsiveness. However, the lambs did develop inflammation of pulmonary cells [Ex. 4&hyph;290]. A cytotoxic effect of tobacco smoke was also demonstrated by decreased intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in guinea pig alveolar macrophages and lowered cell bacteriocidal activity in a study by Firlik [Ex. 4&hyph;104]).
