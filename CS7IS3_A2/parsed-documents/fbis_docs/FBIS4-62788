Speaking before an audience of students and scholars at the Moscow State University on Monday, Gaydar said his Russia's Choice bloc will support Yeltsin. He said the elections will not be easy, but Yeltsin has the best chances of all democratic candidates. Gaydar stressed that lawmakers must join their efforts in order to stop local conflicts and ward off the danger of communist revenge. To this end, the bloc will be reorganised into a party with fixed membership. Draft charter and programme of the new party are already ready. The founding congress will be held in Moscow on June 12-13. Gaydar believes that Russian business people may count on a certain place in the political arena only if they team up with intellectuals. Speaking about privatisation, Gaydar described it as a "task which has no optimum solution, only a more or less acceptable. We have to make not an ideal, but possible decision."
