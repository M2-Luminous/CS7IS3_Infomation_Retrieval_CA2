The congress adopted a namelist of new leaders with Jiang Zemin as the RCSC honorary chairman; discussed outlines of the work programs between 1995 and 1999; and formulated working directives that "China should earnestly implement the Red Cross Society Law and strive to develop Red Cross undertakings with Chinese characteristics." The RCSC marks its 90th founding anniversary in 1994. After holding consultations and restructuring in 1950, the RCSC has done a lot of work as a humanitarian organization providing social aid and relief. The RCSC was New China's first organ to regain its legitimate seat in international organizations. It has extensively launched nongovernmental diplomatic activities in its special capacity and has played an important role in publicizing New China in the international arena. Under the care of the party and government in recent years, China's Red Cross undertakings have vigorously developed. They have achieved remarkable results in making preparations against disasters, providing relief during and after disasters, supplying social services and first aid for the masses, promoting blood donation among citizens, establishing Chinese bone marrow banks, and cultivating young Red Cross members. While launching various campaigns, the RCSC has advocated the spirit of caring for others, feeling good about helping people and self-sacrifice, and has thereby enhanced the socialist spiritual civilization drive. The RCSC has played a special role in linking cross-strait relations. It has actively promoted bilateral and multilateral exchanges with Red Cross societies from various countries and the International Red Cross Organization, and has boosted friendly international exchanges and cooperation. In May 1993, the RCSC successfully hosted the fourth Asia-Pacific regional meeting of the International Red Cross Society and Red Crescent Society in Beijing, which adopted the historically significant "Beijing Declaration." It fully demonstrated the RCSC's important role in the International Red Cross movement. On 31 October 1993, the Eighth National People's Congress Standing Committee formally adopted the "Red Cross Society Law of the People's Republic of China," thereby indicating that China attaches great importance to and supports Red Cross humanitarian undertakings. The law has provided a legal guarantee for the development of Red Cross undertakings in China and for links with the International Red Cross movement. It was a landmark that China's Red Cross undertakings have entered a new historic phase. State Councilor Peng Peiyun spoke at the opening of the national congress. She said: Red Cross undertakings are lofty and great endeavors that benefit mankind. They have bright prospects for development and need active participation and selfless sacrifices from more people. She urged governments at various levels and various social circles should continually support Red Cross undertakings. She expressed the hope that Red Cross societies at various levels and the broad masses of their members would take into account China's reality; learn from useful foreign experiences; do a better job while executing their responsibilities and obligations as stipulated in the Red Cross Society; uphold professional ethics of "humanity and honesty"; and promote a workstyle "stressing unity, performance of concrete tasks, and attainment of development and high efficiency" in an effort to make more contributions to "improving conditions of the most vulnerable groups" and to enhancing social progress. The namelist of the Sixth RCSC leaders adopted at today's meeting follows: Zhao Puchu, Wang Guangying, Li Peiyao, Qian Xinzhong, Cui Yueli, and Chen Minzhang are honorary vice chairmen. Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Vice Chairman Qian Zhengying is chairman. Gu Yingqi is executive vice chairman. Fan Baojun, Yang Chongchun, Lin Yanzhi, Sun Boqiu, and Qu Zhe are vice chairmen. Li Changming is secretary general. George (?Wilberson) [wei bo xiang 7279 0130 0686], the International Federation of Red Cross Society and Red Crescent Society secretary general, sent a congratulatory letter to today's meeting.
