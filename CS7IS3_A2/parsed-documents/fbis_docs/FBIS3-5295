Amid the unprecedented, prolonged economic slump caused by the bubble economy, Japan is being required to review the consumer-oriented economic and social structures which have so far supported our country. This means switching the basic idea of our economic society. Japan is being urged to change the current economic society into one which attaches importance to people and consumers. We have to accelerate significantly our efforts to reform the structure of our economic society in line with the trend of this new era. On the international front, Japan, which is responsible for 16 percent of the world's GNP, is required to fulfill an active role commensurate to its economic power. In other words, Japan needs to make positive efforts to voluntarily tackle the task of building a new world economic order. On the domestic front, Japan needs to promote transparency of its economic society and try to build a society in harmony with the international community. [passage omitted on a people-oriented economic society] Moreover, such an economic society will be realized through changing our society. The path for realizing a people-oriented society may be not easy. [passage omitted on need for the government to tackle this issue] This year we must ensure a smooth and full-fledged recovery of the economy, and mark the first year of successfully changing the economic society. [passage omitted on the world economic situation] Meanwhile, the success of GATT's Uruguay Round talks brings a bright prospect for the future of the world economy. Generally, Japan's economy is in a slump, marked by a continuing slump in personal consumption and a decrease in the private sector's plant and equipment investment. The severity of employment conditions is noted especially in the manufacturing industry. [passage omitted on review of the series of economic pump-priming measures the government introduced in September last year and February this year] Thanks to the effects of the economic measures, the foundation for economic recovery is now being created. However, the real growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 1993 is expected to be about 0.2 percent, without a full-fledged recovery in private demand. While keeping those conditions in mind, we would like to adopt the following basic points to tackle economic management for fiscal 1994. The first point is to put Japan's economy on-track for a full-fledged recovery as soon as possible so that sustainable growth in the years following fiscal 1994 will be ensured. To this end, we will implement maximum policies by the end of fiscal 1994. To continuously stimulate the economy this spring, which starts the new fiscal year, we soon plan to implement the economic pump-priming package. For example, we will make efforts for the smooth implementation of public works projects which were added in the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. [passage omitted reviewing the draft budget for fiscal 1994 and tax cuts] On monetary policy, I think appropriate and flexible management is necessary in the future while closely watching domestic and international economic movements and international currency conditions. [passage omitted on efforts to improve employment conditions and the need for stability of prices] With economic management by the government and positive efforts by the private sector in support of economic activities for voluntary recovery, Japan's economy is expected to be on-track for a full-fledged economic recovery during fiscal 1994. The GDP's real growth rate is expected to reach about 2.4 percent in the fiscal year. The second point is that to bring about a creative and energetic economic society, conditions for future economic development should be created through such measures as steady implementation of structural reform. [passage omitted on need for efforts to create such conditions] Moreover, we plan to help companies in restructuring their business by promoting creative research programs and improving conditions to prepare for a highly developed information-oriented society. We would like to promote development of new business and creative business activities. [passage omitted on efforts to improve working conditions] In connection with the tax system reform, we are expected to create a fair and vital society taking into account the rapid increase of the aged population. We intend to continue our study to create a tax system which gives adequate consideration for the balance among the people's income, consumption, and assets in line with the advisory report of the Tax System Council. In that area, we will try our best to carry out tax system reform within this year. [passage omitted on environment-friendly economy] Third, we intend to shift the focus of economic policies onto consumers. This is to enrich individuals' lifestyle by setting the goal of the Japanese economy in fields directly related to qualitative improvement of the public livelihood. In connection with this the fiscal 1994 budget plan lays emphasis on public work projects for housing, sewerage, and garbage disposal facilities. The government intends to maintain the preferential budget allotment in fields related to the public livelihood. [passage omitted on details of above-mentioned construction, housing programs] The disparity of commodity prices between the Japanese and international markets is one of the major reasons the public cannot actually feel their economic achievements. To ease the problem, we will correct and cut such causes as government regulations and exclusionary business practices. [passage omitted on women's social positions] Regarding the product liability system and other measures for preventing and redressing economic damage to consumers, we would like to enact necessary legislation as soon as possible. In accord with advisory reports of the Social Policy Council, some bills may be submitted to the current Diet session. Fourth, we would like to positively create harmonic foreign economic relations, contribute to revitalization of the world economy, and take the initiative in maintaining and reinforcing the free trade system. To achieve this objective, we should positively promote structural reform of the economy through deregulation so that both Japanese and foreign-national companies and individuals can participate in business activities under visible rules. Functions of the OTO [Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman] have been recently strengthened. OTO activities and review of government procurement procedures will further improve the accessibility of foreign companies to the Japanese market. Also, we will promote imports and direct investments from foreign companies. With Japan's market opening efforts and economic recovery, its trade surplus in fiscal 1994 is expected to become lower than the previous year. The virtual conclusion of the Uruguay Round indicates the strong resolve of GATT member nations to maintain and strengthen the multilateral free trade system. Japan will steadily implement achievements in the GATT negotiations. To ensure stability and steady growth of developing nations, we would like to enrich our economic assistance programs in line with the Official Development Assistance [ODA] guidelines and the fifth ODA mid-term plan. Also, we will offer appropriate intellectual assistance, such as technological assistance to smoothly implement the economic reform efforts of former planned-economy nations. The above is my view of Japan's major economic issues and the favorable direction of economic policies. In the last seven years of the 20th Century, the international economy is expected to grow beyond current boundaries. The world economy is probably heading for a new order of the market economy system through such new trends as the rise of bloc economies and economic reform of former planned- economy nations. In the process, the Asian economy is expected to grow bigger, and Japan will not be able to remain unaffected by the drastic changes in the structure of the world economy. I believe our duty is to overcome such changes appropriately, and realize the bright future of the Japanese economy in the 21st Century. We do have accumulated economic power, highly-educated personnel resources, and a high level of technological and cultural foundations. We are now expected to demonstrate our creativity and ability to make the most of our resources in the new era. Change is a way to utilize the people's efforts for the future. I would like to try to achieve the best based on the people's choice and action. I sincerely hope for their support and cooperation.
