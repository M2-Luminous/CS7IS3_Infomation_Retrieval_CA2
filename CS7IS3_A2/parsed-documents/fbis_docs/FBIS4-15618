"Some would like to force Ukraine out from the uranium market and make an impression things do not go smoothly in this sphere," he said. "In fact, the branch has its problems both in Ukraine, Russia, Estonia and other former Soviet republics, the problems which were inherited from the semi-classified Soviet Ministry of Medium Machine-Building." Rudya stressed the republic is correcting the past mistakes. For instance, it is creating a system of early warning radiation control and much better decontaminates the environment, dumps and tailing dumps in the areas of uranium workings.
