The sources pointed out that the Army discovered the armed cell in a police station covering the Bab El Oued district in the capital. The sources added that the head of the station in Bab El Oued is the amir of an armed group that has carried out several terrorist operations in the area. The Army, some of whose units occupied the police station, has begun an investigation into the clues of the armed groups' infiltration of security units. Information not confirmed by security sources indicates that the armed groups are indeed infiltrating security services and "recruiting" some "security men." Meanwhile, Republican Guard units supported by tanks continue to besiege the Ben Zerga-Bordj El Bahri area, 15 km northeast of the capital. Eyewitnesses told AL-HAYAH that security forces, which included elements from the gendarmerie and the Republican Guard, have destroyed a center used by an "armed group" believed to be linked with the assassination of former Prime Minister Kasdi Merbah. At another level, the "al-Nasr Battalion" belonging to the "Islamic Salvation Army" has denied the contents of the statement issued by the "Armed Islamic Group" about the unification of the Islamic Salvation Front and the Islamic State Movement under its banner.
