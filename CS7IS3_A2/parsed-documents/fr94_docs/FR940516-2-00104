FR940516-2-00104 FR940516-2-00071 As required by the Debit Put Spread Approval Order, the CBOE submitted a report assessing the effectiveness of the pilot program. 10 In addition, as required under the Pilot Extension Order, the CBOE has submitted a report dated as of November 10, 1993, assessing the effectiveness of the pilot program from January 1993 through September 1993. 11 In its 1993 Pilot Report, the CBOE states that no participant has operated in violation of the pilot since its inception. As it concluded in its initial Pilot Report, the CBOE states that the pilot program has provided an efficient means for investors who are limited to cash account transactions to effectively hedge their portfolios against market declines. The CBOE states that it has neither experienced or detected any problems related to the pilot program and, in addition, that no activity of any participant appeared to violate the requirements of the pilot program or other Exchange Rules. The Exchange has found no evidence of market manipulation or other negative impact on market operations arising from the pilot program. 10 See Letter from Mary L. Bender, First Vice President, Division of Regulatory Services, CBOE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division, Commission, dated October 1, 1992 (``Pilot Report''). In the Pilot Report, the CBOE stated that the pilot program has been an efficient means for investors that are limited to cash account transactions to effectively hedge their portfolios against declines in the market. The CBOE represented that it had neither experienced nor detected any problems related to the pilot. Moreover, the Exchange stated that no activity of any pilot participant appeared violative of the program's requirements or other Exchange rules, nor did Exchange studies find evidence of market manipulation or other negative impact on market operations. 11 See Letter from Mary L. Bender, CBOE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division, Commission, dated November 10, 1993 (``1993 Pilot Report''). The Commission finds that the proposal to grant permanent approval to the debit pub spread pilot program is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6. 12 Specifically, the Commission believes, as it has concluded previously, 13 that the pilot program is designed to benefit qualified public customers who are prohibited or restricted in their use of margin accounts by facilitating their purchase of index option debit put spreads. Because the purchaser of a debit put spread uses the call premium to reduce the cost of purchasing the put, index option pub spreads provide investors with an affordable means to hedge their portfolios against adverse market moves. In addition, to the extent that the pilot program has increased index options transactions, the program has benefitted all options investors by contributing to the depth and liquidity of the CBOE's options markets. 12 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 13 See Debit Pub Spread Approval Order, supra note 3. The Commission continues to believe that the economic characteristics of index option debit put spreads permit an exception to the application of Regulation T. In a debit put spread, the long put entitles the spread exemption customer to receive payment when the index reaches the pub option's strike price; because the strike price of the long put must exceed the strike price of the short put, the spread exemption customer's right to receive payment under the long put will offset any obligations he incurs from the sale of the short put. Because the short position must expire with the long position, the offset provided by the long put will last for the duration of the spread exemption customer's obligation as a short put writer. In addition, there is no risk that the short put will be exercised prior to the long put because the exemption applies solely to European-style options, which may be exercised only during a specified period prior to expiration. In its 1993 Pilot Report, the CBOE states that no participant has operated in violation of the pilot since its inception, nor have the CBOE's surveillance procedures revealed evidence of manipulation or abuse of knowledge of impending expiration-related program trades for each expiration Friday during the review period. The 1993 Pilot Report indicates that the pilot program's 39 participants included corporations, pension/retirement plans, non-profit organizations, mutual funds, and individual or family trusts, the majority of which were prohibited by contractual agreements from using margin accounts. The debit put spreads of all of the participants were comprised of Standard & Poor's (``S&P'') 500 Index (``SPX'') options with one to four months remaining until expiration. During the review period the total number of spreads effected on a monthly basis under the pilot program each month ranged from 3,696 to 12,544. On the basis of the 1993 Pilot Report, the Commission believes that the debit put spread pilot program has facilitated that needs of qualified public customers who are limited to cash account transactions by providing them with an effective means to hedge their portfolios against adverse market moves. At the same time, the 1993 Pilot Report indicates that no pilot participant has violated the pilot's parameters, nor has the Exchange discovered any market manipulation or abuse in connection with the pilot program. 14 In addition, the Commission has received no comments regarding the operation of the pilot program, and Board staff has raised no objection to permanent approval of the pilot program. 15 For these reasons, the Commission believes that the debit put spread pilot program has provided qualified public customers with additional means to implement their hedging strategies and, by facilitating index options transactions, has benefitted all options investors by contributing to the depth and liquidity of the CBOE's options markets. 14 The Commission expects the CBOE to notify the Commission promptly of any problems arising in connection with the program. 15 See Board Letter, supra note 9. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 16 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;60) granting permanent approval to the CBOE's debit put spread program is approved. 16 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 17 17 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
