FR941013-2-00138 FR941013-2-00098 Internal Revenue Service Tax on Certain Imported Substances (Dimethyl-2,6-Naphthalene Dicarboxylate); Notice of Determination AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces a determination, under Notice 89&hyph;61, that the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) will be modified to include dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate. EFFECTIVE DATE: This modification is effective April 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary determine whether such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance. This determination is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the determination process. Determination On October 5, 1994, the Secretary determined that dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate should be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3), effective April 1, 1995. The rate of tax prescribed for dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate, under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.97 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for xylene of 0.690, a conversion factor for butadiene of 0.390, and a conversion factor for methane of 0.208. The petitioner is Amoco Corporation, a manufacturer and exporter of this substance. No material comments were received on this petition. The following information is the basis for the determination. HTS number: 2917.39.50 CAS number: 840&hyph;65&hyph;3 Dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate is derived from the taxable chemicals xylene, butadiene, and methane. Dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate is a solid produced predominantly by esterification of naphthalene dicarboxylic acid (2,6&hyph;NDA). 2,6&hyph;NDA is made by air oxidation of dimethyl naphthalene (2,6&hyph;DMN). 2,6&hyph;DMN is prepared via the alkenylation of orthoxylene acid butadiene. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate is: C 8 H 10 (xylene) + C 4 H 6 (butadiene) + 2 CH 4 (methane) + 4 O 2 (oxygen) > > C 14 H 12 O 4 (dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate) + 2 H 2 (hydrogen) + 4 H 20 (water) Dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 60 percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
