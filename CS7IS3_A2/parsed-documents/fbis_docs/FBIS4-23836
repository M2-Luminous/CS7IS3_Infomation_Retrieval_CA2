It however says the government of General Sani Abacha is doing something in that regard through the forthcoming national constitutional conference. The SUN RAY appeals to the Federal Government to resist any temptation that will make it arrest more members of the pro-democracy groups, particularly Nadeco [National Democratic Coalition] leaders, unless it has concrete evidence of criminal activities against them. According to the SUN RAY, mere opposition to government's views about events in Nigeria should not be enough reason.
