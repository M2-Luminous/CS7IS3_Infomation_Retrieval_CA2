The ministry officials said that Economics Minister P. K. Chiang will meet with more than 60 entrepreneurs on June 14 to promote the idea and seek investments in the holding company. The ministry hopes that the holding company can come up with NT [new Taiwan] $10 billion (US$370 million) in its first year. The officials said that although guidelines to reduce the trade deficit with Japan were established more than three years ago, they have had little effect. They said that studies indicate the key to reducing large trade deficits lie in technology transfers. If the key parts and components now imported from Japan can be produced here, the deficit will fall. The ministry is now screening 75 technology-intensive Japanese products which cost more than US$75 million each to import every year. The ministry will then choose ten of the products for domestication. The officials noted that they will take into consideration domestic and foreign market demand, minimum investment and possibility of technology transfer when selecting the 10 products. The holding company will either produce the 10 products by itself or seek cooperation with foreign partners. Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan hit a record high of US$14.42 billion in 1993 and is expected to reach US$15 billion this year.
