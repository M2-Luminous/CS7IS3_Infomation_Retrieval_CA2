Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-16MAR94-JAPAN-U.S. Tokyo Disputes U.S. View of Cellular Phone Accord SUMMARY The Japanese Government appears to be interpreting portions of the 12 March agreement to expand Motorola's access to the Japanese cellular phone market in ways that differ significantly from the reported U.S. reading of the accord. Tokyo's divergent interpretation may reflect an attempt to keep the agreement from serving as a precedent for Tokyo's acceptance of targets for measuring its trade performance in other sectors. END SUMMARY In comments to the Japanese press, a number of Japanese Government officials have taken issue with reported statements by various U.S. officials on the 12 March cellular telephone agreement. These differences with U.S. officials' interpretations focus on language that commits the Japanese Government to ensuring that the Japanese telecommunications company Nippon Idou Tsushin (IDO) carries out its pledges to increase market access for the U.S. firm Motorola. -- According to the 14 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, when the agreement was announced on 12 March, Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Takenori Kanzaki specifically denied that the Japanese Government had accepted any sort of numerical targets. -- The 14 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun also reported that Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) General Affairs Councillor Masahito Tani on 13 March took issue with comments reportedly made by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that the agreement represented a victory for the U.S. Government's results-oriented policy in dealing with U.S.-Japan trade issues. Tani reportedly said that in the Japanese Government's view, IDO's commitment to increase the number of base stations capable of handling Motorola equipment was "neither a numerical target nor an objective criterion. It is nothing but a private corporation's contract." -- According to the 15 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kunihiko Saito attempted to play down a clause in the agreement between the U.S. and Japanese Governments which states that Tokyo will use "all available measures" to ensure that IDO fulfills the agreement. The paper quoted Saito as stating that "All this means is something like conducting regular checks on the degree of progress being made in dealings between the private companies." Saito also reportedly told Kyodo on 14 March that the Japanese Government was in no position to intervene in the affairs of private companies and asserted that any difference in the U.S. and Japanese interpretation of the agreement was because of Washington's misunderstanding of the accord. -- Similarly, Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Futoshi Shirai, in comments to Kyodo on 14 March, took issue with reported remarks by U.S. officials, stating that the Japanese Government had in no way agreed to guarantee that IDO would meet the target of building 159 base stations using Motorola technology as stipulated in the cellular phone agreement. -- An unidentified senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI) official reportedly told Kyodo on 15 March that the Japanese Government had provided no guarantee that IDO would fulfill its commitments. Concern Over Precedent One of the major reasons for the Japanese Government's efforts to limit the way in which the cellular phone agreement is interpreted appears to be a concern that the United States will attempt to use the agreement as a model for setting numerical targets for market opening measures in other sectors. A 15 March Kyodo report quoted an unidentified senior MITI official as stating that Japan could not accept any interpretation of the agreement that would lead to the setting of numerical targets. According to the 15 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, MITI is particularly worried that the United States might try to use the model of the cellular telephone agreement in the auto sector, asking Japanese Government to provide guarantees for voluntary targets for imports of U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts that Japanese automobile companies are reportedly currently drawing up. In a 16 March speech, MITI Vice Minister for International Affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu reportedly specifically stated that the cellular telephone agreement could not be applied to the automobile sector. According to a 16 March Kyodo report, Okamatsu stated that while the telecommunications sector was regulated by government licenses, the auto and auto parts industries were "completely free trade areas" which could not be controlled by the government. The cancellation of a planned visit to Washington by Ichiro Ozawa, Secretary General of one of the key parties in the ruling coalition and the Japanese politician widely reported to have been instrumental in framing the cellular phone accord may also reflect the Japanese Government's desire to limit the impact of the cellular phone agreement. The 16 March Yomiuri Shimbun quoted senior members of Ozawa's party and other Japanese officials as stating that the United States pinned too high hopes on Ozawa, expecting that he would come to Washington with "a bag packed with a lot of gifts." Outlook Japanese officials will probably do everything possible to keep the cellular telephone pact from serving as a precedent for the setting of numerical targets in other sectors. The difference in interpretation with the United States, however, has the potential to create further friction in bilateral relations. In the past, Tokyo has differed with the United States over the wording of such agreements as the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement and the agreement setting up the U.S.-Japan framework talks reached by former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and President Clinton in July, 1993. In the semiconductor agreement, Tokyo has consistently argued that the United States has misinterpreted a pledge that the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market would reach 20 percent by the fourth quarter of 1992 as a formal commitment, when the Japanese government intended it only as a goal. Similarly, in the framework agreement, the Japanese government has consistently disagreed with the United States over how to define the "objective criteria" which the agreement stated would be established to measure Japan's trade performance.
