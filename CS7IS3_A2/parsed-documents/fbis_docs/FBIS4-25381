Xie said this operation is to highlight Sichuan's special characteristics. In talking about seizing the opportunity, we mean to seize the opportunity in this respect: To expand and intensify the opening up process, to launch more cooperative projects, and to strive to score real results in forwarding economic development, he said. As the party committee secretary of the most populous province of China, he told this reporter that Sichuan, as an inland province geographically isolated from the outside world, has made progress and done a good job in expanding contact with the outside world in recent years. The province has established friendly ties with dozens of Chinese and foreign provinces and cities. Now Sichuan is maintaining economic relations and trading with more than 120 countries and areas, and nearly 4,000 foreign-funded enterprises are operating in the province. Two years ago, there were only several hundred foreign-funded enterprises in the province. Since Deng Xiaoping's southern tour, new foreign-funded enterprises have been established in Sichuan at a rate of more than 1,000 per year. The size of projects ranges from small to large, and projects of extra-large size are being launched one after another. An agreement has been signed with Mr. Tsui Tsin-tong to run the joint project of Mianyang-Chengdu expressway. Mr. Li Ka-shing is planning to invest in Sichuan province too, one of his projects being a housing project covering a total area of several million square meters. Secretary Xie Shijie said: Chronologically speaking, Sichuan has made progress. But compared with other provinces in the country, this province is still lagging far behind. In view of this, early this year, eight provincial leaders, bringing dozens of department heads and bureau directors along with them, made fact-finding tours in six developed provinces, namely, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shandong. They drew a conclusion from their tours that Sichuan province lags behind others mainly in two aspects: First, in terms of the extent of emancipation of mind, and second, in intensity of opening up. After repeated and thorough discussion on this question for several months, a consensus has now been reached within the province, from the upper to the lower levels. In order to develop its economy, Sichuan province needs to promote reform and development through opening up, and great opening up will in turn result in great development. Secretary Xie said: Sichuan province's financial resources are so limited as to be called "subsistence finance." So it is unrealistic to expect more funds to be allocated to finance construction projects. Of course we have considered asking for money from the central government in Beijing. Can we do this? Of course we can. But we can ask for money only once or twice, and we cannot keep asking for money again and again. Now we have an opportunity before us. Funds are available abroad, and foreign investors are looking for cooperation partners and investment opportunities. The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary noted: Now lots of investment projects have been launched in every coastal city which offers opportunities for investment, and preferential policies have been applied to wherever preferential policies should be applied to. Sichuan has a potential market with a 100 million population, and in the world today one cannot find another market with a 100 million population which is waiting to be explored. The province's economy is to be developed, the people's living standards are to be improved, and the demand is to increase. So this place with a population of 100 million will become an amazing, vast market! The first in command of Sichuan province said: This year Sichuan province has taken new steps toward this target. Practice over the past few months shows that the results we have scored are quite good. The Chongqing mayor recently returned from an overseas trip with signed contracts involving a total value of $ 1.1 billion, including a value of $400 million that foreign partners have promised to pay in. Deyang city has drawn in a $100 million worth of foreign investments. Dujiangyan city has secured some $40 million worth of investment funds. This provincial party committee secretary, born in the rural areas of eastern Sichuan, received his higher education at an agricultural college, and worked up step by step from the county and prefectural to provincial levels. Until today he still retains the simple and honest character of a Sichuan peasant. He chatted frankly and honestly without talking big. He said: "We have made it very clear that we will assure foreign investors of profits. Just imagine that they are coming a long way to make investments in this remote inland province. No project could possibly be started if it promises no profit." Xie Shijie told this reporter that he and his colleagues had reached this consensus after drawing lessons from their past experience. Some localities invited many people to pay visits. The hosts and guests talked with each other cheerfully at meetings and parties. But no follow-up work was done after the meetings or parties, thus nothing was achieved. One of the main problems is that some of our people have haggled over every ounce. Therefore, the provincial party committee secretary has often warned cadres at all levels to ignore petty and short-term profits but focus on big and long-term interests instead. He said: We must do our best to really draw in foreign funds. After all, from a long-term point of view, it will be beneficial to Sichuan if we can have infrastructure and factory buildings built here. The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary said: We must not apply the same formula to every investment plan, but must adopt tailor-made measures. Anyway, we must make every effort to retain foreign funds in our province. To conclude the interview, Secretary Xie Shijie said to this reporter with an open mind: Sichuan province has started opening up a bit later than others, and we have less experience in this regard. But we have made up our minds to blaze new trails and to do a good job. The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary urged this reporter to pass a message on to readers abroad: Sichuan province is trustworthy, its cadres have liberal minds and will sincerely and wholeheartedly cooperate with friends from abroad. The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary also promised: "We certainly will protect all investors' legitimate interests."
