In a speech in the northeastern Japan port city of Ofunato, Iwate Prefecture, Ozawa said he is "concerned that Japan may be isolated in the international community if it cannot do anything (about the crisis)." "Many say remittances from Japan (to North Korea) are equivalent to North Korea's state budget and that (North Korean) high-tech military machines were made in Japan," said Ozawa, the secretary general of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party].
