The new date is to be coordinated via diplomatic channels, a top-ranking Russian diplomat in charge for Greece reported to Interfax. He does not rule out that the contact between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Karolas Papoulias can take place in Cairo. As it is known, on Tuesday Kozyrev came to Cairo, the Egyptian capital, to participate in signing of the agreement on Gaza Strip and Jericho between Israel and Palestine as a representative of the country-co-sponsor of the peaceful process in the Middle East. "As far as Papoulias is concerned, his presence in Cairo is also obligatory because at present Greece chairs the European Union," said Interfax interlocutor.
