In a statement, the embassy said that it regretted that such baseless and meaningless statements were made in Iran's neighbouring state of Turkey. Peres who is visiting Turkey, in his speech wished the laic government of Turkey would overcome the Islamic revolution of Iran. The embassy statement stressed that world Muslims especially Muslims of Turkey know very well the "terrorist and unreliable" nature of the Zionist regime. Terrorist acts and instability in the Middle East began when imperialism implanted the Qods [Jerusalem] occupying regime in the heart of Muslim states, it said, adding all terrorist-motivated killings originated from the Zionist entity. The Iranian Embassy said that Zionist officials by making such remarks could never mar the solid and brotherly relations between Iran and Turkey.
