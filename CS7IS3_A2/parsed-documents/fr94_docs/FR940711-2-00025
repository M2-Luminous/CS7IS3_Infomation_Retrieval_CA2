AGENCY: Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA). ACTION: Issuing a directive to the Commissioner of Customs establishing export visa requirements for silk apparel. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jennifer Aldrich, International Trade Specialist, Office of Textiles and Apparel, U.S. Department of Commerce, (202) 482&hyph;4212. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Authority: Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854). The Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of China reached agreement, effected by exchange of notes dated June 23, 1994 and June 27, 1994, to establish an export visa arrangement for certain silk apparel products, produced or manufactured in China and exported from China on and after July 15, 1994.

A description of the apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the 1994 U.S. CORRELATION: Silk Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see Federal Register notice 59 FR 15381, published on April 1, 1994). Interested persons are advised to take all necessary steps to ensure that such silk apparel products that are entered into the United States for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, will meet the visa requirements set forth in the letter published below to the Commissioner of Customs. Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements July 5, 1994. Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229. Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854); pursuant to the Silk Visa Arrangement, effected by exchange of notes dated June 23, 1994 and June 27, 1994, between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of China; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on July 15, 1994, entry into the Customs territory of the United States (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of silk apparel products in Categories 733&hyph;736, 738&hyph;748, 750&hyph;752, 758 and 759, produced or manufactured in China and exported from China on and after July 15, 1994 for which the Government of the People's Republic of China has not issued an appropriate export visa fully described below. Should additional categories, merged categories or part categories be added to the bilateral agreement or become subject to import quotas, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included in the coverage of this arrangement on an agreed effective date. Goods exported during the period July 15, 1994 through August 15, 1994 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa. A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking in blue ink will appear on the front of the original export license/commercial invoice or successor document. The license will be printed on a purple guilloche pattern background. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose. Each visa stamp shall include the following information: 1. The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numerical digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for China is ``CN''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying the shipment; e.g., 4CN123456. 2. The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued. 3. The signature of the issuing official. 4. The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation and in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS or successor documents) shall be reported in the spaces provided within the visa stamp (e.g., ``Cat. 340&hyph;510 DOZ''). Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise, the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348''). U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature, category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been crossed out or altered in any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall not be permitted. If the quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and only the amount entered shall be charged to any applicable quota. If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of the People's Republic of China, replacement visa issued by the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Washington, D.C., or a visa waiver may be issued by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements at the request of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Washington, D.C., and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment will be released. The waiver, if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive the quota requirement. The replacement visa shall consist of a Textile Export Visa/Invoice form bearing an official Chinese Embassy embossed stamp on the front and include the standard information required on an export visa and the signature of an official authorized by the Government of the People's Republic of China to issue replacement visas. The signature must match one of two original signatures of authorized officials provided to the Government of the United States by the Government of the People's Republic of China. U.S. Customs shall not permit entry of the shipment if any of the information required on the replacement visa is missing, incorrect or illegible, or has been crossed out or altered in any way. If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct category limit. If a shipment from the People's Republic of China has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United States with either an incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall charge the shipment to the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided. The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document. Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry. The visa stamp remains unchanged. The actions taken concerning the Government of the People's Republic of China with respect to imports of textiles and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, these directions to the Commissioner of Customs, which are necessary for the implementation of such actions, fall within the foreign affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). This letter will be published in the Federal Register . Sincerely, Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements.
