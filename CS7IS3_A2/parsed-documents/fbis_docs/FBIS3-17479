The Russian military on Thursday handed over the list of officers, junior officers and servicemen stationed in Paldiski. The list is the basis for giving them temporary permits to stay in the town. The registration of Russian military vehicles also started on Thursday. On Tuesday, registration of local inhabitants started with the aim of determining the composition and number of inhabitants in the town largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and the Russian military. As of Wednesday night, around 1,600 people had filled in the registration lists. The registration closes on Saturday. On answering the question on dismantling the training nuclear reactors in Paldiski, Tikk declined some reports that the process was to start around April 5-7, at the time of another round of Estonian-Russian negotiations. He said, however, that the dismantling would begin in April, but the date had not been fixed.
