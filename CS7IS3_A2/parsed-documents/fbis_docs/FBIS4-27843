The ministry plans to include the deregulatory steps in Japan's second market-opening package to be launched in late June in line with strong international demands, especially from the United States, to allow the hedging tools commonly used overseas, said the officials, who requested anonymity. Japan promised in a first package adopted in March to offer detailed deregulatory measures on financial services in June. The hedging tool on interest rates, called a forward rate agreement (FRA), involves a contract agreed upon by negotiation between two parties -- either between banks or between banks and customers -- on the interest rate to be paid at future settlement. With the principal amount agreed on but never exchanged, FRA contracts are settled in cash, with risk limited to the gap between the contracted and actual rates at settlement. The same dealings used for currency rates are called forward exchange agreements. Unlike futures contracts traded on exchanges, the forward agreements are made under negotiations by two parties, and the Ministry of Justice has strongly opposed the dealing's gambling nature. But citing the FRA's increasing role in the U.S. and Europe to hedge interest rate fluctuations, the Finance Ministry decided to lift the ban with certain limits in a bid to secure Japan's position in the international financial market, the officials said. Banking industry officials said the industry has not yet received any notice from the ministry, but noted that the negotiated transactions will allow banks to meet needs by individual customers through free setting of contract amounts and starting and settlement dates. In this sense, they said, futures contracts are fixed, with yen- based interest rates, for example, traded on the Tokyo international financial futures exchange under three-month and one-year contracts on euroyen deposit rates. FRA also helps banks maintain the capital adequacy ratio required by the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements because dealings are made off the book without changing their assets and liabilities.
