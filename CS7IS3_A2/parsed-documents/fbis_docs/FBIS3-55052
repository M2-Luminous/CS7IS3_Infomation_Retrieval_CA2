The press-service said the problem had to be addressed anew because the procedure of the preliminary signing of the agreement was interpreted incorrectly by some officials. The parliament empowered its head, Stanislav Shushkevich "to sign the agreement on collective security after making a statement on certain reservations," it said. These reservations "rule out in particular the use of Belarusian Armed Forces on the territory of other countries, and the stationing and use of Armed Forces of other states on the Belarusian territory without the express permission of the Belarusian Parliament," the press-service said.
