Hryhoryev, SILSKI VISTI correspondent, Rivne Oblast: "An Urgent Signal: Stop the Seed Drills!"] [Text] V. Matviyenko, head of the Sarny Administration of Agriculture and Food returned to the rayon center in a bad mood: "There is little good news. I visited Tynne, Hnymovychi, and Stepan. You cannot approach the machine operators. They sowed a few hectares of corn each and stopped their machines: there is no more seed. A shortage of seed is holding up sowing in most of the oblast's collective agricultural enterprises. The seed, which the farms obtained on their own by bartering it for sugar, timber, meat, and other products, has all been sown, and the promised new supplies have still not arrived. In accordance with a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers, the oblast was to have received 2,012 metric tons of corn seed before the sowing season began. The farmers are trying to make arrangements with seed suppliers in Vinnytsya, Kherson, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. These, however, are refusing to be persuaded and are demanding payment in advance. But the grain procurement enterprises have no money, and the loans have gotten lost at the banks.
