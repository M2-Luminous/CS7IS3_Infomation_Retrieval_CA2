It will issue long-term credits for the construction of objects of civic and industrial significance. The main application of the mortgage is supposed to be in housing construction. Market relations are bringing back long-forgotten concepts and phenomena to the housing sphere. The mortgage--or the issuance of credit secured by real estate--is one of them. Although a mortgage law has not been passed yet, a legal basis has been established for introduction of the mortgage in the form of laws on security and privatization of housing. An effective way of resolving the housing problem that is used in the whole civilized world will appear among the residents of Tatarstan immediately after it shows up among Muscovites and St. Petersburgers. The founders of the mortgage bank are the Tatsotsbank, the housing investment building corporation Housing Initiative, and the Kazzhilgrazhdanstroy Association. According to specialists of the corporation, any potential investor, after drawing up a mortgage for his old apartment or other real estate, can acquire credit for the construction of new housing with the best consumer qualities. Credit will be issued to the extent of 70 percent of the cost of the mortgage. Although the system of mortgage credit assumes it will be long-term, under conditions of high inflation such possibilities are limited. Therefore at first, until the ruble is stabilized, mortgage credit will be issued for a year and a half or two years. Nevertheless, this will make it possible for a family with even an average level of income to finance the building of new housing. It is assumed that the Housing Initiative Corporation will take on all the work in drawing up the documents for the planning and construction of the new housing and the sale of the old at market prices. Its aim is to create a closed building cycle, performing the role of a general investor. The issuance of credits under mortgage on real estate is the main but not the only type of activity of the mortgage bank. It will also engage in the issuance of securities--housing certificates. This system is a form of shared participation of citizens in housing construction. Of course, given the existing high prices, a majority of the people do not have the necessary sums to purchase an apartment. Housing certificates, which record the right of purchasers to an appropriate share of housing being built, will make it possible to buy apartments in parts--in installments. However, it may turn out that many people will not be able to acquire a certificate even for a square meter of housing. This is taken into account, and the minimum share for which a security can be bought has been established on the scale of 0.1 square meters. When a family is able to accumulate a sufficient number of certificates for a whole apartment, a certificate of ownership will be drawn up for the family. Moreover, the purchaser of certificates knows beforehand the address of the home being built. If it is impossible to purchase a packet of certificates for the period of its construction, the right to continue to accumulate them is automatically carried over to the next home being built. It is not only well-to-do citizens who will be able to solve the housing question with the help of the system of housing certificates, but also people of modest incomes and those who are unable to get credit because of a lack of real estate. Sites under new housing construction will be offered to the general investor. Appropriate structures under the head of administration of Kazan have prepared proposals for the allotment of sites to the Housing Initiative Corporation. The bank will set itself up in one a reconstructed building, which was presented in the form of its share of investment to the authorized capital of the bank by Kazzhilgrazhdanstroy--one of its founders. It is assumed that the opening of the mortgage bank will occur in the near future, after all the documents are coordinated and approved in Moscow.
