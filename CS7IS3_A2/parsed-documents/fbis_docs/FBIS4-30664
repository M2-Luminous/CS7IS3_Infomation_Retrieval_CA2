FBIS4-30664 "dreas125_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 Thailand Doctor To Continue AIDS Vaccine Tests Doctor To Continue AIDS Vaccine Tests BK2806090494 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 28 Jun 94 p 2 BK2806090494 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] The Thai Red Cross Society's AID Programme Director denied yesterday he had violated the National HIV/AID, Vaccine Development Plan and planned to continue with vaccine trials on Thai volunteers. Dr Praphan Phanuphak said he would give the volunteers a second dose of the vaccine on July 7. The first dose was administered to 3 volunteers in the country's first ever vaccine trial on June 6. Dr Praphan said the blood from a third of the volunteers was sent to Chulalongkon University's Medical Department for testing, a third to United Biomedical Incorporation of the United States -- the vaccine producer -- for testing, and a third was being stored at an independent laboratory ready for dispatch to research places which request it. "I was one of the members who drafted the National HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development Plan. Why should I violate the plan?" he asked. There were reports last week Dr Praphan had violated the plan by not setting up a laboratory as part of the programme to test the volunteers. The doctor said reports of HIV infection among seven volunteers undergoing a similar programme in the United States should serve as a warning to Thai volunteers that no vaccine has yet been able to prevent the infection of the disease. Of the 30 volunteers here, 24 have been given the actual vaccine while the other six have received a placebo in the form of glucose and water. Dr Praphan said he had explained the vaccine to the volunteers and had warned them to be careful. The World Health Organization's Global Programme on AIDS Research and Intervention Development director Peter Piot, said WHO was very disappointed with the decision by the United States not to assess whether vaccines tested at the first and second phase were effective or not. "There is an urgent need in the world to have a vaccine and we will continue the trial programmes throughout the world, including those being conducted in Thailand, Brazil and Uganda." Dr Praphan said the decision by the US to postpone the third phase of the vaccine trials would not affect his own tests. He said the programme required about $20 million in financial support from the Government so the US had decided to observe the results of vaccine trials in other countries before going ahead with its third phase.
