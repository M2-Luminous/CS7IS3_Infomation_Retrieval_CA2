According to a report, the U.S. Senate on 25 January passed the bill for starting the so-called Radio Free Asia broadcast with Asia as its target. According to a report by Voice of America, this radio station will begin broadcast by placing the focus on our country, China, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar [Burma], and Cambodia. The U.S. plan is to instill the sense of value on U.S.-style democracy and poisonous bourgeois ideological elements in socialist countries and independent nations in Asia in a bid to totally crush socialism and to destroy independent governments in this area, thus pursuing insidious purpose. Therefore, the U.S. Senate's passage of the bill for starting the Radio Free Asia is brazen-faced interference in domestic affairs of the Asian countries and an intolerable crime. This is why many nations in Asia raised voices of protest and denunciation against such maneuvers by the United States. In a weekly briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that the genuine purpose of passing the bill in the U.S. Senate for starting Radio Free Asia is to interfere in the domestic affairs of Asian countries and to create confusion by means of mass media. Besides, the Vietnamese newspaper, THE PEOPLE, denounced and rejected the U.S. Senate's resolution as brazen-faced interference in the domestic affairs of the Asian countries, and a Lao Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the U.S. decision to set up a Radio Free Asia broadcasting station goes counter to cooperation, peace and development in Asia, and that the Radio Free Europe had been used as a tool for opposing the former Soviet Union and socialist countries in East Europe. It is quite natural, therefore, that the Asian countries show strong resistance to the United States' movement to start Radio Free Asia. There are plenty reasons that many Asian countries, including China, Vietnam, and Laos, expressed their strong opposition to the U.S. Senate's step. Radio Free Asia is another version of the former Voice of Freedom and Radio Free Europe broadcasts. As has been widely known, the Voice of Freedom and Radio Free Europe were put into operation when the imperialists, frightened by expanded and strengthened socialist forces on a worldwide scale, declared the Cold War policy and ran amok with antisocialist maneuvers. As for Radio Free Europe, it was inaugurated in the United States, and served as a bugler for frustrating the people's faith in socialism and for destroying socialist countries from within under the financial support of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The Voice of Freedom and Radio Free Europe broadcasts, which were operating in Munich, Germany, disseminated various slanderous and smear rumors in an attempt to create discord and social confusion in the former Soviet Union and socialist countries in East Europe, and persistently infiltrated bourgeois ideology and culture into these countries. In this way, the United States is also maneuvering to destroy socialist countries and independent nations in Asia ideologically, culturally, and mentally. The United States regards our country as its important target. If those who are going to begin the broadcast of Radio Free Asia think that they can do something against our people with false, deceitful, and slanderous propaganda, it is indeed a foolish miscalculation. They should precisely realize this. We have the chuche idea--the great guiding ideology--and our own-style unique way of life. The broadcast of Radio Free Asia may send disorderly electric waves out into space, but it can never make our people's spiritual world turbid. This is also applied to other countries in Asia. There is an Asian-style tradition which has been solidified through a long history and a sense of Asian-style culture in Asia. The spirit of independence that the masters of Asia are the Asian people has been further enhanced among the people in many Asian countries and based on this spirit, the people are dealing with the infiltration of reactionary ideas and culture from outside with heightened vigilance. The United States is scheming to destroy the Asian-style tradition and spoil the sense of culture with yellow propaganda. But its attempt will never be successful. Our people and all Asians will resolutely smash all maneuvers to block the fierce trend of time toward socialism and independence. The United States should immediately discard its maneuvers to begin broadcasting Radio Free Asia.
