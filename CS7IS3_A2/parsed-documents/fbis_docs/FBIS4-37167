It will continue in the second plan. We are carrying out the task gradually within the framework of the Constitution. That is, anything that the Constitution permits to be transferred to the private sector, will be privatized. The stock exchange has become more active recently, in recent months. The stock exchange will open branches in various cities and towns. The system was computerized to speed up the work. About foreign investment...

If today someone finds time to go around Iran, he will see for himself that in each corner of Iran an industrial township has been created and a large number of new industries are engaged in activities -- either they are being built or they have become operational. The readjustment policy allowed us to reach this stage. Otherwise -- we had a sum of oil money and used it to import goods and sell them cheap to people -- the old situation would have been repeated and nothing would have happened. [Indian correspondent (?Sukimra)]... Page 47, column two, paragraph two, from the end of the last sentence make read: ...reached so far. [RESALAT correspondent 'Abbas Tavangar] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. Is the government planning to curtail economic growth so as to provide a greater degree of support for the deprived, the oppressed, and the salary earners in line with the growing inflation rate? [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] There is no need to curtail economic growth, for we have performed some tasks in the first five-year plan which have paved the grounds for giving greater support to the deprived and the oppressed. First, more attention is paid to the deprived and war-stricken areas, which absorbed a large chunk of the first plan's budget. Second, we are currently preparing some programs to provide social welfare and national health insurance for the entire country. The government is currently debating these programs and you will be made aware of these programs when they are presented to the Majles. These programs plan to provide welfare and national insurance to everyone whose income is below a certain rational level, or to the unemployed. We hope to be able to solve this problem completely by the end of the second plan, without having to curtain economic growth. [RESALAT correspondent] If... Page 48, column two, paragraph two, from the end of the last sentence make read: ...the court verdict. [Correspondent Sa'id Hashemi] Mr. President. Please explain the latest decisions of the Council of the Economy on prices of services and goods. Will we have more price rises? And when will the price rises come into effect? [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We have typically approved all that was necessary concerning services and goods. We have apparently nothing remaining for the future. As far as I see the directives of the Council of the Economy every month, there is nothing in it for the future. Whatever that was there before has been carried out. [Correspondent Sa'id Hashemi] This question was...

[Unidentified person in hall reminds Rafsanjani to answer AFP correspondent's second question] [Hashemi-Rafsanjani continues] The visit by... Page 52, column one, paragraph two, from end of last sentence make read: ...The Islamic instructions. That means if we apply Islamic ideas to work, to extravagance, to justice, to obtaining the rights of the weak from the strong. If we could do all that, in our view, many problems that exist in many other places would not exist in such an atmosphere; or problems which the west is facing now because of moral issues, because of its promiscuity. We know what sort of problems families without breadwinners, orphaned children, widowed women and others have there. Such things would not exist in an Islamic atmosphere. And many other things. The philosophy cannot be applied partially and prejudicially. It is a combination and it should be applied as a whole. [SALAM correspondent Nuri-Shemirani]... Page 52, column one, paragraph four, from end of last sentence make read: ...and so on. We determine the price of some general goods through the guilds. The [Consumer] Protection Organization gets together with the unions and considering an appropriate profit for wholesalers, producers, and small businesses, they decide on three sets of prices that must be implemented. They ensure a fair profit and the customer can see and choose. This has nothing against trade and throughout the world, in countries which are more advanced in freedom of trade, such a method is used. We believe that... Page 53, column one, paragraph three, from end of last sentence make read: ...and income supplements. I believe that that they [those receiving benefits] have a good answer to your question. If you compare that, for instance, what they received five years ago under the sickness benefit coverage and what they get today then the answer to the question can be extracted. [Fazel] Many thanks. My second question is about issuing coupons for laborers. Could you tell us whether such payments are given in the Second Plan as well, or not? [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] During the First Plan we owed the laborers and the government had an undertaking dating back to the previous government which had not been paid out. And other undertakings were added to that in the First Plan. Some of that debt is still outstanding. We have said that the debt should be considered in the budget every year. I think that several years still remain for [complete payment of] that debt and it will be paid gradually, at the same level that we are paying this year. [Fazel] I have... Page 53, column one, paragraph eight, from end of last sentence make read: ...statement on that? The Egyptian government, Mr. Husni Mubarak's government believes that Iran is responsible for Islamic unrest in that country. Could you express your view on those allegations. Second question: What... Page 54, column one, paragraph five, from end of last sentence make read: ...would be convicted. [Qotbi] My final question is about some apparent violations that have taken place regarding imports during 1370-1371 -- whether through the Free Trade Zones or the normal channels. For example some agreements which were granted in principle to some firms or individuals for founding vehicle production plants. They were such that a ceiling of up to 2,000 vehicles could be imported. I would like to ask in particular [about the fact] that more than that figure have been imported -- I mean one of those firms imported between 10,000 to 15,000 vehicles. Will such violations be confronted and how? [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] If they have acted in violation they will definitely be confronted. We have no intention of letting any violation pass. Whenever we come to one or someone makes a claim we get it investigated. We refer it to the relevant courts. The system will really not make any concessions to anyone who seeks to commit violations...
