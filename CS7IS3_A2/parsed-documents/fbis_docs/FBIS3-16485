As the Ukrainian statement says, the hospital's personnel took an oath of allegiance to Ukraine and appealed to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and Navy command to enroll them as the Ukrainian Navy servicemen. Since then, the hospital has been strictly guarded, as when a similar situation evolved once in Nikolayev. The Black Sea Fleet command attempted to take away medical equipment and drugs from the local naval hospital, the statement explains.
