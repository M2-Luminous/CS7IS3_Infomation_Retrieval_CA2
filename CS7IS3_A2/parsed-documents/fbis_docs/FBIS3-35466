Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah charged late Wednesday that factions which he declined to name were "executing a pledge made by the Lebanese government to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher." Earlier this month, Christopher urged Lebanon and Syria to calm down the situation in south Lebanon after a Katyusha rocket attack on northern Israel, which was later claimed by Palestinian hardliners. Hizballah guerrillas on 7 February killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded five in the bloodiest attack since August. Christopher said the violence could undermine Arab-Israeli peace talks, while Israel warned of a massive operation in south Lebanon following the rocketing and blamed Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon. "Resistance operations will continue (because) Hizballah's strategy is not part of any political consideration," Nasrallah said on al-Manar television, a channel owned by Hizballah. Hizballah spearheads anti-Israeli attacks by Lebanese and Palestinian factions in south Lebanon, where Israel occupies a border strip. It opposes the peace talks and rejects any normalization of ties with the Jewish state. The Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim fundamentalist group "is ready to confront the situation" if Syria and Lebanon sign a peace accord with Israel, Nasrallah said. "We are not only a military movement. We have popular roots everywhere. No one will be able to uproot us, no matter what happens," the Hizballah chief added. Nasrallah also stressed that Hizballah, which has eight MP's, was "trying to topple the government through peaceful means." Its opposition dates back to September when soldiers opened fire on an illegal protest against the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord, killing nine Hizballah supporters. The United States has repeatedly called on Lebanon to disarm Hizballah, the only militia allowed to keep its weapons since the end of the country's 15-year war in 1990.
