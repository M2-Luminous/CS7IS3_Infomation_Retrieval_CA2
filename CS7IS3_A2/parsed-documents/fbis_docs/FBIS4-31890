Commentators stress the high voter turnout, and applaud the decisive majority of "yes" votes, saying that Austria's EU membership will make Hungary a direct EU neighbor. MAGYAR HIRLAP says, "the Austrians saw it as important to vote...., and we can draw comfort from our neighbor's EU membership." MAGYAR NEMZET also emphasizes the two-thirds support declared by Austrians for European integration. "The result of the referendum may help spur the EU's expansion, and the community will move precisely in the direction recently urged by U.S. President Bill Clinton at the French National Assembly: to the East." NEPSZABADSAG calls attention to a few lessons regarding Austria's EU membership. "The Socialist-Conservative coalition governing our neighbors jointly led the country into the Union, an example worth following. Public opinion did not see joining as dependent on party policies, one reason why they supported it with such a heavy majority. This is also why Austrian anti-integration rightists failed so seriously with their arguments against EU membership, so familiar to Hungarian ears."
