FBIS4-46309 "jptot023__l94095" JPRS-TOT-94-023-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 30 May 1994 WEST EUROPE TURKEY SABAH Article on PKK-Armenian Link Called `Lie' SABAH Article on PKK-Armenian Link Called `Lie' NC0306154694 Istanbul OZGUR ULKE in Turkish 30 May 94 p 8 NC0306154694 Istanbul OZGUR ULKE Turkish BFN [Text] The photograph that the newspaper SABAH published last Tuesday under the headline "Dirty Alliance!" exposed this paper's ties with the "intelligence units" and how it is being used by these circles. [Text of SABAH article appears as item NC2605092094 in previous Terrorism Report] It has been ascertained that the photograph of PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] leader Abdullah Ocalan and M. Yohanna, the Syriac Metropolitan of Aleppo, Syria, was part of the archives that were seized during the 10 December 1993 police raid on the paper OZGUR GUNDEM, whose publication was banned last month by the Supreme Court. SABAH resorted to an unbelievable lie to "prove" PKK-Armenian cooperation. It began its front page report on 24 May issue with the following statement: "`PKK-Armenian cooperation,' which Turkish Governments have known about for years and which was being denied particularly by pro-PKK circles, has finally been confirmed with specific documents." Claiming that after prolonged work by the Turkish intelligence units, PKK-Armenian cooperation was proven by photographs, SABAH asserted that the priests of the Armenian Gregorian [Apostolic] Church met with Ocalan in al-Biqa', and that the extremist nationalistic Armenian Tashnak [Armenian Revolutionary Federation] Party has been providing arms and financial assistance to the PKK through the church. It also claimed that Ocalan wants to find shelter in Armenia and that Armenians play an important role inside the PKK. It has now been determined that the Ugur Sefkat's report accompanying the photograph, which the paper described as a 'document,' is a complete lie. The priest standing near PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is described as an "Armenian priest." But in actual fact, the man on the photograph is M. Yohanna, the Syriac Metropolitan in Syria. The second lie concerns the date. The date of the meeting, which took place between Ocalan and Yohanna on 10 March 1993 and which was then distributed to subscribers by KURD-HA and which was published in the monthly magazine OZGUR HALK in Turkey in July 1993, has been 'changed' to 3 May 1994. What SABAH called a 'secret' meeting was fully published in a monthly paper that anyone can buy and read in Turkey. According to SABAH's "news," following a tip off about the meeting of the Armenian priests with Ocalan, the Turkish intelligence officials went into action and photographed the 3 May 1994 meeting. However, no explanation was given as to why Ocalan was wearing a winter overcoat in May, as shown in the photograph. The Photograph Comes From OZGUR GUNDEM's Archives This photograph, under which some concocted information has been sprinkled and which was supposedly taken by the Turkish intelligence officials, was "seized" during the police raid on OZGUR GUNDEM on 10 December 1993. The report, which was published in the magazine OZGUR HALK and which, together with the photograph, was transmitted to OZGUR GUNDEM on the same day by KURD-HA, said that M. Yohanna, the Syriac metropolitan of Aleppo in Syria, paid a familiarization visit to PKK leader Ocalan on 10 March 1993 in Barr Ilyas in Lebanon. M. Yohanna and Ocalan discussed the problems of the Syriacs in South Kurdistan [Iraqi Kurdistan] and in the Mardin region and conversed on the common history of Assyrians and Kurds. In the meantime, the press secretary of the Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul told a television station that the attire of the priest on the photograph is not that worn by the Armenian priests and that no such meeting took place. [SABAH's photograph appears to be an altered version of the photograph of Ocalan and M. Yohanna published on page 16 of the 15 May 1993 issue of BERXWEDAN as part of a report on a meeting between these two persons. The SABAH photograph seems to have airbrushed some background details and eliminated a third person standing beside Ocalan and Yohanna. Nicosia Bureau processed the BERXWEDAN item in May, 1993.]
