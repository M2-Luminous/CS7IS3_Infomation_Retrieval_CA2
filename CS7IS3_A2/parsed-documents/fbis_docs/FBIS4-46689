Spiridonov, ADS, under the rubric "Property": "Four Fifths of Machinebuilding Enterprises Potential Bankrupts: Roskommash Disputes Insolvency Criteria Set by Government"] [Text] In a few days, a government resolution on the implementation of bankruptcy legislation that sets insolvency criteria for enterprises and regulates standards for bankruptcy-related procedures will be passed. In preparing the draft resolution, the Federal Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Affairs under Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the Administration of State Property] used methods for analyzing enterprises' financial-economic activity worked out by the administration with the participation of specialists from Roskommash (Russian Federation Committee on Machinebuilding). The Roskommash board of directors was informed of this at a meeting by its chairman, Anatoliy Ogurtsov. However, as Aleksandr Voytenko, the head of the Main Administration for Structural Policy, Demonopolization, and Privatization at Roskommash, stated, while coming into its own in the name of the state as the owner of the bankrupt enterprise, the department raised the plank of financial indicators envisioned as allowable too high. If insolvency criteria are to be set only according to the current accounting balance-sheet, as the Federal Administration on Insolvency Affairs is doing, and the enterprise's debts are allowed to exceed the funds available to cover them by no more than a factor of 2, then, according to Aleksandr Voytenko, 80 percent of the enterprises in the machinebuilding complex will wind up on the register of insolvent enterprises. So far, the Federal Administration on Insolvency Affairs has put the Moscow Searchlight Plant and the NATI Institute [State Tractor Science and Research Institute] on the "black list." Roskommash itself is still defined on the basis of 15 enterprises. At the instruction of Viktor Chernomyrdin, said Anatoliy Ogurtsov, the branch commission will analyze enterprises' financial-economic status and make site visits before 25 May. Then the final list of bankruptcy candidates will be drawn up. However, it will include only the "very very most," inasmuch as the government's draft resolution on implementing bankruptcy legislation, Mr. Ogurtsov feels, permits the integrity criteria it sets to be ignored when the bankruptcy of the enterprise could be averted by preventive financial stabilization measures. Among the prophylactic measures against bankruptcy mentioned at the board meeting were mandatory preservation of at least 25 percent of the shares of the enterprises included in the priority branch programs for the development of machinebuilding as state property, as well as the transfer of these shares to an administration acting as principal for the branch ministries and committees. Sergey Belyayev, chairman of the Federal Administration on Insolvency Affairs, who spoke at the meeting, characterized these claims of Roskommash's as unsupported, since, as he said, there had yet to be a single example of an enterprise with a 25-percent share of state property being able to attract a substantial investor. Therefore, in his opinion, if its directors were indeed disturbed by the fate of semi-official enterprises, then Roskommash, on the contrary, needs to fight for state packages of shares to be sold to rich investors.
