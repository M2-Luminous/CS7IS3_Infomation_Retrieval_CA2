Minister Mendieta added that the National Transportation Commission [CNT] must honor agreements signed between the government and the various transportation chambers and federations. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta indicated that the National Police will work toward completely normalizing the capital city. As an example of regions where unrest persists, the government minister pointed toward Rubenia, Ciudad Sandino, and, as of today, the Metro Center sector where the interference of Tomas Borge, FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Force] National Board member, has been proven. [Begin Mendieta recording] I believe that since it was Mr. Borge himself who pointed to the need for a demonstration, such as the one that took place today and which was supported by Sandinist groups, he should then also guarantee, just as I personally requested, that there will be no further protests such as those that have been occurring. Therefore, I believe that if he is willing to defend the demands of these groups, then he must also be willing to prevent these groups from overstepping boundaries established by the law. [end recording] Mendieta confirmed having confiscated weapons from the transportation sector workers currently supporting the strike. [Begin Mendieta recording] This morning we seized several weapons and arrested several people. We know they are also using some type of homemade mortar. The police have very specific information on this issue. We hope they do not attempt to use these weapons and that we can end this situation without further problems. [end recording] [passage omitted] The government minister indicated that CNT spokesman Gustavo Aguiluz could face charges because of his constant calls to violence, thus threatening citizens' safety. [Begin Mendieta recording] If necessary, he will have to answer for that decision to the courts. I also understand that some of the persons who were directly mentioned by Mr. Aguiluz are preparing to file lawsuits against him, forcing him to prove the charges he made. [end recording] The National Police have coordinated security measures for the members of the federations and chambers who are still operating in order to guarantee their safety and security. [Begin Mendieta recording] We are in a position to guarantee the free movement of their vehicles and the assurance that their offices will be secure. I would like to be absolutely clear in stating that we are going to act as forcefully as the law allows to prevent any attempts against these persons just because they decided to sign an agreement with the government. The government is not going to take any steps beyond these agreements; on the contrary, I repeat, the CNT must abide by these commitments. [end recording] Public order will be diligently guarded by the state's security organizations.
