As a result, North Korea will resume its negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and working-level contact with South Korea in January, the official said. There is also a strong possibility that North Korea and the United States will hold a third round of their high-level talks soon, he said, requesting anonymity. "The United States and North Korea could not reach a complete agreement as two problems arose at their contact in New York on Tuesday," the official said. "But these problems are not crucial and I don't believe that they will become an obstacle." The official declined to disclose details of the difficulties but said the United States and South Korea have already informed Pyongyang of their positions on the problems. "Therefore, the statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman on Thursday night could be taken as its reply, accepting the U.S.-South Korean position," the official said. The statement said that there had been a breakthrough in the latest round of talks between the United States and North Korea in New York. "The two sides removed a series of stumbling blocks that had deadlocked the North Korea-U.S. talks and made a breakthrough for progress...," the North Korean spokesman said. The South Korean official said, "The possibility of solving the two problems is increasing." He indicated that North Korea is going to allow the IAEA to inspect all seven of its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon and will accept a proposal for exchanges of special envoys with South Korea. The problems involve the venue for the North Korean-IAEA talks. North Korea wants to hold them in Pyongyang whereas the United States want them to be held in a third country and favors Vienna, according to informed sources. Because of these differences, the two sides could not work out a complete agreement, they said. The United States and North Korea are expected to hold another working-level contact in New York early next month to discuss the venue for the talks and other auxiliary matters. Inter-Korean relations and the North Korean nuclear issue will enter into a new phase if the United States and North Korea agree to hold a third-round of high-level talks, they said.
