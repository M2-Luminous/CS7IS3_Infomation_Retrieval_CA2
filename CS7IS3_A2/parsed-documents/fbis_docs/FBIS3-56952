The outcome of three days of tense debates, continuing virtually around the clock, was the adoption of decisions on the more complex questions of the Abkhaz drama such as the return of refugees, strengthening trust and security, and the use of peacekeeping forces. These decisions were included in a communique of the meeting that was signed by the heads of the delegations and representatives of the United Nations, Russia, and the CSCE. The current round in Geneva, like the previous one from 30 November to 1 December, was held under the aegis of the United Nations, assisted by Russia. The Georgian delegation was headed by Jaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Provisional Committee for the State of Emergency and deputy of the Georgian Supreme Council, and the Abkhazian delegation by Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, chairman of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers. Much effort had to be put in by the mediators -- Eduard Brunner, the UN secretary general's special envoy, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, the head of the Russian delegation -- to make the agreement possible. "The talks were difficult," the Russian envoy said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The main reason was the very acute problems that had built up over 18 months of conflict. A great deal of blood has been shed and the war has brought misery to hundreds of thousands of people. And yet, despite the sharp clash of points of view, and when it seemed that a compromise was impossible, they were able to achieve a positive outcome to the talks, and this is another important step toward a full-scale settlement to the conflict in Abkhazia." One of the main results was the commitment endorsed by the sides in the communique not to use force and not to resort to threats to use it. The sides appealed to the UN Security Council to widen the UN Mandate on Supervision in Georgia, which requires it to ensure that there is no resumption of hostilities. They spoke in favor of deploying UN peacekeeping forces or other forces sanctioned by the United Nations in the conflict zone, expressing their mutual consent to the use of the Russian military contingent in such forces. The deployment of the "blue berets" should be followed by the withdrawal of all armed formations over the course of five days from the Inguri River and other possible zones of confrontation and the replacement of them by the peacekeeping forces. All volunteer formations and individuals who have come to take part in the conflict should be disarmed and withdrawn. A commission for problems of refugees is being set up with the participation of representatives of the sides, the United Nations, and Russia. It has been decided to start a stage-by-stage return of refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia on 10 February -- beginning with Galskiy Rayon. The most difficult question -- the future political status of Abkhazia -- will be discussed within the framework of the previously formed group of experts that will assemble for the next meeting in Moscow on 8 February. On 22 February the delegations and the international mediators intend to hold a new round of talks in Moscow or Geneva. Member of the Georgian delegation Sandro Kavsadze, the chairman of Georgia's Committee for Human Rights and Interethnic Relations, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the talks had made it possible "to move forward toward a settlement." Even though the debate was of "very heated and there was a degree of confrontation," "on the main issues we reached agreement and understanding." Having noted the great importance of the accords, head of the Abkhaz delegation Sokrat Dzhindzholiya stressed the important role of the Russian Federation in a settlement. "Thanks to the efforts of the Russian delegation, and of Russia as a whole, a great many positive things were achieved," he said in an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. Even before this the Russian Federation had been doing everything possible in order to bring our positions closer together. Furthermore, life itself has, evidently, meant it to take part in the destiny of the peoples that were joined by the Soviet Union. There is simply no other way out. Neither other countries nor the United Nations have the strength or the means to do this. What is more, no one knows better than Russia the situation on the territory of the former USSR.
