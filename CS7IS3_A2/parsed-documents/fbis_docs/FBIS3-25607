Neither the Pakistani troops nor UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] have commented on the killing of the two men, who were killed near the university on 11 and 12 February. The incident was actually hidden from the media. Malyuun Abdulle Mohamoud, mother of one of the dead men -- Abdullahi Abdi Ogle -- who was speaking at the hospital this morning to our health affairs reporter Abshir Nur Ali, said she had been going to the Pakistani barracks for the last nine days asking to see the body of her son. The identity of the second man is still unknown. Some people believe that bodies of people killed are being hidden in UNOSOM camps, particularly in Pakistani one, with the aim of hiding them from reporters.
