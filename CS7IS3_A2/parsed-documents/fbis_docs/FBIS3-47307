Pheuanchai: "32 Years of Bravery of the Anti-Aircraft Corps"] [Excerpts] Faced with an ever more chaotic situation because of the air war of the imperialist invaders, the anit-aircraft unit--although at that time it was still not organized as an official unit--still provided a way of putting up an ever fiercer resistance while responding to the situation. It countered enemy attacks in a timely fashion and defended the skies and green mountains. In the 1960's the neo-colonialists developed a secret scheme to invade Laos. They rashly tried to escalate the war against the patriotic Lao people hoping to wipe out the Lao people's revolutionary forces completely. Therefore the unit carried out the orders of the supreme headquarters of the Free Lao [Neo Lao Itsara] Army and on 18 October 1961 the first anti-aircraft battalion cleared the skies using bullets against the iron of the imperialist invaders. This unit was established at Ban Nong Nam Village in Pek District of Xieng Khouang Province. It was commanded by Comrade Chan and Comrade Simeuang. It was organized in three companies. Two companies were armed with 37 mm guns, and one company was armed with 12.8 mm guns. After the battalion was established, it was assigned to fighting the enemy in the air. The first company fought the enemy in the air over Khang Khai (Xieng Khouang). Every bullet hit the aircraft and penetrated the enemy iron. The F-101, which was a very modern aircraft just produced by the Americans, immediately turned over and over and fell to the earth in Xieng Khouang. This was the first aircraft shot down in Indochina. When this first aircraft spun to earth, it created a great deal of fear in their air force. The LPA in contrast was very proud and decided resolutely to follow the leadership of the party. On 24 June 1994 [as published] the battle to liberate the Plain of Jars started. The anti-aircraft battalion worked with the infantry to block the enemy's routes for retreat from the Plain of Jars at Meuang Soui, Lat Ngon, Phou Ba, Khoua Lek and Khoua Nam Yen. In November 1964 the enemy attacked Phou Kout with its air force, artillery, and infantry. The enemy force was many times larger than ours. The battle to defend Phou Kout was fought back and forth fiercely with the two sides less than 25 meters apart. The Lao revolutionary combatants were very patriotic. Comrade Phimmason, a young combatant, used a 12.8 mm gun to hit a T-28 and then used a light machine gun to fire into the enemy columns advancing on the ground. This comrade fighting alone delayed a great number of the enemy in order to allow his entire platoon to attack enemy aircraft. In the end this comrade sacrificed his life bravely on the battlefield. When the battle was over, this brave unit had shot down five T-28's and damaged seven. They had also destroyed three armored vehicles and killed 28 of the enemy. In the course of its duties which included constant fighting from 1961 to 1973, the unit took part in the liberation of the nation as follows: it fought against aircraft 1055 times, shot down 285 aircraft of all types, fought 49 battles on land, and captured, killed and caused to surrender many hundreds of the enemy. They destroyed many weapons and much military equipment. They defended more than 4,000 people in Pek District and Khoun District. They built a revolutionary support base in four villages and built a 160 member guerrilla network. For these accomplishments the unit received 14 unit decorations and 41 individual decorations. One comrade was named a national hero, and two comrades were decorated for diligence. [passage omitted] During the period from 1973 to 1993 the battalion achieved more successes to further mark its 32 year tradition. It fought against aircraft two times hitting five aircraft and shooting down two. It captured two pilots and killed five of the enemy. Now the cadres and combatants in this battalion are impressed with these traditions of bravery and are prepared to dedicate their lives to their revolutionary duty in the new era.
