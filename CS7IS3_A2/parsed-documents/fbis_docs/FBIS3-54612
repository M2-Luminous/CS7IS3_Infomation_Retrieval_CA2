For instance, the procurement of Black Hawk helicopters is being put off until 1998. Gen. Budinger told a news conference called to mark the deal with McDonnell Douglas Corporation that it would be inconceivable for rival Lockheed to cease all purchases in Israel immediately. He believes such threats were not made by the company's management in the United States but by Elul, which represents McDonnell Douglas in Israel. He sharply attacked the company representatives, saying that they had conducted a personal campaign against him.
