"I would never go, even if I were invited," he said following British-German consultations with Prime Minister John Major at Chequers, the British prime minister's country seat. But Kohl left no doubt as to the fact that he would attend next year's VE-Day celebrations, the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. He said he would be there to pay his respects to the World War II dead. Needless to say, the British side claims that preparations for the VE-Day celebrations have not started yet. Following domestic squabbles about the D-Day celebrations, Major must make sure he reaches agreement with the war veterans associations in his country. Apart from this, the German-British consultations, which were also attended by several ministers, took place in unusual harmony. Major reported that at no time had there been any disagreement. According to both Kohl and Major, the only open question, that of choosing a successor to European Union [EU] Commission Chairman Jacques Delors, had not been settled. In any case, it became clear during fringe talks that the Germans would not support the candidacy of the British favorite, Sir Leon Brittan. But Kohl claimed that the German Government has not yet made up its mind about this. The heads of government reported at length on the subject of the future expansion of the EU. According to London, once Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway have become members, many years will pass before further members can be considered. "It is quite clear," said the Chancellor, "that there will be a long pause following the ratification of the new membership applications." Hungary and Poland are among the potential applicants for EU membership. The path to a further opening of the EU should be paved during Germany's presidency of the EU, which begins on 1 July and will last six months. The two government heads agreed to suggest to Hungary the holding of a trilateral military exercise in peace protection in 1995, as part of the Partnership for Peace. "We will invite the NATO command to take full part in the planning of this exercise, and at the same time we hope to create the prerequisites for other interested parties to take part as well," said a joint statement. Apart from this, the government heads promised their full support for the American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement and expressed their concern for the successful conclusion of the effort to help Ukraine destroy its nuclear weapons. "We will exchange information and experiences from our respective aid programs to make a maximum contribution to the collective objective of security and partnerlike relations in the entire region," it was said. For this purpose, the two men want to share their experience they have already gained, especially concerning the German retraining and accommodation construction programs for Ukrainian military personnel. The situation in Bosnia also figured prominently in the talks. The chancellor said he could see a "light at the end of the tunnel in former Yugoslavia." On the other hand, other crises are possible, he said. "Nobody should think that the evil spirits we have seen in the Balkans have already been exorcized," said Kohl.
