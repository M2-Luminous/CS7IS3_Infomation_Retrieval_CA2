FR941230-0-00105 FR941230-0-00019 •Form S&hyph;6 96 has been amended to make it clear that a Financial Data Schedule is required only upon the filing of an amendment to a registration statement on that form. 96 17 CFR 239.16. D. Changes to Public Utility Act Rules and Forms The following amendments to the Public Utility Act Rules and Forms have been adopted as proposed: •Forms U5B, 97 U5S, 98 and U&hyph;1 99 under the Public Utility Act have been amended to state that if an instrument defining the rights of security holders is in the form of a certificate, the text appearing on the certificate must be reproduced in an electronic filing. 100 97 17 CFR 259.5b. 98 17 CFR 259.5s. 99 17 CFR 259.101. 100 Instructions for Exhibits B to Forms U5B and U5S and Instruction A to Instructions as to Exhibits to Form U&hyph;1. These changes parallel those made to Item 601(b)(4) of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B, discussed above. E. Other Changes Other amendments are listed below. •As proposed, Exchange Act Rule 12b&hyph;15 101 has been amended to specify the number of copies required to be filed in connection with amendments to Exchange Act filings made in paper. 101 17 CFR 240.12b&hyph;15. •An electronic filing provision of Regulation 13D relating to electronic amendments to Schedules 13D and 13G has been amended to track its parallel provision in Regulation S&hyph;T. 102 102 Exchange Act Rule 13d&hyph;2(c) [17 CFR 240.13d&hyph;2(c)]. •A note to Exchange Act Rule 14a&hyph;4 103 codifies the Commission's position that proxy cards should be filed as appendices at the end of proxy statements filed in electronic format, and not as separate documents within the electronic submission. 104 In a similar vein, Instruction 3 to Item 10 of Schedule 14A 105 now instructs electronic registrants to file employee benefit plan documents required to accompany the proxy statement as appendices to the proxy statement. As in the past, filers are not required to deliver the plan documents to shareholders unless they are a part of the proxy statement. 103 17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;4. 104 See Section IV.F.5 of Release No. 33&hyph;6977. 105 17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;101. •Item 22(a)(4) of Schedule 14A has been amended to clarify that the Financial Data Schedule, required to be submitted by investment companies with certain proxy materials, would be submitted as an exhibit to the proxy statement. •Technical revisions have been made to the cover pages of proxy and information statements to make them easier to understand and expedite processing. 106 The rules have been revised to clarify that the cover page is for the use of the Commission and is not required to be distributed to security holders. 107 Further, a change has been made to Schedule 14A to ensure that the approximate date on which the proxy statement and form of proxy are first sent or given to security holders must be printed on the first page of the proxy statement sent to investors, and not on the cover sheet. 108 106 For example, a box has been added for filers of definitive material to check if the fee had previously been paid with preliminary materials and a reference to Item 22(a)(2) of Schedule 14A has been added to the ``Payment of Filing Fee'' section. 107 Revised Rule 14a&hyph;6(m) [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;6(m)] and Rule 14c&hyph;5(h) [17 CFR 240.14c&hyph;5(h)]. 108 Amended paragraph (b) of Item 1 of Schedule 14A. •The tender offer rules have been amended as proposed to make it clear that tender offer periods are tolled because of failure to file required documents in electronic format only when the bidder is required to file electronically or, if applicable, after it has elected to do so by filing the Tender Offer Statement in electronic form. 109 While this has always been the intended reading of the EDGAR provisions of the tender offer rules, questions have been raised as to whether the time periods would be tolled under other circumstances. 109 Exchange Act Rule 14e&hyph;1(e) [17 CFR 240.14e&hyph;1(e)]. For example, if the bidder is an electronic filer and the target company is also an electronic company, and the bidder files its Tender Offer Statement in paper in violation of the electronic filing rules, the time periods will be tolled with respect to the tender offer until a confirming electronic copy of the Statement is submitted. Where the bidder is an electronic filer and the target is a paper filer, if the bidder elects to file in paper under Rule 901(c)(1) of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.901(c)(1)], it may do so without tolling the tender offer periods, because paper filing is specifically permitted by that provision. However, if the electronic bidder elects to electronically file its Tender Offer Statement with respect to a paper company, as permitted by Regulation S&hyph;T, any subsequent filing in paper by the bidder with respect to the transaction will cause the tender offer periods to be tolled until confirming electronic copies of these documents are submitted. •The number of paper copies of Form SE (for use with documents filed in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption or other specified purposes) and Form TH 110 (used in connection with paper filings pursuant to a temporary hardship exemption) required to be filed has been increased from three to four, to facilitate processing by the staff. 110 17 CFR 239.65, 249.447, 259.604, 269.10, and 274.404. III. Common Mistakes Made by EDGAR Filers Since the adoption of the interim rules in February 1993, the Commission staff has been working with electronic filers to help them satisfy their electronic filing obligations. The Commission has issued the following list of staff suggestions to help electronic filers avoid some of the more common errors associated with electronic filing. 111 111 See Section III of Release No. 33&hyph;7074 for a more comprehensive discussion of these issues. •Filers should review documents in electronic format and error check using EDGARLink prior to transmitting documents for filing. For example, filers should check to make sure they are filing on the correct form type and are using accurate CIK and CCC numbers.
