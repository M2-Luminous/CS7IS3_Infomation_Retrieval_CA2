CBC officials attributed the surplus to increased capital inflow. Taiwan saw a net capital inflow of US$1.76 billion during the January-March period. It was the first time the country's capital account ended in the black since 1988. The balance of payments is a system recording all of a country's economic transactions with the rest of the world during a specified period of time. It is usually divided into the capital account, which records short and long-term capital flow, and the current account, which records merchandise and service trade as well as unrequited money transfers. In the first quarter of this year, Taiwan's current account surplus declined to a 13-year low of US$272 million due to a sharp decrease in the merchandise trade surplus. Taiwan's foreign trade surplus totaled only US$240 million during the January-March period because of sluggish exports and a continued rise in imports. The aggregate capital and current account surplus should be US$2.03 billion in the first quarter of this year. Excluding net errors and omissions, the CBC put the country's balance of payments surplus at US$1.67 billion.
