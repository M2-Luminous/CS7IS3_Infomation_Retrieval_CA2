An official spokesman said: "There are no plans to intervene in the banks, and this has not been proposed." In recent days, individuals who have no idea of the harm they are causing the nation took advantage of the last intervention into banks subsidized by Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] to spread rumors nationwide on new measures against other banks. The truth is that no bank, and much less important banks, is currently under investigation. Whoever is spreading these rumors does not realize the harm being caused to the entire system. Instead, all of us should make an effort to contribute to the reestablishment of a normal situation for depositors, who have become very tense in the wake of the last banking crisis. Meanwhile, a Finance Ministry spokesman said the law guarantees every depositor's savings, indicating the government has complied with the law, as occurred in the Banco Latino case, as well as in the cases of the other eight banks in which the government intervened. In another turn of events, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said: "The bankers have expressed to me their justified concern over this campaign, which the government will investigate." Nevertheless, he admitted it is difficult to locate those responsible for spreading false reports. The crux of the matter is that now campaigns against the so-called "solvent banks" have been stepped up, demonstrating to the authorities that there may be criminal intentions behind the rumors.
