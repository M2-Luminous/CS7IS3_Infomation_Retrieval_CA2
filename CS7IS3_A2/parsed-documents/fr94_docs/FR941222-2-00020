FR941222-2-00020 FR941222-2-00017 Department of the Air Force Partial Record of Decision (PROD) for the Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental Impact Statement for Carswell Air Force Base (AFB), Texas On November 21, 1994, the Air Force issued a PROD for the disposal of a portion of Carswell Air Force Base (AFB), Texas. The decisions included in this PROD have been made in consideration of the Carswell AFB Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on February 18, 1994, and other relevant considerations. Carswell AFB was officially closed on September 30, 1993, pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (DBCRA) of 1990, (Public Law 101&hyph;510) and the recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. This PROD documents the Carswell AFB disposal decisions. The Air Force has decided to dispose of the approximately 1946 acres fee and 69.99 acres leased portion of the base in the following manner: Parcel A (approximately 95.03 acres) will be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the development of a Federal Medical Center Complex, Parcel B (20 houses on approximately 6.68 acres) will be assigned to Health and Human Services for a Public Benefit Conveyance to ARI for a rehabilitation center, Parcel C (one house on approximately .23 acres) will be assigned to the Department of Education for a Public Benefit Conveyance to Westworth Village for use as a public library, Parcel D (approximately 1,840 acres fee and 69.99 acres leased), will be retained and realigned by the DoD as mandated by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. The uses proposed for the property by prospective recipients of property under the ROD are included in the proposed action in the FEIS and are consistent with the community's draft redevelopment plan for the base. Carswell Redevelopment Authority prepared the plan, with the assistance of the broader community. By this decision, the Air Force adopts certain mitigation measures, as described in this PROD, to protect public health and the environment. In response to existing or forecasted environmental impacts to or in the area of Carswell AFB, subsequent property owners should consider implementation of the more specific mitigation measures associated with reuses they may undertake, as set forth in Chapter 4 of the Final Environmental Impact Statement. Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. Charles R. Hatch, Program Manager, Southwest Division. Correspondence should be sent to AFBCA/SW, 1700 N. Moore Street, suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809. Patsy J. Conner, Air Force Federal Register Liaison Officer.
