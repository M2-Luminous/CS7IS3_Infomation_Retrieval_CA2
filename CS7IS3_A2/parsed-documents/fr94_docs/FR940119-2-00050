FR940119-2-00050 FR940119-2-00034 [OPP&hyph;180917; FRL 4754&hyph;1] Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to use Imidacloprid; Solicitation of Public Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Michigan Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the insecticide imidacloprid (trade name Admire 2 Flowable) (CAS No. 105827&hyph;78&hyph;9) to manage insecticide resistance in Colorado potato beetle on up to 30,000 acres of potatoes in Michigan. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180917,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Libby Pemberton, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: CS#1, Room 52, 6th Floor, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA (703&hyph;308&hyph;8326). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of the insecticide, imidacloprid, available as Admire 2 Flowable, from Miles Inc., to control pesticide resistant Colorado potato beetle (CPB) on up to 30,000 acres of potatoes in Michigan. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. According to the Applicant, this emergency is the direct result of severe insecticide resistance problems and the extreme population levels built up because of the growers' inability to control CPB. The Applicant states that year-to-year changes in weather and varieties make it difficult to track long term trends in potato beetle injury. However, there is no visible increase in yields during this period in spite of major improvements in average yield of new varieties and widespread increases in use of irrigation. Under current severe insecticide resistance and defoliation by Colorado potato beetles, average production of potatoes per acre in Michigan has not increased significantly in the past eight years. Losses plus control costs in 1993 were $10.53 million - more than 13 percent of the entire industry's expected gross profits. Under the proposed exemption, one application of Admire 2 Flowable would be made at the rate of 0.9 to 1.3 fl. oz. per 1,000 feet of row. This is equivalent to 13.8 to 20 fl. oz. of formulated product per acre with 34 inches between the rows. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require publication of a notice of receipt in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide) [40 CFR 166.34 (a)(1)]. Imidacloprid is a new chemical. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Michigan Department of Agriculture.
