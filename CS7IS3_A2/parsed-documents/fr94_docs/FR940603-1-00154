All materials removed remain the property of the Owner. The provisions for Owner-Furnished materials in the Proposal shall apply if such materials are reused for construction of the Project. The unit removal prices shall include all materials and labor required to reinstall in accordance with specifications any conductors temporarily detached. The Contractor will reinstall at his own expense any other units removed by him for his own convenience. The removal units are specified by the prefix I and followed by the assembly unit designation of existing assembly unit to be removed. For example, an I&hyph;A1 signifies the removal of an A1 assembly unit. The following special notes apply to specific removal units: a. Poles. All poles of the same height, regardless of pole class, are designated by the same unit. Thus an I&hyph;30-foot pole signifies the removal of a 30-foot pole of any class. The Contractor is not required under this unit to remove from the pole any ground wire or pole numbering attached to the pole. This unit includes the refilling and tamping of holes in a workmanlike manner unless they are to be reused. b. Pole-top Assemblies. The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly itself, any necessary handling, resagging, and retying of conductors in those cases where an existing pole-top assembly will be removed and replaced by a new pole-top assembly and where any existing conductor is to be reused. The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies also includes any holding or handling of mainline or tap conductors at tap lines, angles, and deadends where such is involved, and the reinstalling of such conductor in accordance with the specifications; for example, an I&hyph;A5&hyph;4 will include the disconnection of the tap conductors, snubbing off the tap line at the nearest practical point and the reconnection and resagging of these tap conductors if necessary to the new tap assembly when installed. The new unit of construction, however, will be specified separately in Section N. c. Conductor. The conductor removal unit covers the removal of 1,000 feet of conductor or cable and reeling or coiling it in a workmanlike manner in such a way that it can be reused by the Contractor or the Owner. The Owner will furnish to the Contractor reels if it is to be returned to the Owner's warehouse on reels. The removal unit for each size of conductor or cable is shown by the prefix I followed by D and the conductor or cable type; thus an I&hyph;D 6ACWC signifies the removal unit for 1,000 feet of 6 A Copperweld-copper conductor. d. Guys. All guys regardless of length, type of attachment, or size of guy strand are specified by the same unit; thus an I&hyph;E signifies the removal of any guy. e. Anchors. Only anchor rods are to be removed by the Contractor in anchor removal units. The anchors will be left in the ground; thus an I&hyph;F signifies the removal of any anchor rod. If the rod cannot be unscrewed, the end of the rod shall either be cut off or bent down so that the rod will be at least 18 inches below ground.
