The unification congress of the two parties will take place toward the end of April. There were 318 delegates voting in favor of the union, four who voted against, and 27 who abstained from casting their votes. Suggestions of a name to be given to the eventual new party included such propositions as "Liberal Democratic Union," "Democratic Congress," and "New Democracy." Fortunately, attempts to avert a major conflict that threatened to "blow up" the Congress ended in a successful resolution of the underlying problem just a dozen or so hours before the official opening of the deliberations. During a session of the UD presidium that lasted from late Friday night through the early hours of Saturday, Tadeusz Mazowiecki agreed to stay on as UD chairman and to run as candidate in the forthcoming election of the leader of the new united party. Everyone joined in persuading Mazowiecki to stay: Bronislaw Geremek, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Jan Rokita, and other parliament members collected signatures on an open petition concerning this matter, while local UD circles kept sending in telex messages in support of Mazowiecki's continuing chairmanship. Finally, Mazowiecki decided to stay out--and was applauded by the assembled delegates in a standing ovation. He replied with a concluding address in which he firmly demanded strict loyalty from all of the leaders of the individual UD factions. "Maybe I really am too slow, and maybe I do indeed need to be prompted into acting, but this can be done internally within the party rather than through outside manipulation. I would prefer other ways of finding out about a whole variety of controversial utterances made by my colleagues than coming across them as I listen to broadcasts of radio programs. It is true that Mazowiecki plays the role of "middleman," or mediator in UD: He reconciles sides and settles conflicts when it comes to program-oriented and tactical differences between the party's right wing (represented by Rokita) and the left wing (headed by Frasyniuk). In internal "Unionese" language, Mazowiecki is sometimes dubbed "Paper Clip" or "Safety Pin," to denote his ability to pin back together what has become unraveled. UD Congress Program Debate There are really no substantive differences over party program between supporters of the number of separate factions within UD. Faction leaders were unanimous on this point, regardless of the fact that they had earlier--sometimes as recently as a few days before the Congress--insisted that a split in the party was inevitable. Marek Dabrowski emphasized the need to present an integrated vision of a social and economic program. Jacek Kuron asserted that UD faced an obvious dilemma between the concept of a rational economic policy and the need to demonstrate sensitivity to social needs and expectations. The way out of this dilemma can only be through social movements galvanizing citizens to engage in a reform program, and certainly not a war waged against the state budget by the trade unions. The final Congress declaration was formulated along similar lines: Social discontent was caused by the left-wing coalition's failure to realize the promises it had made during the election campaign as well as from the lack of a clear-cut concept of the necessary reforms. Nevertheless, social conflicts should be resolved at a debating table rather than through organized strikes. UD radicals engaging in strong campaigns against the Catholic Church took a rapping across the knuckles. Jerzy Turowicz argued that anticlericalism engendered unnecessary conflicts in a situation where even the church itself, through the words of such authorities as John Paul II or Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, secretary to the Polish Episcopate, supports the idea that a state should officially adopt a neutral worldview. A most forceful line of argument tackling the same subject was put forward by Aleksander Smolar: "Various politicians, mostly more popular than eminent, have misrepresented UD's real position through their utterances on church-state relations. There are limits to such misrepresentation, and those who overstep them should look for suitable niches for themselves outside UD." Smolar's words were interpreted by the audience as an allusion to some recent statements by Barbara Labuda referring to "creeping clericalization of the state." The culprit herself failed to reply to the challenge. She was absent from the debating hall throughout the second day of the Congress.
