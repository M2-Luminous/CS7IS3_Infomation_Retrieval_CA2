['Abbas] We will not answer those who copy the ideas of others, speak for others, or express the wishes of "certain parties concerned," nor will we pay any attention to those who do not read things and would not understand if they did read them, and if they did understand, they would only understand what agrees with their preconceived positions and decisions. [passage omitted] [Al-Qulaybi] The agreement only applies to the West Bank and Gaza and covers only one third of the Palestinian people. It speaks briefly and in a very few words about the need to solve the problem of the refugees. ['Abbas] The international terms of reference on which the Madrid, Washington, and Oslo negotiations were based are Resolutions 242 and 338. In 1988 the [Palestine] National Council [PNC] accepted commitment to these terms of reference as the basis. The Fes summit conference also committed itself to the international terms of reference and right of all states in the region to live in peace within secure borders. These two resolutions are what the negotiators uphold. One article in Resolution 242 speaks of "a just solution to the refugee problem." In the past the Israelis tried to interpret the word "refugees" as covering the Jews who came from the Arab states to Israel. Its aim was to keep the resolution -- which actually was about the Palestinian refugees -- fluid. The U.S. letter of assurances said that the refugee problem could be discussed in the multilateral as well as bilateral negotiations. That is why we raised it in the three multilateral rounds of negotiations in Ottawa, Oslo, and Tunis. [passage omitted] So the refugee problem was discussed most extensively in the multilateral negotiations. As regards bilateral negotiations, since Resolution 242 was unequivocally and without any ambiguity confirmed as the term of reference and as it was confirmed that the refugee problem would be one of the main issues to be discussed in the final stage, which would be no later than two years after ratification of the agreement, that meant that the words covering that issue in the agreement, though few, were clear. [passage omitted] [Al-Qulaybi] The agreement seeks an end to the intifadah and could lead to inter-Palestinian conflict. ['Abbas] The intifadah broke out against the Israeli military occupation and escalated whenever Israeli repression, persecution, imprisonment, deportations, and curfews intensified. [passage omitted] The intifadah got material, moral, and political support from abroad. It was possible to supply it with the means necessary for its continuation, through the PLO at the official level and the Palestinian masses who lived in the Gulf states. It also earned the sympathy of parties, peoples, and states throughout the world. [passage omitted] The Gulf war, however, deprived the intifadah of all these resources, as 400,000 Palestinians who could support 1.5 million Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territory left Kuwait. As a result, we have a million Palestinians living below the poverty line. The PLO's resources ran out and it stopped its subsidies to the various institutions, societies, and individuals including the families of the martyrs, the wounded, and the detainees. The international community, angry at our position during the Gulf war, turned its back on us. So the intifadah stood alone in the battlefield. Anyone who asks about the question of ending the intifadah or the need for its continuation should think first and foremost about securing the factors that would ensure its continuation and about the people who are suffering from the occupation and poverty at the same time, and should ask himself, why did the masses come out in the streets to express happiness and rejoice at the agreement? Has it occurred to those calling for the continuation of the intifadah what it means to go six years without schools, universities, or work? The intifadah broke out against the occupation. If there is a glimmer of hope that the occupation will end, why should the people not turn to starting a new phase in their life to build their future and the future of their children and of future generations? The intifadah was not an end in itself. [passage omitted] [Al-Qulaybi] The signing of the agreement was a recognition of Israel with no commitment to the creation of an independent Palestinian entity. In fact, it will lead to a feeble, subservient entity lacking in sovereignty. Perhaps the Gaza-Jericho option is in essence the end of the road. ['Abbas] On the question of recognizing Israel's legitimacy, I would like to say so much about this matter but there is no room for that here now, so I will try to be as brief as possible. First of all, the recognition of Israel occurred at the 1988 19th session of the PNC, the highest Palestinian legislative authority. Therefore, the Oslo agreement represented nothing more than the start of practical implementation of that program, which was the culmination of many years of dialogue and many years of Palestinian struggle and many years of history and wars in the region and international conflicts linked to the region. [passage omitted] The Arab world accepted the legitimacy of Israel's existence when it accepted Resolution 242 reinforced by Resolution 338, which gave Israel the right to exist within secure and recognized borders. Then came the Camp David agreement to create some kind of diplomatic relations between the biggest Arab state and Israel. Then came the 1982 Fes summit resolution embracing a plan which provided for the recognition of Israel's right to exist. That summit gave Israel's existence full legitimacy in the name of the entire Arab nation. Furthermore, the Arab states' acceptance of President Bush's 1991 initiative and the initiation of their negotiations with Israel at bilateral and multilateral levels, involving 16 states, confirmed that legitimacy before any Arab party concluded any agreement or treaty. Then there was the Jordanian-Israeli agreement on the agenda or declaration of principles and that was followed by the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. [passage omitted] We do not claim that we signed an agreement of principles creating an independent Palestinian state, and there is no article that clearly says so. We must admit that we agreed on interim autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza. In principle, the so-called Gaza-Jericho option does not mean that the Palestinian authority will be confined to that, because such an interpretation of the Declaration of Principles would be a considerable distortion of the truth and would indicate some political myopia. If we examine the agreement we would see that Article 4, for instance, stipulates that the two sides consider the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to be a single territorial unit whose unity and security should be maintained throughout the transitional period. [passage omitted] When discussing the issue of sovereignty we should take into consideration the nature of the negotiations and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It is a unique conflict and sovereignty has a special meaning. The sovereignty being discussed is a relative sovereignty of a special nature linked not so much to the principle of national rights of sovereignty as to the creation of a national entity that was not there before. The mechanism for the implementation of the agreement will lead to the progressive emergence and crystallization of the elements of sovereignty until they are fully achieved. [passage omitted] The geographical jurisdiction of the Palestinian authority is clear and includes these occupied territories. The fact that Israel is trying to keep some territory is a matter of conflict. The texts are in our favor, and we have the two states which sponsored the agreement and the possibility of arbitration and so on, but we will not forfeit one inch of it. [Al-Qulaybi] The agreement does not fulfill the Palestinian people's legitimate rights which were upheld by the international community. These rights have been the subject of bargaining in bilateral negotiations away from the UN authority and resolutions. The mutual recognition is neither complete, balanced, or just. ['Abbas] Perhaps the detailed meaning of the legitimate political rights was left to the negotiations, but that phrase did appear in more than one place. The introduction spoke of the "recognition of the two peoples' political and legitimate rights." The third paragraph of Article 3 of the Declaration of Principles agreement stipulates that "the elections will be an important preparatory transitional step toward the fulfillment of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights and just demands." As we are talking about a declaration of principles and not a detailed agreement, we believe that this issue was given due attention particularly as the agreement is fundamentally based on international legitimacy and its fulfillment. [passage omitted] The fear of Israeli domination of the Arab economy that some people are talking about actually reflects a disgraceful sense of failure or inferiority on the part of the people who talk like that. The Arabs have been talking about an Arab common market since the early sixties, about the same time Europe started talking about a European common market. Why has Europe now achieved economic union while the idea of an Arab common market remains just an idea in some people's minds? And finally, why is it that the volume of trade among 22 Arab states does not exceed 4 percent of these states' trade with the outside world? [passage omitted] [Al-Qulaybi] Israel supports a confederation with Jordan, not an independent state, because an independent state would prevent the annexation of some West Bank and Gaza territory, would prevent control of the water resources, and would not accept the annexation of Jerusalem. ['Abbas] Israel seeks to annex parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and will try to control the water resources and maintain its annexation of Jerusalem regardless of whether the solution is going to be an independent or confederal state, but we must clarify a point which many people seem to find ambiguous, namely the word confederation. In international law there is only one definition of confederation. It is that "a confederation is a contractual agreement between two or more independent entities." This means that confederation and the independent state are not mutually exclusive. A confederation emanates from independent states. There is no other way. That is why we should not link Israel's wishes of annexation and control to the option that will ultimately materialize, namely confederation. Whatever the option, it is our duty to struggle until Resolution 242 is fully implemented so that there is full withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967 and so that the Palestinian entity is in control of all its resources, including water. [Al-Qulaybi] There are risks in postponing the discussion of Jerusalem, the settlements, sovereignty, the borders, and the refugees to the final phase, that is five years. ['Abbas] It was clear from the beginning that a number of issues would be postponed until the final phase which was supposed to begin with or during the third year. That explains why representatives of Jerusalem and the diaspora were excluded from the Madrid and Washington negotiations. It was also clear that the first phase would be that of interim Palestinian autonomy and that there would be no room in it for discussion of sovereignty and independence, which would come after the implementation of the first phase. However, to eliminate some confusion from people's minds we say that the transitional period will not exceed five years (Article 1 of the agreement). In other words it could be a little less, or much less than that. [passage omitted] It is known that Jerusalem was annexed to Israel by a Knesset decision but the mere fact that it was put on the agenda for the final phase means, from the Israeli point of view, that it is a disputed issue and that the annexation decision was void. We must realize, however, that these matters require great efforts and much time to resolve. We need to struggle and be patient. There are risks. There have been no agreements in history without risks. [Al-Qulaybi] The real significance of the Oslo agreement is that Israel wants the PLO to play the part of the Village Leagues in return for big financial promises and greater influence in return for some oral concession made deliberately ambiguous to obstruct the negotiations. There is a belief that the system of government in the occupied territory would neither be democratic nor elected and that [the government] would be appointed by the PLO because Israel does not want democracy there. ['Abbas] If we want to talk about abstract Israeli wishes in isolation from the objective circumstances then all that is being said is true because, to begin with, Israel was founded on Herzl's theory: "A land without people for people without a land." [passage omitted] I have cited all these historical and real points to say that if the matter was left to Israel it would not have recognized anything and would not have accepted any solution. At one stage of the Palestinian national struggle it created the Village Leagues and then abandoned them when they failed to justify their existence and after they were rejected by the people. It is not right to draw a parallel between that and the Oslo agreement which speaks of the Palestinian people's legitimate political rights, withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, complete transfer of power with the exception of external security, executive, legislative, and judicial powers, general elections, and other things. Why should we assume that the regime in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip would not be democratic and that [the government] would not be elected but appointed by the PLO? And if Israel wanted it to be that way, why should the PLO accept that, when it has been insisting on the principle of elections, on which there was an appendix? And even if, hypothetically, the PLO accepted that, who could force the people to accept it? [passage omitted]
