He said that we found ourselves compelled, in overwhelming circumstances, to announce the formation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which we consider to be the nucleus for a unified Yemen, as it was erected on the firm basis of the pledge and accord document, a document for national consensus. The brother chairman of the Presidential Council stated this today during a dawn press conference in al-Mukalla, Hadramawt Governorate, during which he touched on a number of important national issues. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that the situation which the military and dictatorial machine of the al-Ahmar family's gang is trying to impose would not gain a foothold in this governorate. He noted that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was trying, with his forces deployed over a wide area, to turn the situation in his favor, and to besiege Aden, but he had paid a dear price and was continuing to do so. The brother said: It is now up to us to step up resistance, together with all patriots and democrats in the northern governorates, to bring about the collapse of the al-Ahmar gang's military machine, and with it the collapse of its [word indistinct] and hegemony over Yemen's resources and people. He stressed that the reconstruction of the state in part of Yemen's territory places before us a great task for the future, and a historic responsibility to struggle to bring about the unity of the Yemeni homeland and people. He said: We are not afraid of being termed secessionists or unionists, because history will describe us as individuals seeking to bring about realistic circumstances for the performance of democratic, unionist, and peaceful actions for the future of the entire Yemeni people.
