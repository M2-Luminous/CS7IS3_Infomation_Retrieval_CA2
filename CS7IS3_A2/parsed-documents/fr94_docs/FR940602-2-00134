SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that all licenses and other approvals to export or otherwise transfer defense articles or defense services to Rwanda are suspended until further notice pursuant to Sections 38 and 42 of the Arms Export Control Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Clyde G. Bryant, Jr., Chief, Compliance & Analysis Branch, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State (703&hyph;875&hyph;6650). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: United Nations Security Council Resolution 918 requires that all States prevent the sale or supply to Rwanda by their nationals or from their territories or using their flag vessels or aircraft of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary police equipment and spare parts. On May 26, 1994, the President issued Executive Order 12918 implementing the Security Council arms embargo on Rwanda. Pursuant to the Executive Order, the following activities are prohibited: (a) The sale or supply to Rwanda from the territory of the United States by any person, or by any United States person in any foreign country or other location, or using any U.S.-registered vessel or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary police equipment, and spare parts for the aforementioned, irrespective of origin. (b) Any willful evasion or attempt to violate or evade any of the prohibitions set forth in the order. Pursuant to the Executive Order, section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778)(AECA), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120&hyph;130)(ITAR), the export or other transfer to Rwanda of defense articles and services is prohibited. It is the policy of the U.S. Government to deny all applications for licenses and other approvals to export or otherwise transfer defense articles and services to Rwanda. All such applications which have been submitted since the current strife in Rwanda began on April 6, 1994 have been denied. In addition, U.S. manufacturers and exporters and any other affected parties are hereby notified that the Department of State has suspended all previously issued licenses and approvals authorizing the export or other transfer of defense articles or defense services to Rwanda. These actions have been taken pursuant to Sections 38 and 42 of the AECA (22 U.S.C. 2778 and 2791) and ยง126.7 of the ITAR. The licenses and approvals that have been suspended include any manufacturing licenses, technical assistance agreements, technical data, and commercial military exports and reexports of any kind involving Rwanda subject to the AECA. This action also precludes the use in connection with Rwanda of any exemptions from licensing or other approval requirements included in the ITAR, with the exception of those exemptions specified in ยง126.1(a). Dated: May 27, 1994. William P. Pope, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State.
