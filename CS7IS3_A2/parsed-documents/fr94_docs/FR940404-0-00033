FR940404-0-00033 FR940404-0-00014 A. The Commission's Hearing The Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) of the Colorado Department of Health submitted documentation and testimony to the EPA regarding the environmental need of the 7.8 standard. This testimony was presented at a hearing before the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission held on August 19, 1993. The APCD testified in support of a relaxation of the RVP standard to 9.0 psi before the Commission, stating that the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area had not violated the NAAQS for ozone for the period from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1989 when EPA designated areas under the Act. Because Denver had not experienced ozone violations during this time period, the Denver-Boulder area was afforded ``transitional'' nonattainment status. The APCD further testified that there were no monitored violations of the ozone NAAQS since 1986. The APCD noted that the volatility standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area in 1992 and 1993 was 9.0 psi and no violations of the standard were recorded. (However, there were single exceedances of the ozone NAAQS at two stations during 1993.) The APCD concluded that the Denver-Boulder area would be able to continue attainment of the ozone standard with 9.0 psi RVP gasoline based upon this information. The APCD also concluded that implementation of the lower RVP standard would burden refiners, gasoline marketers, and consumers unnecessarily with higher costs especially in light of current ozone concentration levels. According to the petition that Colorado sent to EPA in 1991 requesting relaxation of the RVP standard in the Denver-Boulder area during 1992 and 1993, the APCD was to have completed an ozone maintenance plan for the Denver area by June of 1993. The maintenance plan is necessary in order for the EPA to redesignate the area as having attained the ozone standard. 12 In the August 19, 1993 hearing, the Commission raised questions regarding the inability of the APCD to complete the ozone maintenance plan on time. The APCD testified that due to resource limitations caused by programmatic obligations under the Act, an ozone maintenance plan assumed a lower priority and could not be completed by the June 1993 deadline. 13 Thus, the APCD concluded that a two year extension of the RVP relaxation would be necessary to provide sufficient time to develop the ozone maintenance plan. Furthermore, because the Denver area continued to attain the ozone standard, the APCD concluded that an extension of the relaxation was not inappropriate. The APCD estimated that a plan would be developed and submitted by early 1995. It therefore recommended that a petition to relax the 7.8 psi standard to 9.0 be approved by the Commission and subsequently recommended to the Governor. 12 An ozone maintenance plan that demonstrates long term (10 years) maintenance of the ozone NAAQS must be developed by the state before an area can be redesignated to attainment. 13 In particular, the APCD testified that the considerable amount of work that had to be devoted to the PM 10 and CO nonattainment SIPs, made it impossible to complete work on the ozone SIP. The Denver-Boulder area is a moderate nonattainment area for both PM10 and CO. Based on the information received in the hearing, the Commission on August 19, 1993 adopted a resolution requesting that Governor Romer petition the EPA to retain the 9.0 psi standard for the 1994 and 1995 summer ozone seasons. The Commission also adopted a declaration that the APCD begin work on the Ozone Maintenance SIP and that it be completed on time. Governor Romer subsequently requested the two year relaxation in a letter dated September 15, 1993 to Acting Regional Administrator Jack McGraw. B. Sufficient Alternative Programs Because Colorado has not violated the ozone standard since 1986, EPA does not believe it is necessary for the State to show that sufficient alternative programs are in place to provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS. EPA approved the Ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Denver-Boulder area in 1983. 14 This plan relied upon emission reductions from the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program and an Inspection and Maintenance Program to provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the statutory deadline of December 31, 1987. Since the beginning of 1986, none of the area's several ozone air quality monitors has recorded a violation of the ozone NAAQS. 15 Because the available data showed no violations, EPA did not require the State to submit a revised Ozone SIP in 1988 during EPA's nationwide ozone SIP evaluation. As noted above, the area is currently classified as a ``Transitional'' area under section 185(A) of the Act. Under these circumstances, Colorado need not provide for alternative ozone control programs in order to obtain a relaxation of the RVP standard to 9.0 psi. 14 48 FR 55284 (December 12, 1983). 15 EPA has ongoing concerns with the quality of some of the ozone data and the geographic coverage of the monitoring network, and is working with Colorado to resolve these issues. Region VIII is currently working with the state to establish a network of maximum concentration monitors. IV. EPA's Proposed Action A. Relaxation of Colorado's Reid Vapor Pressure Standard EPA is approving as a direct final decision the State of Colorado's request to relax the federal volatility standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area until 1996 from the current standard of 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi. Section 211(h) of the Act requires EPA to promulgate regulations that shall establish RVP standards in a nonattainment area that are more stringent than 9.0 psi ``as the Administrator finds necessary to generally achieve comparable evaporative emissions (on a per-vehicle basis) in nonattainment areas taking into consideration the enforceability of such standards, the need of an area for emission control, and economic factors.'' Based on the petition and the evidence submitted on behalf of Governor Romer, EPA believes that the requested relaxation of the standard is justified.
