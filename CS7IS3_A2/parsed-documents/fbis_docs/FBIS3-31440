This general, nicknamed "Mali" [Little] by his friends, caught our attention when (in the first half of February] he started negotiations in the name of the Serbian side and signed the agreement on cease-fire around Sarajevo. [passage omitted] [Kacarevic] Mr. General, there is plenty of talk about air strikes. The Serbian side is supposed to meet the conditions set by NATO by 21 February. If these strike do materialize, what consequences will this have for the Serbian Army? [Milovanovic] Nobody in the world wants the creation of a Muslim state in the Balkans. They want that the peoples in the Balkans exhaust themselves and decimate each other as much as possible so that they could accomplish their interests more easily. It is very well known who has what interests. For example, France has the strongest interest in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Germany in Croatia, and Turkey in the eastern parts, that is to say, the territory of Macedonia and Kosovo. However, nobody, perhaps with the exception of Turkey and individual Islamic countries, wants the creation of the Islamic state. The West is constantly promising some sort of support to the Muslims to keep up their combat morale. The threat of air strikes is the best booster for Muslim morale. And all this has been going on for over a year. Not one of their politicians has made a statement without mentioning this possibility. In this way, they maintain the morale of the Muslim fighters. However, the realization of these air strikes is very complicated. First, it is difficult to differentiate the targets and specify what and whom to pound. Second, the world has become very much involved in Bosnia through the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] and humanitarian organizations. We are making it plain to everybody that if air strikes do take place all foreigners on the territory of the Srpska republic will become hostages. This also includes the representatives of the International Red Cross, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], and, unfortunately, even journalists.... Therefore, gentlemen, go ahead and attack! This is one of our defense mechanisms. Furthermore, as of 1 March, they have been flying in our sky and recorded everything. They have probably also placed numerous radio tracers [radio lokator] on the ground, along the separating lines. However, their problem is that they know all our capabilities [sentence as published]. Earlier they did not know, for example, that we can follow them all over Europe, and especially in Italy where they are concentrating. In one combat raid, as we soldiers call it, we can decimate their first shock group, which would consist of some 50 to 60 aircraft. Not a single chief of a state whose air force is taking part in the attack would be able to justify this at home. To become involved in such a war now would be a catastrophe, however not for Bosnia, which has already met its fate anyway, but for the entire world. Also, regardless of all their technical equipment, they could, according to our estimates, destroy 12 to 18 percent of our military hardware. This, however, would not eliminate our advantage in military hardware over the Muslims. The Muslims now live in 12 enclaves on the territory of former Bosnia. They are all entirely within the range of our arms. There are also UNPROFOR members in these enclaves and they know very well that a sort of massacre of international representatives would take place. We have no other choice, we must defend ourselves. [Kacarevic] Mr. General, is the claim of the western media that the FRY Army is taking part in the combat on the Bosnian battlefields correct? [Milovanovic] This claim has recently been used for propaganda purposes. The Western press has written extensively about this, however, when they have remained without sufficient proof, the matter was put off the agenda. The Yugoslav Army has not taken place in the operations on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina since 19 May 1992. Regarding volunteers, they are always welcome. [passage omitted]
