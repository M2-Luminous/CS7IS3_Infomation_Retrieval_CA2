For three days he has been personally leading these brutal massacres against the 3d Motorized Brigade, during which he refused to listen to the national, Arab and international forces demanding a stop to these massacres. After finishing his assignment, he came to say that 'Ali Salim al-Bid has been making a fuss in the world by contacting the Arab leaders for stopping the battle. In his speech the president spoke of the millionaires who keep their financial credits in foreign banks when wanting not to be opening the door because its odor is nasty -- but those who got used to nasty odors lose their sense of smell. To refer some of the secret international settlers for people to have [words indistinct] the leaders of the influential family are among the elite of the richest men in the world. The president used unfamiliar language in his speech in which he spoke much about Islam, the region, the religion, marxism etc. Perhaps this necessitated by the alliance with Islam, but [words indistinct] in the speech, but it puts on the speaker not his real garment. Then after that he spoke about the separatists. We do not know who are the separatists. Are they those who went to Sanaa with their children and families and the best military equipment and the units they have, according to what he said in his speech, or those who were entrenched behind their (?fascist) systems to impose their own projects, which led the country to this obstructive crisis. The planned attack on the 3d Motorized Brigade is the president's way of merging the Armed Forces.
