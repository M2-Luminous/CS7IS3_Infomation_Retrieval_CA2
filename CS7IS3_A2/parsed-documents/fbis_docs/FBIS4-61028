Your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent was told by Anatoliy Tyazhlov, head of the Moscow Oblast administration, that he like others is carrying out the population's mandate. "The people have told us politicians on many occasions: Stop these battles and finally get down to the business of the economy and the social program." That is what we must now tackle in earnest, A. Tyazhlov believes. It is his conviction that the process of accord should "go downward": At any rate the oblast leadership intends to implement a similar conciliation procedure in the Moscow region. The Treaty must not be just an action on the part of Moscow and the Kremlin. The Democratic Party of Russia is insisting on the Treaty's being given real substance; it is pressing for the process to be continued in conciliation procedures and for common solutions to be found in the economy and in policy, foreign policy included. Its leader Nikolay Travkin believes that the Treaty is designed to "launch the process" and is therefore essential as the first step on this difficult road. Federation Council member Vladimir Podoprigora is convinced that the signing is an extremely important moment, heralding an end to the stereotypical quest for an enemy that has become entrenched over many decades. People may express different political ideas, but they realize that the interests of society and the country are paramount and so renounce confrontation. The deputy hopes that a social atmosphere geared to accord can also prevail upon the hardline opposition, but in order for this he thinks it necessary to stop bad-mouthing those who have not signed the treaty. The opposition's opinion must be taken into consideration in order to adjust one's own policy and formulate the optimum state decisions. This idea was indirectly reaffirmed by Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who did not sign the treaty but said in the lobbies that the idea of accord is not alien to Communists and they will do their part to secure accord. But we would like to see concrete steps from the president and the government, G. Zyuganov said. We would like to see dialogue, support for the agro-industrial complex, and a real fight against corruption. Representatives of the "Yabloko" deputies' faction did not sign the agreement on civic peace yesterday either. But that does not mean that the faction renounces accord, so one of its leaders, Vladimir Lukin, said. On the contrary it is willing to take an active part in all specific measures to establish real civic peace and promote real reforms, movement toward democracy, and maximum accord during this movement. Nor did the Textile and Light Industry Workers' Trade Union immediately decide to subscribe to the Treaty. The position in the sector is a complex one, the trade union's chairman, Tatyana Sosnina, said. We held a protest action and picketed the government building but then we met with Viktor Chernomyrdin, decisions were adopted regarding support for the sector, and a sectoral wage agreement was signed. After which the presidium and the trade union's grassroots organizations authorized their leader to sign the treaty. Tatyana Sosnina believes that the treaty should be supplemented with concrete documents and that there should be economic "roundtables," where trade unions could highlight their position and protect working people's interests. The document will work, Federation Council Deputy Chairman Valeryan Viktorov said, if all contracting parties really want to make definite concessions and compromises. The stabilization of the economic processes is undoubtedly one of the main conditions for accord in society. But the economy is now perhaps to a greater extent the hostage of politics, he said. If we can reach accord, things will be easier in the economy too. And the reverse will also happen: A normal economy will gradually stabilize the political process. Everyone needs social accord. It is essential above all in order to extricate Russia from the protracted and profound economic crisis. As Akhsarbek Galazov, president of North Ossetia, said figuratively, it is necessary to unite in order for everyone to survive our cold political winter and to save Russia.
