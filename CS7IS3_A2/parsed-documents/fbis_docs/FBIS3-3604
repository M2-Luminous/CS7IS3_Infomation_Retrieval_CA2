He stressed in his speech: Party and government leading cadres at all levels should firmly cultivate a mass viewpoint, conscientiously implement the mass line, exert utmost efforts to do practical things for the masses, try by all possible means to do practical things for enterprises, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, further pool the efforts of all sectors, work with one heart and one mind, seek development with all-out efforts, and create brilliant achievements in Tianjin. After listing to speeches given by several deputies, Gao Dezhan said: All of you have great confidence in Tianjin's development prospects and unanimously held that the development objectives defined by the municipal authorities are encouraging, in conformity with Tianjin's reality, and fully reflect the will of the people across the municipality. This has strengthened the confidence of the municipal party committee and the municipal government in doing their work well. Certainly, to realize the development objectives and comprehensively fulfill all tasks of this year, we will face many difficulties. This requires our painstaking efforts to successfully carry out all fields of work. The most important is that leading cadres at all levels should firmly bear in mind the fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people under the new situation. It is necessary to fully understand that strengthening the flesh-blood ties between the party and the masses of people is a fundamental political issue. Even all things change, the original aim will not change. We must not slightly slacken our efforts in this fundamental issue or forget it under any circumstances. The people's feelings and complaints are the most important because they directly affect the success or failure of our work. If we do a good job in resolving this issue, we will overcome all difficulties and make our undertakings more invigorating. Gao Dezhan said: We must carry out all party and government tasks and all activities for the sake of the people and uphold Comrade Xiaoping's "three criteria," particularly the things that are conducive for raising the people's living standards. Therefore, party committees and governments at all levels should regard the immediate interests of the people as a matter of prime importance and as the fundamental starting and resting points for doing all work. All issues that affect the basic living standards of the people should be regarded as the major and urgent matters. No one is allowed to treat them indifferently or adopt an unconcerned attitude. Through our efforts, we should help the people eliminate misgivings, seek benefits, enable them to enjoy real benefits and see the hopes. Gao Dezhan stressed: The masses are the sources of strength and the foundation for achieving success. The working class and the masses of people across the municipality are the masters, the mainstay, and main forces for invigorating Tianjin and creating brilliant achievements. The past brilliant achievements were created by the people across the municipality and the new historical chapter must also be written by them. Leaders at all levels must truly and wholeheartedly rely on the broad masses of people, go to the grass roots and the masses while doing each and every work, organize the masses, boost their enthusiasm, respect their will, and give full play to their pioneering spirit. This is essential for implementing the party's basic line and doing all tasks well, and should be regarded as one of the important criteria for evaluating leading cadres at all levels. Gao Dezhan said: The higher the enthusiasm of the masses is, the more concern the leading cadres at all levels should give to the masses, particularly those with difficulties in their living standards. Tianjin has good traditions for doing practical things for the masses. We should continue to display this good tradition , and unceasingly enhance the level of doing practical things. When doing practical things, the thing of prime importance is to do it with real efforts, turn all things we managed into a success, and enable the masses to enjoy real benefits. To do practical things, the most important is to unceasingly raise the income of urban and rural people under the premise of deepening reform, developing production, improving management, and raising efficiency, and let the people have money in their pockets. This is a major matter which the party committees and governments at all levels should do. Gao Dezhan stressed in particular: Doing practical things for enterprises is also very important. Doing practical things for enterprises and the masses is an issue with two aspects. When enterprises are invigorating, the workers will become prosperous; when enterprises are not successfully managed, Tianjin will have no hope and the living standards of the broad masses of workers will be hard to improve. We should try by all possible means to invigorate enterprises. Well-managed enterprises should become more invigorating and difficult enterprises should have a turn for the better. Pertinent departments at all levels, departments dealing with comprehensive work, and administrative law-enforcing departments should further enhance the concept of serving enterprises, change functions, streamline organs, change work style, do practical things for enterprises on their own initiative, help them solve problems, provide timely help, change their operational mechanism, and create a good external environment for enterprises. Enterprises should also use reform as a motivation, strive to successfully readjust structure, develop products, strengthen management, conduct technological transformation, train workers, build leading bodies, deeply tap potential, and improve their own skills. Gao Dezhan stressed in conclusion: The masses are the foundation of society and enterprises are the foundation of the economy. As long as we exert utmost efforts to do practical things for the masses, try by all possible means to do practical things for enterprises, and rely on the strength and wisdom of the masses of people, we will surely make the work of Tianjin a success.
