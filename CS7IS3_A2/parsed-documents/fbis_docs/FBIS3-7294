The officials of Marubeni Corp. said the project brings together the Japanese firm and two Chinese state-run enterprises, China National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corp. and China International Trust and Investment Corp. Under the present plan, the three partners will engage in oil development in a concession to be acquired in the central part of Papua New Guinea to start commercial production within a few years, they said. China became an oil-importing nation last year due to strong demand for crude oil resulting from high-paced economic growth. The officials said full-scale production at the oil-rich Tarim Basin in northwestern China will not start in the current century. In the oil development in Papua New Guinea, they said sharing of investment estimated at 100 billion yen will be decided later. Most of the oil produced at the concession will be brought to China for domestic consumption but some of it will be sold overseas to earn foreign currency, they said.
