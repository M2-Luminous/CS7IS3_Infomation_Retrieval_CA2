"Only after knowing the election results can the MSZP think about (always assuming it is even in a position to) with whom to form a coalition," he added and cited four criteria for such a decision: Compatibility of party programs and an agreement on concrete government tasks for the first six months; consensus on the new government's composition and style; agreement to conclude a social pact; and partners' ability to create a constructive relationship with the opposition.
