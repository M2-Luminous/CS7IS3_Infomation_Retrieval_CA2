No doubt, the communique reads, such a reconciliation, in our opinion, should be sanctioned through the conclusion, as soon as possible, of a basic treaty between the two countries, a treaty that would confirm the current borders and would include mutual engagements in accordance with international norms regarding the insurance of the rights of national minorities. The PDSR believes that the national interests of Romania and Hungary require that the relations between the two countries should be freed from the bitter burden of the past, and the settlement of these relations should ensure security, territorial integrity, and the prosperity of the two neighboring nations, namely the Romanian and Hungarian nations. The communique also notes that not only the lessons of history, but also the current requirements of the European system direct us toward this goal. The normalization and development of Romanian- Hungarian relations would speed up the process of integration of the two countries in the Euro-Atlantic structures and would facilitate the success of democratic transformations, of reform, and of the transition to market economy in our countries. The communique also mentions that, as a matter of fact, the draft plan for stability in Europe proposed by France and adopted by the Group of 12, sets the act of finding bilateral solutions, through negotiations to possible problems that still exist among them, as a condition for a future integration with complete rights of our countries in the European Union, the way it is also suggested by NATO's Partnership for Peace. Therefore, the PDSR reaffirms its confidence that realistic forces in Romania and Hungry will succeed in bringing about the complete normalization and development of relations between them as soon as possible, including the conclusion of a basic treaty that will serve the interests of the two neighboring people and the cause of security and peace, the communique sent to us by the PDSR reads in conclusion.
