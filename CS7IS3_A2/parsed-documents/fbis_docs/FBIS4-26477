Speaking to reporters at the White House, Clinton minimized Tuesday's [21 June] plunge in the value of the dollars. "Let me just emphasize that the dollar as you know is traded in big multinational markets with other currencies and they go up and down," the President said. "But the fundamental economic realities in this country are very sound." He said the economy is growing, inflation is low and unemployment has dropped dramatically. "I think we just have to keep working on our fundamentals and in the end the markets will have to respond to economic realities of the American economy," Clinton said. The U.S. dollars had plunged to a post-World War Two low against the Japanese yen and the lowest level in more than a year against the German mark Tuesday. The Bank of Japan intervened today to slow the dollars's slide, but the German mark has retained its strength in international markets.
