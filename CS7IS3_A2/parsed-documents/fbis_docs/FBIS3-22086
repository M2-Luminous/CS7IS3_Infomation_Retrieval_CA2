Between the beginning of 1992 and the discovery of the drug consumers and dealers, the main culprits in Vienna and in Korneuburg district probably sold about 22.5 kg of cannabis resin at a price of 100 schillings per gram. Three suspects were arrested at least temporarily. A major ring of heroin dealers has been cracked by the Innsbruck police; eight people have been arrested so far. It has been proven that the suspects, who are between 18 and 24, have taken many "shopping trips" to Zurich. The suspects, most of whom are addicts, appear to have brought several kilos of heroin to Innsbruck and sold it there in 1992 and 1993.
