This is unquestionably an historic event, as was shown by the unprecedented number of foreign journalists and diplomats who attended the press conference given by Le Mai, Vietnamese deputy foreign minister. However, despite the significance of Clinton's decision, it aroused no undue euphoria in Vietnam. Deputy Minister Le Mai, who read out the Vietnamese Government statement, stressed that Vietnam welcomes this move, which it considers important and useful both for the peoples of the two countries and for the cause of peace in the region. Answering journalists' questions afterwards, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the lifting of the embargo will have no effect on the foreign policy doctrine of Vietnam, which advocates the development of relations with all countries in the interests of peace and cooperation. In other words, a cardinal shift of priorities is not on the cards. But Vietnam does have its priorities. After the collapse of the socialist community and the disintegration of the Soviet Union Vietnam turned firmly toward the Asia and Pacific region. Last year there was a perceptible economic rapprochement with the West European countries, too. Thus Vietnam's integration into the system of world economic cooperation has begun without any participation by the superpowers, one of which meanwhile lost that status while the other continued to maintain its anti-Vietnam embargo. When President Clinton asserts that the lifting of the embargo is dictated solely by a desire to speed up and complete the solution of the problem of Americans missing in action during the Indochina war, there is a definite element of craftiness in his words. The Vietnamese leadership has repeatedly stressed that the solution of this problem on Vietnam's part is purely humanitarian in character and has no political or economic motives. The search for the remains of the U.S. MIA's would have continued regardless of the lifting or extension of the embargo. In the opinion of many analysts the lifting of the embargo was dictated more by the economic interests of U.S. business, for whom Vietnam is the key to Indochina. The dynamic development of the Vietnamese economy, which is far from overheating, the pragmatism of that country's leadership, its great natural and human resources, and, most important, absolute political stability make Vietnam one of the most attractive targets for foreign investors today. Vietnam is available for cooperation with America. But it must be mutually beneficial cooperation, not one that is conditioned by any political requirements. I was told that by the leaders of Hanoi enterprises with whom I have talked in the past few days. They stressed that they are not expecting miracles from Washington. In the opinion of some Vietnamese directors it would be naive, not to say stupid, to change the economic priorities today. America is a superpower of course, my interlocutors said, but in the economic sphere there are other superpowers, such as Japan in Asia. There are also the new Asian "tigers," whose rapprochement with Vietnam is evident. In January the Japanese granted Vietnam a credit of 0.5 billion [currency not specified] on preferential terms and they are now first among its trading partners. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore are top of the list of foreign investors. The lifting of the U.S. embargo, in my view, demonstrates first and foremost the pragmatism of Washington politicians, who know how to listen to the opinions of their country's enterprises. U.S. business will now begin to try to secure a position in the promising Vietnamese market, even if it is somewhat late starting. It will bring its capital and technologies here for reasons that are far from philanthropic. But it is more advantageous for it to come to a still poor and backward Vietnam than to the vast expanses of a former superpower where, in the words of its president, the "idol of communism" has already been destroyed. U.S. businessmen are afraid of wreckers and prefer creators even if the latter have retained a loyalty to communist ideology. This, too, is one reason for the lifting of the anti-Vietnam embargo.
