At the ceremony, Hanchongnyon adopted a five-point programme -- opposition to outside forces, restoration of national sovereignty, democratisation of society, reunification through confederation and promotion of campus democracy. The students vowed to launch a movement of opposing the United States and ousting the "government" for the establishment of an independent democratic government and the reunification of the country. They also held ceremonies to inaugurate the National Reunification Committee and the Committee for the Promotion of Campus Autonomy. Prior to this, the students in groups of 300-400 held meetings on education, culture, health service and the press and marched downtown Kwangju, divided into regional federations of General Student Councils and conducted propaganda shouting "Scrap the 'National Security Law'" and "Stop to Nuclear War Scheme on Korean Peninsula." About 700 students of the agricultural college handed to the "American Cultural Center" in Kwangju 150 postcards declaring their "opposition to rice market opening." More than 50,000 students under Hanchongnyon held a rally in Kwangju Sunday for a probe into the truth of the May 18 incident and held a demonstration demanding the punishment of the traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. They condemned the sinister act of the United States in manipulating behind the scene the Kwangju massacre and strongly demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South Korea.
