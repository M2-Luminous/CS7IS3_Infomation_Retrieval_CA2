The letter says that the signing and ratification of such agreements would unequivocally signify Latvia's renunciation of the justified demands it has made so far for the speedy and complete withdrawal of Russia's armed forces, also incorporated in the resolutions of the United Nations Organization and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The letter emphasizes that both the assembly of Latvian local authorities and many political and public organizations have testified to their unwillingness to legalize the activity of the Skrunda radar station on the territory of the Republic of Latvia, and demand the maintenance in force of Latvia's demand hitherto for the withdrawal of the occupying troops without additional conditions. The deputies who signed the letter propose holding a referendum of Latvian citizens, simultaneously with the local government elections due on 29 May on their attitude to the operation of the Skrunda radar station in Latvia after 31 August this year, and call for the issue of concluding the treaty with Russia not to be debated before the collection of the referendum results. The letter is signed by 22 deputies of various factions in the Saeima, among them Maris Grinblats, the leader of For the Fatherland and Freedom; Aida Predele, the leader of the Christian Democrats; deputy Oskars Griks of the Peasants' Union; deputy Karlis Leiskalns of the Democratic Party; deputies Odisejs Kostanda, Eduards Berklavs, Aristids Lambergs, Andrejs Krastins of the Latvian National Independence Movement; and other deputies.
