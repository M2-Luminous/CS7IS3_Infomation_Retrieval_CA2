These events concern every honest person, the prime minister emphasized. Therefore, the Belarusian Government decided to issue this statement, he stressed. [Kebich] The Republic of Belarus is extremely concerned with the latest explosion in Sarajevo on 5 February, which increases the aggressiveness and escalates the tension of the conflict. The Republic of Belarus, as well as all mankind, condemns the forces who carried out this extremely cruel operation. Belarus thinks that such actions cannot be currently tolerated, especially as the issue of settling this crisis is the focus of attention of the United Nations, the EC, and other regional organizations as they look for political ways of settling the dispute. Under these conditions, Belarus was and is consistently and decisively adhering to nonforceful methods of alleviating the crisis. The resolution of this conflict can only be based on a thorough investigation and analysis of the events that occurred, on joint consultations under UN Security Council guidance and that of other regional international organizations. Under the increased tension, the involved parties should demonstrate extreme caution, political wisdom, and, to the greatest degree possible, restrain from military action. This policy will be the best option for the interests of all the states of Europe and the world. [Hladki] Then Vyacheslav Frantsevich added: [Kebich] We proceed from the thought that if the air strikes are carried out, this could actually divide not only Europe but the entire world as well. Moreover, we had a sour experience when World War I began with a similar conflict in the same region. Therefore, the Republic of Belarus considers that this conflict could be settled by peaceful methods. Even if these events have not been excited by someone else, they would not have happened at all. [sentence as heard] [Hladki] Participants in this meeting also discussed a political strike which is being prepared by certain political circles in Belarus. Though the Cabinet of Ministers has already published a statement on this issue, Vyacheslav Kebich stated: [Kebich] The strike, which is scheduled for 15 February, is of a purely political character. Its aim is to forcibly seize power by using the people. Many people have already sorted out this situation as to who heads this political action. Industrial trade unions have behaved correctly, because they understood the political character of this strike and [words indistinct]. I must say that this political action is carried by someone's very dirty hands. [Words indistinct] we try to do everything to avoid incidents. We know that the main aim of this political strike is to frustrate the government and trigger various incidents. However, this will not happen. Rumors of our readiness to use troops and special militia detachments are a simple provocation and a lie that are directed first and foremost against the government. I must say that I do not see any danger for the government [words indistinct]. The government is working and performing its functions. As for the measures to prevent the strike, they can only be legal.
