Available information indicates that the Israeli delegation, led by their foreign ministry's director general, discussed with the rebels a general plan of action in European countries and the United States designed to initiate exchanges between the rebels and members of the Sudanese opposition abroad focusing on ways of undermining the ruling regime in Sudan. You will recall that the rebels recently suffered a succession of defeats at the hands of the Sudanese Army. During the meeting, the Israeli Foreign Ministry's secretary general expressed Israel's willingness to give political and military assistance to the rebels. The two parties made arrangements for a delegation of the southern Sudanese rebels to visit Israel. The Israeli move comes against a backdrop of Egyptian-Sudanese differences. According to available information, Israel is enticing the southerners to take advantage of these differences by declaring the secession of the southern Sudan. Israel has promised to give major assistance to the rebels in their struggle against the Sudanese Army.
