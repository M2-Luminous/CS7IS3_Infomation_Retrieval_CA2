FR940525-2-00157 FR940525-2-00080 [Release No. 34&hyph;34080; File No. SR&hyph;DGOC&hyph;94&hyph;02] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Definition of ``Trading Limit'' May 18, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 1 of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on April 22, April 28, and May 9, 1994, the Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DGOC&hyph;94&hyph;02) as described in Items, I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by DGOC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organizations Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change DGOC is proposing to amend the definition of ``trading limit'' found in Section 101 (Definitions) of Article I (Definitions) of its Procedures and to make a conforming change to Section 204 (Trading Limits) of Article II (Participation) of its Procedures. II. Self-regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, DGOC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. DGOC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purposes of, and Statutory Basis for, the proposed Rule Changes The purpose of the proposed rule change is to clarify that each participant's trading limit means the limit prescribed from time to time for that participant on the aggregate incremental margin that the participant may owe on a particular day with respect to its short positions and the settlement of exercised options. 2 The proposal also makes conforming changes to clarify that each participant's trading limit is revised from time to time. 3 2 DGOC Procedures, Article I, Section 101. 3 DGOC Procedures, Article II, Section 204. DGOC states that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act 4 and the rules thereunder. In particular, Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act 5 requires that a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. DGOC states that the proposed rule change will enable DGOC to control risk better, to provide greater flexibility to its participants, and to permit more utilization of DGOC and thereby the national clearance and settlement system for trading in options. 4 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). 5 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements on Burden on Competition DGOC believes that no burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others DGOC neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) (i) of the Act 6 and subparagraph (e)(1) Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder 7 because it constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 6 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(i) (1988). 7 17 CRF 204.19b&hyph;4(e)(1) (1993).
