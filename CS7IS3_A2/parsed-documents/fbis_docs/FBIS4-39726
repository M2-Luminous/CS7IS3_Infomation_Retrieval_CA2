"I don't consider it possible that Mart Laar would be a minister in my government," Nugis said. But, he said, adding a mellow tone, Mart Laar is a young man for whom the heights of life are still ahead. "I still think that when the current government is replaced, Laar will not be lost for Estonia as a politician," Nugis said. He mentioned that a place for Laar could be found in one of the country's future governments. The parliament chairman said that if the president now proposes to him to set up a new Cabinet, it is possible that he will include the rest of the current ministers in his Cabinet list. "To become a prime minister is not my ultimate goal, but it is a means with which I wish to resolve the government crisis that has energed in Estonia and avoid splitting of Pro Patria," Nugis said at a press conference today. "Fellow members from the Republican faction of Pro Patria have made a proposal to me to stand as candidate for the post of Pro Patria chairman and, as a prime minister candidate, take upon myself the formation of a new government," Nugis said in his personal written statement released today. "Let my personal feelings be left aside at this point, but I take the proposal made by the Republicans as a task from persons with whom I share views," he said, adding that shirking responsibility could only be interpreted as an act of treachery to his ideals. Nugis said a notion had emerged in the parliament that a government under Mart Laar cannot continue in power. In his words the parliament is ready to fail the current government in a confidence vote regardless of the outcome of the Pro Patria congress. He said this was also the position of the governing coalition. When asked how he could be so sure about this, Nugis said that he as the speaker of the parliament knows well his fellow MP's. Article 97 of the Estonian Constitution gives the president the right to call a new general election at the government's proposal within three days after a vote of no-confidence in the government or the prime minister. Observers say it is in Nugis' interests that no such proposal would come from the current government, as this would add uncertainty to his prospects of becoming prime minister.
