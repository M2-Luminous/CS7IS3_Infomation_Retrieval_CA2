The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries an 800-word editorial entitled: "We Should Take a Firm Stance Against the North's Shirking." The editorial denounces North Korea for "gesturing as if it hopes to settle the issue for the envoy exchange" and "easing up on its four key demands while not agreeing to the envoy exchange." The editorial insists, in return, "there should be no more tolerance nor magnanimity toward the North." The editorial calls on the ROK and U.S. Governments to "firmly express their will to put off indefinitely the U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, set for 21 March, and to push ahead with a plan to resume the Team Spirit exercise. " Pointing out that the North issued a fresh demand that the two sides jointly announce an "agreement on the principle of the exchange of special envoys" before discussing procedural matters for the exchange, the editorial reports that "Pyongyang attempts to use this as overseas publicity that it has fulfilled the precondition of `the envoy exchange,' while neglecting to putting this into practice." The editorial concludes that "even if the North may use the same old trick of placing blame on the South, it is about time for us to inform the North side the South is discontinuing meaningless working-level contacts." The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries an 800-word editorial entitled "North Korea's True Intent is Imaginable." Terming North Korea's intent of holding working-level contacts with the ROK a "meaningless show" designed to realize the high-level talks with the United States, the editorial questions if working-level contacts are indeed necessary under such circumstances. Making a detailed analysis of North Korea's proposal that Seoul's envoy should visit Pyongyang first around mid-April, the editorial reports "after all, as Kim Il-song's birthday is 15 April, the North intends to reduce the envoy's mission to mere participation in Kim Il-song birthday celebrations and one of a congratulatory delegate." With the failure to conclude discussions on the envoy exchange, the editorial forecasts chances that the two sides will exchange envoys before 21 March deadline have dimmed, though are not completely dead. Then the editorial calls on the ROK side to "deeply examine the issue on suspending the contacts" to further avoid being ridiculed by Pyongyang and "to manifest clearly to Pyongyang that our side can never accept the envoy exchange through its insincere show or for the purpose of its political celebration." The editorial concludes: "The ROK and U.S. Governments should demonstrate a solid bilateral alliance and their positive interest in inter-Korean contacts." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean on page 3 carries an 800-word editorial entitled: "We Should Properly Read the North's True Intent." The editorial deplores that the ROK Government has committed two mistakes from the start of contacts: First, "its failure to commit in writing to the envoy exchange in the North Korean-U.S. agreement"; and second, its failure "to materialize ROK-North Korean-U.S. tripartite talks to discuss the North's nuclear issue and inter-Korean issues." The editorial contends: "This notwithstanding, the government is optimistic about the North-South dialogues without any reason." Stating that the North's basic policy toward unification has not changed a bit, the editorial calls on the government to "answer Pyongyang with firm principles by reading Pyongyang's true intent and avoid being caught in a trap set by the North." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on page 3 carries a 700-word article by Kang Tae-ho on chances for the simultaneous realization of the envoy exchange and the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. The article appraises Pyongyang for showing flexibility by its backing down on the four preconditions it had set for the envoy exchange. Quoting the Chief ROK delegate Song Yong-tae's remark that "North Korea has expressed its intention that the four issues can be discussed in the process of exchanging envoys. This can be interpreted as a virtual withdrawal of the four preconditions," the article assesses such a stance of the North as a step forward to the envoy exchange. Calculating each side's loss and gain from the sixth round of contacts, the editorial notes "the North gained the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit whereas the ROK and U.S. sides have attained International Atomic Energy Agency inspection of the North's nuclear facilities." The article concludes: "Based on this, it is possible that the tripartite parties will agree to the envoy exchange simultaneously with the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks."
