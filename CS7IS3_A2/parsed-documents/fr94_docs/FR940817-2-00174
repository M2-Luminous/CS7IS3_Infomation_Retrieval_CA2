ACTION: Notice of amended routine uses for NLRB system of records NLRB&hyph;19, Telephone Call Detail Records. SUMMARY: This notice amends the language of three routine uses in the NLRB Privacy Act system of records NLRB&hyph;19, Telephone Call Detail Records. The three amended routine uses narrow the existing routine uses to specify more exactly the information that may be disclosed. EFFECTIVE DATE: The amended routine uses will become effective without further notice 30 days from the date of this publication (September 16, 1994), unless comments are received on or before that date which result in a contrary determination. ADDRESSES: Written comments on the amended routine uses may be submitted to the Executive Secretary, National Labor Relations Board, 1099 Fourteenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20570&hyph;0001. Copies of all comments received will be available for inspection between 8:30 and 5 pm in room 11600. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John C. Truesdale, Executive Secretary, National Labor Relations Board, room 11600, 1099 Fourteenth Street NW., Washington, DC 20570&hyph;0001. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to subsection (e)(11) of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the National Labor Relations Board is publishing a notice revising existing routine uses Nos. 1, 3, and 8 in its system of records NLRB&hyph;19, Telephone Call Detail Records. The system notice of NLRB&hyph;19 was last published in its entirety in 58 FR 50957 on September 29, 1993. As amended, routine use No. 1 will specify that on disclosure to an inquiring congressional office, the subject individual must be the constituent about whom the records are maintained. The other two amended routine uses Nos. 3 and 8 respectively will narrow the existing routine uses to specify more exactly the information that may be disclosed to a court or an adjudicative body in the course of presenting evidence or argument, including disclosure to opposing counsel or witnesses in the course of civil discovery, and to an inquiring Federal authority for hiring or retention of an employee. A report of this notice to amend the three routine uses in NLRB&hyph;19, Telephone Call Detail Records was filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) with the Office of Management and Budget and with Congress. The specific changes to the notice being amended (58 FR 50957, September 29, 1993) are set forth below. By direction of the Board. Dated: Washington, DC, August 11, 1994. John C. Truesdale, Executive Secretary. NLRB&hyph;19 System name: Telephone Call Detail Records. * * * * * Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and the purposes of such uses: 1. A Member of Congress or to a Congressional staff member in response to an inquiry of the Congressional office made at the written request of the constituent about whom the record is maintained. * * * * * 3. A court, a magistrate, administrative tribunal, or other adjudicatory body in the course of presenting evidence or argument, including disclosure to opposing counsel or witnesses in the course of civil discovery, litigation, or settlement negotiations, or in connection with criminal law proceedings, when: (a) The NLRB or any component thereof; or (b) any employee of the NLRB in his or her official capacity; or (c) any employee of the NLRB in his or her individual capacity where the NLRB has agreed to represent the employee; or (d) the United States Government, is a party to litigation or has interest in such litigation, and determines that such disclosure is relevant and necessary to the litigation and that the use of such records is therefore deemed by the NLRB to be for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which the records were collected. * * * * * 8. A Federal authority, in response to its request, that this system of records contains information relevant to the hiring or retention of an employee, the issuance or retention of a security clearance, the letting of a contract, or the issuance or retention of a license, grant, or other benefit. The other agency or licensing organization, however, may then make a request supported by the written consent of the individual for the entire record if it so chooses. No disclosure will be made unless the information has been determined to be sufficiently reliable to support a referral to another office within the NLRB or to another Federal agency for criminal, civil, administrative, personnel, or regulatory action. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20217 Filed 8&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7545&hyph;01&hyph;M
