The Interior Ministry of the royal government had asked all DKP officials to leave the capital before June 19 for security reasons, but notified them of the request as late as 6:30 PM of June 17. The DKP representative office agreed to the request on June 18 morning, but failed to get the visas as the Thai Embassy was closed as usual at weekends. The DKP people are expected to return to their base area via Thailand. Informed of their trouble, King Norodom Sihanouk instructed the Royal Palace Office and the government to arrange the DKP's departure well, and the Interior Ministry granted the officials a one-day delay. There was no demonstration against the DKP here in the past two days as the royal government had claimed to be fearing of. One news source said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivudh, secretary-general of the FUNCINPEC party, said his party took exception to the government decision to expel the DKP office from Phnom Penh.
