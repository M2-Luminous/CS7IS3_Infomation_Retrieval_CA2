The brother president was apprised of the progress of the committee's work, and of the outcome of its field activities. He was also briefed on the positive and gladdening results it has achieved in terms of ending military escalation and making preparations for the implementation of the military provisions enshrined in the accord document. During the meeting, agreement was reached on a timetable for the withdrawal of Armed Forces units from contact lines to the pre- crisis positions they occupied before 19 August 1993, beginning with the western area in Bab el Mandeb, the central axis, and up to the eastern axis of Shabwah, Ma'rib, Hadramaut, and al-Mahrah, in implementation of the provisions enshrined in the accord document, and within the context of the authorization document the Joint Military Committee has received. The authorization document was signed by the brother Presidential Council chairman, who is the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, and the brother vice president. This agreement is meant to spare our Yemeni people any bloody armed conflicts that could put the homeland and its unity in jeopardy. It is also designed to thwart the efforts of warmongers, advocates of secession, the enemies of unity and democracy, and all enemies of the Yemeni homeland. Similarly, it is meant to defeat all attempts to undermine the homeland's security and stability and push our country into the furnace of a destructive war. This agreement also seeks to frustrate the endeavors of those who, while engaged in oneupmanship, seek to capitalize on national issues at the expense of the people, promote selfish and parochial interests, build personal glories at the expense of the homeland's higher interests, and return our people to the period that preceded 22 May 1990. The brother president and supreme commander of the Armed Forces asserted his constant support for the Military Committee's work. He indicated that he instructed the commands of both the Ministry of Defense and the Army General Staff to provide all possible facilities and extend every possible assistance to the committee to enable it to accomplish its mission, halt and eliminate all effects of the military escalation, and supervise the withdrawal of all units to their pre-crisis positions. He underlined the need for all to commit themselves to national constants, and also to the provisions enshrined in the accord document. He also underscored the importance of the speedy implementation of the provisions enshrined in the accord document without any delay or procrastination. Salih emphasized that our Yemeni people will not condone any circumvention of the document or any encroachment on their national gains, especially unity and democracy. He called on all the political and righteous forces in Yemen and all our people to cooperate effectively with the armed and security forces to help them carry out their sacred national duties in defending the country's sovereignty and independence and in pooling efforts to build the 22 May Homeland [reference to the 1990 Yemen unity date] on firm and strong basis and in a spirit of national responsibility. The brother president said that the armed and security forces belong to the people. They are the walls of the homeland and its impregnable fortress. They will never be a tool to destroy the country and its gains or a means of oppression, terror, and domination for the sake of a group whose only care is to ensure its remaining in power; a group which rejects submission to people's desire and opposes democracy and the principle of peaceful exchange of power.
