FBIS4-28616 "dreas113_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-113 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 South Korea Seoul, Japan, U.S. Agree on Phased Sanctions Seoul, Japan, U.S. Agree on Phased Sanctions SK1106090494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0855 GMT 11 Jun 94 SK1106090494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, Japan and the United States agreed through chain talks Saturday to seek phased U.N. sanctions against North Korea. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and concluded that sanctions are inevitable now when the opportunity for measurements from North Korea's nuclear reactor is damaged, ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. Kakizawa, agreeing with Han that close Seoul-Tokyo-Washington cooperation is necessary in dealing with the North Korean situation, made clear that his country will take responsible actions "within limits of the Japanese Constitution" when the U.N. Security Council decides to act, Chang said. The two foreign ministers also agreed that China's role is critical in solving the North Korean nuclear problem. Kakizawa said he plans to seek Beijing's active influence when he meets Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during his China visit. Kakizawa, moreover, pledged his government's efforts to have the G-7 summit next month declare its firm will to deter North Korea's nuclear development, Chang said. He apologized for former Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's controversial remarks about Tokyo's responsibilities for World War II, saying it was "extremely regrettable" to have hurt the feelings of the Korean people. Kakizawa and Tarnoff had flown in over the weekend for key talks on the North Korean nuclear controversy, on its collision course with the U.N. after Pyongyang refused demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to have its nuclear reactor fuel rods measured by the agency. Foreign Minister Han met earlier in the day with Tarnoff and explained President Kim Yong-sam's trip to Russia this month and his talks with U.N. and Chinese officials, the spokesman said. Tarnoff had flown in from Tokyo and briefed Han on what he discussed with Japanese officials. Han and Tarnoff exchanged views on upcoming Seoul-Pyongyang visits by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter next week and agreed that the visit should be used as an opportunity to relay firm will of the international community to North Korea. They both evaluated the Friday's IAEA resolution as a reflection of the hardline stance of the global community regarding the North Korean nuclear situation, Chang said.
