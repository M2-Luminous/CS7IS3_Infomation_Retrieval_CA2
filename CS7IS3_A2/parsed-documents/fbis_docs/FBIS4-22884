The data used in the study were gathered from dozens of launches. Long-lasting artificial ionospheric disturbances recorded by vertical sounding were discussed first. A series of 46 ionograms taken from an ionospheric station located in Karaganda, Kazakhstan, revealed that additional and unusual tracks appeared on the ionograms after a launch, and the relative frequency, quantity, and duration of the tracks depended on the time of year and the time of day. It was emphasized that, as a rule, the additional reflections only appeared during daylight hours. An explanation was provided for the absence of the additional tracks at night, and it was concluded that no long-lasting positive deviations of the electron concentration from background levels were detected. The causes of negative disturbances in the electron concentration were then addressed. The ionograms recorded in this part of the study looked very much like those obtained when the ionosphere is modified by chemical agents. The second part of the paper discussed the use of short-wave Doppler inclined sounding of artificial ionospheric disturbances. The short-wave signals were transmitted in unmodulated carrier mode by broadcast transmitters. The signal parameters were recorded simultaneously on up to eight frequencies on a synthesizer-type receiver located in Tomsk. The signals of the second intermediate frequency were mixed with a reference signal with the same frequency plus a base frequency component of several hertz (e.g., 215 kHz + _D_F). The characteristics of the disturbances and the dynamics of their development were described, illustrated, and mathematically modelled. The results of the ionogram study were fundamentally consistent with the results of the inclined sounding study. Figures 5, tables 1; references 27: 19 Russian, 8 Western.
