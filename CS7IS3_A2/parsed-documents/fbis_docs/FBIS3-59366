Necessity To Popularize Use of EDI Customs Clearance System in China Right now, China's practice in reforming its economic structure and gradually forming the pattern to open up to the world in all directions has doubled the amount of supervisory work of China's Customs. The increasing number of preferential policies for various regions and lines of business has made the work of the customs even more complicated and further delayed the procedure of customs clearance. According to statistics compiled, the total value of China's imports and exports increased by 398 percent; the total volume of imported and exported cargo rose by 281 percent; the amount of customs duties collected increased by 441 percent; the amount of tax collected or levied on behalf of other departments rose by 2,747 percent; and the number of applications to pass goods through the customs increased by 398 percent during the ten years between 1982 and 1992. In order to keep pace with these changes, we must make things easy for the exporters and importers to legally pass goods through the customs, while strengthening our control. This will not work by relying on the manpower alone. We must depend on other means of advanced science and technology to quicken the pace for customs clearance. The customs offices in various localities have adopted some measures such as the system of red and green passages for cargo clearance, the use of different measures for screening, checking and releasing goods for imports and exports under different conditions and the utilization of subsequent centralized customs declaration. The EDI customs clearance system is able to effectively provide the technical support in the implementation of these measures and make things convenient for the declarant. Specific Contents of EDI Customs Clearance System China's EDI customs clearance system is aimed at utilizing EDI technology to automatically exchange and process forms and documents for customs clearance, and make full use of the customs computer system to timely and automatically complete the entire customs clearance procedure between the customs and the declarant. According to Director Yang Guoxun, the establishment of this system involves the design of software for the EDI customs clearance procedure, the purchase and installation of mainframe computers and a network, the setup of the organization in charge of the EDI customs clearance system, the improvement of the EDI customs clearance system and its relevant rules and regulations and the standardization of relevant forms and documents. The EDI customs clearance system consists of clearance of goods, supervision and control, taxation and release of goods. With the customs as the center, this EDI customs clearance system deals with declarant, banks, warehouses and transportation units; and automatically processes and examines declaration forms, levies taxes and releases goods. The development of the EDI customs clearance system is mainly aimed at achieving automation and standardization, and at completing the entire customs clearance procedure with speed and in strict accordance with regulations. In many cases, there is no need for the declarant to send people to the customs office to apply for customs clearance in person. The customs office only needs to stress the essential points in checking declaration forms, levying taxes and checking and releasing goods. It may further simplify the customs clearance procedure and let the EDI customs clearance system automatically handle the arduous administrative work. Prospects and Plans for Development of EDI Customs Clearance System Since the 1980's, some developed Western nations have adopted the EDI form in doing trading. They have also adopted the EDI system in their customs offices. For example, the U.S. Customs adopted the EDI form for customs clearance in 1992. The British Customs has established a complete administrative information system. In 1992, 90 percent of the 13.5 million customs declaration forms in Britain were processed by the EDI system. At the end of 1992, 96 percent of the customs declaration forms in Australia were processed by the automatic customs clearance system, of which 90 percent of the forms were processed and goods released automatically by EDI technology. The methods, measures and experiences of the customs offices of these countries have provided China's Customs with important data to develop its EDI customs clearance system. In the development of the EDI customs clearance system, China's Customs has designated 1993-1994 as an experimental stage, during which the relevant customs clearance system will be mainly revised, the use of EDI in filing applications to pass goods through the customs be permitted and preparations for the establishment and improvement of this system be made. It has designated 1997-1998 as a stage of popularization, during which it will promote the use of the EDI system. China's Customs will closely cooperate with all functional departments and help coordinate their actions to recommend the use of the EDI customs clearance system and let "paper-free trading" become a reality in our country.
