FR940128-2-00214 FR940128-2-00137 NRC has defined the term ``overall treatment period'' in the Statement of Considerations for the QMP rule (56 FR 34104). According to the Statement of Considerations, ``the phrase `overall treatment period' was added to emphasize that the treatments will end after the specified number of weeks, unless the treatment period is revised by the authorized user prior to continuing.'' Therefore, the treatment period is a unit of time and not the number of fractions as used in the licensee's definition. The licensee argues that three different individuals (the authorized user and two radiation therapists) attempted to verify that the treatment to be delivered was in accordance with the written directive, and that the failure to identify the error was related to the working of the written directive rather than a failure to follow proper procedure. However, the same authorized user had created the written directive that same afternoon. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that his failure to identify the error was related to the wording of his own written directive. The licensee's QMP procedure required that the authorized user review and initial the treatment chart to verify that he had reviewed the written prescription and the calculated dose per fraction. As noted in the inspection report, the information written on the patient chart clearly indicated that the dose per fraction was incorrect. It appears that the authorized user initialed the chart and that his review was cursory or inadequate. Moreover, the violation focuses on the fact that, while the licensee's QMP requires that a physics staff member review the accuracy of all dosimetric calculations for treatments that are delivered in four or more fractions, it has no equivalent provision for treatments that are delivered in less than four fractions. Had such an independent review been required by the Licensee's QMP and performed in this case, the error could have been avoided. The Licensee's QMP waived review of dose calculations by the physics staff member for extenuating circumstances such as staff shortages and emergency treatments. Neither the QMP regulations nor the accompanying regulatory guide suggest that this independent review may be waived for staff shortages or emergent treatments, such as those that must be performed after working hours. A footnote to 10 CFR 35.32(a)(1) states, ``if, because of the emergent nature of the patient's medical condition, a delay in order to provide a written directive would jeopardize the patient's health, an oral directive will be acceptable, provided that the information contained in the oral directive is documented immediately in the patient's record and a written directive is prepared within 24 hours of the oral directive.'' Neither 10 CFR 35.32(a) nor the footnote permit the waiving of the independent review of the dosimetric calculations due to the emergent nature of a treatment. The independent verification is especially important during times when the licensee is more subject to error such as with staff shortages and emergent treatments. Based on the above, the NRC concludes that the violation did occur as stated, and that there was not an adequate basis for a reduction of the severity level. Summary of Licensee's Request for Mitigation 1. Identification The licensee asserts that the NRC improperly takes credit for identifying the proposed violation of the QMP because the QMP was submitted to the NRC approximately 1.5 years ago in accordance with 10 CFR 35.32(f)(2); and, since that submission, the licensee has received no indication that the QMP was deficient. According to the licensee, the ``less than four treatment'' deficiency was detected concurrently by the NRC and the licensee as a result of this misadministration; and therefore, escalation of enforcement based on the NRC's claim of identifying the deficiency is inappropriate. 2. Licensee Performance The licensee asserts that the NRC improperly escalated the base civil penalty by 100 percent for ``poor past performance'' and notes that this was apparently due to a misadministration which occurred in May of 1990, some 2.5 years before the most recent one. According to the licensee, while the NRC claims that these two misadministrations were ``similar'', the only similarities were that they were both brain treatments and the dose per fraction was doubled. The licensee notes that the dissimilarities include an emergency treatment versus treatment during normal working hours, a short-term versus a more conventional long-term treatment, and a single port treatment versus a multiple port treatment. According to the licensee, there appears to be no relationship between the causes of the two misadministrations. The licensee indicates that this escalation implies that the NRC's sole evaluation of past performance relates to the number of misadministrations which have occurred and been reported over an undefined period of time. The licensee points out that the May 1990 misadministration was discovered through its QA/QCP and, until January of 1992, most licensees were not required to have any type of QMP; therefore, comparing the licensee's performance to that of other licensees in not appropriate (i.e., other licensees may have had misadministrations which went undetected due to the fact that they had no QMP). The licensee asserts that while a QMP helps reduce the possibility of misadministrations, normal statistical probabilities would predict that the potential for misadministrations will increase with the number of patient treatments due to human error. In the licensee's particular instance, its Radiation Oncology Department treated approximately 1418 patients including some 52,000 separate treatments with external beam therapy during the time interval between the two misadministrations. Five hundred and eighteen (518) of those patients (approximately 15,000 separate treatments) were specifically treated with cobalt-60 teletherapy. According to the licensee, one patient with two ports in error is a very small percentage of the overall number of treatments and should not be sufficient to escalate a civil penalty based upon ``poor past performance.''
