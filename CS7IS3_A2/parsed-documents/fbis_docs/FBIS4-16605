This meeting was preceded by a joint meeting of the foreign ministers of the CIS Republics. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov represented our state for the signing of important documents. Our reporter, Beshir Sherifov, interviewed Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov after the meeting. [Begin recording] [Sherifov] You took part in the meeting of the foreign ministers of the CIS countries. What issues of interest to Azerbaijan were discussed at this meeting? [Gasanov] I want to express my views primarily on two documents: One was on ethnic minorities, and the other on the sovereignty of the states. The document on ethnic minorities was put forward by other states. This was the third time that it was being discussed, and for the third time we objected to its adoption. The reason for our objection was that this document included provisions that had supremacy over Azerbaijani laws. In expressing our position, we said that we cannot sign any provisions found in this or any other document that are above Azerbaijani laws. [Sherifov] That is, the Azerbaijani laws must be confirmed in all these documents. [Gasanov] Of course. That is the only thing possible. Other states too were of the same opinion. Therefore, the work on this [Armenian] document is continuing, but it was not endorsed for the time being. Its sponsors had hoped that it was to have been endorsed today. We made the first move. The second important document concerning us is this one that I am holding. [word indistinct] signed and brought it to me. Azerbaijan is the sponsor of this document. Because it is in Russian, I will read it in Russian; it could be translated later if need be. [passage omitted] We are the sponsors of this document. This is the first time that such a document has been adopted, despite the fact that the CIS has been in existence for the last three years. No such document had ever been submitted here. When we first submitted it they initially received it coldly. But we held intensive consultations both during the joint talks and bilateral talks at presidential, ministerial, and lower levels. And finally, this document was endorsed with great difficulty because the Armenian foreign minister expressed strong opposition to it, but we firmly demanded the adoption of this document. I can state that 11 states supported us and this document was endorsed. [Sherifov] What was its main thrust? [Gasanov] The main focus was explained in its preface. All of the provisions needed by us were in there. Such as that no state can occupy the territory of another state, covet another's land, borders cannot be altered, the alteration of borders by war cannot be described in any other way than what it is, a political status cannot be demanded by war, and so on. Due to a lack of time, we cannot analyze it but we have established its nature. The Armenians said they will not sign it. They made a reservation noting that alongside this document another document should also be adopted recognizing self-determination for any people. They distributed the document. We have a copy, we read it. It was a document incompatible with international norms. Despite the fact that the Armenian foreign minister several times strongly urged its discussion during yesterday's meeting, it was never examined. [Sherifov] Besides ours, what was the position of the other states? [Gasanov] It was identical to ours. All the representatives of the 11 countries voted as one person for this [Azerbaijani] document. These 11 states did not give any importance to that [Armenian] document. There is a regulation at the CIS foreign ministerial meeting that if any proposal is submitted with which we were previously unfamiliar then a special working group is formed and is asked to study it and submit it to the next meeting. Not even a working group was formed on the Armenian document. They might submit it again the next time around. That is a problem for the future, but for now, it was not adopted. Meanwhile, we have endorsed and signed this [Azerbaijani] document, and we have submitted it to other CIS heads of state to enable them to study it the next few days. I am certain that the document will be signed. [end recording]
