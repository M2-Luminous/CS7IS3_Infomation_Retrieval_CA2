That is why the road to Brussels today is so long and so arduous. Ever since 1905 Norway has been close to Great Britain in foreign policy philosophy. Two world wars and a joint battle against a Nazi Europe in 1940-45 joined the Britons and the Norwegians. As a result it was a major break with custom when the Britons in 1972 went into the EC (albeit backwards) while Norwegian voters chose to remain on the outside. [passage omitted] What is interesting about Norway is that once the Danes and the Britons bid farewell and disappeared into the EC, we needed other countries to be travel guides towards the EC/EU [European Union]. The Swedes declared their intent to apply (in passing) in October 1990 when they unveiled a drastic economic crisis program that spelled the end of the "Swedish model." It was no longer possible to continue to extend and extend the welfare state, East Europe did not want to choose the Swedish "third way" between capitalism and communism, and Sweden wound up placing its bets on Europe both politically and industrially. With increased unemployment, a debt crisis, and devaluation the country was highly motivated economically. The Finns were close behind. Less than 100 days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a Finnish application for EC membership was on the table in Brussels. That was March 1992. Finland entered by the "window of opportunity" to become a member of the greater European family. The Finns had, and have, their very strong reasons. Oil-rich Norway has not been under any strong economic pressure to become a member, as the Swedes and the Danes have been, nor do they have the same security threat overshadowing them as the Finns have. As a result such values as the meaning of life, Norway, and the world gain in importance. And this is where we notice that Norway has lacked that sense of European citizenship that has been a driving force among the countries of the continent. It is a broad citizenship that sees itself as part of a larger Europe through family tradition and the pursuit of profession, extending beyond the national and the regional. This sense of citizenship we know in Norway primarily from the centuries-old tradition of Danish senior civil servants [in Norway]. This indoctrination of European thought patterns was very important for Norway, but the ranks of senior civil servants were never large and for a long time these persons were not regarded as 100-percent Norwegians. It is only in the very last years that historians are looking at the 400-year "night" with the Danes with new eyes. Now they are saying that it "was a good night." Norway's deep-rooted Euroskepticism was seen perhaps the most clearly when in 1929 French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand unveiled a plan for a European union. In the League of Nations, Norway took a strong stance against such "group arrangements," preferring to escape into nonbinding support for a "universal coalition of all the world's nations." [passage omitted] The skepticism is seen all through and beyond the war years when thoughts of European integration once again arose in conjunction with initial doubts about the Marshall Plan. It even made British Finance Minister Hugh Dalton ask in 1947 whether Norway really belongs in West Europe. "The Norwegian people are...skeptical to integration plans...with the Mediterranean countries," Foreign Minister Halvard Lange said two years later, after Norway had joined NATO. [Fisheries Minister] Jan Henry T. Olsen today has to do battle not only with the Mediterranean countries with regard to "not one fish," but also with the modern tradition of Norwegians mentally distancing themselves from the rest of Europe.
