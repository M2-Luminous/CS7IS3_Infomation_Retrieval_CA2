ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management is issuing interim regulations to abolish the Federal Wage System special wage schedule for printing positions in the Detroit, Michigan, wage area. Printing and lithographic employees in Detroit will now be paid rates from the regular Detroit, Michigan, wage schedule. DATES: This interim rule becomes effective on November 2, 1994. Comments must be received by December 2, 1994. Employees paid rates from the Detroit, Michigan, special wage schedule for printing positions will continue to be paid from that schedule until their conversion to the regular Detroit, Michigan, wage schedule effective on the first day of the first full pay period beginning on or after November 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver comments to Donald J. Winstead, Acting Assistant Director for Compensation Policy, Personnel Systems and Oversight Group, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Room 6H31, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Shields, (202) 606&hyph;2848. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Defense recommended to the Office of Personnel Management that the Detroit, Michigan, Printing and Lithographic wage schedule be abolished and that the regular Detroit, Michigan, wage schedule apply to printing employees in Detroit. This recommendation was based on the fact that the Detroit special printing wage survey would produce special schedule rates lower than the regular schedule rates for the area. Because regulations provide that the special printing schedule rates may not be lower than the regular schedule rates for an area, special printing schedule rates for Detroit are currently based on the Detroit regular wage schedule rates. In addition, the Detroit special printing wage survey has become impractical due to the declining number of printing and lithographic employees available to serve as data collectors in the Detroit wage area. There are only nine covered employees. No employee's wage rate will be reduced upon conversion to the regular schedule. The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee has reviewed this recommendation and by consensus has recommended approval. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking. Also, pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for making this rule effective in less than 30 days. The notice is being waived and the regulation is being made effective in less than 30 days because preparations for the January 1995 Detroit survey must begin immediately. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect only Federal agencies and employees. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Review This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with Executive Order 12866.
