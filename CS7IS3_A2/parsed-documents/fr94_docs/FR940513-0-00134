The term ``general service fluorescent lamp'' means fluorescent lamps that can be used to satisfy the majority of fluorescent applications. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(B) (West Supp. 1993). The definition specifically excludes fluorescent lamps designed and marketed for specific lighting applications. 38 38 The exclusions are: (i) Fluorescent lamps designed to promote plant growth; (ii) fluorescent lamps specifically designed for cold temperature installations; (iii) colored fluorescent lamps; (iv) impact-resistant fluorescent lamps; (v) reflectorized or aperture fluorescent lamps; (vi) fluorescent lamps designed for use in reprographic equipment; (vii) fluorescent lamps primarily designed to produce radiation in the ultra-violet region of the spectrum; and (viii) fluorescent lamps with a color rendering index of 82 or greater. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(B)(i)&hyph;(viii) (West Supp. 1993). 2. General Service Incandescent Lamps The term ``incandescent lamp'' means a lamp in which light is produced by a filament heated to incandescence by an electric current. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(C) (West Supp. 1993). The definition includes only the following incandescent lamps: (i) Any lamp (commonly referred to as lower wattage nonreflector general service lamps, including any tungsten-halogen lamp) that has a rated wattage between 30 and 199 watts, has an E26 medium screw base, has a rated voltage or voltage range that lies at least partially within 115 and 130 volts, and is not a reflector lamp. (ii) Any lamp (commonly referred to as a reflector lamp) which is not colored or designed for rough or vibration service applications, that contains an inner reflective coating on the outer bulb to direct the light, an R, PAR, or similar bulb shapes (excluding ER or BR) with E26 medium screw bases, a rated voltage or voltage range that lies at least partially within 115 and 130 volts, a diameter which exceeds 2.75 inches, and is either_ (I) A low(er) wattage reflector lamp which has a rated wattage between 40 and 205 watts; or (II) A high(er) wattage reflector lamp which has a rated wattage above 205 watts. (iii) Any general service incandescent lamp (commonly referred to as a high- or higher-wattage lamp) that has a rated wattage above 199 watts (above 205 watts for a high wattage reflector lamp). 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(C)(i)&hyph;(iii) (West Supp. 1993). The term ``general service incandescent lamp'' means any incandescent lamp (other than a miniature or photographic lamp) that has an E26 medium screw base, a rated voltage range at least partially within 115 and 130 volts, and which can be used to satisfy the majority of lighting applications. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(D) (West Supp. 1993). The definition specifically excludes incandescent lamps designed and marketed for specific lighting applications. 39 Included within the category of ``general service incandescent lamps'' are incandescent reflector lamps. The term ``incandescent reflector lamp'' means a lamp described in item (ii), above. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(F) (West Supp. 1993). 39 EPCA excludes any ``general service incandescent lamp'' specifically designed for: (i) Traffic signal, or street lighting service; (ii) airway, airport, aircraft, or other aviation service; (iii) marine or marine signal service; (iv) photo, projection, sound reproduction, or film viewer service; (v) stage, studio, or television service; (vi) mill, saw mill, or other industrial process service; (vii) mine service; (viii) headlight, locomotive, street railway, or other transportation service; (ix) heating service; (x) code beacon, marine signal, lighthouse, reprographic, or other communication service; (xi) medical or dental service; (xii) microscope, map, microfilm, or other specialized equipment service; (xiii) swimming pool or other underwater service; (xiv) decorative or showcase service; (xv) producing colored light; (xvi) shatter resistance which has an external protective coating; or (xvii) appliance service. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(D)(i)&hyph;(xvii) (West Supp. 1993). 3. Medium Base Compact Fluorescent Lamps The term ``medium base compact fluorescent lamp'' means an integrally ballasted fluorescent lamp with a medium screw base and a rated input voltage of 115 to 130 volts and which is designed as a direct replacement for a general service incandescent lamp. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(S) (West Supp. 1993). Thus, the definition does not include other types of compact fluorescent lamps that operate with a separate ballast, even if the lamp or the separate ballast has a medium screw base. B. Disclosures for Lamps Generally Several comments stated that the main purpose of energy labeling for lamps is to encourage purchasers to move towards the purchase of more energy efficient lighting like compact fluorescent lamps. 40 The potential for energy savings through the use of more efficient lighting is high, particularly in commercial settings where lighting is the single largest source of electricity consumption. About 41 percent of electricity, and 28 percent of total energy, consumed in the commercial sector is for lighting. 41 Fluorescent lamps consume about 55 percent of lighting electricity in the commercial sector, 42 with incandescent reflector lamps consuming most of the remainder. In the residential sector, energy use for lighting is small, though not trivial, representing about seven percent of residential energy use. 43 Incandescent lamps provide most lighting in residences. 40 See, e.g ., NEMA, G&hyph;3, 35; Gluckstern, GG&hyph;3, 1. 41 U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Building Energy Efficiency (hereinafter referred to as ``OTA Report''), OTA&hyph;E&hyph;518 (Washington, DC; U.S. Government Printing Office, May 1992), C&hyph;6, 50. Commercial buildings used 12.9 quads of energy at a cost of $68 billion in 1989. About two-thirds of this energy was in the form of electricity. In addition to lighting, space heating and space cooling were the other principal end uses. Id. at 21. 42 Id. at 54. 43 Id. at 50&hyph;51.
