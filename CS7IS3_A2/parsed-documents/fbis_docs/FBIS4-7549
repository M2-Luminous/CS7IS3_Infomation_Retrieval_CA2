FBIS4-7549 "dreeu063__a94006" FBIS-EEU-94-063-A Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Assembly Fails To Debate Newspaper Demands Assembly Fails To Debate Newspaper Demands AU0104123994 Sofia BTA in English 1056 GMT 1 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0104123994 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- Debates started in parliament on bills of amendments (demanded by the leading national dailies) to the Value Added Tax [VAT] Act which is coming into effect today. However, the bill was not put to the vote, as the sitting was closed for lack of quorum. Two bills were moved, one by the MP's of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) Yuri Borisov and Ivo Atanasov, and one by the MP of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) Lyubomir Pavlov. Under the "Borisov-Atanasov Bill" Bulgarian scientific and fiction books and non-porn newspapers would be exempted from the 18 percent VAT for a period of three years. Under the "Pavlov Bill" exemption extends over advertisements as well. The observations of the parliamentary committees on both bills were presented at the plenary sitting. The Radio and Television Committee and the Culture Committee support both bills. The Economic Committee supports the "Borisov-Atanasov Bill". According to the Budget and Finance Committee, the government alone has the right to initiate legislation where budget-related acts are concerned. It offers a compromise: To exempt the distribution and sale of newspapers and possibly of magazines and Bulgarian books from VAT by the end of this year but to charge further the present 10 per cent turnover tax. According to the Legislative Committee, the bills are not in contradiction with the constitution and the principles of the legal system. However, it maintains that the passage of amendments to an act which has not even come into effect as yet, is no contribution to the stability of the legislative system. Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov who attended the sitting said he was not convinced that the demanded amendments were in the interest of the reading public. He pointed out that the real rise in the prices of published material with the introduction of VAT should not exceed 7 percent. Yesterday the editors-in-chief and the publishers of the leading newspapers presented their demands to the National Assembly. They insist that the mass media, advertisements in them, Bulgarian books, trade in newsprint and ink for the periodicals and for book printing, and printing services be all exempted from VAT. The leading national dailies staged a four-day boycott (Monday- Thursday) in protest against the newly introduced tax. On Monday [28 March] and Tuesday [29 March] the six private radio stations did not broadcast. They were back on the air Wednesday [30 March] but aired several minutes of noise effects every hour. Local newspapers and radiostations protested as well. A protest procession of Bulgarian intellectuals -- writers, journalists, publishers and book distributors -- was held Wednesday.
