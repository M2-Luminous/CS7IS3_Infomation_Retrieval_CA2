According to experts of his ministry, Russia exported armaments worth 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. A major contract on shipments of MiG-29 fighter planes to Malaysia is expected early next year, Davydov told Business-TASS on Tuesday. The minister denied allegations that Russia had sustained considerable losses by ceasing military shipments to former Soviet allies as those were mostly free of charge deliveries. "for political reasons we have stopped arms shipments to a number of warring countries - Afghanistan, Angola, Ethiopia and others. But Russia did not practically earn any money from that. Now the arms trade is going on only for hard currency", Davydov said. The minister hopes the creation of the "Rosvooruzhenie" company which is to unite major Russian military exporters will open new prospects for arms trade. He added that his ministry retains the licencing right, will draft intergovernmental agreements and carry out export control.
