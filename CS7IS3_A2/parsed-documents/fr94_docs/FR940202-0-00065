FR940202-0-00065 FR940202-0-00006 (2) Payments from borrower to lender _(i) Money lending transaction. In a lending transaction to which section 1273(b)(2) applies, a payment from the borrower to the lender (other than a payment for property or for services provided by the lender, such as commitment fees or loan processing costs) reduces the issue price of the debt instrument evidencing the loan. However, solely for purposes of determining the tax consequences to the borrower, the issue price is not reduced if the payment is deductible under section 461(g)(2). (ii) Section 1274 transaction. In a lending transaction to which section 1274 applies, a payment from the buyer-borrower to the seller-lender that is designated as interest or points reduces the stated principal amount of the debt instrument evidencing the loan, but is included in the purchase price of the property. If the payment is deductible under section 461(g)(2), however, the issue price of the debt instrument (as otherwise determined under section 1274 and the rule in the preceding sentence) is increased by the amount of the payment to compute the buyer-borrower's interest deductions under section 163. (3) Payments from lender to borrower. A payment from the lender to the borrower in a lending transaction is treated as an amount loaned. (4) Payments between lender and third party. If, as part of a lending transaction, a party other than the borrower (the third party) makes a payment to the lender, that payment is treated in appropriate circumstances as made from the third party to the borrower followed by a payment in the same amount from the borrower to the lender and governed by the provisions of paragraph (g)(2) of this section. If, as part of a lending transaction, the lender makes a payment to a third party, that payment is treated in appropriate circumstances as an additional amount loaned to the borrower and then paid by the borrower to the third party. The character of the deemed payment between the borrower and the third party depends on the substance of the transaction. (5) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (g). Example 1. Payments from borrower to lender in a cash transaction_ (i) Facts. A lends $100,000 to B for a term of 10 years. At the time the loan is made, B pays $4,000 in points to A. Assume that the points are not deductible by B under section 461(g)(2) and that the stated redemption price at maturity of the debt instrument is $100,000. (ii) Payment results in OID. Under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the issue price of B's debt instrument evidencing the loan is $96,000. Because the amount of OID on the debt instrument ($4,000) is more than a de minimis amount of OID, A accounts for the OID under §1.1272&hyph;1. B accounts for the OID under §1.163&hyph;7. Example 2. Payments from borrower to lender in a section 1274 transaction_ (i) Facts. A sells property to B for $1,000,000 in a transaction that is not a potentially abusive situation (within the meaning of §1.1274&hyph;3). In consideration for the property, B gives A $300,000 and issues a 5-year debt instrument that has a stated principal amount of $700,000, payable at maturity, and that calls for semiannual payments of interest at a rate of 8.5 percent. In addition to the cash downpayment, B pays A $14,000 designated as points on the loan. Assume that the points are not deductible under section 461(g)(2). (ii) Issue price. Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the stated principal amount of B's debt instrument is ^$686,000 ($700,000 minus $14,000). Assuming a test rate of 9 percent, compounded semiannually, the imputed principal amount of B's debt instrument under §1.1274&hyph;2(c)(1) is $686,153. Under §1.1274&hyph;2(b)(1), the issue price of B's debt instrument is the stated principal amount of $686,000. Because the amount of OID on the debt instrument ($700,000^$686,000, or $14,000) is more than a de minimis amount of OID, A accounts for the OID under §1.1272&hyph;1 and B accounts for the OID under §1.163&hyph;7. B's basis in the property purchased is $1,000,000 ($686,000 debt instrument plus $314,000 cash payments). Example 3. Payments between lender and third party (seller-paid points)_ (i) Facts. A sells real property to B for $500,000 in a transaction that is not a potentially abusive situation (within the meaning of §1.1274&hyph;3). B makes a cash down payment of $100,000 and borrows $400,000 of the purchase price from a lender, L, repayable in annual installments over a term of 15 years calling for interest at a rate of 9 percent, compounded annually. As part of the transaction, A makes a payment of $8,000 to L to facilitate the loan to B. (ii) Payment results in a de minimis amount of OID. Under the provisions of paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(4) of this section, B is treated as having made an $8,000 payment directly to L and a payment of only $492,000 to A for the property. Thus, B's basis in the property is $492,000. The payment to L reduces the issue price of B's debt instrument to $392,000, resulting in $8,000 of OID ($400,000^$392,000). Because the amount of OID is de minimis under §1.1273&hyph;1(d), L accounts for the de minimis OID under §1.1273&hyph;1(d)(5). But see §1.1272&hyph;3 (election to treat de minimis OID as OID). B accounts for the de minimis OID under §1.163&hyph;7. (h) Investment units_ (1) In general. Under section 1273(c)(2), an investment unit is treated as if the investment unit were a debt instrument. The issue price of the investment unit is determined under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of this section, if applicable. The issue price of the investment unit is then allocated between the debt instrument and the property right (or rights) that comprise the unit based on their relative fair market values. If paragraphs (a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1) of this section are not applicable, however, the issue price of the debt instrument that is part of the investment unit is determined under section 1273(b)(4) or 1274, whichever is applicable. (2) Consistent allocation by holders and issuer. The issuer's allocation of the issue price of the investment unit is binding on all holders of the investment unit. However, the issuer's determination is not binding on a holder that explicitly discloses that its allocation is different from the issuer's allocation. Unless otherwise provided by the Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the investment unit. See §1.1275&hyph;2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain information to holders. (i) [Reserved] (j) Convertible debt instruments. The issue price of a debt instrument includes any amount paid for an option to convert the instrument into stock (or another debt instrument) of either the issuer or a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) or into cash or other property in an amount equal to the approximate value of such stock (or debt instrument). (k) Below-market loans subject to section 7872(b). The issue price of a below-market loan subject to section 7872(b) (a term loan other than a gift loan) is the issue price determined under this section, reduced by the excess amount determined under section 7872(b)(1). (l) [Reserved] (m) Treatment of amounts representing pre-issuance accrued interest_ (1) Applicability. Paragraph (m)(2) of this section provides an alternative to the general rule of this section for determining the issue price of a debt instrument if_ (i) A portion of the initial purchase price of the instrument is allocable to interest that has accrued prior to the issue date (pre-issuance accrued interest); and
