Now, over 50 years after it was established, this international organization's activities are contrary to the objectives that have been stated in the UN Charter. Our political correspondent interviewed our country's permanent representative at the United Nations, who is in Tehran now to discuss the United Nations' actions on world events during recent years. [Kamal] Kharrazi, our country's permanent UN representative, said it is disturbing that the United Nations follows U.S. policies and stressed that the United Nations has become more like a pressure lever. Citing an example of how the United Nations follows U.S. policies, he referred to its stances on Iraq, Somalia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina and said: Since U.S. interests were involved in the Iraqi and Somali problems, the UN presence was strong. But, when it comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina and the passage of two years since the problem started, it has taken no serious step against the Serbs. Elsewhere in his interview, our country's permanent UN representative discussed how the United Nations uses human rights in its approach to various countries and said: [Begin recording] [Kharrazi] Human rights has been turned into a political instrument and everyone, that is, the representatives of the various countries at the United Nations, knows the human rights issue is a political instrument, not a real problem, and that the stance on this issue is very selective. One country is selected for political reasons so that pressure is exerted on it and the United Nations examines human rights in it, while the member countries know that, say, the Iranian human rights situation cannot be compared with that in many countries nearby. They know this. But in their political transactions and under the pressure and influence of these countries, they do not vote in our favor. And this is because the approach to human rights in general is a political one. Basically speaking, we should note one point: The United Nations is not a house of justice where everything is based on justice. The United Nations, as I said, is a political club in which the political interests of countries play a determining role. In countries' political transactions among themselves they may vote for something. They may not necessarily believe in the vote they cast, but they justify their vote on the basis of their own political interests. [end recording] In this interview, Kharrazi also referred to the UN Security Council's procrastination over dealing with the recent crime by the Zionists at al-Khalil and pointed out: Such approaches have led the Third World members of the United Nations to demand that the Security Council hold open sessions and to the countries of the south forming a committee to examine the Security Council's actions.
