FBIS4-5421 "dreas069_a_94025" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Tax Panel Plans To Continue Discussion Tax Panel Plans To Continue Discussion OW0804125094 Tokyo KYODO in English 1004 GMT 8 Apr 94 OW0804125094 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- A government advisory tax panel will continue its discussions as Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa requested to compile detailed proposals on tax reform, a forum chief said Friday [8 April]. Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, made the remarks at a news conference after a panel meeting held amid news that Hosokawa announced his intention to resign. The news indeed came as a surprise for the advisory body to the prime minister that kicked off discussions with newly appointed panel members after Hosokawa himself requested at the onset to compile detailed proposals on a tax reform. His request featured a net tax increase to cope with the coming aged society. "There will be no effect on our discussions," Kato said, noting a tax reform as requested by Hosokawa is a promise both domestically and internationally to materialize by the end of the year. He added any new cabinet will come up with the same direction as Hosokawa to deal with the coming aged society. The greatest missions are to limit the net tax increase as much as possible and to promote publicity to win public support, Kato said. The panel will compile a report in June with "various options" for politicians to decide, he said, suggesting the report will include specific figures on the scale of the tax cut and hikes. The timing is in line with the ruling coalition parties' agreement to decide on the tax reform before the current Diet session ends June 29 and also with Japan's promises in the March market-opening package to offer details in June before the summit of the Group of Seven major nations in Italy in July. Addressing the resumed meeting, Hosokawa asked the panel to discuss and present recommendations "in the early stage to detail a desirable tax system for creating a stable, balanced tax system on income, consumption and assets," as proposed by the panel in November in its medium-term report on tax reform. The November report called for such a balanced tax system to cope with the coming aging of society in the 21th century. But Hosokawa said an "increase in public tax burden is unavoidable" to attain an affluent society amid the aged population while creating a sound fiscal position without amassing national debt balance even if thorough administrative reform and expenditure streamlining are taken. In specifying tax reform, Hosokawa reminded panel members that the government and the ruling coalition parties vowed to bring about full-scale tax reform by the end of the year, when they decided in February to conduct 6 trillion yen income tax cuts limited to fiscal 1994. He also said legislators attached a provision to include a permanent income tax in the year-end reform when they passed the single-year bills in March.
