G. Mamedova and S. P. Rodtsevich, General and Inorganic Chemistry Institute, Minsk; UDC666.59] [Abstract] Large-scale use of electric heating films capable of providing surface heat emission at low heater-to-object temperature gradients, makes it is necessary to develop low-cost metal-ceramic and ceramic resistor coatings on ceramics and to study the effects of some technological factors on their properties. The use of any particular ceramic as an electric heater coating is hindered by the mutual diffusion between both the components of the film and its substrate which leads to chemical reactions in the interfacial zones resulting in a rise in the resistance of the coating to cause mechanical stresses which inhibit conducting processes. In this respect, the highly clayey ceramic (22KhS) is of considerable interest since it is chemically inert and does not react with the coating material. The problem of making low cost film heaters may be resolved through study of metal-ceramic (Me-clay-glass) and ceramic (transition metal oxide-glass former) systems. Selection of the proper material used in a system depends on the following considerations. In the first system the metal is used as a base for an electrically conducting component; the clay is needed to support the slip in a suspended state. Also, after losing its water of hydration, clay becomes more chemically active and reacts with metals to form the conducting phase, while glass serves to bind the metal particles to the ceramic base. In the second system, during the calcining process, the transition metal oxides form cations of varying valencies of the same element to provide the needed conditions for electrical conductivity. The oxide-glass former plays the same role as glass does in the first system. Slips, prepared using 3d-elements (nickel, titanium, iron, copper, and chromium) and alloys of these elements with aluminum, boron, phosphorus, and silicon, were applied to ceramic objects by dipping or coating and tested for resistance to heat, cold temperatures, and moisture. Films containing Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Mo, V, La, and Nb oxides had the best electrical conductivities, and negative temperature coefficients of resistance. On heating, resistance drops rapidly and the objects become overheated and burn out unless a thermo-regulator is used. The coatings are resistant to vibration, cold, and moisture.
