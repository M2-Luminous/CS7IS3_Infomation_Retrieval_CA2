FBIS4-20949 "jptdd014__l94009" JPRS-TDD-94-014-L JPRS Narcotics 28 March 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA FELCN Report Allegedly `Mercilessly Tarnished' Paz Zamora, FELCN Report Allegedly `Mercilessly Tarnished' Paz Zamora, MIR Leaders PY2803173094 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 28 Mar 94 PY2803173094 La Paz Television Nacional Network Spanish BFN [Text] The Special Antinarcotics Force's [FELCN] report has provoked a political storm. The report mercilessly tarnished the image of former President Jaime Paz Zamora and important Movement of the Revolutionary Left [MIR] leaders. As a result, Jaime Paz Zamora announced his irrevocable withdrawal from political life. The population was surprised by the FELCN report's summary of conclusions. It obviously had the sharp advice of intelligent experts and probably the DEA itself. The document says drug trafficker and Army Captain Isaac Oso Chavarria, who was trained as an intelligence officer by the Army, used his personal relations with Jaime Paz Zamora and his family to create a drug trafficking network within Paz Zamora's administration. The MIR leaders involved tried to hide their links with Chavarria when the real nature of Chavarria's business became known, but Chavarria used that fear to blackmail them, the document says. These MIR leaders were involved in illegal activities to protect Chavarria against FELCN efforts to uncover his activities. Chavarria had legal immunity until the advent of the new government. The report says that Chavarria's links with MIR leaders were financial as well as personal. Chavarria was a MIR follower and had easy access to MIR leaders. We must point out that these links were not established by the MIR as a party and most MIR followers were unaware of them, the report says, adding that the evidence does not incriminate the MIR as a party in Chavarria's activities. The MIR cannot be accused of involvement in drug trafficking activities. When the report mentions the MIR and its links with Chavarria it only refers to the party leadership, the document says. When studying the chronology of events, it is clear that MIR leaders were willing to accept Chavarria's hospitality, financial infrastructure, and resources even before Paz Zamora was elected president. Once in power this relationship continued, although in a more discreet manner, because MIR leaders realized they were politically dangerous, particularly after then-Senator Juan Lucio's revelations. During the MIR administration, Chavarria and other drug traffickers continued paying bribe money to high-ranking MIR leaders, the document says. The bribes were delivered through middlemen such as Chavarria employees Edgar Fernandez and Luis Capobianco. Paz Zamora's sisters presumably also acted as links to carry messages and set up meetings between Chavarria and the president, the report adds. The report says that in October 1990, MIR leaders and presidential personal secretary Susana Seleme, speaking on behalf of the president, prevented a FELCN raid on a house owned by Chavarria in Ilpavi and in November 1990 ordered FELCN to free Edgar Fernandez, thus interrupting the investigation of Chavarria's businesses. In April 1991, acting MIR President Oscar Eid paid Chavarria's hospital bills. At that time Chavarria had enough money not only to pay his hospital bill but also to buy the entire hospital, the report says. In February 1994, MIR leaders threatened fugitive Edgar Fernandez' family members to prevent him from revealing anything about MIR leaders' links to Chavarria. The report says Chavarria conspired to create a drug trafficking network within Paz Zamora's administration. The most notable expression of Chavarria's influence was the appointment of Colonel Faustino Rico Toro to head FELCN. With that appointment Chavarria intended to control and neutralize FELCN's struggle against drug trafficking. The report says Chavarria considered Faustino Rico Toro a drug trafficking partner by at least 1983. The report says Chavarria allegedly pressured President Paz Zamora into appointing Rico Toro to the very important and delicate post in February 1991. The appointment completed the narco-influence network established by Chavarria that included presidential aides chief Colonel Jorge Coco Velazquez and Seized Goods Director Choco Saucedo. In 1983, Chavarria deposited $1.2 million in a Rico Toro account. The two were partners at least as of that date. The same year Chavarria purchased Rico Toro's condominium in Florida, in the United States. Chavarria received a house that belonged to Rico Toro in Ilpadi, La Paz, as payment for a drug trafficking debt. Rico Toro tried to repurchase the house when he was named FELCN chief, but Chavarria refused to sell it back to him. Rico Toro was one of [former military dictator] Luis Garcia Meza's assistants. He received $200,000 for his loyalty to the regime. The report says Chavarria tried to influence the appointment of military officers to important positions through presidential aides chief Col. Jorge Coco Velazquez. The report concludes that Seized Goods Director Choco Saucedo was part of Chavarria's drug trafficking influence network. Saucedo sold confidential information on investigations of the activities of Colombian drug traffickers to Bolivian drug traffickers.
