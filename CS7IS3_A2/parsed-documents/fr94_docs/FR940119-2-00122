SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 24, 1993, the Clinton Administration announced a comprehensive package of wetlands policy reforms that will improve the protection of wetlands and make wetlands programs more fair and flexible for landowners. The MOA signed on January 6, 1994, implements one of the more than 40 initiatives in the Administrations's Wetlands Plan. The MOA signatory agencies recognize the important contribution of agricultural producers to society, our economy, and our environment. The agencies are committed to ensuring that Federal wetlands programs are administered in a manner that minimizes the impacts on affected landowners to the extent possible consistent with the important goal of protecting wetlands. The MOA was developed in response to concerns that previous practices may have led to confusion and inconsistent application of Federal wetlands programs and policies on agricultural lands.
