He recalled that United States has not yet canceled the Jackson-Venik amendment which discriminates against Russia. The solution of a number of financial and commercial issues is tied to various political conditions and to progress in the implementation of market reforms in Russia. The minister added that the policy of strict quantitative regulation of Russian imports is still in force. Russia, in the opinion of Oleg Davydov, should first and foremost seek the lifting of restrictions on the export of its goods to the United States and develop a mechanism for bilateral consultations.
