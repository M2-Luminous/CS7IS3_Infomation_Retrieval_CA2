A statement from Derrick Smith, party spokesman on National Security, said hostilities had developed between the two gangsters after a robbery in New York by the Black Roses Gang. Twenty-five kilograms of cocaine and US$1 million in cash were stolen from a Colombian drug ring. According to the JLP, two Colombians are now in Jamaica to ensure that approproriate punishment is inflicted for this violation. An associate of one of the gang bosses known as "Rat" had four of his cronies killed and their bodies found in a car along Diamond Road recently. "Rat" fled to New York shortly after but was shot dead less than 24 hours after arrival. In the ensuring hostilities between both gangsters, the JLP says, there has been increasing importation of guns and ammunition concealed in bags of rice, barrels of clothing, and in the guts of television sets and refrigerators.
