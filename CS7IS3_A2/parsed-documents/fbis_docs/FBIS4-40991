Unfortunately, Estonia is dragging out talks on a joint description and designation of the border on terrain in accordance with the universally accepted international practice. This brings about difficulties in the protection of Russian borders. The guarding of borders cannot be exercised if they are not clearly defined, Kozhevnikov said. As is known, Estonia claims part of Narva district in Leningrad region and Pechora district in Pskov region. This is a territory with an area of 2,300 square kilometers. Nationalist-minded Estonian organisations have repeatedly attempted to set up road barriers on Russia's territory, thereby asserting "a new Russo- Estonian border." Various assemblies and congresses periodically demand that the "historical lands" be handed back to the Estonian side. The president of Russia said a firm "no" to attempts at arbitrarily changing the established borders. Meanwhile the situation in the border sector remains complex. Attempts to cross the border unlawfully or to smuggle contraband merchandise, including arms and narcotics, continue unabated. Russian border guards counter the criminals' challenge by adroit arrangements for guard duty and by enhanced cooperation with the customs personnel and law enforcement agencies. Operations to identify smuggling channels prove resultative. This is evidenced by tens of firearms, hundreds of kilogrammes of narcotics, tonnes of non-ferrous metals, fuel, and art treasures that are intercepted at the border every month. The accommodation of troops remains a painful problem with the border guards. In the opinion of the deputy commander-in-chief, personnel withdrawn from the Baltics had to begin accommodation arrangements practically from scratch. Estonia did not assign funds for that, although the withdrawn personnel left behind durable buildings and facilities, valuable radar and searchlight equipment, obstructions systems and many other things worth billions of roubles. The Baltic district was among the Soviet Union's best accommodated ones. All this remains the subject of the talks but there are no constructive solutions so far, General Kozhevnikov said. As Boris Yeltsin stated when addressing border guards on the eve of their professional holiday, "Russia favours the development of good-neighbourly relations with Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia and wider cooperation with them. But these states are not members of the CIS. Therefore the border regime should be sound and the guarding of the border should be organised accordingly."
