FBIS4-38104 "drnes124_c_94002" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 Egypt Musa on Golan Withdrawal, Yemen Musa on Golan Withdrawal, Yemen NC2706130794 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1130 GMT 27 Jun 94 NC2706130794 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Beirut, 27 Jun (MENA)--Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that the comprehensive peace in which Egypt believes must be based on Israel's withdrawal from all the territories it occupied in 1967, self-determination for the Palestinian people, and an agreement on an overall settlement that could ensure security, withdrawal, and coexistence among the region's peoples. In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-DIYAR published today, Musa said that progress on any of the Arab-Israeli peace tracks will help the other tracks in the same way as failure on any track will harm the others. He added that progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track was followed by progress on the Jordanian track, noting that negotiations on the Palestinian track were in parallel with endeavors and talks along the Syrian track. He noted that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has visited the region more than once to boost the Syrian-Israeli track. He stressed that Egypt believes the Syrian-Israeli track is the main track that could prove crucial to the fate of the comprehensive peace or the Middle East problem. Musa pointed out that we believe in basic principles, namely, that Syria is entitled to regain the Golan according to the 4 June 1967 borders, which would necessitate an Israeli military and civilian withdrawal up to these borders. He added that Egypt is closely following the contacts being held in connection with the Arab-Israeli talks. He emphasized that the Syrian-Israeli track is of particular importance to Egypt, because what is in the interest of the Syrian brothers is in Egypt's interest and because no comprehensive peace can be achieved without Israel's withdrawal from the Golan. The foreign minister hoped that progress would be achieved along this track in the coming stage. Regarding the Palestinian issue, Musa said that what is required now is to move from Gaza and Jericho to the remaining occupied territories and then hold negotiations for a final solution. He warned against one-upmanship in the Palestinian arena. He added: Inter-Palestinian collision or one-upmanship over political movement are not needed; the important thing is to gear the Palestinian issue toward serving its goals--self-determination for the Palestinian people. On the developments in Yemen, the Egyptian foreign minister warned that if the current fighting continues, expectations are that things will be "extremely bad." The continuation of this war, the ongoing killing, and the victims resulting from this war cannot preserve any unity or serve as a basis for the future of a state or a people, he added. If the current UN contacts fail, the international as well as the Arab legality will not remain silent about the continuation of this war; Yemen's survival and future are now at stake, he added. Musa ruled out any Arab or foreign military intervention to end the deteriorating conditions in Yemen.
