The document envisages close ties between the republic and NATO, especially regarding reform in the armed forces, officer training, and joint exercises. It stipulates involvement of Ukraine's military subunits in UN and CSCE operations, open national defense and budget planning, democratic control over the military sphere, and exchange of relevant information. Partnership for Peace member countries can consult NATO members when faced with a direct threat to their territorial integrity, political independence, or security, but this does not imply security guarantees on the part of the NATO. Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Borys Tarasyuk told UNIAN: "It is of special importance to Ukraine to be able to initiate such consultations, since Ukrainian political circles have for a long time been voicing concern over the state's security, especially in the wake of parliament's confirmation on 3 February of the country's intention to get rid of nuclear weapons completely." "Membership in Partnership for Peace will enable Ukraine to build its armed forces on a new basis, approaching world standards, and involve its military subunits in various operations run by the UN and the CSCE which will enhance its authority," said Yuriy Serheyev, head of the information directorate at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commenting on the signing of the document.
