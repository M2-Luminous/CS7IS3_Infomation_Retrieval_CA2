The court ruled that the section of the Law and Order Maintenance Act that made demonstrations illegal, unless they had the approval of the police, was in conflict with the Zimbabwean Bill of Rights which guaranteed freedom of association. The challenge to the law was brought by members of the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions who were arrested in 1992 for staging a procession in Harare after police refused to approve it. They pleaded not guilty on the grounds that the law infringed their constitutional rights and the case was referred to the Supreme Court.
