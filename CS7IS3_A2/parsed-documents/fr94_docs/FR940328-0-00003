FR940328-0-00003 FR940328-0-00001 Immediate Action The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted to remove unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of cattle from Texas. Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication in the Federal Register . We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the Federal Register . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the Federal Register . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. Cattle moved interstate are moved for slaughter, for use as breeding stock, or for feeding. Changing the brucellosis status of Texas from Class B to Class A will promote economic growth by reducing certain testing and other requirements governing the interstate movement of cattle from the State. Cattle from certified brucellosis-free herds moving interstate are not affected by this change. The groups affected by this action will be herd owners in Texas, as well as buyers and importers of cattle from the State. There are an estimated 140,000 cattle herds in Texas that would be affected by this rule. Ninety-eight percent of these are owned by small entities. If the total cost of testing were distributed equally among all herds affected by this rule, this change in classification could save at the most approximately $4 per herd. Therefore, we believe that changing the brucellosis status for Texas would not have a significant economic impact on the small entities affected by this interim rule. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
