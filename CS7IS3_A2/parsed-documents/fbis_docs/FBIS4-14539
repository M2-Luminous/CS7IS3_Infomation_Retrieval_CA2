He said these persons are being held at a former prison facility in Maardu, outside Tallinn. The minister said that most of the interned in Estonia were Kurds. He added that this was somewhat surprising, for it is evident that also people of many other nationalities are staying in the country illegally. "Unlike the illegal residents of many other nationalities, the Kurds are not dangerous to society," Kama said. He said plans to build an internment camp for illegal immigrants at Rummu, a small town to the southwest from Tallinn, were standing behind money problems. At least a few dozen million kroons would be needed to set up the internment camp, he said. Kama told BNS that a small number of illegal residents had also been expelled from the country. The minister said this was possible only in the cases when the country where the immigrant had come from could be clearly proved.
