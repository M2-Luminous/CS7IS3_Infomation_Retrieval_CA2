The agreement was initially presented as a triumph of U.S. diplomacy, then it was used as confirmation that peace in Bosnia was a fait accompli, and in the past few days the affair got an unusual epilogue. The majority of analysts now see in the U.S. plan for Bosnia a return to the old theme of division of spheres of interest, while some even see it as a return to the Cold War. The sequence of such different interpretations of one and the same fact shows what the capital sum and what the interest rate might be in this game. The United States does not have a clear goal in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because if it had one, it would already have achieved it. The events surrounding the Washington agreement only confirm the continuity of its inconsistency and controversial actions. Clinton has come up with a winning combination, yet he is now behaving like a chess player who has overlooked an entire chess piece. The chess piece is called Russia. That is why the U.S. President is sending Warren Christopher to Vladivostok where an agreement on division of work in Bosnia should be reached. The West wants the war to end so that the two-year public pressure on its governments finally stops. On the other hand, correspondents from Moscow report on Russia's firm intention of actually reasserting its presence in the Balkans through Bosnia. This is not yet proof that history is repeating itself, but we should not forget that certain ideas often outlive history itself. The Balkan peoples cannot seem to be able to grow up. The reason lies both in them and in those who are squabbling over them and their countries. For over a hundred years three or four superpowers have been regulating affairs in these areas, but all of their experiments and creations have failed, and have dragged them into catastrophe. It was always others who made Bosnia's past tragic, regardless of whether they came from its eastern or western borders. Nowadays we are witnessing an attempt to end the tragedy caused by the Serbian aggression with a plan that has probably never been implemented anywhere. The Washington agreement will perhaps bring peace between the Croats and the Muslims, but it in itself will not preserve the Bosnian state within the existing borders. For Bosnia to survive, someone needs to cool the nationalist blood in Belgrade and Zagreb. Agreement on certain theoretical principles was reached swiftly and easily at the Vienna negotiations about the Muslim-Croat federation. This was proclaimed to be a great success, and was mathematically expressed with the claim that only 5 percent of concurrence was still needed in order for it to be a complete triumph. It became evident, however, that precisely this "5 percent" represents the essence of things and the essence of the conflict. Everything would probably be different had this project originated in Bosnia and not in Washington. Whenever others had designs on the Bosnians, the Bosnians ended up being beheaded. According to this historical experience, we must count on the temporary character of this latest sartorial model.
