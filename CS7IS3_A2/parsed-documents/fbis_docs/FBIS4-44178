[passage omitted] Bonn says that Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to stick to the candidate of his choice for the time being; but as yet, Kohl has not found a solution for the special summit either. Bonn circles regard former Belgian Prime Minister Wifried Martens as a "hot tip." The 58-year-old Flemish Christian Democrat is chairman of the European People's Party. Members of the delegation accompanying Kohl to the Corfu summit say that Major probably rejected Dehaene mainly because he fears he might promote European integration too much for Britain's liking. Following the devastating defeat Major's Conservative Party suffered in the European elections, the prime minister's statement that he will not change his mind over the next four weeks is considered credible. Kohl, therefore, does not want to provoke the British Government, but rather to try to have intensive talks with London in order to find a joint solution.
