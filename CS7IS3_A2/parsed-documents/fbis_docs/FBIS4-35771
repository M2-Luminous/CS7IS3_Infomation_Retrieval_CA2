The sources noted that the firing of rockets was preceded by an Israeli air raid against a Hizballah base in the Ba'labakk area, leaving 30 terrorists dead and 60 others wounded. The sources said that the base was used for training Hizballah members. It was also used as a staging point for carrying out terrorist operations in south Lebanon. The air raid was effected as part of the continuous war against Hizballah and as a response to Hizballah's terrorist acts against the Israeli army, the South Lebanese Army [SLA], and civilians in the border area. The sources stressed that the State of Israel cannot remain silent over rockets being fired at civilian targets. They added that if Hizballah fails to abide by the understanding, Israel will be absolved of this understanding. The sources added that if Hizballah continues to attack the Israeli army, the SLA, and the defenseless civilians in the border area, the Israeli army will use all available means to strike with all force at Hizballah. The firing of rockets will be met with a violent response against Hizballah bases and centers as well as those belonging to the other terrorist organizations. If calm does not prevail on this side, it will also not prevail on the other side, the sources added.
