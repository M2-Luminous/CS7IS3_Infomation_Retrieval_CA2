FBIS4-53773 "dreas099_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 North Korea United States Urged To Respond to Peace Proposal United States Urged To Respond to Peace Proposal SK2305022294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1640 GMT 22 May 94 SK2305022294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1640 GMT 22 May 94 Korean BFN [Unattributed talk: "The United States Should Respond to Peace Negotiations With Us"] [Text] We recently proposed to the United States that negotiations be held to establish a new peace guarantee system to prevent arms buildup and recurrence of war, to stabilize the situation, and to ensure durable peace and security in a practical and dependable manner on the Korean peninsula. Our initiative toward negotiations is generating great international reaction, which proves that our proposal is right. A state of acute military confrontation remains on the Korean peninsula. This resulted from the wrongful U.S. act of wantonly violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and paralyzing the armistice mechanism and from the U.S. policy of crushing the DPRK. The United States has been trampling [chitpalpko] upon the agreements of the Armistice Agreement even more wantonly and following the road of reckless military confrontation and adventurism. Raving about countermeasures to check someone's nuclear development and surprise attack, hardline conservative forces of the United States have massively brought and deployed various types of equipment, including new Patriot missiles, in South Korea, and assembled a large-scale mobile strike armed forces around South Korea. The United States also says they will enforce the Team Spirit joint military exercise this November. By this, the United States itself reveals that it has completely destroyed the armistice agreement it signed with us in the name of the United Nations with the world as witness. The Korean peninsula is presently in a state of armistice. In order for this state to continue, the signatories of the armistice agreement should fulfill their obligations stipulated in the agreement. However, the United States is not doing so. The United States, in breach of its obligations stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement, has violated and trampled upon [pagihago yurinhaessumyo] the agreements unilaterally and systematically for the past 40 years, and their trampling upon the agreements has become more grave recently. In fact, they do not admit to the validity of the agreement and ignore the value of its existence. This is proven by the U.S. deployment of numerous items of combat equipment, including new-type missiles, into South Korea openly and in broad daylight, and its open actions against us, the other signatory party to the agreement. Because of this wrongful act of the United States, the armistice Agreement has become a blank sheet of paper, and the situation on the Korean peninsula is becoming more grave. In fact, the armistice agreement has now lost its role as a systematic device to prevent aggravation of tension and danger of war. Because of the U.S. maneuvers, the armistice supervisory mechanism has also been paralyzed. The United States unilaterally forced a surveillance team--which watches over the observance of the armistice agreement and investigates and clarifies violations of the agreement--out of its area in order to hide its violations of the armistice agreement. The United States has also disabled the armistice mechanism from carrying out its function. The United States unilaterally replaced the senior member of the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] with a puppet army general of South Korea who is neither a practical party to the signing of the armistice agreement nor has any real power, qualification, or legal legitimacy. This improper act of the United States, depriving the MAC of its masters, turned the MAC into a nominal [yumyong musirhan] organ that could no longer carry out its proper role. We can no longer hold out any expectations for the armistice agreement and the armistice mechanism--which are in name only and are used as a camouflage for the U.S. policy of crushing the DPRK. As long as the present armistice system--which stipulates us and the United States as the two parties to hostilities--continues to exist, the acute issues, including the nuclear issue, cannot be settled on the Korean peninsula. Facts show that only when the armistice agreement is replaced by a peace agreement and a new peace guarantee system is established replacing the present armistice mechanism can the hostile relations between the DPRK and the United States be ended, reconciliation be achieved, and peace and security ensured on the Korean peninsula. How the United States treats our new proposal for peace negotiations will be a touchstone determining whether they want peace or war. The United States should squarely see the nature and reality of the situation and respond to peace negotiations with us as soon as possible.
