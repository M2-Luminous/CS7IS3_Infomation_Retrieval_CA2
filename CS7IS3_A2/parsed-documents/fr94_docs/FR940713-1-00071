FR940713-1-00071 FR940713-1-00014 (b) Application receipt and processing. HUD Offices will receive, screen applications, and notify PHAs under the deficiency notice procedure set forth in the NOFA issued for fund availability under 24 CFR part 941. (1) Review, rating and ranking, and selection for funding shall occur in accordance with the criteria stated in the published NOFA, which for MROP shall be largely based on the PHA's management capability to carry out the proposed MROP activities (considering the PHA's latest rating under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program), the expected term of useful life of the project or building after completion of proposed MROP activities, the likelihood of achieving full occupancy within the project or building after completion of MROP activities, and such other factors as the Secretary may determine, including statutory provisions which may cause the above factors to change. (2) Funds shall be reserved in accordance with §941.605(b)(2), and PHAs shall be notified in accordance with the NOFA issued for funding availability under 24 CFR part 941. §941.607 MROP proposal. Following application approval and fund reservation, MROP projects will be processed under the development procedures and a project planning conference to discuss program requirements and the time schedule shall be held. The PHA shall incorporate its approved application into a proposal described in §941.404, and upon its approval, an ACC will be executed in the form prescribed by HUD. §941.608 MROP project development. MROP project development shall proceed in accordance with subpart E, with the following modifications: (a) No site/property acquisition. Since the property is already owned, §941.501 is inapplicable. (b) Development method. If the sealed bid method is used (as described in §941.605) only §§941.502 (a) and (b) are applicable; however, no cost adjustments shall be made. If the competitive proposal method is used, §941.502 is inapplicable, and §941.605(a)(2) shall be followed. (c) Reconstruction, acceptance of contract work, and completion. Sections 941.503 (concerning reconstruction requirements), 941.504 (concerning acceptance of contract work), and 941.505 (concerning completion of development) are applicable to MROP projects, except that there shall be no initial operating period or cost as under §941.505(a) since the PHA will be receiving operating subsidy for the units under the original project until completion of the MROP project. A Date of Full Availability (DOFA) shall be established as the last day of the month in which substantially all the units in the MROP project are available for occupancy after reconstruction; the PHA and HUD will execute an amendment to the ACC to remove the units of the MROP project from the original development project, and initiate the operating subsidy for the MROP project units, both effective as the end of the quarter in which DOFA was achieved. Changes to applicable data systems shall also be effective as of that date. Dated: June 13, 1994. Michael B. Janis, General Deputy, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
