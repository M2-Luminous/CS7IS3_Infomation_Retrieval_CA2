Although we realize that the illegitimate son that is the product of Western states' relations with Jewish leaders, the birth of Israel, will continue to be the object of Western care and attention, new talk about the peace required in our region dictates striking a balance -- which does not yet exist -- between the special relations the West is establishing with Israel and the new relations the West hopes to establish with the Arabs, who call for justice, restoration of usurped rights, and compensation at a stage when durable peace can be concluded. The French minister's talk about reactivating military and security cooperation between Paris and Tel Aviv, after crossing the river from a recent visit to Amman, is surprising. We question the timing and aims of this reactivation, especially since France was neutral rather than supportive of Israeli aggression and the acts of persecution and oppression practiced under occupation. During the current peace talks Tel Aviv has presented nothing, on any track, that proves it is ready to abandon the logic of occupation and aggression. It continues daily violations of the simplest human rights in Palestine and the occupied Arab territories. Still, the French minister talks about more cooperation with Israel in various fields amid reports that the French defense minister will shortly arrive in Tel Aviv to bolster military cooperation that was severed in 1967. We hope the French interest in reactivating relations with Tel Aviv will not place more hurdles on the path of the peace process -- a process further complicated and slowed down by the unlimited U.S. support for this entity. Israel will be reassured that this economic, political, and military aid will continue, even if it perpetuates the state of war and instability in this sensitive region by its obstruction of the peace talks. Development and construction energies in this region have been exhausted over the past decades as a result of the losses caused by the establishment of Israel.
