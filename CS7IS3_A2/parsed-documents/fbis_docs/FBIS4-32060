Sporadically but persistently throughout the night, the enemy used 60-mm mortars, antiaircraft machine guns, antiaircraft guns, and rifles to attack the defense positions of Brcko. The defense positions in Djukici, in the central part of the battlefield, and in Vranovaca were targeted the most frequently. An enemy saboteur group was chased away in the region of Boderiste at approximately 2000 last night, and at 2200 the defenders repeated their success in thwarting an attempt by chetnik saboteurs to penetrate into the Vranovaca area. The aggressor continues to encounter major difficulties mobilizing soldiers. Intelligence information suggests that, over the past month and a half, the Serbian aggressor has carried out a whole series of raids in Bijeljina and in nearby villages. The chetnik military police are rounding up potential military conscripts in apartments, on the streets, bus stops, and even in hospitals, regardless of their (?rank), profession, or health condition, to transport them to special training camps. However, not even this latest aspect of mobilization has provided much of a chance for success for the aggressor. As soon as they arrive on the front, these forcefully mobilized soldiers of the so-called Srpska republic army desert the front lines in the Bosnian Sava Basin and Mt. Majevica at the first given opportunity.
