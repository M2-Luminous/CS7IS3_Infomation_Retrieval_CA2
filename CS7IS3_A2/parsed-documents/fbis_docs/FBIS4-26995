Example one: Legco member Emily Lau Wai-hing claimed that Patten's constitutional reform package "is far from democracy," and tabled a private member's bill proposing a comprehensive direct election in 1995. In his article published on the eve of Legco's examining the constitutional reform package, Patten criticized Lau's bill, saying: "Can we put an end to the disputes by adopting Lau's bill? Is it true that the public needs an electoral arrangement that clearly runs counter to the Basic Law?" From this, a person of good sense knows immediately that Lau's bill serves only to clear the way for Legco to pass Patten's reform package because Lau told the public long ago that she would support the package. Rather than really criticizing Lau, Patten tried to make electoral arrangements in their interest by upholding the Basic Law. Example two: Legco member Szeto Wah, from the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK), put forward an unprecedented motion to criticize Patten, saying that the latter refused to approve Legco's amendment to the decision on rates, in contravention of the popular will. Szeto pointed out at the meeting that his motion is without parallel in history and possibly also in the future. What Szeto really seeks is for someone to follow his example in the future by criticizing those in power, rather than uniqueness of his motion in history. Patten, who understood the implication of Szeto's motion, immediately praised Szeto for his "criticism" at Legco's question-and-answer session, saying that "this represents a step forward toward democracy in a political society." Patten also "pledged that he would defend Legco's powers to criticize the government, or the governor, before and after 1997." Just as the drinker's heart is not in the cup, what Patten hopes is that the Hong Kong Government will be subject to criticism after 1997 rather than before. Example three: Early this year, Legco member Christine Lok Kung-wai distributed the draft "Access to Information Law" she had drawn up, claiming that after consultation, the draft law would be presented to Legco for examination as a private member's bill. The basic points of the draft law are: The government must keep the public aware of its documents, materials, information, and materials about individuals other than those which the government can really prove would undermine "Hong Kong's major interests" or "the public interests" if brought into the open; any resident is entitled to have free access to the government's information or make relevant inquiries; and the government should appoint a special information officer to whom the public can complain of any government department's refusal to bring its information to light. Recently, Patten decided to "reject" Lok's draft "Access to Information Law." Instead, the government will implement a comprehensive set of rules on access to information. In fact, however, the rules published by the government shows that it has incorporated in them the principal points of Lok's draft law, which will bring a major change to the operation of government departments. To prevent the rule's affecting its governance, the government decided that the rules should be tried out before they are put into effect in 1996. The government also said it does not rule out the possibility of passing the rules into law. Is it not very clear what this means? Example four: Patten supports Legco's decision to examine the revised version of the "Public Security Ordinance," which has been revised in a manner reminiscent of the "Mass Organizations Ordinance" revision in 1992. At that time, the regulations on banning local mass organizations from establishing ties with political organizations abroad, as well as political organizations abroad setting up branches in Hong Kong, were deleted and the original system requiring mass organizations to register with the proper authorities was replaced by a system whereby mass organizations need only notify the government of their founding, thus weakening the government's administration of mass organizations. According to the revised "Public Security Ordinance," any mass organization need only notify the government of the rally or demonstration to be held, instead of applying for a license beforehand. This also will weaken the government's administration. This revision totally runs against Article 23 of the Basic Law, which "prohibits foreign political organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in the SAR (the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) and prohibits political organizations or bodies of the SAR from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies." This is a major issue of principle, while a number of Legco members from the UDHK criticized the government for making only a limited revision of the ordinance, saying the revision relaxing restrictions on demonstrations and rallies is "a trivial one." In all these two-man comic shows, standing at the front of the stage were pro-British, anti-Chinese Legco members, and acting behind the scenes was Patten. Sometimes the two parties echoed each other; sometimes certain Legco members "hurled abuses" at Patten; and sometimes Patten "criticized" certain Legco members. Whatever they did was designed to support each other in directing their spearheads at their common target: the post-1997 SAR government and the Chinese Government. It is clear to everyone that all the above activities suggest that the British side has stepped up its arrangements for reform of the political and legal systems. When it comes to the political system, the British side is trying to arrange for a number of pro- British, anti-Chinese elements to sit on the post-1997 Legco. Where the legal system is concerned, it is trying to revise or work out a set of ordinances to support the pro-British and anti-Chinese forces in their effort to make trouble in the SAR and in their struggle against the Chinese Government. However, cheap tricks after all are worth nothing. No matter what tricks Patten is playing and will play, the last three-tier council under the British rule will be disbanded 30 June 1997, and the future SAR government certainly will not acknowledge ordinances that run counter to the Basic Law.
