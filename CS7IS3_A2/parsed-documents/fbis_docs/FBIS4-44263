Mueller: "Sisyphus Wants To Become Chancellor"] [Text] He incessantly rolls uphill the stone of daily government business in Bonn. But in contrast to the futile drudgery in Greek mythology, the toiling by the chief of the Union caucus in the Bundestag is to be rewarded--with succession to Helmut Kohl. "To Start Everyday Anew, Even If One Never Reaches a Final Goal" Wolfgang Schaeuble is quite aware that he does not lead a bourgeois life. That struck him once again, especially on Pentecost Monday. According to bourgeois standards, he should have spent the day with his wife and family in the esteemed "Adler" in the Glottertal to celebrate his silver wedding anniversary. Instead, he was busy in the Reichstag in Berlin to ensure that Roman Herzog becomes federal president. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the chairman of the Union caucus in the Bundestag sometimes pursues the question of how, and to what, compare the activity of a politician, and thus explain it better. The answer is surprising: For him, Sisyphus is the model, the Greek mythological figure condemned by the gods to incessantly roll a heavy stone up a mountain; but the stone again rolls down from the top immediately, so that there is no end to the toil. However, it is not easy to imagine the success-oriented political manager as the "hero of the Absurd" and as "eternal rebel," as philosopher Albert Camus describes the unfortunate Sisyphus in his famous essay, "The Mythos of Sisyphus." Perhaps the French thinker's insight appeals more to Schaeuble: "There is no fate that cannot be overcome by contempt." But Wolfgang Schaeuble's everyday life in Bonn also recalls Sisyphus. Last Wednesday, for example, a stone rolled back onto his desk which he had pushed away only a few days earlier: the law on indemnification and compensation payment, which is to regulate the return of lands expropriated in the former GDR between 1945 and 1949. The project will probably end up in the mediation committee of Bundesrat and Bundestag. As a politician, sighs the head of the Union caucus, one has to "start every day anew on this earth, even if one never reaches a final goal." Nonetheless, one can be "satisfied and happy." If Schaeuble does not always look like that, it may be explained by another of Camus' insights: "A face that labors so close to the stone has itself turned to stone." The 51-year-old lawyer has relieved the chancellor of the stone of daily government business for some time now. Be it elderly care insurance, the solidarity pact or the question whether German soldiers are to participate in monitoring the airspace over Bosnia--it always holds true what a CDU [Christian Democratic Union] minister said recently: "While Kohl assumes more and more a presiding role, Schaeuble does the work." The chief of government, normally forever suspicious of potential rivals, not only tolerates this development, he even promotes it. Very soon, the chancellor wants to publicly drape the ermine cape around his crown prince's shoulders. On 20 June, he will personally present Schaeuble's new book, Und der Zukunft Zugewandt [Turn Toward the Future]. Kohl watchers cannot remember any time when the chief of government had ever before honored an author in such a way. But Schaeuble is for Kohl "the beloved son in whom he is well pleased." From a Cool-Headed but Liberal Pragmatist to "Godfather of the Right" Who is this frail man with a will of iron, who seems unstoppable on the road to becoming number one in the CDU? The judgments on him show a remarkably broad range. Until the end of the 1980's, Schaeuble's cool pragmatism in solving problems and creating political majorities was considered proof of a relatively liberal mentality. Today, Social Democrat Peter Glotz classifies him as an intellectual arsonist when he calls him the "Godfather of the Right," because of his talk about nation and "foreignization." In fact, in past years Schaeuble demonstrated great understanding for the fears of too many foreigners. Yet he ignores the fact that shelters of asylum-seekers are still burning in Germany, and that foreigners are hunted down on open streets in broad daylight. One could have wished for a clear word from him. If one wants to classify Schaeuble, one must go to his roots: his parents' home in Hornberg on the Black Forest train line; high school in Hausach, 10 kilometers distant; and today his house in Gengenbach, another 30 km further away; the years of law studies in Freiburg, just 50 km from home. Such a person is not out to conquer the world from the very beginning; rather, he wants to become someone at home. "Wash the Neck, Don't Forget the Ears, Attend Church Service," the Obedient Son Promised His Mother This was also the goal of the education given to young Wolfgang and his brothers, Frieder and Thomas: conservative-strict, but also loving. Karl Schaeuble, a clerical employee who managed to become an independent tax consultant, and his wife, Gertrud, taught their boys to respect order, discipline, a sense of decency, and fear of God. Only recently, his mother came across a slip of paper with good intentions for the new year, which Wolfgang had written down at age eight or nine: Among other things, it said to wash one's neck and not forget the ears before going to school, and to attend church service. When Schaeuble today feels that the Gutachtal, where Hornberg is situated, "is terribly narrow," he means primarily its geography. But it may also be responsible for some narrowness in his nature. Even today, the Black Forest homeland is for him a place of rest and retreat, especially with his family living there. He calls his wife Ingeborg and his two brothers the most important confidants when it concerns personal matters. Together with his oldest daughter, Christine, who was with him when "this shit happened," as he calls the attempt on his life in Oppenau on 12 October 1990, they were his mainstay in the ensuing difficult weeks. Schaeuble is in frequent telephone contact with his parents whom he calls "Mama" and "Papa" as in his childhood days. And the fact that the Schaeuble boys emulated their father in all important ways, at best tried to surpass him, also indicates that childhood and youth passed "free of conflicts" as Wolfgang Schaeuble remembers. Although bent on success at school and in sports, and growing up during the philistine 1950's, no potential built up that would have led to protest or rebellion. In 1965, when turmoil set in at the universities, Schaeuble joined the CDU, of which his father was already a member. "The spirit of the times never interested me," comments Schaeuble on his life. His basic attitudes are rooted in the childhood experiences of the safe world of the Black Forest. Gerhard Heinzmann, who graduated from high school with Schaeuble and today works as a clergyman in the diaconry of Pforzheim,is convinced that "his ethics of responsibility was molded by his parents and the church." Torsten Wolfgramm, formerly Schaeuble's FDP [Free Democratic Party] partner as parliamentary manager, recognizes in him "Max Weber's protestant performance ethics in person." The virtues of asceticism and work for work's sake, pointed out by sociologist Weber, have much to do with Schaeuble's system of values. For him, also, wasting time is basically one of the gravest sins. This ethos, absorbed with mother's milk, also immunized him against the unrest of the 68' movement. The results of the "cultural revolutionary upheavals of the 1960's," as Schaeuble sees the emancipation push after 1968, he calls "exaggerated individualism and hedonism." Schaeuble stresses in conversation that a 'comprehensive insurance mentality' of citizens undermines the necessary community spirit. His demand for greater love for one's country, which always sounded a little like "hurrah patriotism," he nowadays explains as the desire for more public spirit, charity, and service to the community. And he takes the anti-European sting out of his chatter about the nation as "a community of protection and destiny" by stating that the Western ties of the old Federal Republic are a part of the "raison d'etat of united Germany also." Schaeuble not only banks on nation and patriotism because he is still of the generation "which put candles in the windows on 17 June," as his schoolmate Heinzmann recalls. Kohl's chief tactician is also concerned with maintaining the Union's sole position as the party of unity, and strengthening the right fringe. Schaeuble's rise to the first rank of politics was closely linked to the policy on Germany. As interior minister, he worked out the unification treaty of 31 August 1990 with then-GDR state secretary Guenther Krause. Then, on 3 October, came reunification toward which Schaeuble had worked "as if in a frenzy." But he had never lost sight of party interests. He urged all-German elections early on. At that time, Kohl wanted to make him his designated successor. But on 12 October, the bullets of a demented would-be assassin tore Schaeuble out of the political machinery running full speed ahead. For a moment, everything seemed to be over. German unity and personal fate were linked even more closely for Schaeuble than for Kohl. "How Enormously Consoling When People Are Kind to One" In Bonn it is being asked to what extent the attempt on his life and its consequences have changed Schaeuble. It is said he has become hard and bitter, that he is quick to anger, and that he takes criticism worse than anyone else. Schaeuble himself claims that, if he has changed at all, he has become more serene. Everything else he considers projections by healthy people who blame their insecurity in dealing with the handicapped on the latter. He counts among the most positive experiences "how enormously consoling it is when people are nice to one." That would have been "worth two years in the wheelchair," if he had had a choice. The coming election campaign will again prove that his disability, and the iron will not to let it get him down, has provided him with additional favor and fascination. A politician with a destiny is more fascinating than one with a smooth career. It sounds almost regretful when Schaeuble states that the old FRG had been spared "trials endangering its existence." In his view, such tests would have answered not only the question whether western Germany was more than a fair-weather democracy; they would also have offered a chance to correct undesirable developments. Schaeuble is all the more determined to make use of the upheaval phase of reunification and the elimination of the East-West conflict for this purpose. The attempt to use the Bundeswehr within Germany, which he will pursue until he prevails, is only a small sample. With this Sisyphus as chancellor, for whom spiritual and moral leadership is not an empty word, things could become uncomfortable.
