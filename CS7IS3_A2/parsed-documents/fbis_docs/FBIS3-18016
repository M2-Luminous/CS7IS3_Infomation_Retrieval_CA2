"Either the West fills that void, or Russia will return to a position of dominance," said Fabbri, speaking at the sidelines of a ceremony to inaugurate the 84th course of the NATO Defense College at which he participated today along with President of the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. "The active role of NATO thus remains very important," the minister said, adding he concurred with the view of German Military Chief of Staff Klaus Naumann, who expressed with "crystal clarity" said Fabbri, what was usually said only cautiously in the political-diplomatic sphere: "The unpleasant truth that the West now has to face the Russian problem." While that country was "politically and economically weak, it remains strong in conventional and atomic weapons," he added. "Perhaps as a result of this weakness," Russia now wants "a new Yalta conference and the right to a free hand over what it considers its untouchable sphere of influence," he said. In other comments, Fabbri called Communist Refoundation's position on NATO "out of tune and frankly surprising." That left-wing party's secretary Fausto Bertinotti has declared that NATO was out of date and no longer needed. "Never before as in this moment has the Atlantic alliance been so timely," said Fabbri "precisely because the cold war is over and it is necessary to seek a new equilibrium." NATO is "essential for Western security and for international order," he said. (In other related news, it was announced that the secretary of Italy's Left Democrats would visit NATO headquarters in Brussels Monday [28 February], where he would meet Secretary General Manfred Woerner just before noon before attending a lunch with top members of the Alliance's military and political staff. Occhetto's visit will be the first by a Left Democrat or former Italian Communist to the Allied command.
