FR941007-0-00054 FR941007-0-00014 Oklahoma is not authorized to operate the Federal program on Indian lands. This authority remains with EPA. C. Decision I conclude that DEQ's application for a program revision meets the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, DEQ is granted Final Authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Oklahoma now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and for carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the HSWA. Oklahoma also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA. D. Codification in Part 272 EPA uses 40 CFR part 272 for codification of the decision to authorize DEQ's program and for incorporation by reference of those provisions of its Statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. Therefore, EPA is reserving amendment of 40 CFR part 272, subpart LL until a later date. Compliance with Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of Oklahoma's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. This authorization does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
