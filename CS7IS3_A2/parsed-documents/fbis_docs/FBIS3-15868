Servicemen from Nearby Foreign Countries Set on Coming to Russia"] [Text] It appears that national armies are becoming a national disaster for the independent states of the post-Union space. In fact, the last thing politicians who gained points and earned dividends from the idea of independence are bothered about now is the future of the very armies they advocated creating. They were necessary merely as an essential attribute of embryonic statehood. But when the once common "blanket" was torn up, it turned out that the shreds would not even cover the private parts, if you will excuse the expression. The units which were once the subject of fierce polemics are in a dire state. For example, the regiment of ultramodern Tu-160 strategic bombers, which were once "privatized" with such pomp and ceremony by Ukraine. While they have been under yellow and blue banners, the regiment's pilots have hardly ever been up in the air. For the umpteenth time the military are pawns in political games. The recent flood of requests for transfer to national armies has dried up. The lack of proper social guarantees and the threat of professional degeneration altered the direction of migration. Now the cadre departments of the Russian Army's main commissariats are snowed under with letters in which officers from nearby foreign parts are expressing their willingness to serve anywhere and in any posts. For instance, 800 military pilots have left the Belarusian Armed Forces and are now serving in Russia. They constituted 60 percent of the Belarusian Air Force flight personnel. Also badly weakened by the mass "exodus to Russia" are the Belarusian Airborne Assault Forces, 339 of whose officers have changed their place of service in this way. According to the republic committee for the social protection of servicemen, another 2,500 officers want to go to Russia. Clearly, the independent states cannot afford to keep armies. Moreover, one cannot expect economic progress and a corresponding easing of the crisis in these armed formations in the foreseeable future.
