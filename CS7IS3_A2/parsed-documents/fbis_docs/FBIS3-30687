The FIDESZ would like to see the document signed as soon as possible, FIDESZ Deputy Chairman Tamas Deutsch told the press in Budapest today. Deutsch feels that such an accord is worth concluding on the basis of the principal agreement from Monday's [31 January] meeting of liberal parties, even if party leaders fail to come to an understanding about backing each other. The four-party agreement would concern cooperation during the two election rounds. By the FIDESZ's interpretation, mutual support between party chairmen would mean that in constituencies where the leader of one of the four parties runs for election, the other three parties would enter no candidate. Deutsch announced that, contrary to earlier plans, FIDESZ deputy Imre Frajna will not run for election in the individual constituency where Chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats Ivan Peto will compete for the mandate.
