The meeting was held 22 March at Eduardo Bauza's office. CNEA Chairman Mondino and Bastos agreed on the main aspects. They defined three essential points: -- The state will create an institution that will regulate the granting of licenses for operation of the new power plants, the enforcement of safeguard clauses for operational safety, the implementation of basic research, and the fulfillment of international agreements on the subject. -- One (or several) corporations will be created for the operation of the nuclear plants and for the implementation of the other productive activities currently performed by CNEA. At the beginning the corporations will be totally state-owned, but the Economy Ministry is studying how to privatize them. The model in which Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's team is most deeply interested is that used with YPF [Government Oil Deposits]. -- The state will be held responsible for nuclear damage and for the resolution of the problems caused by radioactive waste and the dismantling of closed plants. The financing of these activities will be made on the basis of fees, while private enterprises operating the plants will designate the state as the beneficiary of specific insurance policies. Mondino's CNEA so far monopolizes all nuclear activities, concerning both research and development and the generation of energy. A commission made of members of the Energy Secretariat (Ministry of Economy) and of the CNEA will now evaluate the various alternatives for structuring and organizing the entrepreneurial sector. The commission has one year to complete the restructuring work. Thus far the only decision is that the nuclear plants and CNEA productive activities will be regulated by the legislation applying to the private sector, and that they will have private capital, in competition with the other enterprises that generate and sell power on the market. It still remains to be decided whether a corporation will run the entire business, or whether there will be several corporations that will take care of individual plants and activities. For example, it is possible to rapidly call for offers for selling nuclear fuel. The CNEA has already contacted foreign enterprises that are interested in buying fuel, and some of them might buy it. Other matters concerning this uncertain situation have to do with whether there will be anyone willing to operate the Atucha-1 or Embalse plants, which are 12 and 20 years old respectively. Won't privatization of nuclear fuel as a separate business make the rest of the deal unattractive? Or to what extent will possible buyers want the state as their local "partner" with the CNEA men who are now running the plants? The answers to these questions will determine the method for transfer to the private sector. Yet it is certain that the next nuclear plants for which licenses will be granted will have fully private capital and that, sooner or later, the private sector will buy part of the shares of the plants that are operating. This point, on which the two officials agreed, seems useless, because no nuclear plants are now being built in the world (except for Atucha-2). Yet according to the projections of the businessmen of the sector, the nuclear business will flourish in the first years of the next century. And they want to have a free path at that time. Another important fact is that construction of Atucha-2 will be completed in two years, with national budget funds. The meeting on 22 March closed a harsh phase in which the Economy Ministry and the CNEA confronted each other over leadership of the sector. It was a dispute over control of a budget allocation of more than $1 billion; Cavallo had almost not even had a chance to learn how this was allocated. At the same time the leadership of the only productive activity that had not sunk with the shipwreck of the state was at stake.
