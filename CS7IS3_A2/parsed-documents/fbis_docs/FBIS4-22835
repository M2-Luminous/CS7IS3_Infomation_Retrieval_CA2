Vorobyev, Institute of High Temperatures at Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow] [Abstract] Research done during the 1969-1991 period concerning the physical mechanisms of laser-induced plasma formation above solid targets is reviewed, formation of low-temperature surface plasma by interaction of laser radiation and solid targets covering the 10[.sup]5[/]-10[.sup]10[/] range of radiation intensity being essentially considered here along with negative and positive technological aspects of the process. The results of experiments with pulsed CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers indicate that formation of a plasma above metal surfaces in air requires a radiation of only about 10 MW/cm[.sup]2[/] intensity in pulses of about 1 ï¿½s duration and of only 0.1-1 MW/cm[.sup]2[/] intensity in millisecond pulses, while breaking down air in the absence of metal surfaces requires as much as 1-10 GW/cm[.sup]2[/]. Two characteristic target temperatures have been defined as parameters of the initial thermal interaction: temperature T* of complete vaporization and temperature T[.sub]b[/] of boiling or sublimation under a given pressure of the ambient gas. The energy relations during thermal stage of target heating to vaporization and the subsequent stage of vapor ionization are examined theoretically with the support of experimental data, for the purpose of determining the threshold laser radiation intensity and the threshold energy density at the target surface. Inasmuch as both threshold depend on the mode of surface plasma formation, the following ones are considered here: S- by heating of the entire target surface, MD- by heating of thermally insulated microdefects, A- by heating and vaporization of aerosol, VGM- by ionization of the target vapor mixed with ambient gas in the diffusion mode, EF- hydrodynamically in the presence of an erosion flare. The review covers plasma formation in these modes above ideally smooth surfaces of many metals ranging from fusible ones (Zn,Pb) to refractory ones (W,Ta) including brass, also of carbon and several oxides (alumina, silica), above surfaces of nonhomogeneous materials such as aluminum alloys with solid inclusions of intermetallic compounds, above microdefective surfaces, and above rough surfaces. Analysis of surface plasma formation in vapor-gas mixtures in the diffusion mode after heating of the entire target surface (S-VGM) are considered two models: quasi-steady vapor distribution within a cloud of finite dimensions and nonsteady vapor distribution within a cloud in statu nascendi, atomic and molecular ambient gases being considered. Analysis of surface plasma in the hydrodynamic mode in the presence of an erosion flare is based on the model of vapor breakdown by a ``heat absorption spike'' or the model of ``avalanche ionization'' in gas layers at the target surface. Despite the subjectivity of researchers and not always consistent research data, the thresholds of surface plasma formation by laser radiation pulses have been in many cases correctly estimated.
