But the government issued a formal comment regretting the U.S. decision to revive the formidable retaliation clause of the Omnibus Trade Act in the wake of the successful conclusion of the multilateral Uruguay Round talks successfully ended and the set-up of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 for a freer trade order. The Foreign Ministry said, "Trade disputes between countries should be solved through settlement procedures of the WTO rather than domestic legal procedures of any one nation." Super 301 is initially targeted at opening Japanese markets as repeatedly reported after the failure of the U.S-Japan summit talks last month to rectify the snowballing U.S. trade deficit, a Foreign Ministry official said. Japan recorded $60 billion trade surplus with the United States last year. But to avoid criticism from the world for retaliation against one specific nation, Mickey Kantor did not pinpoint Japan in announcing the reinstatement of Super 301. An official of the Economic Planning Board said this means that the United States intends to take retaliatory action against an country using unfair trade practices. The Korea Trade Promotion Corp. [KOTRA] and the Korea Foreign Trade Association [KFTA] made similar comments that the United States is likely to use the weapon as a means to pressure all its trading partners recording trade surpluses with the United States to open their markets wider. A KOTRA official cited China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. The United States is also deeply interested in the telecommunications and financial markets of Korea and protection of foreign intellectual property rights here. If the United States obtains what it wants from Japan, it is expected to use the clause against Southeast Asian nations and Korea, the KFTA and KOTRA officials said. Korea has a good relationship with the United States thanks to balanced trade unlike in the late 1980s, they said. But Washington has not decreased its pressure, calling for advancing the market opening timetable in nine fields, including telecommunications and education, at a third conference of the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) last month. Han Yong-su, director-general at the trade cooperation bureau of the Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry said, "Now, we have no outstanding trade disputes with the United States. We have been carrying out the market opening program at a fast pace. We will wait and see how the situation develops." But Super 301 is different from existing Clause 301 by the act that the retaliation procedures are simple and negotiations are comprehensive with each nation involved, not item-by-item or field-by-field negotiations. A a result, its impact on one nation is wide, a KFTA official said. Japan, India and Brazil surrendered to the U.S. threat to use Super 301 in 1989 and India again in 1990. To escape from the naming as a nation for priority negotiation in 1989-90, Korea opened its farm markets wider and drastically eased regulations on foreign investment in advance. Since 1989, Korea has been listed as a priority watch nation for intellectual property rights and has been forced to strengthen protection of property rights under Special 301 which is only applied to that sector. Some businessmen, on the other hand, forecast that Korea will be able to benefit from U.S. pressure on Japan. They claimed that Korea could advance to Japanese markets amid the high yen in a short-term view. The United States wants Japan's automobile and semiconductor markets to open to U.S. exporters. It is reported that Toyota Motor, a leading Japanese car maker, plans to purchase $6 billion worth of auto parts from the Untied States in 1996-97 year as a gesture to ease U.S. retaliation. But Korea should pay keen attention to probable damage from across-the-board U.S. pressure rather than short-term benefits, an observer said.
