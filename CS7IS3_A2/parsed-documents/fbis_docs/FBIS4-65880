"To see Bernard-Henri Levy's film "Bosnia!" in which he plays an important role," the president's advisers consistently argue in order to maintain the fiction of a "private nonpolitical visit." It was therefore vital for the Bosnian president to go and see the film, despite the late hour. So, at around 2230, when the Saudi plane landed at le Bourget Airport, Alija Izetbegovic, accompanied by the Bosnian ambassador to France, climbed into one of the cars placed at his disposal by the official visits department, crossed Paris as if it was a Le Mans race, with motorcycle outriders and flashing lights, and went to the Haute-Feuille cinema, in the Latin Quarter, where Paris' Bosnian community was waiting for him. At the end of the film, President Izetbegovic stood up and addressed his compatriots in Serbo-Croat. "People have heard a great deal said about Bosnia," he said, "but it is much more important to see than to hear. This film is a very powerful documentary which will stir up consciences in France and abroad. You have just seen a painful truth but the film does not show us as victims. It shows the resistance of our people caught between the grip of Croatian fascism and Serbian fascism." The Bosnian president then drew up an optimistic picture of the military situation on the ground: "We are now stronger and they are weaker. I have just visited the front lines and I noticed a strange strength there. Our people cannot be defeated. Faced with the dilemma of `fighting or dying,' we have chosen to live." Condemning the Western countries which "intervened to impose an embargo on arms for Bosnia," Alija Izetbegovic is now asking them to stop intervening: "Let us fight," he cried. "The Serbs have not succeeded in turning us into criminals like them. Does this mean we will forgive them one day? No, we will never forgive what they have done to our women and children." The crowd in the cinema gave a long standing ovation to the president and philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy. At the Raphael Hotel in Paris on Monday morning, the real purpose of the Bosnian president's flash visit to Paris could no longer be concealed: To give support to the campaign of the intellectuals, who will present a list called "Europe Begins at Sarajevo" in the European elections. Izetbegovic came to try to convince the French that the embargo should be lifted and the partition of Bosnia rejected. [passage omitted]
