According to party members, the decision came "due to 'Asfur's role in the negotiations that led to the Cairo agreement on 4 May, an agreement repudiated by the party." 'Asfur's membership in the central committee had been frozen in the past few months due to his participation in the Cairo talks. Upon returning to the Gaza Strip after a 26-year absence, 'Asfur, a resident of 'Abasan, was appointed as supervisor of the civilian and military talks. The communique issued by the central committee reiterates the party's opposition to take part in the self-government. Following the signing of the Cairo agreement, senior party members in the Gaza Strip had been pushing to join the Palestinian Authority institutions "in order to promote democratization," although "this runs counter to the Palestinian People's Party's official line, whereby we should not participate in any official institution of the self-rule authority."
