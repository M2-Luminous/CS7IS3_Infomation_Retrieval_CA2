In practice, this means not reaching an agreement about the proposed changes to the constitution, as the process of amending the constitution requires the agreement of three-fourths of the members of the House of Representatives, a number available only by a political agreement among the three political parties sharing power. It appears that the Yemeni leadership, with its three parties, has moved quickly. Time, too, may have moved quickly. On 14 October, the authority of the Presidential Council that has led Yemen since the declaration of unity expires. If there is no agreement on the proposed constitutional changes, parliament will find itself forced to elect a new Presidential Council; and even this new council is not an object of agreement. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, for example, has stated that he is unwilling for his membership on it to be renewed, thus reviving speculations about possible alternatives the Socialist Party might propose instead of its general secretary. The name of Salih Muhammad, the party's assistant general secretary, has been mentioned in this regard, or political bureau member Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man for membership in the new council, on condition that one of them would become vice chairman of the presidential body. Sources in the People's Congress, which is headed by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, say that attempts at mediation, both domestic and Arab, have taken place during the last two months, since the vice president's return from a European and American tour, with the goal of persuading him to return to the capital, Sanaa, and end his seclusion. These mediations reached a dead end; nevertheless, the attempts were repeated and are still continuing. It should be mentioned in this regard that a parliamentary delegation headed by Shaykh 'Abdallah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar has offered to go to Aden to talk with Salim al-Bid and reach a formula for a new Presidential Council with al-Bid as a member to be formed before 14 October. It is difficult to predict Yemen's future legal and constitutional situation unless one goes back to the real reasons behind the sudden decision to seclude himself that al-Bid made without informing anyone, even the members of the Socialist Party's political bureau. They were surprised by his seclusion, but understood his statements and objections to the constitutional changes after they met with him in Aden during September; this despite the fact that before al-Bid's return from the United States the political bureau itself had agreed to the proposed constitutional changes and had participated with representatives of the two other parties--Reform and People's Congress--in approving them. Was al-Bid not informed of what his party's representatives had approved? In fact, the vice president was apprised of everything that took place in the meetings of the three-party committee that discussed and approved the constitutional changes. Salim Salih Muhammad, the number-two man in the party, has stated that he informed 'Ali Salim al-Bid of all the developments as they occurred. Seclusion What happened? The way in which al-Bid returned to Yemen drew attention. He refused to board the presidential plane reserved for the president and the five Presidential Council members, preferring to board a plane belonging to Alyemda, the southern airline. He took off on 19 August, went to Aden, instead of Sanaa, and refused to meet with any official in the country; neither did he deliver any statement to the information media. Finally, at the end of August, he came out with a fiery speech before the leaders of the Labor Confederation and defined his position on the constitutional changes. It came as a shock to all parties sharing in the government, including the leaders of the Socialist Party. Al-Bid insisted on the need to hold a popular referendum on the changes, although there is no constitutional provision to that effect. For the first time since unification he referred to "balance of interests," although he did not define exactly what he meant by the term. He used astonishing expressions, such as "rejecting incorporation and annexation." Many interpreted the expression as an implied rejection of one provision of the constitutional changes: namely, that only the president should be elected, while the vice president's name would be announced without their necessarily being on one slate. Al-Bid leveled strong criticisms of state and government policies such as weak security measures, failure to arrest the perpetrators of attempted political assassinations, and suspicions of administrative and financial corruption in the government apparatus. What many considered to be the time bombs in al-Bid's speech in fact reflected but one side of the reasons for al-Bid's opposition to the constitutional changes. Leaders of the People's Congress say that the vice president is trying to obtain the best privileges in the proposed constitutional changes--such as election of the president and vice president from one slate, with the vice president having the right to succeed the president for the remainder of his term of office in case of the latter's death or resignation. Sources in the Socialist Party say that a two-party agreement on constitutional changes was concluded one week before the elections. The most important point was agreement to change the form of the presidency from a five-member Presidential Council elected by the House of Representatives to a president and vice president only. The two would be chosen by direct popular election from a single slate after the House of Representatives had pronounced on their integrity. Socialist sources say that the People's Congress tried to change this provision while 'Ali Salim al-Bid was traveling outside the country. The problem in Yemen now is that the complications surrounding the constitutional changes--complications that threaten to cause a political and constitutional vacuum if 14 October passes without an agreement--come at a time when many were expecting that the Socialist Party and the People's Congress would merge and that their parliamentary representatives would form a single bloc. The current disagreements have given impetus to the antimerger wing of the Socialist Party. Leadership sources in the party say that the party's general convention this December will not discuss on its agenda the issue of merging into the People's Congress, which means that the proposal no longer has any meaning at the present time. Army Merger Another aspect of the complications is that the ongoing disagreements have derailed strategic decisions that were supposed to have reached the stage of practical implementation. Perhaps the most important of these was the decision to merge the armed forces, the military police, and the people's security forces, in addition to the forces of central police and security. Many fear that the suspension of unifying the army is the prelude to an unknown and perhaps frightening alternative. The recent resignation of the chief of staff revealed political forces that do not want the armed forces to merge, perhaps so that they can preserve the privileges they used to obtain before unification. In any case, many in Yemen predict that the efforts of the speaker of parliament, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, will succeed in persuading the vice president to end his seclusion, return to Sanaa, and agree to a formula acceptable to the three parties for constitutional changes before 14 October, which coincides with the 30th anniversary of the revolution against British imperialism in the south. On the 18th of the same month, Yemen is to receive French President Mitterrand. It would be unthinkable for these occasions to take place with the vice president absent. Meanwhile, many in the Arab world and Europe are speaking with wonder about the democratic experiment in united Yemen.
