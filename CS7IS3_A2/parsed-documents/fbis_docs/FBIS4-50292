According to statistics, the People's Insurance Company of China in 1993 earned $732 million, or 29.8 percent more than in 1992, from insurance business catering to foreign nationals. It paid a total of $356 million in settlement for losses and its loss ratio was 48.76 percent. Twenty company branches which sell life insurance in Tianjin, Beijing, and other localities each reaped an average of over $10 million worth of insurance premiums from insurance business catering to foreign nationals. This business again grew in the first quarter of this year, yielding tangible social and economic returns. It is understood that since 1993, our country has made greater progress in opening up to the outside world, in importing technologies, in attracting business and investments, and in expanding exports on the north and south of the Chang Jiang. Never before has it come across such a scene of prosperity in insurance business catering to foreign nationals. The People's Insurance Company of China has promptly adjusted its way of thinking to catering to market demand, operated according to international market practices, and at the right moment, set up business in aviation and space insurance, oil exploitation insurance, insurance for the three types of partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, short-term credit insurance for commodity exports, seller's contract responsibility insurance, and insurance on personal injury caused by accidents on domestic flights. At the same time, the company has actively explored overseas markets, established the Hong Kong China Insurance (Group) Limited Company and the London China Insurance Shareholding Limited Company, and set up 71 overseas agencies in Luxembourg, the United States, and other countries.
