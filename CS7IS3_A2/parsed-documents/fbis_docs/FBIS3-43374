Nogueira da Silva reports from Maringue, Renamo's general headquarters. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has admitted that the pacification process in the country will soon enter a difficult phase since most people in rural areas are illiterate. Afonso Dhlakama said it was necessary to educate the people about the meaning of democracy, [words indistinct] and how to vote, among other issues, connected with the electoral process. He said it is necessary to explain to the people that not voting for the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] would not mean their death. Likewise, if people did not vote for Renamo it would not mean that they would be killed, the Renamo president stressed. He said the people are still afraid of Frelimo. At a news conference he gave in Maringue yesterday to mark the New Year, the Renamo leader once again accused the news media organs in the country of being biased. [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] There is still no press freedom in the country. This is what I can say. I have always spoken about this issue and I continue to speak. For example, I am speaking here. If you return today and to do not report what I am saying, if you cut or just try to report bits and pieces of what I am saying, it means that you have no freedom. I shall therefore continue to speak about lack of press freedom. We want to see the freedom of the press in Mozambique and you, as journalists, should correctly inform the people. The people do not want propaganda. They want to hear the truth. In my case, I want the people to hear what I am saying. You should not, therefore, be the ones to cut my words or choose what you think should be reported. You cannot say: Dhlakama's words were too strong. We cannot report them because Frelimo will not like it. Let us report what is not strong. Although I continue to speak about lack of press freedom, I must also say that things are improving. We have to recognize that things are improving. All the same, I would like to see the press have greater freedom in Mozambique than is presently the case. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, do you believe there has been reconciliation in the country since the signing of the general peace accord? [Dhlakama] Well, I can say that there has been. The situation is a little bit difficult. Let us recognize that Freelimo has ruled and continues to rule the country alone. It has not been easy for Frelimo to heed the message of reconciliation. We have been receiving complaints from our members who are maltreated. Some of them are expelled from work. Some of our members who are civil servants are expelled just because they visited Maringue. That is the case with you. You were dismissed from work because you came to Maringue. Today, you work for Renamo full time. There are other cases where our members were expelled, including teachers, (?typists). Others were expelled from companies, hospitals, and so on. We have already talked to the government about it and we think that we shall be able to defend the interests and rights of our members. [end recording]
