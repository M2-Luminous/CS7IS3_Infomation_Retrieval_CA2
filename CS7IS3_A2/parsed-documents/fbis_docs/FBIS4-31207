According to him, fewer than five people are involved. Baudys made this admission just a week after it was made public that there are positively screened generals or colonels in some senior posts in the Army. The minister refused to say, however, in what way and by whom exactly the law was infringed. It was only apparent from his statement that the law was infringed in the case of soldiers serving in posts held by colonels. "Certain inconsistencies were found, which, however, have already been cleared up. These were really individual cases and did not involve any army general. Nevertheless, this was a certain infringement of the law," he said, without specifying what has been done to remedy the situation. Only a week ago, however, the minister denied that positively screened officers were serving in the Army. The director of the Defense Ministry's Personnel Department, Jaroslav Cuhra, also said that the Screenings Law was not infringed in the Army. Baudys had unequivocally discounted the possibility that anyone with a positive screenings certificate could currently be serving in a colonel's or general's post. In connection with Generals Karel Pezl and Rostislav Kotil, who, according to some of the media, had been assigned false screenings certificates, the minister yesterday maintained that the two men comply with the conditions for executing their duties and that they have been accused wrongly.
