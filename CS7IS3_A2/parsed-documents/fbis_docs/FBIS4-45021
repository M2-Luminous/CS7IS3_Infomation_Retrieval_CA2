The Constitution (Eighty-Second Amendment) draft Bill, 1994 on electoral reforms proposed by the Union Government envisages amendment of four Articles in the Constitution in order to confer equal status to Election Commissioners on par with the Chief Election Commissioners [CEC] and provides for fresh delimitation of constituencies on the basis of the 1991 census without effecting the total number of seats allocated to various seats. Copies of the draft Constitution Bill along with 20-odd proposals to amend the Representation of People's Act (RPA), 1950, on the basis of recommendations of Dinesh Goswami Committee, suggestions made by the Election Commission [EC] and certain proposals mooted by the Union Law Ministry were circulated by the government to leaders of political parties at a meeting convened by the Lok Sabha Speaker, Mr. Shivraj V. Patil. The proposed Constitution Bill seeks to confer powers to Election Commissioners on par with the Chief Election Commissioner through amendment to Article 324 with a view to equating other Election Commissioners with the CEC in the matter of their removal from office, provide for the conduct of the business of the Election Commission and prohibit members of Election Commission from holding any other office after they cease to be members. The draft Constitution Bill seeks to insert new Article 324A to ensure that the "business of the Election Commission shall be transacted by the Election Commission as a whole and if the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners differ in opinion on any matter, such matter shall be decided according to the opinion of the majority". Delimitation of Constituencies The Bill proposes fresh delimitation of constituencies on the basis of 1991 census through amendment to Article 81, 82 and 170. Under the existing provisions of the Constitution, no delimitation of constituencies is required to be undertaken until the figures for the first census taken after the year 2000 have been published. Among the significant amendments proposed by the government to the RPA include the provisions for amendment of provision 28 relating to issue of identity cards for electors in notified constituencies and provision 43 relating to residential status of a member of Rajya Sabha. While retaining the powers of the Election Commission on directions to issue identity girds to voters, a new section in the form of 28A is sought to be inserted to make it mandatory for the EC to get prior approval of the Union Government on any its directions relating to identity cards. Section of 43 of RPA is sought to be amended so that a person shall not be qualified to be chosen as a representative of any State or Union Territory in the council of States unless he is an elector for any parliamentary constituency. De-registration of Party Section 29A is proposed to be amended so that no association or body shall be registered as a political party if it bears a religious name and the memorandum or rules and regulations do not conform to provisions of the constitution. Any appeal against a decision of the Commission on the subject shall lie with the Supreme Court within a period of a month from the date of order by the Commission. De-registration of political parties, it has been proposed, may be made by a high court within whose jurisdiction the main office of that party is situated if it promotes or attempts to promote on ground of religion, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious groups. The draft amendment to Section 30 (D) of RPA Act proposes to shorten the minimum of campaigning period from 21 to 14 days. Amendment to Section 34 envisages a minimum security deposit of Rs. 1000 by a candidate of a recognised political party and Rs. 5000 by in independent candidate. It is only Rs. 500 for SC/ST [expansion not given] candidates. A new section is proposed substituting the existing Section 52 of RPA on procedure to be adopted on the death of a candidate of a recognised political party before poll. The proposal is not to countermand an election on the death of any candidate. In case of death of candidate set up by a recognised political party, the election should be adjourned for a fortnight and the recognised political party should be allowed to nominate a new candidate within two days of the death of its candidate. A new part with a new section to be called 78A is proposed to be introduced to RPA to make a beginning towards state funding of elections to candidates of recognised political parties. Supply of free copies of electoral rolls, certain quantity of petrol, a certain number of vehicles as may be laid down by the Union Government and payment of hire charges for microphones is envisaged.
