In the last few years the two banks have done a great deal in handling this professional work, playing a positive role in promoting China's foreign-related labor services. However, viewing the implementation of the provisional method, the management of the "fund" seems to have been out of line with the detailed handling of loan business, making it difficult for MOFERT to know about the use and recovery of the funds on loan or the collection of management fees for it. To further strengthen the management of the cooperative fund, MOFERT has now decided, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, to take direct charge of the "fund's" loan business as of 1 January 1991, whereas the "fund's" foreign exchange and renminbi deposits will continue to remain in the two banks. The funds which are released on loan before the end of 1990 will still be handled by the two banks until their recovery. [Signed] The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, [Dated] 17 September 1990.
