A gift-conveying ceremony took place in Harare, Zimbabwe on February 14. Speaking at the ceremony, N.T. Mawema, member of the Central Committee and director of the Political and Cultural Department of the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and chairman of the Zimbabwean National Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea, referred in detail to the history of the revolutionary activities of Comrade Kim Chong-il. The chairman said: Kim Chong-il, he is just socialist Korea. It is under the leadership of the great general Comrade Kim Chong-il with literary and military accomplishments and with loyalty and filial piety that Korean-style socialism is imposingly rising in the east of the globe, throwing its rays all over the world. According to his interpretation of the gift, the gift "bell" is symbolic of the sound of the bell of chuche calling mankind to the accomplishment of the cause of independence and the tiger inscribed in the "bell" represents the majestic appearance of the general making the imperialists and the renegades of socialism shudder. The gift was conveyed to the DPRK ambassador to Zimbabwe.
