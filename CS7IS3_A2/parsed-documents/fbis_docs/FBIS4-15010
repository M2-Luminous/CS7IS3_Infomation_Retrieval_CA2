Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRUA] and Russian Federation minister of nationalities affairs and regional policy, in turn issued a statement in support of the idea of a confederative union of Eurasian states and passed to the editorial office the draft Confederative Agreement which he advanced in 1992, which was announced in the PRUA election platform, and which is published below. The party's statement says, in particular, that "not only the peoples but also many political forces in the CIS countries are already prepared not just to discuss the idea of creating such a union but also to work out specific questions of its activity." We advance, the PRUA declares, the idea of forming an International Working Group comprising representatives of countries which wish to conclude the Confederative Agreement or of political and public organizations which share this desire. We are also prepared to take on the resolution of organizational-technical and financial questions relating to ensuring this group's activity. The draft Confederative Agreement, the statement reads, should be regarded as a conceptual base for a future interstate treaty. The simultaneous elaboration of a package of necessary treaties and agreements directly associated with the idea of a Eurasian confederation is proposed. (Draft) Confederative Agreement The Russian Federation, acknowledging the historical significance and effectiveness of the interstate relations achieved within the framework of the CIS, striving, in the name of the interests of the peoples of the High Contracting Parties, for further integration and effective cooperation on economic, sociocultural, and defense questions, confirming that none of the provisions of this agreement is directed or can be interpreted to the detriment of the CIS or of the treaty relations and other relations of each of the contracting parties among themselves or with other states, and preserving the independence and the inviolable sovereign rights of the states that are party to the agreement, have [as published] agreed on the following. I: The High Contracting Parties conclude the Confederative Agreement, whose contents and the ways to implement which are defined by this document and by treaties signed on its basis. II: The High Contracting Parties have agreed to the creation of the Confederative Economic Community (CEC) as the basis of the Confederative Agreement. The CEC ensures: the revival and development of a common market of the Confederative Agreement member countries as a single economic area without customs borders and not hindering free cooperation among business subjects or the circulation of commodities, services, and capital within the Community, the creation of a common currency system and banking system based on the preservation of the national currencies of these states and on agreed principles of credit and monetary regulation, the implementation of a concerted customs and export-import policy in respect of states which are not parties to the Confederative Agreement, the creation of the Eurasian Investment Bank to fund programs and projects aimed at the economic development of the countries that are party to the Confederative Agreement, the phased standardization of the civil-law and financial legislation of the states which have concluded the Confederative Agreement. To carry out the tasks facing the CEC, the CEC Governmental Committee is formed and is empowered to adopt decisions on questions of the implementation of a common economic policy in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.
