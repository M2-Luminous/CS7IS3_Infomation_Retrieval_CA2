Professor Motofumi Asai of Meiji Gakuin University in his report at the meeting titled "On the `Emergency Security Legislative Arrangements' and the Korean Question" said Japan's preparation of the "legislative arrangements" is a political plot aimed at turning itself into a military power, which involves "troop dispatch overseas" of its "Self-Defence Forces". He added that Japan has been increasing tensions by whipping up the clamour about "a nuclear threat" from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a bid to put it into effect. Jiro Suzuki, an honorary professor of Tokyo Metropolitan University, made a report titled "On the Human Rights of Koreans in Japan and Discriminations Against Them". He said "sanctions" have been taken in Japan in the form of crackdown on Koreans in Japan, while politicians are crying for the "emergency security legislative arrangements" and "sanctions" against the DPRK. An appeal opposing the "emergency security legislative arrangements" and calling for a peaceful solution of the Korean question was adopted at the meeting. Saying the Japanese Government authorities' preparation of the "legislative arrangements", choosing the DPRK as an imaginary "enemy", is an extremely dangerous anti-peace, anti-democratic move, the appeal strongly urged them to give up the preparation and strictly control criminal acts against Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.
