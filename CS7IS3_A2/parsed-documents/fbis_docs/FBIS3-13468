Mir, 30, the former commander-in-chief of the guerrilla wing of the Moslem separatist group, was arrested along with another man when the car in which they were travelling was stopped by border guards, the witnesses said. The pair were pulled out of the car and whisked away by the Indian paramilitary troops, they said. The other man, whose identity was not immediately known, was later released. JKLF sources here confirmed the arrest of the JKLF president but there was no immediate word from the Indian authorities. The stocky and bearded Mir was one of the four founders of the Moslem separatist rebellion which began in India's only Moslem-majority state in 1989 and his arrest is seen as a major setback to the movement. Of the other three architects of the armed struggle against Indian rule, two are dead and the third is in prison. Mir, who worked for the state waterworks department before picking up a gun, carried a reward of 50,000 rupees (1,666 dollars) on his head and topped the list of Kashmiri Moslem militants wanted by the Indian authorities. A native of Sringar, Mir has been accused by the Indian authorities of singlehandedly carrying out several deadly attacks against Indian troops deployed in the northern state. The outlawed JKLF is the second most powerful Moslem separatist organization in Kashmir after the Hizbul Mujahedeen, which favors a merger of the state with Pakistan. Unlike the Hizbul and most other groups, the JKLF seeks independence for the Himalayan territory. Mir is the third top leader of the JKLF to be arrested in the past fortnight and his arrest comes just a day after he made a surprise appearance at the main mosque in Srinagar to deliver a speech from the pulpit. Last week, Mir was among a group of Kashmiri Moslem leaders who met here with a team of 10 New Delhi-based diplomats who toured the strife-torn state. More than 8,000 people have died in Moslem-separatist related violence in Kashmir since 1989. India, which holds the southern two-thirds of Kashmir, accuses Pakistan, which controls the northern third, of arming and training the militants waging the fight against India rule. Pakistan denies the charge but provides diplomatic support to a campaign which it describes as a legitimate struggle for self-determination.
