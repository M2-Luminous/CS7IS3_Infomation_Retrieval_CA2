"The Russian military helped to stop the bloodshed inspired by extremist-minded politicians in summer 1992," said the colonel. "So, no matter what they say the 14th Army remains a stabilizing factor in the region and its presence cools hotheads on both banks of the Dniester River." In the opinion of Baranov, the troops pullback in 1994, as it is suggested by the Moldovan side, is unreal. Re-location of the Army is difficult and costly. The more so, the trans-Dniester region is a native land of many officers, many of them have families, relatives and housing in the region. "Hasty and poorly-considered decisions on the army pullback may result in undesirable consequences. I hope this is understood both in Moscow and Kishinev," stressed the colonel.
