Bento was reconfirmed with five votes in favor, one abstention, and four votes against. The "yes" vote is due to the fact that it has been established that he has returned his Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party membership card. It is worth noting, however, that Engineer Inacio Bento only gave up his Frelimo Party membership card on 11 January, the day after he had been selected by the opposition. MEDIAFAX learned this yesterday from Hermenegildo Infante, head of the Frelimo Party Central Committee Mobilization and Propaganda Department. According to that source, Inacio Bento delivered his membership severance letter by hand to an official of the Registry Department, in the Frelimo Central Committee headquaters, at 1030 on 11 January. In his letter, Bento alleged that he had never done any specific work within the Frelimo Party and he added that he had been neither a relevant nor an effective member, but the head of the mobilization and propaganda department said that Inacio's allegations are false because he had done work of some responsibility in the Frelimo Party cell at the National Hycarbon Company, ENH. Hermenegildo Infante further noted that Bento should have surrendered his severance letter at the party cell committee at ENH and that he had been "dishonest" when he claimed to have done so "a long time ago." Bento's letter carries the date of 20 December, but was only received at the Frelimo Central Committee Registry Department on 11 January. Our source in the Frelimo Party said that his party's statutes grant members the right to renounce their membership. According to Infante, not many do so, but "there are some who desert" the party. He added that in Niassa Province, for instance, there were some "desertions" in mid-1993.
