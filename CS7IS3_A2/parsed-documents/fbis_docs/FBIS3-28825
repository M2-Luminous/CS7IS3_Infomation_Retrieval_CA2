We consider this action has been unavoidable in view of the given unpredictable situation of the economy and the fast approaching Japan-U.S. summit. It will have the effect of stimulating the economy. We believe it should be turned into a first step for fundamental tax reform, and should be linked to discussions on tax reform -- with the future of Japan's economy in perspective. A public opinion survey conducted by phone by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN revealed about 60 percent of the people recognize the need to raise the consumption tax in the future. If this is viewed against the hustle among the government and ruling parties over the last several days, it becomes clear that the politicians and bureaucrats have wasted precious time in anachronistic bargaining. The general public accurately understands the need for fundamental tax reform. The happenings witnessed in the prime minister's out-of-the-blue announcement for a "national welfare tax" of 7 percent, and then scrapping the idea, are nothing but an outcome of attempts to deceive the people. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa insisted "there was a problem in the process of arriving at a decision." But he should have also repented for not having trusted the people. What is important in future discussions is to define the forthcoming tax reductions as the first step in fundamental tax reform which will be based on readjusting the weight of direct and indirect taxes. To do that, it is essential to make reductions in the income and residential tax not a temporary event for only one year, but to incorporate the reductions in the revised progressive system when the taxation system is reformed next year. The revenue for shortfalls from the tax reductions must come from increasing the consumption tax. Of course, thorough rationalization of expenditures should become a condition to it. But raising the consumption tax is unavoidable if the government wants to stop the financial conditions from worsening further, and yet still build a taxation system appropriate for the upcoming society made up of an aged population. Hence, the point of concern should rest only with when the increases begin and how high the rate should be set. The coalition parties have agreed to pass related bills by the end of this year. In view of the existing economic situation, it is desirable that they be extensive and flexible in substance. Furthermore, as we have said time and again, debate on them should be made on the principle of respecting the "neutrality of tax revenue" [as published]. The government should push ahead with the new tax measures, regarding them as tax reductions to stimulate the economy, and also as a step toward building up a tax system which can support a society made up of an aged population. In doing so, the government should present a future vision of Japan's economy as specifically as possible. Besides, in increasing the consumption tax, the government needs to take another look at the current simplified levying [kani-kazei] system which is creating the problem of the so-called "eki-zei" [pocketing of tax money by businesses]. The government should not think about changing the name of the consumption tax or about confining uses for the money collected from it. It should not be necessary to again point out the problems which will arise if the consumption tax -- which is as important a source of tax revenue as much as the income tax -- is made a specific tax earmarked for use only for stated purposes. It should not even be necessary to cite past examples when warning about the danger of such actions creating rigid expenditures. It is essential that discussions on tax reform should involve all Japanese. The government must not rely on politicians' logic or bureaucrats' theories alone. Of course, using tax reform as a means of political strife must be banned. We request the government provide as much information as possible to the general public to aid in their understanding and as a way of ensuring no mistakes are made in the future.
