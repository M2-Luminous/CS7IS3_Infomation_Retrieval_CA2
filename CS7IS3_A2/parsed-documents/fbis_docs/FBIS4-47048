This is an absurdly short period in historical terms, but is long enough for us to take stock. The results of our stocktaking will depend on our mood, since there are not very many indisputable statements to be made -- it is beyond dispute, for instance, that a normalization of contacts is better and more civilized than a lack of contacts for ideological reasons; it is beyond dispute that the establishment of ties between Moscow and Seoul has helped to stabilize the situation in the region; and it is beyond dispute that new prospects have opened up for the development of diverse and mutually advantageous partnership ties with great potential. That is probably everything on the "obvious" list. In our subsequent assessments of any problem or aspect of our bilateral "baggage" everything will depend on interpretation. Particularly if it is a question not of an amorphous or hard-to-calculate "political dialogue" but of specific economic matters, which sometimes set the entire tone of our relations. Judge for yourselves. Previously there was no direct trade, while deals done through intermediaries in third countries barely amounted to $10 million. Now mutual trade turnover has surged to $1.5 billion, and the advantages of direct contacts are obvious. Is that an achievement? Certainly, but on the other hand, statistics show that the trade turnover growth rate is slowing with every passing year, certain sectors are marking time, and the development of contacts is being held up by a lot of objective and subjective factors. We are doing worse than other countries "new" to Korea -- for instance, Seoul's trade turnover with China is several times more than its trade with Russia, and the Koreans even have more investments in Uzbekistan or Vietnam than they have here. What is there to be complacent about there? Another illustration is the talk about opening a new market for Russia -- virtually a "gateway to the Asia region." Is this correct? Once again, on the one hand, it is (if you are thinking of the market for sales of raw materials and semimanufactures), but obviously it is not if we are talking about the market for finished goods and products. The Koreans would be quite right to credit themselves with having made a breakthrough into the Russian commodity market, but the reverse is not true -- there is not even any hint of reciprocity. Our relations, which seem to be developing but have at the same time managed to get really bogged down, moving from a galloping beginning to a "middling" rate as we end our first four years, essentially consist of such "pros" and "cons." And although, on the eve of the Russo-Korean summit, there is a strong temptation to talk about what has been achieved in good terms and to proclaim our present situation as active and dynamic, we should not deceive ourselves. Calling a spade a spade, it has to be admitted that our contacts lack any systematic, well-thought-out approach and are motivated -- at least on the Russian side -- by an inescapable sense of drift, occasionally interrupted by various sporadic and impromptu leadership demarches designed, as a rule, to mark trips and diplomatic tours. When the tours end, these demarches are mutually forgotten. However much we may want positive news, in their years together Moscow and Seoul have not seen through to a successful conclusion or even begun any of the major projects devised and proclaimed at top level. Korean official statistics, for instance, put the number of joint undertakings with Russia at the modest figure of 28, and the size of Korean investment at $26 million. The only memorable large-scale actions have been the operation for massive deliveries of South Korean soap and washing powder during the Soviet "soap crisis" and the $1.5 billion in loans which Gorbachev's Moscow obtained as a reward for its forced march toward the establishment of diplomatic relations. Incidentally, twice as much had been promised, but Seoul froze the second half, since no payments on the first half had been forthcoming. This debt hitch, as far as the Koreans are concerned, has turned into a sore point that will not go away. Admittedly, in actual fact the problem is small in money terms, but very convenient for Seoul tactically. And although Moscow is offering in payment raw materials, weapons, or land in the Russian capital for Korean use for 99 years, there has been no progress on the debt issue, which serves as a major and excellent argument in altercations with Korea's Russian partners when the latter complain about the shortage of investment or the Korean side's reluctance to develop Siberia's resources or tackle other major projects. But we should not grumble at the Koreans for their intractability and formal approach -- they have their own interests, and this is not the main problem. The problem, it seems to me, is that Russia has no interests, and over the past four years of regular contacts Moscow has still not decided where it stands on the main issue -- just where does the Republic of Korea rank in the system of Russian political, diplomatic, and economic priorities? For instance, the beautiful formulas about complementary economic potential that can be heard from time to time are not the goal of the process, just a slogan and another line in official documents. In other words, Russia is suffering from diplomatic and economic anemia, totally vague ideas about its own future interests, and a lack of consistent action. Conversely, Seoul is using Moscow skillfully and with pleasure, obtaining visible and tangible benefits for itself. Through diplomatic relations with the USSR a bridge was built toward the normalization of contacts with China; Korea's position in the region was strengthened; a new point of support [tochka opory] emerged, as it were; and its room for maneuver was increased. South Korea is now freely and exclusively for its own benefit siphoning off Russia's "gray matter," transferring our scientific personnel very cheaply and without any great fuss to its own laboratories; the Koreans are gradually opening up the Russian raw materials market and taking what they need in the amounts they need. Translated into the language of priorities, this means that Korea has, as it were, set aside three "niches" for Russia -- the political niche (the function of providing a balance and counterweight in regional policy, which is very important for Seoul, hemmed in as it is by giants such as the United States, Japan, and China); the technological niche (neither the Japanese, the Americans, nor the Europeans are making new technology freely available to the Koreans, nor will they, and without this technology the "engine" of the Korean economy -- exports -- will rapidly grind to a halt); and the raw materials niche. Seoul is "trawling" through these three areas in line with its own needs. Current Korean interests make no provision for a close alliance with Moscow politically and are not prompting them economically to make major financial investments or to implement giant projects -- something, quite apart from anything else, for which the creaky Korean economy (which urgently needs fundamental restructuring) is itself objectively unprepared. As a result we now have the kind of relationship with Seoul that Seoul wants. The common references to Russian musical chairs and vagueness are of little importance in this instance. The objective difficulties caused by market and semimarket reforms, the sad nature of Russian economic reality, and our political instability are all not so much a cause of delays in our bilateral relations, rather they are the background against which these delays occur. The reason is that the existing volume and structure of relations satisfies South Korea, it simply does not need any more from Moscow. And Moscow is cast in the unenviable role of an extra engaged in its own domestic squabbles. Russian "traders" are currently the only people at the moment who are really deriving any professional benefit from contacts with Korea. However much they may be looked down upon by officials, there is no denying the obvious fact that these traders are investing tens of millions of dollars in Korea, they are organizing trade specialization with whole areas of Korea, and, finally -- unlike the Russian Government or Russian regions -- they have access to Korean private credit (something which Russian official structures can only dream about). These "trader diplomats" can be accused of anything you like, but you cannot deny that they clearly target end results and certainty in their intentions and choice of goal. These small wholesale-market hustlers are, regrettably, sometimes better known and better respected in Korea than many official representatives of the country that produced them. This is a paradox, but it is natural, since the invention of slogans and the search for ways to show that Russia is great and influential do not produce any real returns. Eloquent evidence of this is the simple fact that the Russian Embassy in Seoul is housed in a gloomy barrack-like building surrounded by street drains and with a frontage hard up against a dirty fence covered with garbage. The two-headed bird on the embassy plaque is facing away from the fence, but both the heads gaze on an unedifying scene, while St. George the Conqueror's lance is absurdly pointing at a dent in the roof in which a dirty pool of water has formed. Where is your pride, great Russia, and what is the point in puffing out your official cheeks if even this trivial matter of economic representation cannot be properly resolved? After all, it is not the "harmful Koreans" who are to blame, but Moscow alone which has permitted itself to be humiliated and has lost all face in its quest for a "new face." And this wrong note, incidentally, applies not only to Russo-Korean ties, but also directly to Russia's positions in the entire Asia-Pacific region. It is high time that our leaders gave this some thought. Moscow's foreign policy in the socialist era was a high-profile appendage of the system -- it cost a pittance, but it carried out its ideological tasks. Now the regime is different, and it is not the function of an appendage that is important in foreign policy, but the function of safeguarding genuine national interests. There should be fewer declarations and initiatives -- nobody will shed any tears for them. But we simply must sort out our priorities and decide what our aims and tasks are. As people like to say, we can do anything we set our minds on. But just when will we finally set our minds on doing something?
