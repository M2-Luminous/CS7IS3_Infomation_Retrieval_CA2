Our correspondent Gulsefa Ahmedova reports: [Begin recording] [Ahmedova] The situation on the fronts and in the Army and measures to end the more than five-year war were discussed at a meeting that was devoted to the military-political situation in the Republic and problems connected with the creation of the army. Rasul Guliyev informed the meeting that, despite contacts at various levels to put an end to the Armenian aggression, the opposing side is doing everything to prevent the resolution of the conflict by peaceful means. No matter what the difficulties are, the Azerbaijani people will shape their own destiny. Only we ourselves should solve all our problems. [Guliyev] The future and destiny of Azerbaijan rests solely in the hands of the people. No one, be they our close neighbors or countries friendly to us elsewhere, will solve the Azerbaijani people's problems. For that reason, we must have a strong army, internal unity, and economic potential. We must also deal decisive and courageous blows against the enemy. Such blows will bring peace closer. The opposing side will opt for peace only when faced with force. [Ahmedova] The chairman of the Supreme Soviet also informed the meeting that Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of the Armenian parliament, phoned him and expressed his wish for a meeting. It is highly possible that this meeting could take place on Saturday. Prime Minister Suret Guseynov and heads of main departments at various ministries were taking part in the meeting. The meeting is continuing behind closed doors. [end recording]
