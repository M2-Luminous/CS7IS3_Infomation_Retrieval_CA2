Speaking to the Foreign Press Association, Rabin rejected the PLO's demands for more radical action against the Israeli settlers in the territories. Jack Katzenell reports: [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Prime Minister Rabin made an impassioned appeal to the Palestinian leadership not to allow the late Barukh Goldstein to succeed in his aim of halting the peace process by means of the atrocity at the Hebron mosque. These are crucial days, Rabin said, and much will depend on how quick the negotiations are resumed. [Rabin] The longer it will be dragged, the more it will be difficult to resume them, and the situation on the ground will be complicated. I believe that at this stage, the leadership on both sides -- the Palestinian and us -- has to stand up, to overcome pain, sorrow, and agony, and to understand that the real solution is in the political field. [Katzenell] Rabin rejected Palestinian demands for the disarming of all the settlers. For decades the settlers have been the object of Palestinian terrorism, Rabin said, and even since the Oslo agreement, they have been the victims of terrorist attacks by the organizations opposed to the peace. [Rabin] In coping with terror and violence, there were Palestinian victims, mainly in confrontations with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and other security forces, but terror by Israelis, killing, was very rare, if at all. [Katzenell] Rabin also rejected suggestions that the settlers be evacuated from down-town Hebron. In his view, this would mean accepting the Palestinian demand for immediate negotiations on the future of the settlements, and that would be a breach of the Declaration of Principles. If we reopen signed agreements after only five months, Rabin said, what value will there be to any new agreements that we sign with the Palestinians.

Rabin said that parties to the negotiations might take advantage of the absence of a Russian-U.S. cooperation. ["Speaking to foreign reporters, the prime minister said Israel will continue imposing the closure on the territories for as long as Israel believes it necessary. He added that the attorney general is examining the possibility of issuing additional detention orders against Kakh activists in the territories. Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports that Rabin further said: I have taken all the necessary steps to prevent a massacre in Hebron, to the best of my discretion and with the best means I had at my disposal."]
