The defense minister's statement to the AL-ANBA' newspaper followed reports on the dependence of the U.S. Army on new missiles, cancelling its dependence on the Patriot in air defense missions. The Kuwaiti defense minister clarified to the newspaper that the new type of missiles were still being tested for their effectiveness. He added that the upgraded Patriot missile that was being used by the U.S. Army would be the same type used by Kuwaiti forces. Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah justified the delay in purchasing these missiles and other types of armament and military equipment for the forces by citing a delay in the approval of the military budget. He also added that a reduction in the number of American technicians working in the various army units came after they had concluded their duties. He said they had completed their business and that their contracts had ended in a normal manner.
