"Protection of the environment will be the driving force for the growth of the European Union [EU]," he said in a lecture delivered at the Catalan Employers for Europe organization, where he was introduced by its chairman, Carles Gasoliba, before a very large audience comprising representatives of the administration and industrialists. During his address, Paleokrassas, a conservative Greek politician who was twice a minister in his country, outlined the main aspects of the EU's new environmental policy. He said that it seeks to banish the idea of industrial production based on the depletion of natural resources and to replace it with a principle aimed at protecting and safeguarding this natural heritage for future generations. He also stressed that protection of the environment should not be just a policy in itself but should be a precondition for industrial expansion. "The new course in environmental policy (the European Commission's white paper) is that economic and fiscal means should be used, instead of the old methods of legislation and controls," because, among other reasons, "it has been seen that this is not effective," Paleokrassas told this newspaper. To this effect, the commissioner believes that the cost of products should include the environmental cost stemming from the natural resources which they deplete, the pollution which they produce, or the waste which they create. Within this same strategy, he supports the European Commission's decision to impose ecological taxes in order to increase the cost of using energy sources which cause carbon dioxide emissions, as a way to alleviate the greenhouse effect. He said that unless this method is used, the volume of carbon dioxide emissions would not be stabilized at the 1990 levels, which the EU had set itself as an overall target. "If the carbon dioxide tax is not adopted, studies show us that it would exceed the 1990 levels by 3 percent in the year 2000," he warned. He also supports Jacques Delors' proposal for "waging a crusade" to extend this ecological tax to the whole world. "The greatest danger is of these emissions increasing in the rest of the world, where there is no control," he added. He refuted the idea that the economic crisis subordinates environmental concerns: "In Europe, measures in the environmental field will create at least 2.5 million jobs over the next five years, and other studies show that this figure could rise to 5 million," he stated. Paleokrassas deemed generally "insufficient" the programs drawn up by the various countries in order to fulfill the commitments which they undertook at the Earth Summit (1992) in signing the climate change treaty, and claimed that only Europe has drawn up plans to combat the effects of a possible climatic change. On the implementation of EU directives, he said that Spain in general carries out those concerning the protection of birds, "but the degree of fulfillment is not as satisfactory in the case of public works and conducting environmental impact studies. Spain is in an intermediate position; it is not among the worst," he concluded.
