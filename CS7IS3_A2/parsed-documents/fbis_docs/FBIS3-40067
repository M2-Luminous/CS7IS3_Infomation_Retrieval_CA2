The development should be sustainable, quick, and sound so as to revitalize the machine-building sector and make it a real pillar industry in Jiangsu. To meet this target, we must make ceaseless efforts to emancipate our minds, seize every opportunity available, and work assiduously and in a down-to-earth way to fulfill all related tasks. Above all, we must correctly handle the following 10 relationships with respect to our state of mind and method of work: 1. Correctly handle the relationship between strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control and developing the industry. To meet the needs of developing the economy and deepening the reform, the party Central Committee and State Council have put forth a series of policy-related measures aimed at strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control. This is absolutely necessary and timely. A review of our province's machinery industry shows that after breaking the 20-billion-yuan mark last year, the gross output value of this industry increased further by 55.31 percent during the first half of 1993, surpassing the province's industrial growth by 10.71 percentage points and the average growth of the nation's machinery industry by 21.59 percentage points. For the same period, increases in sales and in economic returns both outpaced the growth of production. Affected by the increasingly tight macroeconomic environment, however, this year's monthly production growth has kept declining--each month the growth rate has declined 2 to 3 percentage points. For the entire first half of this year, the farm machinery sector registered a 17-percentage-point drop in its monthly production growth, while for the construction machinery sector the decline was as great as 31 percentage points. Meanwhile, there emerged more factors that increased production costs and reduced profit yield; for the first half of this year alone, a reduction in profit by 1.4 billion yuan was attributable to these factors. Losses suffered by those known as loss-incurring enterprises climbed up to a fairly big extent. Due to an acute shortage of circulating funds in the hands of enterprises, only 14.4 percent of the funding requirements could be met for key technological-upgrading projects. As of the end of June, the three kinds of tied-up funds [funds tied up by products in stock, by goods in transit, and by receivables and prepaid accounts] had amounted to 6.69 billion yuan, up 20.9 percent from the figure registered a year ago. Urgently needed primary and auxiliary materials were in short supply, resulting in a surge in prices. Transportation facilities and electric power supply were far from adequate to meet the demands. If we do not promptly correct the above situation by beefing up macroeconomic regulation and control, the output and economic returns of the entire machinery industry will continue to slide, and some sectors of this industry will encounter more serious problems in production and operations and may even be bogged down in predicament. Although it has not been long since the macroeconomic regulatory and control measures designed by the CPC Central Committee were put into effect in Jiangsu, they have nevertheless produced remarkable results. This has undoubtedly provided a rare opportunity for the machinery industry -- which serves as an equipment supplier in the entire economy -- to adjust and develop itself. We should seize this opportunity, value it highly, and make good use of it. On the one hand, under macroeconomic regulation and control, we should be versed in enlivening our microeconomic activities to achieve development. On the other hand, we should see to it that the various microeconomic activities we are carrying out are at all times consistent with and subordinate to macroeconomic regulation and control. That is, it is necessary to seriously implement the party Central Committee's policy decision of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control and, at the same time, achieve a sustained, quick, and sound development of the machinery industry. This year, our province's machinery industry should make every effort to meet the targets of a sales revenue of more than 30 billion yuan (a growth rate of 30 percent) and a total profit and tax contribution to the state amounting to 2.2 billion yuan (a growth rate of 20 percent) so as to consolidate its pillar-industry position. 2. Correctly handle the relationship between the total production increase and the three kinds of tied-up funds. An increase in total output inevitably requires more circulating funds. The two have a certain inherent relationship. We should take such measures as enlivening the utilization of the present assets and making best use of the increased capital to avoid or minimize as much as possible the need for increasing the circulating funds and to reasonably control the three kinds of tied-up money. This way we will bring about a self-perpetuating and highly efficient production growth. A current problem of our province's machinery industry is that with the growth of total output, the three kinds of tied-up funds have kept increasing. In August, the stockpile of products reached 4 billion yuan. Planning production in strict accord with market demands and making an all-out effort to limit the output of certain items, slash their stockpiles, promote sales, collect and avert accounts receivables, and maintain a reasonable amount of stock are key to controlling the three kinds of tied-up funds. We should do this seriously so that we may increase the machinery industry's total output while keeping the three kinds of tied-up funds at a reasonable level and achieving a fast and sound development of this industry. 3. Correctly handle the relationship between production speed and product quality. In reality, this involves the question of how to correctly handle the relationship between the quantity and quality of production. We should reach a consensus of thought on the following points and put them into practice in our work. -- Without good quality, quantity will be meaningless, and no real, effective speed can be spoken of. Quality is the life of enterprises. Failing to pay attention to quality, an enterprise or a trade will have no future, and its development will be out of the question. -- While ensuring quality as a prerequisite, we should go in for greater quantity and speed. Authorities in charge of the machinery industry should guide the enterprises to operate "as independent socialist commodity producers and dealers, responsible for their own profits and losses and for their own decision about whether to expand" with attention focused on product quality. They should be guided to improve their product quality as a way to boost their operational efficiency so that they will really embark on the road of efficiency through quality. -- When contradictions arise between product quality and production speed, it is imperative to adhere to the principle of "giving priority to quality." This is especially important. Sample quality inspections conducted by the state and by the ministry concerned in the first quarter of this year revealed that the percentages of standard-quality products turned out by the province's machinery industry were only 67.03 and 66.67 percent, respectively. This shows that product quality is a problem worthy of concern. Therefore, while production is developing quickly, great attention should be devoted to the question of quality. By taking the current drives to transform enterprise operational mechanism and modify government functions as an opportunity, we must seriously carry out the "Product Quality Act" and use the market as a mechanism to gear up quality control and supervision so as to ensure a sound and fast development of production. It is necessary to rely on progress in science and technology to raise our product quality in an effort to catch up with the advanced world standards as soon as possible. 4. Correctly handle the relationship between product development and the optimization of product mix. Now, Jiangsu's machinery industry turns out nearly 20,000 different varieties and specifications of products. Among them, close to 3,000 are main products. Recently my department has made an analysis of the development levels of 7,821 products made by the machinery industry and found that only 8.34 percent of them are up to the world's standard of the 1980s. Those meeting the standards of the "late 1970s and early 1980s" account for 21.63 percent, those up to the standards of the 1970s, 55 percent; and those below the standards of the 1960s, 15.03 percent. As can be seen, the proportions of products in terms of their levels of development are not so rational. Further, products meeting high standards have been developed slowly, while most products being turned out are of low standards. Such a state of affairs neither meets the needs of our economic development nor is in the interest of achieving a sustained, quick growth of the machinery industry itself. For this reason, in developing new products, we should not only pay attention to expanding the variety and categories of products and increasing the models and specifications in each category, but also attach great importance to improving their quality. We should strive to develop products made by high and new technologies, products that are a combination of machines and electric equipment, and other products belonging to the technology-intensive category. Meanwhile, we should constantly adjust and optimize of our present product mix. With the market condition as a guidance and using brand-name and competitive products as model commodities, we should strive to transform, reorganize, and reform our lines of production so as to boost the percentage of high-technology, good-quality, highly profitable, and readily marketable products. In addition, we should successfully adjust our production plans to suit the demands by adopting the strategy of "wresting the market for urgently needed products, expanding the mass production of highly marketable products, upgrading the quality of moderately marketable products, and replacing nonmarketable products with marketable ones." This way we will be able to constantly adjust and optimize our product mix. To sum up, we should pay close and earnest attention to every aspect of product-mix optimization, from setting targets and developing new products to promoting technological transformation and boosting the marketability of products. 5. Correctly handle the relationship between the development of the industry and the development of advantages and characteristic conditions in various localities. As an early developed traditional industry and an equipment industry, the machinery industry has a relatively big influence on and is rather closely related to other industries. Because of this, it has received due attention in all regions (cities and counties) and is listed as one of the key undertakings to be developed locally. On the other hand, we have noted that the products made by our province's machinery industry have a serious problem of low standards, that the lines of production in various regions show a tendency to be identical, and that the development and production of new products are at a slow pace. As a result, the industry cannot have a rational layout with distinctive characteristics in each location -- a problem which has affected the sustained and quick development of machine-building enterprises. In view of thi s, all cities and counties must give prime consideration to their respective priorities, choose the fittest projects to develop, and display their own distinctive characteristics in promoting the machinery industry. They should change the mindset of seeking paralleled and all-inclusive development and rushing to make "products that sell well." Instead, they should dare to give up some of their current undertakings and products, and go all out to develop uncommon products, make good the shortage, and fill up the gaps in the machinery industry. In developing themselves, all cities and counties should keep to the track of making what others don't have, beating competitors by turning out better products, and giving full scope to their own characteristics, so that each of them will have their strong points. This is the only path to take in developing our machinery industry. Now, competitive products with distinctive characteristics have appeared in various parts of our province. Examples are "vehicles, boxes, machines, and containers" [che xiang ji gui 6508 4630 2623 2681] made in Yangzhou; construction machinery produced by Xuzhou; and farm machinery, mainly diesel tractors, turned out by Changzhou. We should speed up the development of the strong points of various localities. In doing this, we should be oriented toward the domestic and overseas markets, take the local economic and technological conditions into consideration, bring into full play our strong points, and sidestep our shortcomings. We should choose some characteristic products as key targets to make breakthroughs, devote our efforts to improving the quality of these products and expanding their production scale, strive to develop them into competitive products with distinctive local characteristics, and make every effort to bring them up to the nation's advanced level. To sum up, we should take the development of the strong points and characteristics of various localities as a main task in connection with the effort to increase the total output. We should see to it that while increasing the total production, all localities bring into full play their characteristics and strong points, and that, in doing so, they also contribute to increasing the total production and boosting the economic returns. 6. Correctly handle the relationship between developing "small but specialized" enterprises and promoting conglomerates. Jiangsu's machinery industry is characterized by large numbers of small- and medium-sized enterprises as well as township enterprises. Such an organizational structure makes it necessary to develop scores of "small but specialized" enterprises as basic units to supplement and coordinate with the development of big and medium-sized enterprises. Based on their characteristics, these small enterprises should constantly raise their technological level, improve their product quality, acquire advanced equipment, and distinguish themselves by fine quality, low production costs, and expertise in their specialized fields. More importantly, they should put stress on developing conglomerates aimed at making competitive products as the leading commodities, such conglomerates to be formed by sharing assets on the basis of specialization and cooperation. The purpose is to build an economy of scale, bring out the advantage of the integrated whole, and boost the enterprises' competitiveness so that they can get a foothold in the domestic and international markets. The competent government authorities can do something in organizing such conglomerates. During the last two years, our department did play a leading role in organizing three provincial-level conglomerates. At the same time, a number of conglomerates also came into being in various localities. The year 1992 saw 48 enterprises and conglomerates formed in our province in the machine-building field, each scoring an output value in excess of 100 million yuan or providing more than 1,000 yuan to the government in the form of profit contribution or tax payment. This brought an initial change to our province's machinery industry, which had lacked big and effective organizations. In the future, we should further use our polices, laws, and regulations along with informational and economic measures to guide enterprises to form conglomerates as a way to spur the development of the machinery industry. Such conglomerates may be formed by association or merger of enterprises or through such methods as share-buying, shareholding, or leasing. We should try to see that each sector of our machinery industry has one or two conglomerates. 7. Correctly handle the relationship between introducing technology and capital from outside and making self-improvement. Since the outset of the reform and opening-up drive, our province's machinery industry has introduced some 120 new technologies from abroad, established 156 partially- or wholly-foreign-funded enterprises, and actually utilized foreign capital in the amount of $117 million. This has accelerated the updating and upgrading of our products and increased our sources of capital. Acquisition of advanced designs, manufacturing techniques, and management expertise from abroad has helped promote our export trade to earn foreign exchange and has brought in greater economic returns. Our practical experience shows that such acquisition and joint investment with overseas business interests are a significant way for our machinery industry to achieve quick and effective results in making technological progress, seeking quick development, and narrowing the gap between itself and its foreign counterpart. In the main, acquisition of foreign technology plays the role of raising our starting point in making technological progress, while our foundation for technological progress is to beef up our own strength in the field of science and technology. Because of this, we cannot solely rely on the acquisition of foreign technology. More important is a positive effort to digest and assimilate what we have acquired from abroad and, on this basis, create our own technology, expand our own expertise, and raise our independent development capability. As an example, the Wuxi Compressor Plant has created its own technology after actively digesting and assimilating the oiled-screw-rod technology acquired from abroad. The plant has developed two new products, no- lubrication screw rods and screw-rod refrigerators. These new products have provided it with a new competitive edge and boosted its capability for sustained development. In utilizing foreign capital to solve the shortage of funds at home, we should pay particular attention to the following: Along with the capital acquired from abroad, we should also obtain foreign advanced technology and equipment. We should encourage the sectors and enterprises concerned to participate in international division of work and to explore overseas markets for their products. In addition, we should integrate the work of utilization of foreign capital with the transformation of old enterprises and go all out to win success in developing the three kinds of partially- or wholly-foreign-funded enterprises. 8. Correctly handle the relationship between developing the domestic market and exploring the international market. In view of China's forthcoming "reentry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade," the quickened pace taken in linking the domestic market with the international market, and the internationalization trend of world economic development, every enterprise and region must base itself not only on developing the domestic market but also on exploring the international market. It must act in both directions. On the one hand, the machinery industry must meet domestic market demands. It must make further efforts to capture a large part of the domestic market and must compete successfully with foreign companies and "imported goods" by means of flexible marketing strategies, good after- sales services, and fine-quality and low-price products. On the other hand, it must, as a strategic measure, expand its international market and boost its exports to earn more foreign exchange. While consolidating and developing the current export market, it must continue to expand the market abroad and establish transnational companies to develop internationalized operations. In no way should it relax or give up the exploration of international market because its products are selling well at home. 9. Correctly handle the relationship between the transformation of government functions and the transformation of enterprises' operational mechanism. These "two transformations" are both needed in building a socialist market economic structure. We should coordinate and synchronize the work in these two fields, let them promote each other, and really achieve the goal that "enterprises are acting in line with the market condition, while the government is functioning according to the needs of enterprises." Enterprises should speed up the transformation of their operational mechanism. In doing this, however, they should not relax their internal management. Some time ago, "using contract arrangements instead of strengthening management" and a relapse of laxity in management appeared in varying degrees in our machinery industry. This matter deserves our particular attention. We must make a real effort to gear up management and devote ourselves painstakingly to "internal work." Factory directors of enterprises should properly exercise their decision-making power while giving full play to the role of the staff members and workers as the factories' masters. The administrative department in charge of the machinery industry should put in more efforts to transform its functions. On the one hand, it must further implement the "Regulations" [Regulations on Transformation of Operational Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises], simplify its administration, and delegate more power to enterprises so as to create a relaxed external environment for enterprises to better their services. On the other hand, it should not loosen its control over this industry. Especially, it should not relax or give up its supervisory functions (such as supervision in the fields of quality, security, fixed assets, as well as party and government discipline). It must learn to be adept at regulating, controlling, and guiding the industry by using comprehensive measures, including economic means, policy-based measures, and legal, informational, and planning methods. Plus, it must gear up investigations and studies, draw experience from selected units to promote overall work, and pay attention to solving tendentious problems. 10. Correctly handle the relationship between reform and development Reform is a powerful propellant for development. An industry without reform is hard to develop quickly. Similarly, an enterprise without reform is hard to become lively. We cannot use the old mindset and methods to solve the problems and contradictions encountered in the development of an industry or an enterprise. Still less should we go back to the old road to solve them. The only solution is to deepen the reform. Our present task is development, but it is more important to be devoted to reform. We should seek development by means of reform and, in the course of development, continue to deepen our reform. Many of the above-mentioned tasks involve the work of reform, such as the tasks related to the three enterprise systems, the shareholding system, the property rights system, and government organizations. We must make rock-firm efforts to deepen the reform in various fields and strive to achieve successful results.
