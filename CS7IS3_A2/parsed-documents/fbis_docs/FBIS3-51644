Georges favors the national conference of the Committee of Action for National Reconciliation, to be held 6-7 February, and also a government of concord. [Begin Georges recording, in Creole] Despite all the positions we took and the talks we held with those gentlemen [from the national congress] in order to make them understand what is right, they are not listening. We want then to know that: First, ALAH has some legislators within the parliament, whom we hope they will not attack; second, nor any other legislators; third, we heard that they formed a government in which they assert that the North represents Artibonite and the West. We are asking that the other six departments be represented, particularly the department of the Center, where we are a representative. We accept dictates from no one and we are formally asking the Haitian Army and the police to fulfill their responsibilities to stop those power-hungry gentlemen. In the event of failure to do so, we will take the necessary measures to deal with them through our own means. We are issuing a watchword to all ALAH members throughout the nine geographical departments. We are asking them to mobilize, to get in touch with the party's office immediately tomorrow morning. We will take measures to protect our members on the one hand and to protect the national sovereignty on the other hand, so that no small groups of petty persons endanger the country's durability. I am accusing them of sectarianism and of pettiness. A small group of people cannot pretend to national sovereignty. [end recording]
