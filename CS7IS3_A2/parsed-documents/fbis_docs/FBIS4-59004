Four years after unity between the north and south, matters between brothers have reached an apogee of violence and fighting unseen even in very fierce wars. What recklessness and madness governs the minds of those who have the power to decide war in fraternal Yemen? What do they want for their country and united people? Are the brothers in Yemen going to reap anything but damage, ruin, death, and the destruction of everything that has been built? All the mistakes, all the disputes, and all the so-called deviations and excesses do not in any way justify these violent forms of fighting and dispute. Who will benefit from the destruction of Aden or Sanaa airports? What does the bombing of the presidential palaces and vital installations in Sanaa and Aden mean? The only people who will benefit are the enemies of Yemen and the enemies of its people's unity and democratic march, which was supposed to proceed toward a new era, in which the Arab people of Yemen could build the foundations of their progress and harmonize with the spirit of the age. Faced with these violent, bloody confrontations and the bitter fighting among the brothers, we in Jordan -- whose leader patronized the reconciliation meeting and the signing of the pledge and accord document -- are overwhelmed with sadness, pain, and outrage. We denounce what is going on in Yemen, regardless of the reasons and motives, and regardless of who resorted to violence first. We say: We denounce all the parties without exception, because now matter how big they may get, differences between two parties should not reach the point of shedding the blood of a young man or a child and the destruction of a house, a school, or a hospital. As we today stand watching what is going on in the mountains and plains of that fraternal country, we can do nothing but urge the Yemeni leaders to resort to logic and spare the blood of their children. We urge them to preserve their country and their unity and prevent their country from becoming a new Somalia or a new Afghanistan, the two countries that symbolize destruction, chaos, and bloodbaths, where the hungry and homeless wait for aid convoys.
