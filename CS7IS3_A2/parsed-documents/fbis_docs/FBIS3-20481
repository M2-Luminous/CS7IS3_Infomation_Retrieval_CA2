Taking the Initiative in Requesting My Retirement (Part One of Two) -- Disappointed at Jiang Zemin's Political Report, I Made Up My Mind To Retire; I Was Accused of Trying To Hang on to My Post Because I Had Suggested That the Replacement Be Effected After the Adoption of the Basic Law With respect to the handling of Hong Kong affairs, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng would listen to the reports and analyses made by Li Hou [2621 0683] and Lu Ping [7627 1627] only, but would not see me or listen to my analyses, resulting in a growing gulf between them and me. I estimated that the problem between them and me was no longer the matter of differences on the 4 June incident. It was already very difficult, or even impossible, to change the situation. If I was to continue to work in Hong Kong but had to obediently follow the "blind command" from Beijing, proceeding on the basis of disregarding Hong Kong's realities, I just could not do the job. Jiang Zemin's Political Report to the Fifth Plenum made me even more disappointed. I made up my mind to retire, and wanted to find out if I would be able to secure a "safe landing." Seizing the opportunity of a break from Central Advisory Commission group discussions which Song Ping [1345 1627] was also attending, I presented to him my formal request for retirement. Song Ping was very surprised and asked: "Why? The center is not considering the issue of your retirement." I replied: "I am already over 70. Too old. Too busy. Already feel mentally tired. Often feel exhausted. I do hope the center will give approval." All this was true. But I thought it better not to mention the main reason. At the same time I raised some demands: I planned to live in Shenzhen and do some investigation and research work as my ability would permit. On the one hand Song Ping said: "Now is not the time for you to retire. Don't think about this issue." On the other hand he also said: "For the time being the center cannot find a suitable person to succeed you." I recommended: "Ye Xuanping is suitable. He is from Guangdong and familiar with the situation in Hong Kong, and have had much contact with personalities in Hong Kong and Macao." Song Ping said: "This is a good idea, and may produce mostly good results." Several days later, when the Fifth Plenum was still going on, Song Ping asked the Central Organization Department deputy head in charge of Hong Kong and Macao cadres to tell me not to think about the issue of retirement, informing me that the center had truly not considered the issue. Another message was that if there should be retirement in the future, then those few demands would not be a problem. Around this time I also met Yang Shangkun. I asked him to transmit to the center my request for retirement. Yang Shangkun readily said: "No consideration for now. Continue to work for a while, and then we will see." I insisted that he transmit the request. He shook his head and did not approve of my making the request. In order to make Beijing let me retire, I decided to make use of my public appearances in an effort to create an atmosphere so that the people of Hong Kong could also become psychologically prepared. On 11 December 1989, I was invited to the ribbon-cutting opening ceremony of the Dynasty Club owned by the tycoon Cheng Yu-tung. When interviewed by reporters, I took the initiative in telling them that I had submitted to the center my request for retirement. After Beijing learned the news, first, I received a telephone call from Yang Shangkun's secretary, who said that Yang Shangkun was somewhat unhappy and transmitted a message to me: "Don't mention the matter of retirement again." Then people in Beijing told me that Zhongnanhai had made a new decision on the personnel of the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency and that Zhou Nan [0719 0589] would come to Hong Kong to take over my job. I was very happy, but upon learning this information the colleagues all faulted me for openly taking the initiative in talking about retirement, "thereby giving them an opportunity." On 23 December the center sent a telegram, asking me to go to Beijing immediately. I knew that this trip was related to the matter of my retirement. I arrived in Beijing the next day. In the evening of the same day Li Peng, Song Ping, and the head of the Central Organization Department summoned me to Zhongnanhai. They came straight to the point. As soon as they sat down, they announced: "The center has decided that you retire and be succeeded by Zhou Nan. What do you think about the decision?" They did not say that I had taken the initiative in requesting my retirement but instead said, "The center has decided." I replied, smiling: "Thank the center for approving my request for retirement." I also suggested: "Zhou Nan may immediately come to Hong Kong to take over the job. It might be advisable to announce the decision after the National People's Congress [NPC] has adopted the Basic Law, so as to let the people of Hong Kong get psychologically prepared and have a peaceful New Year." They immediately said that this suggestion could be considered. But, later they considered this move made by me to be an attempt at "hanging on to my post," and decided to take further measures to make me leave Hong Kong promptly. (142) [24 Sep 93 p 3] [Text] Events Shortly Before and After I Left My Country. Taking the Initiative in Requesting My Retirement (Part Two of Two) -- The Suggestion That I Be Transferred Back After the Adoption of the Basic Law Was Rejected; Zhou Nan's Xinhua News Agency Appointment Was Announced Without Being Considered by the NPC Standing Committee. As the talking drew to a "close," I stood up to say goodbye. Suddenly Li Peng turned around and asked Song Ping: "Have the senior comrades been informed?" Song Ping said: "Comrade Xiannian knows this. The secretaries of the others are all present and will make their reports." I knew that persons such as Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun would all have their secretaries participate in the meetings of the Standing Committee and the secretariat in order to keep informed of the details of the discussions at the meetings. Their question and answer showed that Li Xiannian already knew the decisions to dismiss me and appoint Zhou Nan (later I also learned that Zhou Nan had been recommended by Li Xiannian), and that the other senior comrades, perhaps referring to Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun, might not have been informed beforehand. The next morning I met Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378], who said, seeming to be trying to show his powerlessness with regard to the matter, that Song Ping merely told him at a public rally that Zhou Nan would take over my job, and did not solicit his opinion. Ji Pengfei also told me that he once said to Song Ping: "Zhou Nan has diplomatic experience, but the Hong Kong job is a comprehensive one." He also said to me: "They do not understand the situation. You have developed a new situation in Hong Kong and made great contributions." He was still indicating his powerlessness on this matter. I smiled and replied: "The reason was your excellent leadership. But while talking to me, Li Peng and the others did not say a single word about my six-year work in Hong Kong. I don't know their assessment." In the afternoon Ji Pengfei asked someone to tell me that the center had decided to ask all the responsible persons of the CPC Hong Kong and Macao Work Committee (i.e., the several deputy directors of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY) to come to attend a meeting in Beijing. For Li Peng and the others were unhappy about my attitude expressed on the preceding evening, considering me to be trying "to hang on to my post" and intending to take measures. On 25 December Jiang Zemin presided over the meeting; Li Peng was late for half a hour. Song Ping, Ji Pengfei, Li Hou, Lu Ping, and Zhou Nan attended the meeting; all the deputy directors of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY were also present. Jiang Zemin started by announcing the center's decision that I retire and be transferred back, and that Zhou Nan take over the job. The suggestion, made by me and some deputy directors of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, that I be transferred back to the hinterland after the adoption of the Basic Law had been rejected. It had been decided that a public announcement be made on 15 January 1990, and that Zhou Nan immediately go to Hong Kong to take over the job. In his speech Jiang Zemin responded to the remark I had made to Ji Pengfei, saying: "Comrade Xu Jiatun has done a great deal of work in Hong Kong, and has made achievements." Li Peng came very late, and made some harsh comments rejecting our suggestion regarding the takeover. Ji Pengfei said nothing from the beginning to the end. It was very abnormal, within the CPC, to hold such a meeting and use such an approach to announce the transfer or dismissal of a high-ranking cadre and for leaders to assume such an attitude toward the matter. In my lifetime I had been transferred from my jobs many times, but had never seen such a "solemn" situation. According to usual practices, after the party made the decision on my dismissal and Zhou Nan's appointment, the State Council should raise the matter to the consideration of the NPC Standing Committee. The dismissal and appointment should be announced only after being approved by the NPC Standing Committee. However, unusually, Zhou Nan's assumption of his office in Hong Kong was announced in the news released by the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in Beijing on 15 January 1990. The NPC Standing Committee did not even discuss the issue as a matter of formality. There has been no announcement by the NPC Standing Committee to this day. In trying to transfer me back to the hinterland, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and the others did not even bother to put up a facade. (143) [25 Sep 93 p 4] [Text] Events Shortly Before and After I Left My Country. Leaving Hong Kong After Being Relieved of My Office (Part One of Two) -- I Retired as I Had Wished, But to My Surprise Jiang and Li Would Not Let the Matter Drop; Zhou Nan Did Not Say a Single Word About My Leaving Hong Kong at the Farewell Banquet. After the 25 December meeting, I returned to Hong Kong right away, and immediately moved out of the Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Building, vacating the office. Colleagues advised me not to be in such a hurry and said that when being transferred back to the hinterland Li Chuwen and others all had left Hong Kong six months after the respective announcements, hoping that I would also stay in Hong Kong a bit longer after leaving office. I thanked them for their kindness, and immediately started packing, transporting my personal belongings to Shenzhen. It seemed to me that it had not been just for one or two days that Jiang and Li had wanted me to leave Hong Kong early. As I had fulfilled my wish to retire, leaving early could get me extricated from the dispute-infested place early. This was something my colleagues did not think about. But at the time I did not thought that Jiang and Li would not drop the matter, and that the "next chapter" was waiting for me. I planned to go to Shantou on 9 February to participate in the opening ceremony of Shantou University built on the basis of the donation from Li Ka-shing, to come back to Hong Kong on the 11th, and to leave Hong Kong for Beijing on the 12th to attend the last plenary session of the Basic Law Drafting Committee. I thought that the 12th would be the day when I would be officially relieved of my office and leave Hong Kong. After learning that I would soon retire and leave Hong Kong, China's institutions in Hong Kong and people in society all came, suggesting the holding of farewell banquets for me. If I accept the suggestions, then not only would there not be enough time, but such events would also cause resentment on the part of some people in Beijing when the news spread. On the other hand, if I should accept some invitations, then I would be suspected of showing favor; therefore I politely declined all the invitations. The heads of some major Chinese-owned institutions in Hong Kong would not agree to that and insisted on "showing their sentiments" in some way. In the end they made a compromise proposal that a farewell dinner be held on the 50th floor of the Huarun Building one day before my leaving Hong Kong. I could not but accept the proposal. Zhou Nan would arrive in Hong Kong on 5 February. I and the deputy directors decided to expand the Spring Tea Banquet so as to introduce the new director of the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency to the people of Hong Kong and to say goodbye to the people of Hong Kong. The general office estimated that the number of participants would be larger than in the previous National Day banquets held by the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. As the place we usually rented might not be able to accommodate 3,000 people, the main conference hall of the International Trade Conference Center, which could accommodate 4,000-5,000 people, was rented. On the day of the banquet people of all circles in society came to the conference hall. In my speech, I especially introduced the new director Zhou Nan to people, wishing Zhou Nan "well," and said farewell to Hong Kong compatriots and Chinese and foreign friends, expressing my gratitude for the support given to the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency and to myself over the six years. Standing on the podium and facing the thousands of pairs of eyes in the hall, I had all kinds of thoughts, and did my best to control my strong emotions. After the toasting, I hurriedly retreated to the lounge. While still in Beijing Zhou Nan had sent a telegram to the general office of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, asking it to prepare his response speech at the banquet. She Mengxiao, deputy director and secretary general, had personally drafted the speech for him. As Zhou Nan liked to cite ancient poems, he also had cited two lines of a Tang Dynasty poem for Zhou. The text had then been sent to Zhou Nan in Beijing by fax. But unexpectedly Zhou Nan did not use a single word from the text after coming to Hong Kong, and instead used a text that he said he had prepared himself. The speech in no place mentioned my name, Xu, and did not have a single word about Xu's leaving Hong Kong, totally ignoring the "newcomer welcoming" speech made by the host of the banquet, thereby astonishing the participants. Seeing this abnormal occurrence, not only did colleagues in the branch ask me after the banquet, "What was going on?" but people in society also talked about the incident. Many people made phone calls to ask people to inquire of colleagues in the branch, asking: "Have you noticed it?" and "why?" I felt that this could not have been Zhou Nan's own "creation," and that he would not have dared to behave in such an arrogant manner without being backed by "instructions." Li Ka-shing had already invited me to the 9 February opening ceremony of Shantou University built on the basis of Li Ka-shing's donation. Although Zhou Nan had already assumed office in Hong Kong by that time, Li Ka-shing did not express any attitude. I specially suggested to Li that Zhou Nan be also invited; Li agreed and sent out an additional invitation. I and Zhou Nan planned to go to Shantou together and to come back to Hong Kong together. Li Ka-shing's donations to projects in China were mainly concentrated on Shantou University. At the time his donations to Shantou University had already totalled HK$560 million, and in addition a foreign exchange fund had also be set up for the purpose of hiring foreign professors. He had said to me that he had planned to invest in the Shantou Power Plant, and that he would not take the power plant's future profits which could be used to cover Shantou University's operational expenses. In the process of establishing Shantou University, Li Ka-shing had had many differences with some personnel of Guangdong Province in charge of the matter. In some cases he raised the relevant matters to my attention, and I then took up the matters with the relevant supervisory agencies in Beijing and Guangdong, presenting my own opinions and expressing the hope that they would help resolve the problems and reduce Li's difficulties so that things could proceed as much as possible according to Li's ideas. (Installment No 144) [26 Sep 93 p 2] [Text] Events Shortly Before and After I Left My Country. Leaving Hong Kong After Being Relieved of My Office (Part Two of Two) -- I Was Very Disappointed at the Fact That Only Li Tieying [2621 6993 2503] Had Been Sent To Attend the Opening Ceremony of Shantou University; The Center Asked Me Not To Turn Over the Responsibility for Taiwan Work; Zhou Nan Was Rather Unhappy About It. Li Ka-shing was not only involved in matters of funds but also in matters of the school's size, capital construction, and teaching material. He had asked Chuang Shih Ping, former chairman of the board of directors of Nanyang Bank to serve as an advisor of Shantou University and also asked Huang Lisung, former chancellor of the University of Hong Kong to serve as an advisor. Usually there were seven or eight people from Li's company among those in charge of the construction of Shantou University. He had even sent his own secretary to provide help. All this showed the importance Li gave to Shantou University. He once told me: "I have devoted a great of deal of my energy to making Shantou University a prestigious university." Accompanied by Chuang Shih Ping, I had specially visited Shantou University during its construction. I had seen that Shantou University's size and facilities as well as architecture had all been modernized, a rare phenomenon among universities in China. I thought that as Li Ka-shing had devoted not only money and energy but also his "painstaking care" to the university because of his patriotism and love for his native place, he should be given support and encouragement. When Yue-kong Pao had built a university in Ningbo, the center had treated him with honor. Not only State Counselor Gu Mu [6253 3668] but also Wan Li, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony of Ningbo University. I had wanted to achieve some balance. Before the 4 June incident, I had suggested to responsible persons at the center that it would be advisable that one of the four persons, PRC President Yang Shangkun, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, NPC Standing Committee Chairman Wan Li, and Premier Li Peng, attend the opening ceremony of Shantou University. They had all said that the suggestion would be considered. After the 4 Juneh incident I again suggested that Jiang Zemin, the new general secretary, and Premier Li Peng attend the opening ceremony and go to Shenzhen after the ceremony to meet with people of various circles in Hong Kong. But in the end they only sent Li Tieying, the head of the State Education Commission, to attend the ceremony; I was very disappointed. Li Ka-shing's wife died before the opening ceremony, and Li felt great sorrow. I specially visited him, and attended the memorial ceremony and funeral. Li told me that he was very sad because of his wife's death, and that his attending the opening ceremony would not be affected. I also told him that I would definitely attend the ceremony. He said: "I will have a specially chartered plane to take you there and then bring you back." I said: "You don't have to pay any attention to making me comfortable. It is better to be casual. Let us see who the center will send here (at the time we did not know that Li Tieying would come)." However, he still personally came to the airport to greet me, and arranged for me to stay in the "Presidential Suite" of the best hotel in Shantou City. If only I would ask, Li would always consider making donations to the hinterland. His donations for the Asian Games in Beijing and the Cultural Foundation of Hong Kong had in each case totalled around HK$10 million. When I left Hong Kong, I only agreed to having a private farewell activity, but the activity was just a lunch together as the two of us often had had before. During the lunch he said to me emotionally: "If you were not a Communist, our friendship could be even deeper." He had already heard about my plan to live in Shenzhen and to do some research on Hong Kong, and therefore said: "I will often go to Shenzhen to see you. I can provide financial assistance if there should be any difficulties in research work." I was also very moved at the time, and expressed my appreciation, After attending the opening ceremony of Shantou University on 9 February, I returned to Hong Kong together with Zhou Nan the next day, planning to go to Beijing on the 12th to attend the final session of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee and the meeting of the NPC Standing Committee. Before my departure I said farewell to colleagues in the branch and indicated that I would be leaving Hong Kong officially the next day. Upon learning the information, the British Hong Kong government solicited advice from the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency, offering to send people to see me off. Some comrades in the branch politely declined the offer because they did not want me to officially leave Hong Kong on that occasion. I expressed my appreciation of the colleagues' good intentions, but was still determined to officially leave Hong Kong on that occasion. However, unexpectedly, Yang Shangkun and Yang Side [2799 1835 1795] told me face to face during a meeting in Beijing: that some important contacts in Taiwan with whom I had been responsible for communicating should not be turned over to Zhou Nan, and that I should continue to be responsible for the matter. I immediately transmitted the message to Zhou Nan, who looked very unhappy after learning the message. He took the initiative in seeing Yang Side, and also requested a meeting with Yang Shangkun; but Yang Shangkun did not see him. At the time Taiwan was faced with a presidential election, and the situation was rather tense. When I had returned to Shenzhen after attending meetings in Beijing, Yang Shangkun sent a telegram to the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, asking me to meet Yang Side to exchanges views on the situation in Taiwan and the work on Taiwan. I talked with Yang Side by having a long-distance call. He suggested that I go to Hong Kong so as to make it easier for me to have discussions with the relevant people on a timely basis. For this reason I went to Hong Kong three times. On each occasion I stayed at the Stanley guest-house for one night and left the next day. Each time She Mengxiao, deputy director and secretary general of the branch, came to see me, I asked him to report to Zhou Nan on my behalf and to give him my regards. I did not think that my three official business trips to Hong Kong would cause unexpected storms.
