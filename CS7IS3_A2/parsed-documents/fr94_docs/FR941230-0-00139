(a) Service requirement. A person employed in the competitive service for other than temporary, term, or indefinite employment is appointed as a career or career-conditional employee subject to the probationary period required by subpart H of this part. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an employee must serve 3 years of substantially continuous creditable service as defined in paragraph (b) of this section to become a career employee. (b) Creditable service. Unless otherwise approved by OPM, the service required for career tenure must begin and end with nontemporary employment in the competitive service except as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, must include service under an appointment based on or leading to competitive status, be substantially continuous, and total 3 years, as follows: (1) Nontemporary employment. To be creditable, the 3-year period of service must begin with one of the following: (i) Nontemporary appointment in the competitive service. For this purpose, nontemporary appointment includes a career-conditional appointment; career appointment; reinstatement under subpart D of this part; and transfer under subpart E of this part. The 3-year period may also begin, but not end, with status quo employment under subpart G of part 316 of this chapter, and overseas limited appointment of indefinite duration or overseas limited term appointment under part 301 of this chapter. The 3-year period also may have begun with permanent employment under now obsolete appointing authorities such as probational, war service indefinite, and emergency indefinite appointments.
