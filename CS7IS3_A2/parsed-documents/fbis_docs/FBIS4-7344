Representatives of the Federation of Korean Traders and Industrialists in Japan on April 26 demanded the Japan Police Agency to probe into the truth behind the murder of Vice-Chairman of the Federation Ku Cha-yong, saying that the forcible search into the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon by Osaka prefectural police and assault on a Korean student are the result of the hostile policy of Japanese authorities towards the DPRK and Chongnyon. On the same day, officials and compatriots under the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon thronged to the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and strongly demanded it renounce at once the hostile policy towards the DPRK, stop suppressing Korean residents in Japan and apologize for it and immediately return the unconcerned materials seized from the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and its branches. Song Chang-to, chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Committee of the Union of Korean Teachers in Japan, in his report at its emergency meeting on April 26, charged that the Japanese authorities made every effort to undermine the organizations of Koreans in Japan and obliterate the education of Koreans, before the war of aggression on Korea was unleashed by the U.S. imperialists in 1950, and called upon the teachers and students to cope with the subversive moves of the reactionaries within and without with heightened vigilance. At the meeting, O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee and chairman of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, called for smashing the subversive plots of the reactionaries within and without with united efforts and actively push ahead with the work. Meanwhile, Vice-Chairman Paek Han-ki and director of International Department Kim Tae-hui of the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee met the cadres of Japan Social-Democratic Party [JSDP] on April 25 and asked for positive activities of the JSDP to stop the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities and immediately renounce and rectify the hostile policy towards the DPRK.
