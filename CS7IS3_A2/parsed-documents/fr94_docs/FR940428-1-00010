FR940428-1-00010 FR940428-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Defense Logistics Agency 48 CFR Parts 5419 and 5452 DLA Acquisition Regulation; Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns AGENCY: Defense Logistics Agency, DOD. ACTION: Proposed rule and request for comments. SUMMARY: The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) proposes to establish a new 48 CFR Chapter 54 to contain Defense Logistics Agency acquisition regulations. New parts 5419 and 5452 provide regulatory coverage which incorporates two nonstandard clauses in domestic bulk petroleum solicitations and contracts concerning small business set asides and evaluation preference for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns into DLAR on a permanent basis. Comments are hereby requested on the proposed coverage which supplements the contract quality requirements of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) by adding prescriptive language and contract clauses to satisfy the specific needs of DLA. The proposed coverage is being published in the Federal Register because it is expected to have an effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DLA and, in some cases, a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors, when required. DATES: Comments on the proposed DLAR rules must be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before June 27, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of the final rules. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to Defense Logistics Agency, Directorate of Procurement, Contract Policy Team (AQPLL), Ms. Melody Reardon, Cameron Station, Alexandria, Virginia 22306&hyph;6100 FAX: (703) 274&hyph;0310. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Melody Reardon, Defense Logistics Agency, AQPLL (703) 274&hyph;6431. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Section 1207 of Public Law 99&hyph;661, as amended, sets a goal for the Department of Defense to award five percent of contract and performance dollars to small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions. Defense Fuel Supply Center has historically utilized deviations to DFARS 252.219&hyph;7001 and 252.219&hyph;7006 which are reviewed and approved on an annual basis by the Director of Defense Procurement. Defense Fuel Supply Center proposes incorporating two nonstandard clauses in DLAR in order to eliminate the need for the class deviation. An additional objective of the two clauses is to include the term small disadvantaged joint ventures in the definition of small disadvantaged business concerns. Small disadvantaged joint ventures will now be eligible to receive the evaluation preference for those items solicited under these clauses if the small disadvantaged business or small disadvantaged joint venture manufactures or supplies the products of small disadvantaged businesses. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed clauses are not expected to have significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. since the clauses have been utilized for many years by Defense Fuel Supply Center as deviations to DFARS. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS sections will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite this case in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed rules do not impose any reporting or record keeping requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR 5419 and 5452 Government procurement. Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR chapter 54 consisting of parts 5419 and 5452, be added to read as follows: CHAPTER 54_DEFENSE LPGISTICS AGENCY, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PART 5419_SMALL BUSINESS AND SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS CONCERNS PART 5452_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES PART 5419_SMALL BUSINESS AND SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS CONCERNS Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301, 10 U.S.C. 2202, 48 CFR Part 1, subpart 1.3 and 48 CFR Part 201, subpart 201.3. 5419.001 Definitions. The definition of ``small disadvantaged business concern'' to be used for DFSC competitive bulk solicitions and contracts is in the provision at 5452.219&hyph;9F06 and is different from the definition in DFARS 252.219&hyph;7001. For purposes of contract opportunities, Small Disadvantaged Business Joint Ventures, as defined in 252.219&hyph;7001 have the same status as small disadvantaged business concerns.
