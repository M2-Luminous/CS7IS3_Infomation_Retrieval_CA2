Miroslav Konvalina reports from Ruzyne Airport: [Konvalina] We do not have any problems in bilateral contacts with Finland. On the contrary, Vaclav Klaus will affirm our permanent interest in this northern country. He gave us his reasons a few weeks ago, after returning from Norway, which so far was the last Scandinavian country he visited. [Begin Klaus recording] We should not forget that the Czech Republic, with its geographic size and number of inhabitants, must logically seek partners not from among the superpowers, as we thought at a certain time in the past. Norway and Finland are our natural partners. [end recording] [passage omitted]
