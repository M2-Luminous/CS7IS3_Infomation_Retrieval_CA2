Diplomats said disagreement over the future of the police, especially the riot unit, had proved a stumbling block in the latest round of talks, which began in the Zambian capital in November. UNITA wanted the riot wing disbanded, arguing that it operated more like a military than a normal police force, and was serving to terrorize peole rather than keep the peace.
