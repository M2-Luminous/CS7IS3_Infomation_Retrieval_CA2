The High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] today appointed Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo as prime minister. Andre Mounyinga, an active member of the French branch of Mr. Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress [UDPS], has reacted to Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo's appointment. He does not seem at all happy about it. Mr. Mounyinga was interviewed by our correspondent in Paris, Mohamed Youssouffou Saliou. [Begin recording] [Mounyinga] It is an unacceptable violation because it does not comply with the transitional text based on the agreements signed with them. The text does not indicate that a prime minister should be appointed by the HCR-PT. It is a violation we are not prepared to accept. We will fight it just as we fought the violations in the cases of Nguz Karl-I-Bond, Birindwa, and many others. [Saliou] How do you see Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's political future? [Mounyinga] That is not the point. The question that needs to be asked is: How do we see the country's political future? I can only tell you that the whole population continues to rally behind the ideal of change which Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi and all the UDPS activists initiated a long time ago. You can be sure that this popular support will continue all the way. [end recording]
