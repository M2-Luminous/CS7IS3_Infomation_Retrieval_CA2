Diplomatic sources here said Wednesday that Assistant Secretary of State for Military and Political Affairs Robert Gallucci sent a letter to North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu several days ago, saying a third round of high-level talks would not take place unless Pyongyang met two previously agreed conditions -- full inspection of nuclear sites at Yongbyon and an exchange of envoys between North and South Korea. Gallucci and Kang headed their respective delegations to the previous two rounds of high-level U.S.-North Korean political negotiations. The letter contained no fresh offers but urged Pyongyang to allow additional International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) checks of its nuclear facilities, while reaffirming the U.S. position on further talks, a source said. Gallucci wrote the letter in reply to a missive sent by Kang in the middle of March. In his letter, Kang urged Washington to hold a third round of talks as agreed, noting North Korea had permitted IAEA inspections. South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told South Korean correspondents here that further high-level U.S.-North Korean talks would not be held until Pyongyang complied with the coming UN Security Council action, be it a resolution or a statement. "I don't think it necessary for Washington to have prior consultations with Pyongyang regarding additional IAEA inspections, "He added, suggesting that the resumption of dialogue depends on whether Pyongyang changes its mind on the nuclear issue.
