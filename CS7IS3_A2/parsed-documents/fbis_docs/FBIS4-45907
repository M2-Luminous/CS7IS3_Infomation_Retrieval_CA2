ATS, quoting examining magistrate Pierre Marquis, said Haessig had been charged last Wednesday and denied the accusations against him. Judicial investigations into the spread of AIDS-contaminated blood were launched two years ago. So far seven people, including five haemophiliacs, have filed complaints that they contracted the deadly virus through transfusions in 1985 and 1986. Lawyer Jacques Barillon, head of an association for the defence of infected haemophiliacs, told ATS the charging of Haessig was "a considerable victory," following a "long and careful inquiry." Switzerland and Spain became in 1986 the first European countries to introduce systematic tests of donated blood for AIDS, but some slipped through. The following year, according to a Swiss television report, the authorities decided on a cover-up rather than track down contaminated batches of blood and warn recipients. But officials said in March after an investigation that a total of 52 people had caught the virus from contaminated blood, 18 of whom died before the end of last year. The investigation covering 315 suspect blood solutions delivered to 70 hospitals between 1982 and 1992 revealed three previously unknown people infected by the AIDS virus. Barillon said the charging of Haessig would bring the affair into the open and other trials could follow of national and local public health officials.
