The agreement was reached in mid-December 1993 during a visit to Russia by Mr. Gore. Yesterday an American delegation headed by David Pamfry, head of the U.S. Department of Energy's Department of Energy Research, left Tyumen after signing a specific agreement on establishment of the center with oblast administration chief Leonid Roketskiy. Both sides have an interest in establishing the oil and gas technology center, which should begin operating this summer. Russia needs investment in its oil and gas complex, as well as U.S. equipment and technology. The Americans, according to Mr. Roketskiy, "are forced to resort to `migrant labor'," as their oil production is declining due to market forces. According to projections by American sources, in 1994 the United States will shut down approximately 50,000 wells and an equal number will operate below capacity if oil prices remain at the current level of $14 a barrel. According to the charter documents drawn up by TyumenNIIGiprogaz [Tyumen State Scientific Research Institute for Gas Industry Planning] the center will collect and collate information, draw up technical and financial plans for the use of Russian technology and equipment in the United States and American technology and equipment in Russia, and carry out joint projects and research in the field of oil and gas production. The U.S. Government has allocated $400,000 to set up the center, which as a non-commercial organization will have to operate on a cost recovery basis. During negotiations Mr. Roketskiy stated that the center's opening should be noted by a Russian government decree, which would give the center greater importance. As KOMMERSANT reported yesterday, the oblast administration has already drafted such a decree. However, Mr. Roketskiy denied that by doing so the oblast is attempting to induce Moscow to finance the center.
