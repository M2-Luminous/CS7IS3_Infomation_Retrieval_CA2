He added that the "political echos of the present strike wave are not subject to doubt." According to Mazowiecki the "way to resolve the present problems in the country is to clearly define the standpoint of the government towards the most important national economic and social affairs." When speaking about the strike wave, the Freedom Union leader said that he wonders why "those who now say that they are striking in the name of Solidarity in support of the state enterprise pact not so long ago undermined a government which created the pact." According to Mazowiecki, "it is unjust that all of society suffer due to a strike staged by a narrow social group such as that of the coal miners in Belchatow."
