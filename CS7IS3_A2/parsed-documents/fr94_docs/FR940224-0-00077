FR940224-0-00077 FR940224-0-00019 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 021794A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for pollock by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the first allowance of the pollock total allowable catch (TAC) for the offshore component in this area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), February 18, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., August 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Resource Management Specialist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI Exclusive Economic Zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii), the first seasonal allowance of pollock for vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the BS was established by the final groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994), as 330,671 metric tons (mt). The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director) has determined in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(8), that the first allowance of pollock TAC for the offshore component in the BS soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 320,671 mt with consideration that 10,000 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the BS. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the BS, effective from 12 noon A.l.t., February 18, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., August 15, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20.
