The potentially embarrassing disclosure, came in a parliamentary written answer by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister. Mr Aitken said defence equipment exports under the Al-Yamamah deal had "Crown status", in common with all government defence exports, and were "therefore not subject to export licensing requirements." It also emerged last night that the disclosure had earlier been brought to the attention of Lord Justice Scott who is conducting the arms-for-lraq inquiry. Evidence before the inquiry shows that the government pressed ahead with defence deals with Saudi Arabia in spite of being warned by intelligence and some officials that the country was possibly being used to divert military equipment to Iraq. Mr Paul Regan, a spokesman for the Scott inquiry, said the judge was looking at the potential loopholes inherent in Crown status arrangements, which are believed to cover a number of other potentially sensitive defence deals, and the extent to which the government had adhered to restrictions on exports to Iraq directly or through a third country. Al-Yamamah is a two-stage government-to-government deal covering supplies of British arms, infrastructure, and defence services worth more than 2bn pounds per year. Mr Jim Cousins, the Labour MP who tabled the parliamentary question, said yesterday that the government's answer was "of very considerable significance" in the light of evidence given to the Scott inquiry. Mr Cousins said the answer showed there was "a great hole" in the export licence control system. The Ministry of Defence said last night that there was no requirement for transactions with Crown status either to have export sales licences or for end-user details to be provided. Mr Aitken said sales under Al Yamamah were subject to "the normal foreign and defence policy considerations." The Al-Yamamah deal dates from 1985 and was reinforced in 1988. Although signed by defence secretaries Mr Michael Heseltine and his successor Mr George Younger, now Lord Younger of Prestwick, it had from the outset the strong personal backing of Lady Thatcher the then prime minister. A year ago, Mr John Major, the prime minister, secured the latest order for arms estimated to be worth 4bn-5bn pounds total. Full details of the deal have never been disclosed. British officials and industrialists have said this was at the insistence of the Saudi authorities.
