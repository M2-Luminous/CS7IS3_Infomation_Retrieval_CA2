In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday Panov underlined that, after the Russian president's historic "break-through" visit to Beijing, Russia is now engaging in a wide, dynamic range of cooperation with China both on the international scene and in their bilateral relations. Panov said China is a high priority in Russia's foreign policy. The deputy minister reported that Kozyrev's visit will include preparations for a return visit to Moscow by the Chinese chairman. Panov thinks that the fact that Russia's new year is beginning with visits by the American President to Moscow and then the Russian foreign minister to Beijing is symbolic. Although these delegations are in different "weight categories", the two visits will maintain equilibrium in Russia's foreign policy, which is directed to the east as much as it is to the west.
