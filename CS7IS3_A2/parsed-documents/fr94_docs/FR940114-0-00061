Design values in this ``Table'' are only applicable to roof slopes between 10 degrees (nominal 2/12 slope) and 30 degrees. 5 The design uplift pressures are the same whether they are applied normal to the surface of the roof or to the horizontal projection of the roof. 6 Shingle roof coverings that are secured with 6 fasteners per shingle through an underlayment which is cemented to a 3/8'' structural rated roof sheathing need not be evaluated for these design wind pressures. 7 7. Structural rated roof sheathing that is at least 3/8'' in thickness, installed with the long dimension perpendicular to roof framing supports, and secured with fasteners at 4'' on center within 3'&hyph;0'' of each gable end or endwall if no overhang is provided and 6'' on center in all other areas, need not be evaluated for these design wind pressures. 8 Exterior coverings that are secured at 6'' o.c. to a 3/8'' structural rated sheathing that is fastened to wall framing members at 6'' on center need not be evaluated for these design wind pressures.
