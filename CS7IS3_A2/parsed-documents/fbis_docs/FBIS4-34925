Suriname's admittance to Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] next month is expected to create possibilities to make these intentions come true. So says the Surinamese president. Meanwhile Guyana's president, Cheddi Jagan, has assured his Dutch counterpart of his country's support for Suriname's request for Caricom membership. President Jagan arrived in Suriname on Monday [20 June] for a four-day official visit. Marion Riedewald reports: [Begin recording] [Riedewald] President Ronald Venetiaan says the border dispute between Suriname and Guyana should be solved in order to promote collaboration between the two countries. Guyana, 25 years ago, occupied the piece of land which she claims to be hers. The countries are disputing about where the source of the bordering Corantijn River is. The problem originates from the time when Suriname was a colony of the Netherlands and Guyana a colony of England. Holland and England then agreed that the Corantijn River would be the border to Suriname and Guyana, taking the uppper Corantijn as the source of the Corantijn. Now President Ronald Venetiaan suggests international mediation to solve this problem. However, the border dispute should not stand in the way of positive collaboration between the two nations, say the Surinamese president. During a special address to the National Assembly on Tuesday [21 June], Guyana's president, Cheddi Jagan, said the Corantijn River should not be dividing, but uniting the two countries. He suggested that the parliaments of Suriname and Guyana make laws that enable mutual private investments in the two countries. [Jagan] Clearly we cannot be satisfied merely with the establishment of democratic institutions. Our democratic institutions, including our parliaments, must function in a manner that puts the welfare of our people at the central point of our purpose. [Riedewald] Bilateral collaboration is not enough says Jagan. Suriname and Guyana should also work together within regional organizations. During his four-day visit to Suriname, President Jagan visited the state oil company, the banana company, and (Effebacher) power plants and other production facilities in Suriname. [end recording]
