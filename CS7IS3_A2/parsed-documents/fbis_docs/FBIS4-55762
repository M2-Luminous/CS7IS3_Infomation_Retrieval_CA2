Spacek said that more detailed information concerning the signing of the law would be provided by the Presidential Office on Friday. The law, passed by parliament on April 29, was handed to the Presidential Office on May 5. Havel could have applied suspensive veto on the law. Some deputies said after its passing they would submit the law to the Constitutional Court as they believe it defined the victims of Nazism on the basis of racial aspects, and that it thus contradicts the Constitution. At a dinner last night the prepared law on the Senate, the as yet non-existent upper chamber of the Czech parliament, was discussed, parliament Deputy Chairman Karel Ledvinka told journalists. He said the parliament officials had informed the president of the fact that "there is a good will in parliament to pass the law." Spacek added that Havel prefers a two-round system for the Senatorial elections.
