Polish-Swedish talks on this issue are in progress. Last Friday [21 January], the Czechs and Slovaks prevented a group of 55 Albanians from crossing the border. They had to travel through Ukraine instead, Molga told a PAP journalist. The Czech Republic has recently introduced visas for citizens from the former Yugoslavia, which has made the transit of refugees on the way back [from Sweden] complicated. Leszek Czerwonka, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ] border traffic department, told a PAP journalist that there was an agreement on this matter between Poland and Sweden. According to this agreement, Sweden can send back through our country those refugees who have failed to be granted refugee status and who arrived in Sweden during the period when that country did not have visa-authorized traffic with the former Yugoslavia, and who have been illegally extending their stay. These refugees are transported through Poland by the Swedes in coaches that are paid by them. In accordance with this agreement, such groups cross the border of the Polish Republic in Swinoujscie and in Chyzne and Cieszyn. [passage omitted including passage indistinct] The MSZ Office for Immigration and Refugees said that citizens from the former Yugoslavia on their way back through Poland do not ask for political asylum in our country.
