Besides restoring seven floors on the right side of the building, the so-called sectors G-1 and G-2, they did a good deal of additional work. This organization, which is not well known even to specialists, began to be discussed literally during the first weeks of work, and when the plans for construction of the new parliamentary center appeared, it was the one to receive the prestigious order. What kind of a firm is this, which has constructed hundreds of the largest facilities but until recently seemed to remain in the shadows? This and other questions are answered by Colonel General Aleksandr Tumanov, chief of the Federal Administration of Special Construction under the Government of the Russian Federation. [Ivanyuk] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, last year your organization celebrated its 40th anniversary... [Tumanov] Yes, it was created in July 1953. The Glavspetsstroy [Main Administration for Special Construction Work] (that is what it was called at the time) included 14 construction and installation administrations, 10 individual construction units, and several enterprises with various profiles. These forces had to carry out an extremely important task--to create an air defense system for Moscow in the shortest possible period of time. In addition to specialized facilities it was necessary to build a broad highway network, electric power transmission lines, substations, mechanization and transportation bases, and many other things. As early as 1955 the basic facilities of the Moscow air defense system were turned over to the military department. A system for protection of Leningrad was created in parallel. [Ivanyuk] That is, your organization more or less came to the aid of the military builders of the Ministry of Defense. [Tumanov] Not quite. We found our own "niche" very quickly. At the time one of the priority tasks was to raise the country's defense industry to a qualitatively new level. Glavspetsstroy was assigned the construction of the production shops, buildings, and structures, scientific research institutions, and design bureaus of the ministries of aviation, the radio-technical industry, shipbuilding, and the chemical, electronics, and defense industry. New military construction administrations were created in Saratov, Kuybyshev, Voronezh, Severodvinsk, and other cities. [Ivanyuk] Now one could probably name certain specific facilities that were constructed during those years. [Tumanov] It would be impossible to list all that was constructed. A very large volume of work was done in Moscow by seven military construction administrations. It would probably be hard to find a person in the capital who has not heard of the firms of Koroleva and Lavochkina or the plants Khromatron and imeni Khrunichev. Many administrative buildings, residential buildings, and medical institutions were built according to individual plans. The remarkable bicycle race track was built on Krylatskiy for the 1980 Olympics. In St. Petersburg I would mention first of all the Svetlana Plant, the scientific research production-design institute Terminal, the Leninets scientific production association, and the scientific research institute of instruments, for whose construction at the end of the seventies the prize of the USSR Council of Ministers was awarded. A significant scientific and production potential was created in Voronezh. Among the enterprises and scientific research institutes built by the military builders was the plant for electro-vacuum instruments, the scientific research institute of communications, and the design bureau for chemical automation. The Glavspetsstroy has done a great deal for the aerospace industry. We built the Center for Aviation and Space Machine-Building in Samara where, in particular, the Energiya missile was made. And in general for the Energiya-Buran program we built facilities in Moscow and in the Urals and in the Moscow environs. In Sverdlovsk Oblast such strategically important facilities as the plant for producing titanium was introduced, and in Verkhnyaya and Nizhnyaya Salda--facilities for testing missile aircraft engines. The construction administration in Severodvinsk, which is now headed by Major General Anatoliy Polyakov, created the Center for Construction of Nuclear Submarines starting from zero. The immense scale of this construction project is shown by the fact that four football fields could be placed under the roof of the assembly shop. During 1966-1967 construction was started on a whole complex of defense industry enterprises in Udmurtia. Through the efforts of two construction administrations an immense volume of work was performed--comparable to what was done in Moscow. Giants of industry were constructed such as the Izhevsk automotive plant, which is intended for annual output of 200,000 motor vehicles and 450,000 motorcycles, the Izhevsk metallurgical combine, which provides "defense" with especially strong grades of steel, the Izhevsk motor plant, which produces space electronic equipment, the Izhevsk radio plant, which produces the most complicated instruments and household radio equipment, the now world-renowned Votkinskiy machine-building plant where SS-20 missiles were produced... [Ivanyuk] Each of these facilities probably required that the builders come up with difficult engineering solutions. [Tumanov] Undoubtedly. For example, when constructing the bicycle race track on Krylatskiy in order to cover spans of 168 meters, they installed on inclined metal arches two saddle-shaped coverings made of rolled welded steel sheets four millimeters thick. And the supports were reinforced with solid reinforced concrete tie-beams which can hold up to 6,000 tonnes. This was the first time such a solution had been used in domestic or foreign practice. One could give many examples like this. And in 1989 the Planning Design-Technological Institute was created as a part of Glavspetsstroy, which made it possible to perform the full cycle of work for creating one facility or another, to introduce the achievements of science and technology more actively, and to reduce the time periods for construction. [Ivanyuk] Spetsstroy must be distinguished by its autonomy. [Tumanov] It does approximately 80 percent of its work with its own forces. The Main Administration includes automotive transportation enterprises and mechanization administrations. Practically every year we build an enterprise for the development of our own production base. Now, for example, in the Moscow suburb of Tuchkovo we are building a modern brick plant which meets European standards. It will produce 45 million bricks a year. We want to arrange production of plastic carpentry items. In recent years we have mastered the technology for pouring solid concrete and producing gypsum-cardboard partitions. Industry of the Main Administration produces a total of more than a million cubic meters of reinforced concrete a year, approximately the same amount of gravel and sand, hundreds of square meters of carpentry items, tens of thousands of "cubes" of items made of cellular concrete, and tens of thousands of tonnes of metal structural elements. [Ivanyuk] Your organization has been working for "defense" for decades. The conversion of the defense industry, and especially the way it is proceeding, could not but affect the work of the builders. [Tumanov] Of course, it has had an effect. We too are now conducting a kind of conversion process, and it is rather painful. While before 1990 each day we released 700,000-750,000 square meters of industrial space and 500,000-600,000 square meters of dwelling space for operation, now it would be ideal to reverse this ratio. But the decline of production during the past two or three years was so sharp that last year we were only able to reach the level of 450,000 square meters. And I am not even talking about industrial projects. And this also entailed a considerable outflow of personnel, although we were able to retain many of them. The number of military construction workers also decreased from 50,000 to 20,000. Working in Glavspetsstroy has always been prestigious. For example, we used to hire 40 graduates of the Moscow Engineering Construction School each year and we held a competition for them to enter our system. Many officers from the military schools also had hopes of working in Glavspetsstroy. I recall my own experience, since I came to one of the largest construction projects in Udmurtia as a lieutenant after graduating from the Kazan Engineering-Construction School. We have always tried to create good conditions for the work and recreation of our people: We set up polyclinics and hospitals with the latest in technical equipment, built sanatoriums-preventive treatment facilities, and health bases. Each year 10,000-11,000 children spend the summer in recreation camps alone. Even now during these difficult times we are building a children's health facility to accommodate 450, which is to be put into operation in 1995. We are solving our workers' housing problems. There were times when we constructed 200,000-250,000 square meters of housing a year for ourselves alone. But even this year, for example, in Moscow alone we will release at least 250 apartments. Now we are faced with the task of making housing construction the main area of the work of the entire Main Administration. To do this we are reconstructing housing construction combines in Izhevsk and Novorossiysk. [Ivanyuk] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, what are your specific plans for this year? [Tumanov] There are many suggestions. A large volume of work is planned for Moscow. Thus the Moscow Construction Committee has turned over to us for reconstruction an entire block of residences on Zoologicheskaya Street--about 100,000 square meters of housing, garages, parking lots, and offices. In today's prices this amounts to more than a quarter of a trillion rubles. Large amounts of work are also planned for Butovo and Lyublina. If we look at the defense industry, it is "loading" us by 15 percent. They are the traditional clients--the Izhevsk plants, the design bureau imeni Lavochkin, the Severodvinsk nuclear center. Perhaps the most difficult situation now is in Severodvinsk: They have plenty of work but no money. We might have to relocate part of the organization to another region. Two new construction administrations were formed recently in Krasnodar Kray and the creation of several subdivisions is in the stage of development. We are prepared to work in any region of Russia and carry out any tasks in short periods of time. [Ivanyuk] The "special construction workers" are used to strict deadlines but will you be able to compete in terms of quality? [Tumanov] With good quality of construction materials and control of the course of the work I think we can cope with any task, and it is a fact that we will do it at a lower cost, even if we have to buy some of the materials abroad. We have experience in building unique facilities. I have already mentioned the bicycle race track on Krylatskaya. I can also name others: the Moscow area flight control center, the relay tower in Novorossiysk. We are also striving to gain new experience. In 1990 we acquired a license to engage in foreign economic activity and we already have two joint ventures with foreign firms functioning. During this time we have managed to build a station for technical service for the Soviet-Japanese firm Imis. In conjunction with the Canadians we have released several offices "turnkey" for foreign firms and we are building an ice cream plant for the well-known American firm Baskin-Robbins in Moscow. So we are giving serious thought to reaching the level of world standards.
