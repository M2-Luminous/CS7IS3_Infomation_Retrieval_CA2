Balza and General Hernan Jose Guzman, Colombian Army commander, set dates for visits to Colombia and Argentina by high-ranking staff officers of both armies and established a student exchange program for advanced military courses. Thus, in principle, two Argentine officers will arrive soon in Colombia to take lancers courses and other military disciplines, while two Colombian officers will travel to Argentina for an advanced military intelligence course and other advanced studies. In addition, the Colombian Army commander is scheduled to officially visit the Argentine Army headquarters in late June. Balza praised the good relations between the two forces, saying: "We must try to achieve greater cooperation through mutually beneficial agreements. We do not have to gain each other's confidence, because we already have it."
