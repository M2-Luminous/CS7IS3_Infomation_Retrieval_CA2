TRT correspondent Kudret Dogandemir reports from Paris: [Begin Dogandemir recording] Cindoruk is continuing his contacts in Paris. Cindoruk devoted his day to the French National Assembly and the Senate with the aim of promoting relations between the parliaments of the two countries. Cindoruk, in Paris on an official visit, held a breakfast meeting with National Assembly President Phillipe Seguin. During the meeting, Seguin stated that Turkey is a very powerful country in its region. In turn, Cindoruk stated that Turkey is conducting deliberate and persistent efforts to enter the European Union. Cindoruk later signed the National Assembly guest book, and Seguin presented Cindoruk with a plaque. Cindoruk later met with the head of the Socialist caucus, (Martin Malve), and answered questions on the PKK. Pointing out that the PKK is a terrorist organization, Cindoruk recalled that Germany and France have banned PKK activities in their countries. Explaining that racism was never an issue in the transition from the Ottoman identity to the Turkish identity, Cindoruk stressed that everybody in Turkey has equal freedom and rights. Cindoruk said that like France, which does not want Corsica to be divided or to break away, Turkey also does not want the unity of the state to be disrupted. Pointing out that the terrorists kill the old, the young, and the innocent indiscriminately, Cindoruk said: They both kill people and burn machines. They force the parties and newspapers in those regions to shut down. Cindoruk added that unfortunately, certain countries support those who are working against Turkey and use the human rights issue as an excuse. (Malve) said Turkey has taken important steps toward development. [passage omitted] [end recording]
