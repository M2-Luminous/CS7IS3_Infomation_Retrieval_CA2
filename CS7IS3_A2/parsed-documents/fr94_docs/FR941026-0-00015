FR941026-0-00015 FR941026-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner 24 CFR Parts 207, 213, 221, and 236 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1660; FR&hyph;3342&hyph;N&hyph;02] RIN 2502&hyph;AG04 Deletion of the 90 Percent-of-Value Criterion in Section 223(a)(7) Refinancing; Extension of Effectiveness AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Notice of extended effective period. SUMMARY: This notice extends the effectiveness of the interim rule, published October 26, 1993 (58 FR 57558), which deletes the value criterion in section 223(a)(7) refinancing. The rule will remain in effect until April 26, 1995. The final rule is currently in the last stages of review by HUD and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and will be published when approved. EFFECTIVE DATE: As of October 26, 1994, the interim rule published October 26, 1993 (58 FR 57558), is effective until April 26, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jane Luton, Acting Director, Policies and Procedures Division, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Room 6142, Washington, D.C. 20410. Telephone numbers: (202) 708&hyph;2556; and TDD (202) 708&hyph;4594. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 223(a)(7) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715n(a)(7)) (the Act) authorizes HUD to insure mortgages given to refinance existing HUD-insured mortgages under any section or title of the Act. HUD has implemented Section 223(a)(7) in each of its regulations authorizing the insurance of mortgage refinancing, including 24 CFR parts 207, 213, 220, 221, 231, 232, 236, 241, and 242. Due to requirements of the Act, each of these parts limits the principal amount of the refinanced mortgage to the lower of: (a) the original principal amount of the existing mortgage, or (b) the unpaid balance of the existing mortgage, to which certain HUD-approved items may be added. Additionally, each of these parts, except parts 241 (supplemental loans) and 242 (hospitals), prohibited the refinanced mortgage amount from exceeding a stated percentage of the Federal Housing Commissioner's estimate of value of the project after completion of any repairs, improvements, or additions to the property. Unlike the limitation noted above, the value criterion was not a statutory requirement. The value criterion precluded many troubled projects from refinancing their HUD-insured mortgages, thus preventing them from lowering their debt service payments and gaining a sounder financial footing. Because Section 223(a)(7) mortgages are already limited by the amount of the original insured mortgage, HUD felt the public interest and HUD's Insurance Fund would be better served by allowing these loans to be refinanced to take advantage of lower interest rates. Accordingly, on October 26, 1993, HUD published an interim rule (58 FR 57558) removing the value criterion from those sections of HUD's regulations implementing Section 223(a)(7). The preamble to the interim rule stated that the rule would cease to be effective after October 26, 1994, unless before that date HUD published it as a final rule. The final rule is currently in the last stages of review by HUD and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and will be published upon approval. To prevent a period during which there is no rule in effect on this subject, the Department is extending the effective date of the interim rule deleting the value criterion in Section 223(a)(7) refinancing, from October 26, 1994, until April 26, 1995. This action extends the potential effective period from 11 months to 18 months which is in accordance with internal Departmental guidelines on interim rules. However, the Department anticipates that a final rule will be published well before the expiration of the 18-month period. The final rule would supersede the interim rule. Consistent with the extension of the interim rule, the Department also is extending the Expedited Section 223(a)(7) Processing Instructions (issued November 24, 1993 for use by the Department). The instructions will now be effective until April 26, 1995, unless otherwise superseded. Dated: October 20, 1994. Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.
