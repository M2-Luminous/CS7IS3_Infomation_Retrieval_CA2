He said that in seeking dialogue, developing countries should be conscious not only of the aspirations and concerns of the South but also of the interests of the North. The summit, which was officially opened by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, ended on 30 March. According to President Suharto, the developing countries of the South should emphasize the spirit of promoting common interests and mutual benefit. This is the only way the G-15 can bring the international economy out of its present disarray and recast the inequitable international structures and practices that have resulted in deepening disparity and injustice in international economic relations. The views presented to the G-15 summit by President Suharto could be called strategic, although that would put him in a difficult position. This is because the head of state was representing Asian member countries at the summit and was also speaking in his capacity as the chairman of the Nonaligned Movement (NAM), which handles several other complex issues. At the same time President Suharto was carrying out Indonesia's policy toward the G-15. Since the first G-15 summit in Kuala Lumpur in 1990, Indonesia has offered its expertise in three programs: Population development, agriculture and food production, and management to overcome foreign debt problems. Indonesia is ready to send its officials to provide expertise and advice to officials of any G-15 member country that requires such programs. Now let us refer to the G-15's objectives, spelled out when it was formed in 1990 following the NAM summit in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. One of objectives was to provide developing countries with an opportunity to discuss effectively the basic problems facing the Third World and the relevancy of the NAM. The 10th NAM Summit in Jakarta managed to revitalize the group, thus clearing up doubts about its relevancy in the post-Cold War period following the reconciliation between the superpowers. Another G-15 objective was to emphasize the effectiveness of the existing group of 77 developing countries, or Third World countries, known as the Group of 77 (G-77). The G-77 represented the developing countries at various international fora. It was hoped that by reducing the G-77 to the G-15, the voices of the developing countries could be channeled more effectively, especially in promoting the long-stagnant North-South dialogue. It was also hoped that, among other things, the G-15 could play a more active role in the international arena. The G-15 is believed to have the potential to become a consultative partner with the Group of Seven developed countries (G-7) for the steady development of a favorable international environment. The G-15 is expected to produce a working formula to improve South-South cooperation and conduct regular consultative meetings with the industrialized countries of the North, which are attempting to undermine multilateralism in the post-Cold War era. The G-15 should also establish closer cooperation among developing nations and focus its attention on the creation of a world founded on social justice, peace, industrialization, economic cooperation, and sustainable development. Although the proposed dialogue between the G-15 and the G-7 is expected to be informal, it will be advantageous to the Third World countries. Apart from that, the G-15 should produce an effective formula on protectionism to protect the trade interests of developing countries following the completion of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations. The G-15 must seek ways to settle the foreign debt burden faced by developing countries and the UN role in creating peace and sustainable development. It must discuss proposals for restructuring the membership of the United Nations Security Council in line with the changing international scenario. As the NAM chairman, Indonesia is committed to ensuring that the G-15 continues to place great emphasis on cooperation among developing countries and on international peace, prosperity, and justice. In general, all nations have the confidence to solve global conflicts in a new democratic spirit of partnership through dialogue and negotiation. As a result, the G-15 forum on South-South cooperation and consultation should be intensified so that it becomes an effective instrument to participate in international dialogues and negotiations and achieve its objectives.
