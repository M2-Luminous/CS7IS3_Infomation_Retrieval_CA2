The northern border, where a de facto economic and commercial integration is supposed to exist, constitutes the practical scenario to show the advantages of the commercial agreement in a natural and everyday manner. In Chihuahua, however, the situation appears to be the same, at least in regard to regional exports from the state to U.S. markets. Despite everything, as far as imports are concerned, it is possible to find in the supermarkets a variety of U.S. products that are being sold without Spanish labels and even foods with expired dates on them. Is the Mexican Customs opening in keeping with the "free flow of foods" that is being promoted by NAFTA or is it simple premodernistic [premoderno] smuggling. As for Chihuahua's exports, there is discouragement and disappointment. Apple producers who process the fruit and sell it as concentrate or syrup must, before every shipment, wait for lab tests in order to introduce their product. The product is kept by Customs for days, which entails additional expense since apples are a perishable product. Apparently, the elimination of nontariff barriers has not reached the U.S. Customs officials yet. Another case in point is that of a renowned producer of Mexican bread and tortillas, which are exported to the United States. To preclude surprises in each shipment, he asked that a customs office be set up at his plant where compliance with the rigorous U.S. health requirements is documented, verified, and certified. Despite this, tortilla shipments and exports are stopped and sent for lab tests, thus delaying and raising the Mexican exporter's operating costs. In addition to these protectionist examples, typical of U.S. praxis and insensitive to NAFTA, there is a very significant and well documented "free trade" experience. An executive of a business association or chamber accompanied by Mexican and U.S. notaries tried to determine levels of bias and ambiguity among U.S. Customs officials. For this purpose, he bought several gallons of U.S. milk (the milk sector of the state refuses to let go, despite efforts by the sector's industrialists via subsidized imports and official policy). He shipped it and imported it into Mexican territory. Subsequently, he switched the packaging (not the containers) and replaced them with others that had Mexican labels. When the same milk was exported to the United States, Customs officials stopped the shipment and conducted the lab tests that have become customary for Mexican perishables. The milk was rejected because it yielded negative results (unhealthy bacteria and foreign objects). How can one interpret this Customs behavior that milk producers have documented with Mexican and U.S. notaries? In sum, the cases described have nothing to do with promises of "clear and objective regulations for permanent access to the national exports" that were used to justify this national decision to sign and approve NAFTA. Therefore, before further lowering tariffs and beginning the new opening for the announced banking services, the government should demand the effective dismantling of nontariff restrictions because thus far, neither commercial reciprocity nor NAFTA have reached Chihuahua's border.
