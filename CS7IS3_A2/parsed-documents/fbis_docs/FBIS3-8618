Krajisnik said this after talks in Pale today with the Russian president's special envoy Vitaliy Churkin, which took place after Churkin's talks with Muslim President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo. "Churkin came here to inform us about the talks he held with the Muslim side and about the talks between the Croats and Muslims. He wanted to hear our position on this," Krajisnik said after the talks with Churkin. "Churkin said no obstacles should be put in the way of the Croat-Muslim agreement. He also said that some people think that the Serbs should also have a loose link with the Croat-Muslim federation, perhaps in the form of a union," Krajisnik said. He added that he had told Churkin that the Serb side's position will be officially presented tomorrow in Belgrade, where Churkin is expected to meet Nikola Koljevic, the Srpska republic's deputy president, and Aleksa Buha, the foreign minister. "Churkin told me the Bosnian Serbs should have a firmer link with the rest of the Serb people," Krajisnik said, and added that the Russian envoy did not define the nature of such a link in clear terms. "The concept is not exactly clear, but we have nevertheless undertaken the obligation to negotiate all possible solutions," Krajisnik said, adding that the Serb side is ready to resume talks as long as Serb interests are not threatened. As regards Churkin's statement after the talks with Izetbegovic that Tuzla airport will not be under the control of Russian troops but that the Russian military observers will be deployed there, Krajisnik said: "We reached an agreement on this in Russia. According to the agreement, civilian Russian representatives will be deployed at Tuzla airport, together with the Serb ones. I think this is a realistic agreement, and Mr. Churkin said today the Russian side will insist on it. This gives us encouragement in our belief that we will finally reach the right solution for the opening of Tuzla airport," Krajisnik said in conclusion.
