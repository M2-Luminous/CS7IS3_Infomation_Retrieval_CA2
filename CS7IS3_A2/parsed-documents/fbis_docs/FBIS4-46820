Relations are forming between Russia and Ukraine that are reminiscent of the "cold war," and a "war of nerves" is going on that is fraught with border disputes and interethnic clashes. And this is at a time when an overwhelming part of the population of one and the other country is not experiencing hostility toward each other. Moreover, the traditional friendly relations of the two peoples urgently require amicable interstate relations. Political elites are competing between themselves who, as it seems to us, cannot find a common language by virtue of the obsession with imperial great power ambitions on the one hand, and the so-called "Pereyaslavl complex," with excessive fears regarding a threat to Ukrainian independence--on the other hand. Under conditions of a lack of clear state rule from both sides, too great a force in the adoption of political decisions is acquired by the generals and admirals and their small but very active ultrapatriotic, chauvinist circles in both Russia and in Ukraine. This threatens that the ruling state structures will lose control of the situation. It looks especially explosive in connection with the recent presidential elections in the Crimea, the provocative statements of Crimean President Meshkov and the position of the command of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Similar actions could cause a chain reaction of the further regionalization of Ukraine and Russia at best, and at worst--it could unleash a civil war. We are categorically against the policy of the two countries being determined by generals and admirals among whose functions this does not fall. We are against the emergence of a "Crimean Zhirinovskiy" in Ukraine, and more specifically in the Crimea. After considering numerous problems in Ukrainian-Russian relations, many of which have an undoubtedly objective character, in particular economic, international-legal, and culturological, we came to the conclusion that these problems are completely resolvable, given the competence, persistence, and tolerance of the sides. And the main thing: Given a clear realization of the desire to come to a mutually acceptable compromise by means of bilateral concessions that do not affect state sovereignty and the independence that was recently acquired by both sides. During the course of our discussions, we coordinated the measure and volume of such concessions and are prepared to report them to the authoritative structures. Being loyal citizens of both countries and at the same time professionals in the field of international relations, we caution the governments and the authoritative structures of both sides against playing with fire. The recent events in the area of Odessa were a striking example of the possible uncontrollable development of events. These kinds of incidents, given the current nature of authority in both countries, are entirely probable in the future as well. It is difficult to predict how local military authorities will behave in this case, just as it is difficult to predict the chain reaction of similar events. At the same time, careful analysis of the foreign policy of both countries shows a real possibility not only of resolving bilateral problems, but also of effectively achieving an "international division of labor" in current international relations, in the resolution of problems of European security and relations with developing countries, in the resolution of problems of domestic and world economies and participation in joint international projects, and in the development of common positions in relations with the leading countries of the West--without unnecessary competition and ambitious political games of the ruling circles of Ukraine and Russia. We view this appeal as a serious warning to the governments and public organizations of both countries, and we urgently request that it be taken into account in the preparation of decisions that affect the fundamental interests of Ukraine and Russia.
