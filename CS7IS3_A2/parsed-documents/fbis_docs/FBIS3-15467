Nazeykin said the draft resolution submitted for consideration by First Vice Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets envisions allocating funds to TV and radio broadcasting companies for them to prepare programs and communications enterprises for their distribution services. According to the document, TV and broadcasting companies will have to remove commercials from the state air time. They will be broadcast at other time at commercial prices. Re-selling air time is expected to be prohibited. Nazeykin said it still remained unknown whether the document will be approved by the government. As for the state's debt to communications sector workers worth 65.9 Bn [Billion] rubles which made them cut down air time in many regions of Russia on February 10, the money has been paid out, according to Nazeykin.
