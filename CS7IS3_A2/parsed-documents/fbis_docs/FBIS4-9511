In your opinion, what was the difference between the negotiations conducted with the IMF by Vladimir Meciar's government and the negotiations carried out a few days ago by Jozef Moravcik's government? [Schmognerova] In the way the negotiations were conducted. When I was appointed, I was in the United States and I had the opportunity to speak with senior officials from the World Bank and the IMF. The upshot of this was that, immediately following our request, missions from these institutions came to Slovakia. As opposed to the previous negotiations, the government submitted its own concept for economic policy. Apart from this, we submitted an analysis of the risks facing the state budget and also an analysis of the measures for counteracting these risks. In the past, the approach at the negotiations was that the IMF drew up the basis for a memorandum on economic policy and the government then approved it. Our approach was much more active. [Stulajter] Were there any differences between the IMF and government representatives? [Schmognerova] Not in the aims we are pursuing. The IMF had pointed out in the past that transformation is slowing down significantly. Then, there was no certitude that the loan would be paid. We announced unequivocally that the transformation process will be speeded up. [Stulajter] This is true, but the former government also -- in its declarations -- expressed its support for transformation. Deeds are important. What will the government's first steps be to improve its credibility vis-a-vis the IMF? [Schmognerova] Before the end of the month, the government will submit to the National Council of the Slovak Republic draft laws on value-added tax, consumer tax, and child allowances. [Stulajter] The draft law on value-added tax will obviously proceed from the addendum to the memorandum on the government's economic policy, which talked about amalgamating the rates for this tax... [Schmognerova] This step has been prepared for a long time; the difference, however, will be that the rates will not be amalgamated, but that some items from the 6.0-percent tax bracket will be regrouped into the 25-percent bracket. It should transpire that the government will have the possibility to determine by law which products will be burdened by the higher rate. It will be far more flexible this way. [Stulajter] Can you tell us which products will not be affected by the higher value-added tax? [Schmognerova] Basic foodstuffs and medicines. [Stulajter] By how much will the state budget's revenue be increased? [Schmognerova] It could amount to around 3.0 billion korunas. [Stulajter] What about the child allowances? [Schmognerova] The child allowances should be more targeted, depending on the minimum subsistence multiple. However, no decision has yet been made on the size of this multiple. Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no supplementary social system on whose basis we could categorize the claims for payment of these benefits. If we were to take twice the minimum subsistence level as the borderline for being able to claim family allowances, then child allowances would be paid to almost 88 percent of families. If there were a supplementary social system, this percentage could be lower. If there were social difficulties in families that lost their claim to these allowances, this situation could be remedied by a form of targeted assistance, for example, by various social stipends to support education in high schools and universities and so on. [Stulajter] Will budget savings be the outcome of targeting the payment of child allowances? [Schmognerova] This is our aim; however, it will not be achieved since there are no supplementary systems. In any case, this is the first step toward transforming the social sphere. [Stulajter] In connection with minimizing the budget risks, the government says in its policy statement that it wants to concentrate on unfreezing outstanding claims and on reducing tax and customs evasion... [Schmognerova] These are measures intended to give one-off assistance to the state budget. Tax collection can only be improved to a certain extent, then the efficiency of the appropriate measures becomes depleted. In principle, the same applies to unfreezing outstanding claims; but, this is implemented over a longer time frame. The decisive thing in this regard, however, is whether the decline in the economy has been halted or at least slowed down considerably. [Stulajter] This is in fact an issue associated with the development of the gross domestic product. In this context, what do you intend to concentrate on? [Schmognerova] Definitely on developing the private sector, on small and medium-size enterprise, on halting the decline in the enterprise sphere, and on exports. [Stulajter] As far as exports are concerned, what kind of pro-export measures can the government take? [Schmognerova] We would like to expand activities associated with providing insurance and possible credit for exports, as long as the resources are found. It will be necessary to improve the information available to our entrepreneurial sphere on the possibilities for exporting. In this context, the government has made it its goal to conclude bilateral agreements to create a good foundation for conducting trade. [Stulajter] How do you intend to proceed with regard to Russia? [Schmognerova] I discussed this with the Russian Federation's ambassador. The question of a link to the gas pipeline that will lead from Russia across Poland is still open. There is great interest in this project and there will be a certain amount of competition among the interested parties. The Russian side would be glad if Slovakia were to hold its ground in this competition. At the moment, we are looking very intensely at the options for financing this project. The options are also being outlined for Russian help in completing the Mochovce nuclear power plant. [Stulajter] Why would the Russian side be pleased if Slovakia were to hold its ground in this competition? [Schmognerova] This is what the ambassador said. [Stulajter] A link to the gas pipeline is one issue, another is Slovak exports to the Russian market... [Schmognerova] The demand for agricultural products has declined and, for this reason, our export potential is limited. In addition, what we are able export comes up against strong competition from the European Union where foodstuffs are heavily subsidized. The situation is similar with regard to exports of engineering equipment. Western exporters receive very advantageous export credits, which Slovakia cannot afford. Despite this, Slovak enterprises should try harder to penetrate into this territory. It is often emphasized that Russian enterprises have payment problems; this is only part of the truth, however. There are also solvent partners there and it is necessary to make contact with them. [Stulajter] The issue of the insufficient ability of Slovak products to compete on world markets is closely associated with the lack of foreign capital, which would bring advanced technology and know-how. What can the government do to increase the flow of foreign capital to Slovakia? [Schmognerova] The entry of foreign capital, compared with the Czech Republic or Hungary, is rather minimal. For example, in 1993, the growth of foreign capital in the Czech Republic was four times higher than in Slovakia during the same period. Moreover, we also included capital from the Czech lands in foreign capital. Everyone knows this, but somehow does not think it through. If the political situation here is not stable and predictable, "decent" capital will rarely come here. Foreign investors are alarmed by the confrontational statements with regard to the Hungarian minority and the extensive personnel changes throughout the state administration following the government changeover. [Stulajter] The issue does not merely involve the replacement of civil servants, but the way it is being done. [Schmognerova] Yes, it involves the overall style. [Stulajter] What is your opinion of creating advantages for foreign capital by means of various kinds of tax relief? [Schmognerova] I would not overestimate this. If there is political instability in a country, tax holidays mean little to foreign investors. After all, what guarantees do they have that they will not be canceled? [Stulajter] That was direct investments; what is your view of the entry of foreign capital into privatization? Some warnings are being issued about selling off national property cheaply, about the Slovak market being bought out. [Schmognerova] We certainly have to be careful. However, the risks will be reduced in the sense that we will base our decisions on the advice of well-known and reputable consultancy companies and privatization will take place in the form of competitions. I want to emphasize that we are very interested in foreign investors who have development plans and know-how. However, we are not interested in laundering dirty money. [Stulajter] Has there in fact been money laundering? [Schmognerova] Yes, several cases are being investigated. [Stulajter] The government has conceived a very broad program. It is even being said that some of its intentions go beyond its six- month mandate. On the other hand, who continues this program after the elections is important. If we had thought in 1990, 1991, and also partly in 1992 that the initiated reforms were irreversible, then the government of V. Meciar -- to say the least -- cast doubts on this conviction of irreversibility. This is a political commitment for the parties that currently make up the coalition. [Schmognerova] Naturally, each of these parties has the ambition to continue this program after the elections. As an economist, I am very well aware of how much time has been wasted. I entered the government knowing that I did not want there to be any more wasted time. I realize that if, after the elections, those political forces that were in power previously get into government once more, then the reforms would again be slowed down considerably or even halted. Therefore, the present government has to try to find a way of establishing development tendencies in the economy and, at the same time, of not forfeiting the people's trust. [Stulajter] Fine, but there is a real possibility that those forces you mentioned will return. The government is now faced with the task of bringing Slovakia's economic -- and social -- life out of the considerable influence of the state, where political power is concentrated most intensively. Quite simply, it is vital not to give the state a chance to turn into a dictatorship... [Schmognerova] I do not think we are able to "catch" all the risks. Incidentally, there is a risk of undemocratic development in every society. Take a look at history. There were states that had very advanced democratic institutions, but change still occurred in them. From the point of view of the current government, it is important that the measures in economic and social policy are such that no prerequisites are created in Slovakia for a victory by extremists. [Stulajter] In this context, however, the government will win the citizens' trust by means of visible acts carried out in the present as measures that will bear fruit at some distant and unspecified future time. After all, who else here cares about the future? [Schmognerova] We are working on using the foreign aid that was and is earmarked for Slovakia. I received an analysis drawn up by the Foreign Ministry on the utilization of foreign aid in the second half of 1993. You would be surprised at the amount of money we had at our disposal and how little of it was used. At the same time, these are not loans. [Stulajter] In view of the fact that you only have six months, and to make sure that the government's work bears visible fruit now, it is perhaps necessary to ask: What do we not want to do? Not because the government would lack sufficient will, but because not very much can be done in such a short period and the government may pay dearly for a too widespread span of activities. [Schmognerova] I have not thought about it like that; but I will contemplate it. I know one thing, however. The government will not prevent the liquidation of inefficient and heavily loss- making state enterprises. It will only prevent this in cases where -- from the point of view of employment in the region -- it would involve a major enterprise. Such a measure will only be taken when alternative employment has been found.
