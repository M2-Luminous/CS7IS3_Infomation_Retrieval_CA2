Under a jurisdiction annex of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on Palestinian self-rule, the power of the Palestinian autonomy authority covers all matters that fall within its territorial, functional and personal jurisdiction. The annex says the territorial jurisdiction, which covers the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, shall include land, subsoil and territorial waters. The functional jurisdiction does not include foreign relations, internal security and public order of Israeli settlements and the military installation area and Israelis, and external security. The personal jurisdiction extends to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, except for Israelis. The Palestinian authority has legislative, executive and judicial powers and responsibilities, while Israel has autority over the Israeli settlements, the military installation area, and Israelis. The annex also specifies criminal and civil jurisdiction. Two other annexes, one on israeli troops withdrawal and the other on civil matters, were also signed along with the jurisdiction annex. They are part of the Palestinian autonomy agreement. Israeli troops will complete their withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho within three weeks. An annex on economic affairs was already signed at the end of last month in Paris. The Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel signed a peace accord in Washington on last September 13, which provides for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. But, the implementation of the accord was delayed because of differences between the two sides on some key issues.
