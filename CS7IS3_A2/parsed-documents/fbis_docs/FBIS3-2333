They have manufactured six different models of corvettes, and 95 percent of the corvettes now in service were manufactured by this shipyard. Therefore, the shipyard is called the "cradle" of Chinese corvettes. Corvettes are the main vessels a naval unit uses in combat. Since its production of the first Chinese-made corvette in the early 1970's, the Hudong Shipyard and the naval representatives office have jointly created 14 top products including totally enclosed [quan feng bi 0356 1409 7028] corvettes, new types of propellers, and vessels for helicopters to land on. Central Military Commission leaders praised the shipyard for these achievements. The tactical [zhan shu 2069 2611] and technical functions of Chinese-designed and Chinese-made corvettes have stood the tests of major activities including sea combat, sailing to the South Pacific, and visiting three South Asian countries, leaving their tracks in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. "Providing top-quality naval vessels for the party and the people and qualified combat effectiveness for the armed forces" has been the pursuit of the Hudong Shipyard's cadres and workers, as well as naval representatives in the shipyard. They are very meticulous about their work: After carefully welding thousands of steel plates on a naval vessel, they use magnifying glasses, X-rays, and supersonic equipment for double checks. Cables on a vessel are generally dozens of kilometers long and of more than 100 sizes. Military engineers in the shipyard conduct repeated checks on each joint and rivet and test the land and maritime functions of each weapon and equipment. In the last 30 years they have discovered and handled more than 2,000 quality problems. As a result, over 95 percent of their military products are up to standard. The corvettes they have produced have won 13 gold and silver prizes from the state. A corvette is a science city on the sea. The Hudong Shipyard and the naval representatives office have always focused their attention on the world's advanced shipbuilding technology and brought about a higher level of combat effectiveness by means of science and technology. They have established relations of technological mutual assistance with more than 30 scientific research institutions and applied some 30 high-tech projects including laser, electronics, remote sensing, ultraviolet rays, and simulation to the manufacture of modernized naval vessels. In the meantime, they have used more than 1,000 scientific renovation achievements to improve the functions of equipment.
