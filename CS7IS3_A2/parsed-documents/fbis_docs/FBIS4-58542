[passage omitted] I would like to take the opportunity today to talk about the fact that there are two points of view in our country and in many so-called Third World countries. One view is that the people, the enlightened, and the decision-makers of the country must rely on a world-dominant power to build their country and make a future for their country. [passage omitted] That is one view. It exists in backward countries. Those who have studied geopolitics know that it exists in Latin America and in some Asian and African countries. Some enlightened people and politicians believe this. [passage omitted] I very much regret to say that there are, unfortunately, some people in some parts of our country today who still have the same view. They are still under the influence of the remnants of ideas and tastes of past puppets of the West and the United States. That is one view. Another view says no to this: We are a nation; we have certain capabilities; we must adopt the principle of utilizing our own capabilities. Of course, if we are ever stuck and see that someone else has better tools, we will go and borrow his tools and do our job. Then we will try to manufacture those tools ourselves. That is a sensible thing to do. [passage omitted] To a nation, that means scientific, practical, technical, cultural, and all-round independence. From the beginning the revolution has pursued this form of independence. Some other countries have followed this path. Countries which were nearly razed to the ground after World War II -- as is usually exaggerated in reports -- have risen and taken care of themselves and used their own manpower. By managing their worldly affairs they have today surpassed those who brought such misery to them in the war. It can be done. That is the other view. The aim of our imam [Khomeyni] -- God be satisfied with him -- was to say to our nation: O people of Iran, O Iranian youths, O Iranian workers, O Iranian engineers, O Iranian managers, you can do it without relying on foreigners. The imam wanted to revive in us the spirit of self-reliance. Over the last few decades people have said: Iranians? No, sir! They joked that domestic goods are not quality products. There is no greater injustice to a nation. Our domestically-produced goods are today in many instances much better than foreign-made goods. [passage omitted] We have many resources. I tell you from the bottom of my heart, if anyone wishes to know, that my real aspiration is that one day we can turn off the oil well taps and base our economy on something other than oil. Let us imagine this country without oil. [audience shouts approval] Of course, this may not be practical for some time. During the era of the subservient and corrupt Pahlavi regime, the enemies of Iran did a great deal of sabotage by making this nation and this country dependent on oil. The sabotage done was much greater than can be imagined, and it makes it impossible for us to realize this aspiration easily. But this must be done one day. Such a day will come when the Iranian nation utilizes its innate intelligence to stop handing these assets to those, who with utmost wickedness, exploit the national wealth of oil producing countries. On such a day this nation will be able to stand on its own two feet. Today, unfortunately, things are different. Thanks to the betrayal of some oil producing countries, and thanks to their complicity with the international plundering thieves, oil has today become a tool in the hands of the consumers instead of serving the interests of the oil producing states by benefiting them politically and economically. It has become like an inferior commodity, whereas it is a commodity without which the world would have no light, no heat, no movement, and no industry. Without oil, the modern industrial civilization, which is founded on machinery, would grind to a halt. This is how important our oil is. When I say our oil, I mean the oil of the entire region and the oil resources of the world. Of course, this region possesses the main resources, and those states which have joined hands with the plunderers unfortunately possess the major part of these oil resources. This very valuable commodity has become a tool in the hand of the consumers, and they are also very dependent on it. They began planning a policy such as this dozen of years ago and it has today reached fruition. Unfortunately, a handful of treacherous statesmen of the subservient states cooperate with them. Imagine, however, that the Iranian nation, Iranian workers, Iranian youth, Iranian producers, and Iranian teachers were to concentrate all their efforts and zeal to build this country by altering its exports/imports ratio, by reducing consumer demand and foreign currency requirements, and by building this country in such a way as to make it free from having to sell its oil at such a low price. If all this were to happen, can you imagine what great benefits such efforts would bring to this country today and in the future? How could this be possible? It would be possible when the Iranian worker regards work as true worship. [passage omitted] May God bestow his success upon all of us that we may understand our obligations and perform our tasks accordingly, God willing. May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you all.
