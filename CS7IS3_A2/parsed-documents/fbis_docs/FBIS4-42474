He is due to join in the celebrations of the 1944 operation, to "cloak himself in the prestige of Normandy," although he has never experienced war and escaped the Vietnam War. He is due to reaffirm "Lafayette, we are here!" although he is more concerned with domestic policy than foreign policy and often advocates isolationism. The criticisms of his foreign policy are now building up: vacillation and sudden about-faces on China's trade privileges, on Haiti, on Somalia, or North Korea; with regard to Bosnia in particular where the French, who urged a negotiated agreement, think that he is not going far enough and fast enough. "I am doing what I can in face of very difficult problems," Bill Clinton said, which is a far cry from the authority of Ronald Reagan, whose panache and emotion worked miracles in Normandy itself in 1984. The U.S. President nonetheless knows that Europe is vital to him. He studied at Oxford. He has had the D-Day landings explained to him. He said before his departure that the Americans had then understood that they were taking part in a historic action and that there could be no security in the United States if it did not defend "freedom." Is this enough to shoulder the role of world policeman, which Bush intended to play? Probably not. But it is enough to understand our interdependence. It is enough to propose, with more credibility than any other U.S. President, that Europe should take control of its own affairs. Clinton wants a "united and strong" Europe. The European defense initiative has never been viewed more favorably and the U.S. President would not be annoyed if the Eurocorps troops, the precursor to the European intervention force, were to march down the Champs-Elysees on 14 July. In four days' time lyricism will prevail. It could result in a salutary European reorientation if the strong solidarity of the past and France's gratitude for it finally find their present-day military and political expression. There would then be at least one lesson learned from history.
