[Begin Kravchuk recording] I express satisfaction with the meeting that took place today with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton. This really is a historic moment. It opens up a new page in the resolution of such a global problem as nuclear weapons. I am pleased to stress that having signed these trilateral documents Ukraine, together with other states, in the interests of the peoples of Ukraine and Russia and of the whole of mankind, is going along the path of nuclear disarmament and, I would say, is one of the first to take this historic step.
