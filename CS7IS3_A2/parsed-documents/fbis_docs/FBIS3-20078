Are you happy with it? [Mock] I am satisfied because it was the right step in the right direction for the first time in three weeks. One must not forget that there has not been any progress at all during the past three weeks. Today we had the possibility of really holding discussions with individual colleagues. I was able to talk to my three colleagues from the Scandinavian countries. Then we met Foreign Secretary Hurd and the Spanish foreign minister. I would say there is a fair chance that a solution will be found this week or next week. Hurd advocated the British position, but he indicated clearly that he wants a solution, even in the form of a compromise. [Broukal] Mr. Foreign Minister, this is precisely what we have tried to find out here all afternoon -- namely where is the compromise? As far as we understand the matter, it is said that in the future Great Britain cannot prevent anything, unless it says that it wants to prevent something. That means, how long will this period be during which Great Britain can say: No, we are not satisfied, we must still hold discussions? Is there a day as of which this objection is no longer valid, because only this would be progress? [Mock] This will certainly be discussed in Brussels tomorrow or the day after tomorrow -- whether or not there will be a specific point in time. However, I may give you a positive example. In Austria's social partnership [talks between representatives of employers and employees] there is no specific period for negotiations and, nevertheless, negotiations are always held until a result has been achieved with the agreement of all four parties. This is a system of which the world is envious. [Broukal] This means -- if I try to translate what you just said -- with its resistance Great Britain has achieved [recognition] that its objections cannot simply be ignored. [Mock] Correct. I believe that this must be granted, if there is not more behind it. [Broukal] If I ask you to take a bet now: What are the prospects that Austria can continue with its schedule for membership in the European Union as planned? [Mock] The working hypothesis still remains that we will be able to stick to our schedule and hope become a member of the European Union on 1 January 1995. [Broukal] Thank you for your visit to the studio, Mr. Minister.
