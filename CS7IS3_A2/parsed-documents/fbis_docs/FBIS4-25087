Those involved in preparations are the Chinese ministries in charge of supply and transportation of flood control equipment and supplies, such as the ministries of railways, the coal industry, electric power and posts and telecommunications. The Ministry of Railways has already completed its annual inspection in the south to remove hidden perils. Major Chinese oilfields have allocated special funds of up to 70 million yuan this year for flood control use. To improve accuracy in weather forecasting, the meteorological department has decided to form a combined service group to provide timely and accurate analysis of weather conditions in areas which are possible targets of heavy flood.
