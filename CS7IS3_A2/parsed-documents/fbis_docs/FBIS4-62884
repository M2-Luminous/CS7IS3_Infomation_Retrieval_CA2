Last night, an electric power line was blown up in the Gali Rayon of Abkhazia. As a result, half of the republic's territory was left without electricity. The authorities in Sukhumi believe that Georgian saboteurs are to blame. Moreover, the Georgian Army has still not received the command to withdraw its troops from the line of contact with the Abkhazian formations. I will remind you that a security zone is to be set up here, which is provided for in the agreement signed in Moscow between Tbilisi and Sukhumi.
