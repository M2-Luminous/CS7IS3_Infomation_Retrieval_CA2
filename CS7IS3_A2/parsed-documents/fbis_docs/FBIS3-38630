President Rauf Denktas received Lord Finsberg this morning and conferred with him for some time. In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that he discussed with Lord Finsberg, who is assessing the Cyprus situation, the problems created by the lack of Turkish Cypriot representation at the Council of Europe and their possible solutions. Denktas noted that he told Lord Finsberg how the obstacles created by the recognition of the Greek Cypriot administration as the legitimate government can be eliminated, adding that Lord Finsberg expressed the hope that these problems will be averted if progress is made on the confidence-building measures. Denktas said that the UN secretary general should send letters to both sides for the talks on the confidence-building measures to begin. He concluded by describing the recent positive statements made by the Greek Cypriot side as an optimistic development.
