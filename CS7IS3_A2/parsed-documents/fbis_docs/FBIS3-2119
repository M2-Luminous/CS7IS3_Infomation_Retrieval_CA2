The provincial government offices stationed outside the province made indelible contributions in 1993 to Hebei's success in accelerating the opening to the localities at home and abroad and maintaining rapid development in economic construction. Focusing on the requirements put forward by provincial leaders, they made use of their special positions and advantages, actively conducted explorations, pioneered the way forward, and notably changed and improved the work to bring in investment from outside the province and establish ties with foreign countries, develop economic and technological cooperation, provide information, increase income, receive guests and provide service, exercise management, and strengthen basic construction. They created an income of 26.68 million yuan in the whole year and realized a profit of 10.66 million yuan, a net increase of 48 percent from 1992. Meanwhile, the offices served as liaison offices for 360 projects of the province, signed 86 letters of intent, officially signed 185 contracts, planned to bring in $380 million from abroad, and provided information on 1,422 occasions, thus making contributions to the endeavor of building an economically strong province. During the conference, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, and Ye Liansong, provincial governor, attended to meet with all the delegates. Cheng Weigao commended several offices that had won notable achievements and clearly urged the participants to particularly do a good job in bringing in investment from abroad and establishing lateral ties at home, in management, and in service and to make still greater contributions to Hebei's economic development and opening to the outside world in the new year.
