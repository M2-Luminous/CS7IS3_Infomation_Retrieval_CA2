The Nakhichevan authorities also said that they will appeal to Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev to impose a state of emergency in the region if the situation is not normalised within three days. The situation in the district, home base of ex-President Abulfaz Elchibey, worsened two days ago, following the appointment of a new head of the administration. Several local leaders and deputies refused to obey the new head and called on their supporters to follow their suit. A group of front activists tried to seize the building of the local executive council last night. As a result of a clash with the police, several people were injured.
