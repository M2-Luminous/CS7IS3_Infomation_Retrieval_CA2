The central government is stepping up efforts to verify the assets at State-owned industries, said Ni Di, Vice-Minister of the State Administration of State Property. "But, it is not the central government's intent to prepare for foreign purchases, as some papers said," he told Business Weekly in an exclusive interview. After two years in pilot areas, the State Council plans to expand its verification of State-owned firms' assets nationwide. The move is of crucial importance in the development of a socialist market economy, since it provides accurate information about assets. He pointed out that it is untrue that the government plans to encourage domestic and foreign businesses to purchase loss-making large and medium-sized State-owned firms. The government is, however, encouraging some State-owned firms to use part of their equipment, workshops, and infrastructure to lure domestic and foreign investors. The potential benefits for State firms include updating equipment and operating methods, making them more competitive. But it does not mean the State has allowed trading of State-owned firms' property rights. This practice was suspended, according to a circular issued by the State Council in April this year, the vice-minister said. Setting up ventures between some State-owned firms and foreign investors therefore does not mean any change in government-dominated ownership of property, he added. It is "normal" for some small State firms and State enterprises "in severe difficulties" to contract, lease and transfer some assets to other businesses, or even go bankrupt. But Ni said such activities should be carried out according to State laws and regulations. He denied rumours that the government is to set up a special fund to revitalize State-owned enterprises. Nearly 50 per cent of the State's annual budgetary investment is now used to develop State businesses and factories. The government has special funds to build transport facilities and supply coal, electricity, and oil. It also issues State treasury bonds annually. The funds and the money raised from selling these bonds are used for supporting State businesses and firms. So Ni believes it is not necessary to have a special "revitalizing" fund for State-owned enterprises. Other official sources say there now are nine State-owned firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. They hope to raise foreign currency to update their manufacturing technologies. Yet all these firms still control the majority of their shares. as well as their property rights. It is also a common practice among State-owned firms to seek foreign investment for ventures China has more than 180,000 foreign-funded ventures which have helped revamp production technology in 26 industrial sectors. The State Statistics Bureau said a survey of 2,586 loss-making State firms in the country's eight major provinces and municipalities shows the majority are in the red due to poor management.
