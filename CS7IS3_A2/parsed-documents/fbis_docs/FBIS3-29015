The U.S. lifting of the embargo on Vietnam must have been prompted by economic realities in which the United States realized that it can no longer afford to stand aloof by Vietnam's golden market. Besides, the Vietnamese authorities have shown positive and quick responses toward the solution of the issue of U.S. soldiers missing in action (MIA's) in the Vietnam war. U.S. economic sanctions on Vietnam have been such an agonizing shackle to the United States it may be said that they applied economic sanctions on one another. Therefore, while the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam has long been envisaged, the decision on lifting the embargo had to take into account how sincerely the Vietnamese Government pushed ahead with the search for the remains of the 2,239 U.S. MIA's. No matter how important the Vietnamese market may be, the Clinton administration had to be sensitive to potential criticism from the U.S. war veterans association and the association of families of MIA's. During his visit to Hanoi toward the end of last month, however, (Charles Larson), commander of the U.S. Pacific Forces who is charged with the search operation for the U.S. MIA's, highly appraised the Vietnamese authorities' efforts in which they even offered prize money. Adding that, "If the United States normalizes relations with Vietnam, it will facilitate the resolution of the MIA issue," he opened a way to lifting the embargo. Lawmakers of the U.S. Senate Energy Committee Appropriations Subcommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee Asia-Pacific Subcommittee visited Vietnam. Upon their return home, they helped adopt a resolution calling for the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam, thus enabling the government to lift the embargo. We can better understand the background behind the steps taken in order to lift the embargo on Vietnam in view of the fact that some 300 U.S. businesses, including such multinational enterprises as Citibank, General Electric Co., and Mobile, have arrived in Vietnam to begin their brisk marketing activities there. Since Vietnam introduced the doi moi renovation policy in 1986, along the lines of the former Soviet Union's perestroyka and glasnost example, it has achieved an economic miracle with an annual average economic growth rate of 7 percent from 1991 to 1993 and an annual inflation rate of 5 percent or lower from its previous three-digit inflation rate. Vietnam's potential, no doubt, is attractive to U.S. businesses. With the lifting of the embargo, investment and cooperation between the two countries is expected to increase in various fields, such as in construction, real estate, finance, manufacturing, and in petroleum and gas projects. Brisk activities are already evident with Mobile's signing last December of a contract to develop the (Tan Long) oil field. However, the lifting of the embargo may not smoothly lead to the complete normalization of relations, for the United States will probably use the issue of normalizing diplomatic relations as leverage in securing the initiative in negotiations on pending issues, such as the MIA issue, the signing of an investment guarantee agreement, the lifting of the freeze on U.S. assets in Vietnam, and the human rights issue. Following President Clinton's 4 February announcement of the lifting of the embargo, he clarified that "This does not mean we are normalizing relations," and this supports the above analysis. Nevertheless, the U.S. lifting of the embargo on Vietnam may well have considerable impact on the world, as well as the Asian economy, because it is a signal heralding the official rebirth of the Vietnamese market, which is called "Asia's last golden market" second only to the Chinese market, in the Asian economic sphere.
