Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong made the reaffirmation at the inaugural meeting of the Joint Steering Council (JSC) of the project, which was the first since China and Singapore signed the agreement on the Suzhou industrial park project in Beijing in February this year. Under the agreement, the Suzhou Municipal Government and Singapore agencies would jointly develop a modern industrial park of 70 square kilometers at Suzhou. Singapore also agreed to make its public administration "software" available to the Suzhou project. At today's JSC meeting, the two countries reaffirmed their commitment to giving their "fullest support" to the Suzhou industrial park project, the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement at the end of the JSC meeting. "Both sides will spare no efforts to ensure the smooth progress of the project," it said. In his speech at the opening of the JSC meeting, Li Lanqing said the cooperation between China and Singapore in jointly developing the Suzhou industrial park is a matter of great importance in the history of bilateral economic cooperation. He proposed that the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and sincere cooperation be the guideline in undertaking the construction work of the Suzhou industrial park. While expressing his satisfaction with the progress made in the project so far, the Chinese vice premier said that so long as the two sides proceed in the spirit of this principle, all the difficulties that might appear in the process of the project can be overcome. Lee Hsieng Loong said the Suzhou project "is a major collaborative project of our two countries". "Singapore is fully committed to the Suzhou project. We will spare no effort to ensure the success of the software transfer," he stressed. "Given the goodwill and commitment which both sides have demonstrated in embarking on this project, I am confident that Suzhou industrial township will overcome all obstacles, and fulfill the hopes which we have invested in it," Lee said. According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the JSC will meet every year after this inaugural meeting. The next meeting will be held in Suzhou in May 1995, to coincide with the completion of the first factory in the initial 10 hectare industrial park.
