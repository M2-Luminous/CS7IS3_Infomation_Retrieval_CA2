One camp has reacted to the economic crisis by demanding protection from foreign competition. The other believes in opening up new markets for France and in placing the country in a "forced march" to modernization. This split first emerged during the campaign to ratify the Maastricht Treaty and was deepened during the GATT negotiations, Duhamel continues. Politically, the first group is made up of communists, FN [Front National] sympathizers, ecologists, and followers of National Assembly President Philippe Seguin. According to Duhamel, members of this group feel nostalgic for a France of "disparate but always protective traditions" and support protectionist devices such as "safeguard clauses, Community preference, and national exceptions." This group also tends to "curse American hegemonism...mistrust German ambition...and be suspicious of the selfishness of the powerful and of treason by the elites," Duhamel writes. The second group is characterized by Duhamel as "determined, dynamic, and resolutely positive." Its members come primarily from the white-collar class, see themselves as reformists, and nurse fewer suspicions about the Maastricht Treaty and the GATT.
