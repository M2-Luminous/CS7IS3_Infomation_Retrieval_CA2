Peres came with some proposals that are already being studied so they can be implemented without delay. Those proposals include seeking a commercial agreement -- and this is perhaps the most important proposal -- similar to the one that has been in effect for some years between Israel and the United States. Israel is setting its sights on Mexico because, Peres said, it is a nation that seeks markets and opportunities. During this private meeting, President Salinas de Gortari and Foreign Minister Peres also discussed ways to prevent double taxation which is hurting commercial exchange, to seek (?joint investments) for development and research in the field of science and technology, and to promote cultural exchange. On this latter point, it has been suggested that each country should select 10 works of literature, translate them into the other country's language, and publish them. They also talked about the new structure that must govern the United Nations now that the division between communism and democracy, north and south, no longer exists, so the Third World countries can join the First World, Peres said. Following his private meeting with the Mexican president, the Israeli foreign minister hosted a news conference where he said the 21st century is full of perils and nations have to block the path of dictators, new wars, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons because we do not have much time left. This is the time, according to Peres, to buy a ticket for revolution and to understand revolution means change. He added, it is a time to be either spectators or actors. He felt Mexico had already purchased its front row ticket. The Israeli official admitted that change has made the world more democratic and that the topic of protecting the ecology and living a free life go hand in hand. One advantage to all this is the movement of information, which travels in the sky as if it were air. Television, for example, is much stronger than the iron curtain of the communist system. [Begin Peres recording; superimposed translation into Spanish in progress] ...this revolution. In all nations, Mexico is obviously one of those cases; this is a question of deciding whether to purchase a ticket, whether one is going to enter the next century in sitting a theater seat or as a participant or an actor. Changes in the world are as follows: first, the sources of wealth and power are now of an intellectual and not material nature. Everything depends on education, science, technology and no longer on the wealth of oil or gold mines. Before, oil constituted 80 percent of Mexican exports and industrial products were 20 percent. That relation has been reversed. [end recording] Shim'on Peres arrived at Los Pinos and his movements around the city are conducted under tight security measures. A black Lincoln with him aboard leads five other cars with his personal bodyguards who issue orders in Hebrew, the official language of Israel. He has a stern and dry expression, but when he talks he becomes another person. He speaks in poetry. He said, for instance, that the task of our generation is to eliminate the desert from the earth, salt from the water, and violence from the people. That is how we will have a happy world. He feels that despite the dangers looming over us there never can be another Hitler. To conclude, upon leaving Los Pinos, Salinas de Gortari informed Peres he would be traveling to Jerusalem next year. If the visit materializes, Salinas de Gortari would be going as a tourist since he would no longer be president, according to the electoral timetable. [Station anchorwoman] Peres will conduct private activities in our country, right? [Watson] That is right. He will remain here a few hours and then leave. He is on a tour of different Latin American countries.
