Jucuapa riot police stormed the entrance of the Saul Flores School where the ballot boxes are located, according to members of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]. Ricardo Samayoa, of the FMLN Political Committee, said the people began to gather in front of the school building and added that there have not been any major incidents. [Begin recording] [Samayoa] Riot police and members of the civilian National Police, whose actions are being repudiated by the residents of Jucuapa, broke into the school building where the election ballots were being held. This incident is evidence of the fraud that Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] has tried to stage in this town as well as in the rest of the country. The residents of Jucuapa are opposed to this. There have been clashes with members of the civilian National Police. We call on the international community to take note of the incident that is occurring at this time in the town of Jucuapa. [Unidentified reporter] The ballot boxes have still not been taken to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]? [Samayoa] The ballot boxes are inside the building, but the entrance has been damaged. The locks have been destroyed and the door was damaged in an attempt to take out the ballot boxes. The people, however, have gathered there to prevent them from doing so and to observe what the riot police are doing. [end recording] The police authorities have still not made a statement on the case. The TSE and the UN Observers for El Salvador had already challenged these votes.
