FR940328-0-00040 FR940328-0-00012 Eight of the 11 endangered plant taxa are threatened by competition with one or more alien plant taxa (See Table 1). Naturalized taxa compete with native plants for space, light, water, and nutrients (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Clidemia hirta (Koster's curse), a noxious shrub first cultivated in Wahiawa on Oahu, spread to the Koolau Mountains prior to 1941, where it is now rapidly displacing native vegetation (Wagner et al. 1985). Koster's curse spread to the Waianae Mountains around 1970 and is now widespread throughout the southern half of that mountain range (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith 1985, Wagner et al. 1985). This pest forms a dense understory, shading out other plants and hindering plant regeneration, and is considered the major alien plant threat in the Koolau Mountains (HHP 1987; Smith 1989; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). At present, Koster's curse threatens Cyanea truncata, Eugenia koolauensis, Hesperomannia arborescens, Lobelia oahuensis, Lycopodium nutans, Rollandia crispa, and Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa (HHP 1993a1, 1993a2, 1993b2, 1993d1, 1993d2; HPCC 1990b1; J. Lau, K. Nagata, J. Obata, and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). Tibouchina herbacea, a relative of Koster's curse, first became established on the island of Hawaii in the late 1970s and, by 1982, was collected in Lanilili on West Maui (Almeda 1990). Although the disruptive potential of this alien plant is not fully known, Tibouchina herbacea appears to be rapidly invading mesic and wet forests of Maui, and is considered the primary alien plant threat to the only population of Hesperomannia arborescens on that island (Cuddihy and Stone 1990; HPCC 1990b2; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava) has become widely naturalized on all the main islands of Hawaii. Found in mesic and wet forests in the Koolau Mountains, strawberry guava develops into dense stands in which few other plants can grow, displacing natural vegetation. Strawberry guava is eaten by pigs that disperse the plant's seeds through the forest (Smith 1985, Wagner et al. 1985). Cyanea truncata, Eugenia koolauensis, Hesperomannia arborescens, Lycopodium nutans, and Rollandia crispa are seriously threatened by this pervasive weed (HHP 1991e8, 1991f1, 1991j16, 1993a4, 1993b1; HPCC 1991b1, 1991b2; K. Nagata, S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). After escaping from cultivation, Schinus terebinthifolius (Christmas berry) became naturalized on most of the main Hawaiian Islands (Wagner et al. 1990) and is a pervasive threat in the Koolau Mountain Range. This fast-growing tree, distributed mainly by feral pigs and fruit-eating birds, is able to form dense thickets that displace other plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith 1985, Stone 1985). It is now replacing the native vegetation of the Koolau Mountains and threatens to occupy the habitat of Chamaesyce deppeana and Eugenia koolauensis (HHP 1991e5, HPCC 1990a). Lantana camara (lantana) is an aggressive thicket-forming shrub, brought to Hawaii as an ornamental, that has now become naturalized in mesic forests, dry shrublands, and other disturbed habitats (Smith 1989, Wagner et al. 1990). Lantana poses an immediate threat to a population of Eugenia koolauensis in the Koolau Mountains (HHP 1991e7). Paspalum conjugatum (Hilo grass) is one of several perennial grasses purposely introduced for cattle fodder that have become noxious weeds on Oahu as well as other Hawaiian islands (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Scott et al. 1986, Tomich 1986). Hilo grass rapidly forms a dense ground cover in wet habitats from sea level to 6,600 ft (2,000 m) in elevation and competes with ferns and other native plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Haselwood and Motter 1983, O'Connor 1990, Smith 1985). Its small hairy seeds are easily transported on humans and animals or carried by the wind through native forests. Hilo grass threatens Chamaesyce deppeana and Hesperomannia arborescens (S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). Casuarina equisetifolia (common ironwood) is a large, fast-growing tree that reaches up to 65 ft (20 m) in height (Wagner et al. 1990). This large tree shades out other plants, takes up much of the available nutrients, and possibly releases a chemical agent that prevents other plants from growing beneath it (Neal 1965, Smith 1985). Like Hilo grass, common ironwood is becoming a significant component of the wet forest vegetation in Nuuanu Valley and poses a significant threat to Chamaesyce deppeana (HHP 1991a; HPCC 1990a; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by these taxa in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, this rulemaking will list these 11 plant taxa as endangered. Ten of the taxa in this final rule either number no more than about 100 individuals or are known from 5 or fewer populations. The 11 plant taxa are threatened by one or more of the following: Habitat degradation and/or predation by feral pigs and goats; competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by alien plants; habitat loss from fires; recreational activities; and predation by animals. Small population sizes and limited distributions make these plant taxa particularly vulnerable to extinction from reduced reproductive vigor or from stochastic events. Because these 11 plant taxa are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, they fit the definition of endangered as defined in the Act.
