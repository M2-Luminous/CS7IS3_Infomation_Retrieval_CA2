Savage was greeted by Jose Gonzalez Torres, vice minister of agriculture, and Marcos Portal, minister of basic industry, who briefed him on different aspects and propspects in their respective ministries. Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of Ministers, and Public Health Minister Julio Teja Perez also met with Savage and members of his retinue. The visitor expressed an interest in the ongoing transformation of Cuban agriculture, the large state farms, and basic production cooperatives wherein land is turned over to farmworkers and peasants who are then given work tools and credit. There are currently four forms of land property in Cuba: small private peasant holdings, peasant cooperatives, new basic production units, and state production units, which will be considerably reduced. The state controls 70 percent of all cultivable land in the country. It is estimated that by the end of the transformation, the state will retain barely 20 percent, according to figures submitted by Gonzalez Torres. As for the farming sector, in which the two countries maintain traditional ties, the visitors expressed great interest in obtaining Cuban fruits and fresh vegetables. They explored the possibility of investing capital through joint ventures, for which Savage estimated "there are real opportunities." The Canadian visitors and Minister Portal studied Canada's participation in Cuban mining. Several Canadian companies are already participating in nickel, gold, and copper mining in Cuba, as well as in other fields, such as rubber production. "I believe there are many opportunities that deserve to be exploited. Our objective precisely is to strengthen such ties for our mutual benefit," Savage stated. He visited the island with 17 representatives from Nova Scotia who want to negotiate with Cuba. The economic reforms promoted by the Cuban Government, specifically opening up ties to foreign capital, have elicited great interest among businessmen, who hope to explore such possibilities, Andre Hare, trade director of Nova Scotia, told PRENSA LATINA. "We really do not want to arrive too late and want to get here before others do," Hare said. Savage is accompanied by businessmen on the tight agenda of meetings that he is holding with his island counterparts. Hare noted that 35 meetings were held Monday, 55 others are scheduled for Tuesday, while a memorandum of agreements is being drafted. Savage, a career physician, also visited a family doctor's clinic, a health clinic in the neighborhood, and was greeted at the Ameijeiras Brothers Modern Hospital. The prime minister of Nova Scotia will be declared illustrious guest of honor of Havana and will be given the keys to the city at a ceremony on Wednesday. Before ending his official visit on Thursday, he will hold meetings with specialists in the Cuban biotechnological industry, and Nicolas Rodriguez, acting foreign minister, according to the agenda.
