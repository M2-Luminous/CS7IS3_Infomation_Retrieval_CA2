He recalled that Moscow had not agreed to sign such a treaty before Georgia resolved its differences with South Ossetia and Abkhazia by political means. Georgia, however, has not even started an equal political dialog with those republics, Khugayev thinks. He believes that Russian support for an indivisible Georgia "will give a free hand to chauvinist forces in Tbilisi." He did not rule out the possibility that, once the treaty was signed, Georgia would resume military pressure on South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Lyudvig Chibirov, head of the South Ossetian parliament who also attended the interview, made it clear that the people of the republic would hardly agree even to a confederation within Georgia.
