FR940217-1-00052 FR940217-1-00013 The Service proposes to list as endangered the Barton Springs salamander ( Eurycea sosorum ), under the authority of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et. seq. ). The Barton Springs salamander is entirely aquatic and neotenic, meaning it does not metamorphose into a terrestrial form and retains its bright red external gills throughout life. Adults attain an average length of 6.35 centimeters (2.5 inches). This species is slender, with slightly elongate limbs and reduced eyes. Dorsal coloration varies from pale purplish-brown or gray to yellowish-cream. Irregular spacing of dorsal pigments and pigment gaps results in a mottled, ``salt and pepper'' pattern (Sweet 1978, Chippindale et al. 1993). The Barton Springs salamander was first collected from Barton Springs Pool in 1946 by Bryce Brown and Alvin Flury (Chippindale et al. 1993, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) 1993). Although he did not publish a formal description, Dr. Samuel Sweet (University of California at Santa Barbara) was the first to recognize the Barton Springs salamander as distinct from other central Texas Eurycea salamanders based on its restricted distribution and unique morphological and skeletal characteristics (such as its reduced eyes, elongate limbs, dorsal coloration, and reduced number of presacral vertebrae) (Sweet 1978, 1984). Formal description of the Barton Springs salamander, based on Sweet's work and genetic studies conducted by the University of Texas and TPWD (TPWD 1989, 1990, 1992), was published in June, 1993 (Chippindale et al. 1993). An adult male, collected from Barton Springs Pool in November, 1992, was selected to be the holotype. The Barton Springs salamander is found near three of four hydrologically connected spring outlets collectively known as Barton Springs (Brune 1981). These three spring outlets are known as Parthenia, Eliza, and Sunken Garden springs and occur in Zilker Park, which is owned and operated by the City of Austin. No salamanders have been found at the fourth spring outlet, which is in Barton Creek immediately above Barton Springs Pool (Paul Chippindale and Dr. David Hillis, University of Texas at Austin; Dr. Andrew Price, TPWD; Sweet; pers. comms., 1993). The area around the main spring outlet (Parthenia Springs) was impounded in the late 1920's to create Barton Springs Pool. Flows from Eliza and Sunken Garden springs are also retained by concrete structures, forming small pools located on either side of Barton Springs Pool. The salamander has been observed under gravel and small rocks, submerged leaves, and algae; among aquatic vegetation; and buried in organic debris, at depths of about 0.1 to 5 meters (0.3 to 16 feet) of water (Chippindale et al. 1993, TPWD 1993). It generally does not occur on bare limestone surfaces or in silted areas (Dr. Charles Sexton, City of Austin, Environmental Conservation Services Department, unpublished data). Hundreds of individuals were estimated to occur in Eliza Pool during the 1970's (James Reddell, University of Texas at Austin, pers. comm. in Chippindale et al. 1993). The numbers apparently declined over the next decade. Fewer than a dozen and occasionally no individuals were observed during surveys conducted in Eliza Pool between 1987 and 1992 (Chippindale et al. 1993; TPWD 1993; Price, unpubl. data). The Barton Springs salamander was reportedly abundant among the aquatic vegetation in the deep end of Barton Springs Pool in 1946 (Chippindale et al. 1993, TPWD 1993). Between 1989 and 1991, Sexton ( in litt., 1992) reported finding salamanders on ``about one out of four [snorkeling] dives'' under rock rubble immediately adjacent to the main spring outflows. On July 28, 1992, at least 50 salamanders (Hillis, pers. comm., 1993) were found over an area of roughly 400 square meters (4,300 square feet) near the spring outflows in Barton Springs Pool (TPWD 1993). Following reports of a fish kill at Barton Springs Pool on September 28, 1992 (Austin American Statesman, October 2, 1992; Daily Texan, October 13, 1992), only 10 to 11 salamanders were observed and could only be found in an area of about 5 square meters (54 square feet) in the immediate vicinity of the Parthenia Spring outflows (Chippindale et al. 1993, TPWD 1993). Since that event, the salamander appears to be recolonizing Barton Springs Pool, which has been attributed to recent changes in pool cleaning operations (see further discussion under Factor A). At least 80 individuals were observed during a November 16, 1992, survey and about 150 individuals were seen on November 24, 1992 (Chippindale et al. 1993, TPWD 1993).
