Although we have no idea today what will happen at midnight this Sunday [20 February], could we discuss some aspects of what might ensue from this situation? For example, how was this situation reflected in our political scene? That's not an uninteresting subject. [Havel] It was not a simple decision. Many wise men, both politicians and military leaders, eventually arrived at this decision. It is quite natural that there are some in our country who present it as a problem and who highlight some related dangers or risks. I think that we should not forget the main thing, which is that this might be a real turning point in this situation. [passage omitted] I firmly believe that there will be no need to start bombing artillery positions around Sarajevo. I firmly believe that this threat will result in the genuine pullout of Serb units. I firmly believe that this might amount to the beginning of a process in which they stop mocking the whole world, when not only the Serbs but also the other sides realize that the world is genuinely interested in this matter, and when the process of searching for a solution to this situation can perhaps begin. I believe that Bosnia-Herzegovina should be preserved as a state under the international auspices of the United Nations. After all, Bosnia-Herzegovina has been internationally recognized. We should concentrate on looking for some form of regionalization and federalization of the state. We should slowly but, at the same time, with all our might, look for ways of renewing the coexistence between these ethnic groups and communities in a single society. [Hulkova] Mr. President, spokesmen of the Czechs living in Kazakhstan turned to you with the issue of resettling some 160 families to our Republic because of difficult conditions of life in Kazakhstan. Regardless of how this matter is resolved, I would like to ask whether there are differences in our approach to wealthy and not very wealthy foreigners who are somehow linked to our country. [Havel] I would not suspect the Czech Republic of this. The case of the Kazakhs is very complicated, and I have been following it with considerable attention. Indeed, these people find themselves in a dangerous situation. In my view, our Republic should accommodate their request. But they are wrong to think that it is the president who decides about these matters. The president is not the chief executive in our country. I responded to their appeals by writing a letter to the prime minister asking that the government take a position on this matter and decide whether resettling them could be considered. It appears that at issue is a resettlement of individual people. Nevertheless, the decision is up to the government. It is a matter that should not be treated with indifference. Although our state cannot be built along purely ethnic lines and although we cannot elevate the feelings of Czech national identity above everything else, I still think that, regardless of these people being rich or poor, we should have and we should demonstrate stronger feelings for those who originate from this country, who speak this language, and who feel some bond with this country. [Hulkova] But, according to the man on the street, we are not very generous to those who are of little use, as it were... [Havel, interrupting] We should discriminate against no one, I think. By saying this I think that we should not discriminate against the poor, who arrive here with nothing, with neither a roof over their head nor money. But I think we should not discriminate against the rich either. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] And now about the parliamentary session dealing with the bill on foreign trade in military material. Is it really true that it will substantially change the image of our country? [Havel] I think it is a very good law, a very strict law. By itself, a law is not sufficient to improve the image of our country. What is important is the practice and the application of the law. However, the law is an important precondition. It seems to me that this whole area will become more transparent now. It will become clear what the state did allow and what it did not allow, why it allowed it and why it did not allow it. Of course, there is no law that cannot be bypassed by inventive people. It will be important that the law is really functional and not bypassed. That will be fundamental in securing a good image of our state. [Hulkova] [passage omitted] Let us return now to the parliament. Mr. President, what adjective would you use to describe what happened there last Friday [18 February]? [Havel] I would rather not use any adjective. However, I will simply say that I am very, very disappointed, even almost outraged. The return of property to the Jewish communities is being dragged out for too long. It is undignified, and it is beginning to be offensive. I am very alarmed by it because an impression is being created that we do not want to see justice done, and it even harms our reputation abroad. It is generally known why this law failed to be passed. An amendment was adopted, and it must be said that it was in accordance with the government's standpoint, that local authorities would not be so-called legal persons, which would mean that local authorities would decide whether these properties should be returned to the Jewish communities or not. In case they do not return it, the Jewish communities should be financially compensated by the state. The reason behind this amendment was an argument that such a thing would be a de facto expropriation serving as a precedent for appeal by other legal persons in other restitution claims. I think this argument does not hold water and is weak. I understand the reasons that led to part of the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] and the opposition being reluctant to make the issue of local property ownership more problematic. I understand it from the legal and economic point of view and because of possible precedents. However, these are insufficient reasons for postponing this matter again, for not being resolved once again. I absolutely understand those deputies who then left the chamber to make it impossible for the law in this form to be passed. Next week, I plan to invite several deputies involved in this, talk to them more thoroughly, to understand their attitudes and arguments and find out if there is a chance to finally solve this matter and, if so, what kind of chance. [Hulkova] Do you think that the way we are dealing with this matter is being observed from abroad? [Havel] They are observing it with great attention, and I am not sure if these legal or concrete arguments that are being used will be understood as sufficient and legitimate arguments by the international community. I rather doubt it. It is likely to be understood as unwillingness of the state to release this property, although I am convinced that our state is willing to release this property to the Jewish communities. [Hulkova] Let's talk about the visit of Andrey Kozyrev to Hradecek. Can you tell us what was the main idea around which your talks revolved? [Havel] It was the future security setup in Europe. I explained our position. I even drew a chart for him that he regarded as a starting point for the debate. He himself used it to demonstrate what his own view was. I explained to him the reasons for our striving for future membership of NATO, my idea of relations between NATO and Russia, and the reasons the position of small Central European countries differed altogether from that of Russia. I also explained to him the specific features of Russia's position as a major nuclear power in Europe and Asia, a power that has to have a firm partnership with NATO. I explained to him that the (?eulogistical) nature of these relations will always be totally different from those between NATO and small Central European or European countries. I explained to him that even a possible enlargement of NATO was plausible only if solid relations with Russia existed. These relations could also be based on the Partnership for Peace program because this program provides for various types of relations. On the other hand, he explained Russia's way of thinking to me--the reasons that Russia fears the further enlargement of NATO, which would eventually encompass various European countries without incorporating Russia itself. Russian society perceives this as some kind of discrimination and alienation. What is important, I think, is that I had a chance to look deeper into the political ideas and the thinking behind Russian diplomacy. I also regard as important the fact that the minister told me that, following my explanation, his understanding of our position is far better. He understood why it was unsuitable to use the expression "sphere of interests" and why we showed such displeasure at Russia using this expression. It was a very friendly and informal discussion and i was also a result of being in a home environment, but it was, in my view, a very useful discussion. [passage omitted]
