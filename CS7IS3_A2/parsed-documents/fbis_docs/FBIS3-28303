FBIS3-28303 "dreas025__a94015" FBIS-EAS-94-025-A Document Type:Daily Report 7 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Official Discusses Security in East Asia OW0402214894 Tokyo GAIKO FORUM in Japanese Jan 94 pp 12-23--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0402214894 Tokyo GAIKO FORUM Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Article by Yukio Sato, Foreign Ministry North American Affairs Bureau director general: "Toward 1995 -- a Critical Year in Asian and Pacific Security"] [Text] The issue of security in the Asia Pacific region has been relatively easy to handle until recently. The central issue has been how to develop a dialogue on security for the entire region. Initially, Japan and the ASEAN countries agreed on the idea of utilizing the expanded ASEAN foreign ministers' conference, and other countries also agreed. But from now on, the substance of what is to be achieved through dialogue will become the issue. It is anticipated that reconciling the opinions of the concerned countries will not be easy, including the treatment of concrete issues such as North Korea's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) nuclear arms development. It is especially difficult because international politics in the Asia Pacific region is thought to be entering an era of full-fledged multinational consultation. Under such circumstances, what kind of role should Japan play to secure peace in the Asia Pacific region and to promote economic development of countries in the region? That is the question we must now consider. Over the last four years, I have been given the opportunity to think over security for the Asia Pacific region from a variety of angles. I want to remind readers in advance that what I am going to write in this article is my private opinion, based upon that experience. Japanese Response Has Changed -- From Opposing Soviet Proposals to Forming a Consensus in the Region It was the Soviet Union which first took up the subject of security in the Asia Pacific region. The Soviet Union had proposed since the 1960's a series of Asian collective security concepts. Typical examples included, among others, Secretary-General Brezhnev's Asian Collective Security Plan and President Gorbachev's All Asia Collective Security Conference Plan. Each concept sought to create an organization similar to the CSCE (Conference on Security Cooperation of Europe) in the Asia Pacific region. It is easy to conceive that the aim was to interrupt the network of the Western alliance led by the United States, also keeping in mind the Soviet-Chinese confrontation. On the other hand, various proposals have been made from the Western camp in recent years, namely The Northern Pacific Security Concept by Canadian Foreign Minister Clark, and the CSCA (Conference of Security Cooperation in Asia) by Evance, Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In the ASEAN countries, movements to hold international conferences on security issues have been emerging. Given such currents, Japanese responses have changed. The turning point was President Gorbachev's visit to Japan in April 1991. Up until then, the emphasis of the Japanese response had been placed on denying the validity of the Soviet's proposals; to that end the Japanese Government had been stressing how different the Asia Pacific region was from Europe. The foreign policy speech Foreign Minister Nakayama made at the Diet three months prior (January 1991) to Gorbachev's visit to Japan summed up the government position at that time. That speech highlighted a number of basic points which needed to be recognized regarding security in the Asia Pacific region. Though it is a bit long, I want to quote a relevant portion [of the speech] as the premise for the argument I am going to make. "I think that the time has now come to seriously examine the path to securing long term stability for the Asia Pacific region. It is natural that in this region the process for achieving that purpose is different from that in Europe. That is because the geo-political conditions and the environment for security in this region are significantly different from those of Europe. "First, due also to the fact that many of the countries in the Asia Pacific region are developing countries, the greatest concern of each country is economic development. This is very different from Europe which so far has considered military detente and the threat of nuclear war to be the matters of greatest concern. "Second, in Europe in the past, the East-West relationship existed in the polarized form of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In contrast, in the Asia Pacific region, there are many elements which can not be subsumed under the East-West relationship, including the existence of China. International politics takes the form of multipolar power relations. Alliance relations in this area are mostly bilateral, and the conflicting interests and concomitant recognition of accompanying threat varies between individual countries. Consequently, the overall security situation is complex. "Third, in contrast to the fact that in Europe the so-called CSCE process was initiated in an effort to resolve post-war boundary issues and so forth, in the Asia Pacific region, unsolved disputes and confrontations such as the North South confrontation on the Korean peninsula, Cambodia issue, and Northern Territories issue between Japan and the USSR are still present. "And fourth, in Europe, there is a major movement toward unification, politically and economically, with the movement of the EC union at its center. But in the Asia Pacific region, relationships of economic mutual dependency are pursued on the basis of national, regional, political, social, and cultural diversity and differing phases of economic development. To recognize such characteristics of the Asia-Pacific region and insure its peace and security, it is important to seek solutions for unsolved disputes and confrontations -- such as the confrontation on the Korean peninsula, the Cambodian issue, the Northern Territories issue, and so forth -- and through this process, to promote dialogue in order to bring about lasting stability in each subregion -- such as Northeast and Southeast Asia -- and to strengthen cooperative relationships. As for regional cooperation in a broader sphere, in light of the fact that economic development is important for the stability of the countries in this area, it is important to promote cooperation stressing the economic sphere. In concrete terms, utilizing already existing frameworks -- such as ASEAN, the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministers' conference, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC), and so on -- is the most suitable way for this region to expand dialogue and cooperation on various issues in the political and economic area. President Gorbachev did not mention the usual Soviet proposals when he visited Japan. As a consequence, the Soviet-Japan dispute on security in the Asia-Pacific region ended for a time. Also, by then Australia and Canada had stopped talking about the "approach" which took the CSCE as a model. But the issue did not end then. Among the countries involved, it has become important to create a consensus for an "approach" suitable to this region's actual circumstances. Recognizing this, Foreign Minister Nakayama made the following proposal, indicating Japanese thinking on Asian-Pacific regional security, at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers Conference (at Kuala Lumpur) held in July 1991, three months after the Gorbachev visit: "What is necessary for the Asia-Pacific region is to comprehensively and in a multi-tiered manner utilize the various existing international cooperation arrangements which currently exist as well as the places of discussion, and to secure the long term security of this region.... If something is to be added to the already existing cooperation arrangements and frameworks as regards the areas of economic cooperation, foreign policy, and security, it should be a forum for political dialogue where friendly countries of this region can conduct frank exchanges of opinion on matters of mutual common interest.... "The dialogue which the friendly countries would conduct in order to increase mutual feelings of security would also strengthen the political basis of mutually cooperative relationships. Such a political dialogue would be different in nature from confidence building measures intended to relax military tensions. "Because of this recognition, it is significant and timely to utilize the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a forum for political dialogue intended to increase feelings of mutual security. In order to make such political dialogue more effective, it may be useful to establish a site for a senior operational-level conference within the larger ASEAN, and to have the participants report the results of their discussion back to the larger ASEAN conference." At that time, it was reported that U.S. Secretary of State Baker ignored this proposal, the ASEAN countries resisted it because they did not receive prior consultation, and in Japan not much attention was paid to the proposal. But the concept which the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference adopted two years later -- in July 1993 -- at Singapore mirrored exactly the Nakayama proposal made at the Kuala Lumpur Conference. The contents of the concept were: 1) in order to discuss security for the entire region -- including China, Russia, Vietnam, and others -- a cabinet level ASEAN Regional Forum was to be established; and 2) prior to the cabinet members conference, a senior operational level conference (SOC) was to be held. As for ASEAN countries not receiving prior consultation, there was some basis for that interpretation. But this proposal did not come out of blue for the ASEAN countries. About one month before the Kuala Lumpur Conference, I proposed to ASEAN officials in charge of the issue the idea of utilizing the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a forum for political and security dialogue as well as for submitted papers. This conference was held following a decision of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Conference. As for my attendance, I had been invited by the Philippines Government, albeit in a private capacity, as the official in charge of the issue for the Japanese Government (as director general for the Information, Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau). On the other hand, there was also thinking within ASEAN that the political and security dialogue should be held at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference. Just before the Manila Conference, a conference was held in Jakarta. Those gathered were exclusively director-level personnel of security issues research institutions from the ASEAN countries. What I discovered by attending this conference was that the ASEAN scholars shared my thinking. One of the attendees, after hearing the Nakayama proposal, even said "the ASEAN scholars' contention was brought to governmental-level discussion through the speech of the Japanese foreign minister. Now the discussion will go forward." As is clear from this story, as for the idea of utilizing the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a forum for political and security dialogue, officials in Japan and the ASEAN countries came to the same conclusion, though they came from different positions. Moreover, anyone could come up with the idea of utilizing the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a forum for such dialogue. What is important in the details surrounding this issue is that the idea emerged from within ASEAN and the opinion submitted by Japan, both mutually supporting each other, and thus became a consensus among nations, including such countries as the United States. There is no doubt that Japan caused the United States to consent to this process, and thus was useful for helping the process go forward. It has also become clear that because Japan had a certain persuasive power, Asian countries would take into account what Japan had to say. Making Overtures to the United States Secretary of State Baker's vague attitude toward the Nakayama proposal was somewhat unexpected because the bureaucratic offices of the U.S. Government, not to mention Secretary Baker, were well aware of and supported Japanese thinking. We spent nearly one and a half years in completing the Nakayama proposal, repeatedly exchanging opinions and "papers" with officials in the State and Defense Departments as well as the White House. At that time, the concern of U.S. Government officials involved was focused on avoiding being pulled into naval disarmament negotiations in which the initiative would be taken by the Soviet Union. U.S. Government officials supported the following points, which were the core of the Japanese idea: 1) as regards security in the Asia- Pacific region, we should take a "comprehensive approach," utilizing already-existing security treaties and other cooperation framework; 2) as for multilateral cooperation which is lacking in this region, we need to begin with political and security dialogue for the entire region, and for that purpose it is most realistic to utilize the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference; and 3) the participation of China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam -- among others -- should be given consideration only after conditions for doing so are in order. I felt that, at a time when the U.S. Government and the American people were focused on East-West German reunification following the fall of the Berlin Wall, the spread of freedom in East Europe, reforms in the Soviet Union, and so forth, U.S. Government officials in charge of Asian policy preferred that Japan take the lead in developing a security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region. I once had a similar experience in the latter part of the 1970's. Soon after the Vietnam war, when the mood permeated the United States that they did not ever want to be involved with Southeast Asian problems again -- a mood especially prevalent in the U.S. Congress -- Carter administration officials in charge of Asian policy welcomed Japan's active foreign policy which supported ASEAN, beginning when Prime Minister Fukuda visited ASEAN in 1976. The concerned U.S. officials, recognizing the Japanese Government was doing what the U.S. Government could not even if it wanted to, accepted the U.S.-Japan partnership toward ASEAN as "fruitful" for the United States (1979 Ohira-Carter joint statement). Later, the Bush administration expressly agreed in the U.S.-Japan Global Partnership Plan issued in January 1992 to "promote political dialogue among the Asia-Pacific countries through an ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference." Still, the United States had little interest in this issue. Prime Minister Miyazawa's speech at the National Press Club in Washington in July 1992 was to impress the United States with the importance of security issues in the Asia- Pacific region. In this speech, Prime Minister Miyazawa first indicated his recognition that the existence of U.S. forces and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty were the indispensable premise for stability in this region. He then advocated the so-called "two track approach," which is to concurrently promote both international cooperation aimed at solving disputes and confrontations in the Korean peninsula and Cambodia, and dialogue and cooperation for the entire region utilizing the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference and APEC. Incidentally, the political declaration at the Munich Summit, which was held right after this speech and which accepted the Japanese proposal, included the phrase "in the Asia-Pacific region, regional frameworks which already exist -- such as the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference and APEC -- will play an important role in promoting peace and stability." This is the first such expression made at a summit meeting. Policy Coordination Will Become More Difficult Japanese thinking concerning security matters in the Asia-Pacific region has been reflected to a considerable degree in the Clinton administration's policy. The Clinton administration has supported the idea of discussing political and security matters at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference, and has indicated that the multi-tiered approach of using already existing various organizations has promoted security in this region. This is precisely the same recognition we have. Further, as I look back over the last year, the mutual understanding between the U.S. and Japanese Governments concerning the Asia-Pacific region was very good. On the issues of North Korean nuclear arms development, the PRC, Vietnam, peace in Cambodia, the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference, and APEC, the Clinton administration has pursued policies which appeared to have fully taken into account Japanese thinking. On the one hand, this is the result of the Japanese Government taking the initiative and communicating its thinking to the new administration in advance. On the other hand, concerned officials in the Clinton administration have adopted a posture of listening to other countries' thinking -- Japan's in particular -- prior to solidifying U.S. positions. But we must be prepared to accept the fact that the situation will be different in the future. The United States has a tendency, when it becomes interested in a certain issue, to set its own goals one after another and try to achieve them in a short time. A typical example is that President Clinton, as soon as he became aware of the importance of APEC, proposed to hold a summit-level conference. The U.S. advocacy of a "Pacific community" is the same sort of thing. The Clinton administration is expected to have a greater interest in the Asia-Pacific region in the future. This is because the dynamic economic development possibilities in the Asia-Pacific region will be useful for the recovery of the U.S. economy and the expansion of employment in the United States. It is also because this economic benefit will provide suitable persuasion in battling the isolationism which is gaining strength in the United States. That the United States is becoming more interested in the Asia- Pacific region is to be welcomed. But we must keep in mind there is a strong possibility that a gap could emerge between the policy objectives of the United States, the timetable to achieve those objectives, and what Japan and Asian countries feel are appropriate. There is also the possibility that a lack of U.S. understanding of the Asian situation may come to the surface. There are not a few Americans who are thoroughly familiar with the Asian situation. The influence of Asian-Americans is increasing. But American society as a whole does not yet know about, and moreover has little interest in, Asia. As for the aspect of adjusting policy between the United States and Japan, the past format in which the Japanese Government did what the U.S. Government could not do even if it wanted to, or that Japan took initiatives in areas where the U.S. had little interest, will not be possible. That is why it will be necessary more than ever for Japan to come up first with good ideas and take the initiative in bringing the United States along. Policy adjustments with countries in the Asia-Pacific region are not easy either. The interests throughout this region are not the same; especially on security matters, the situation is significantly different between Northeast and Southeast Asia. Also, Asian countries, while paying close attention, are repelled by the strong arm tactics of the United States. As regards Japan, they are suspicious about our increased influence within the region, while at the same time expecting support from us. Moreover, multinational discussions and cooperation will be the center of regional cooperation in the future. Therefore, it is important to make step by step efforts to come up with a consensus in the region, even though it is time consuming. Promote a Multifaceted Approach -- Five Objectives To Pursue As for the future approach, a "multi-faceted approach" designed to simultaneously pursue the following five objectives is important. First, maintain the existing security framework and minimize uneasiness over security matters during this time of change. Second, strengthen efforts to secure long term stability in areas where confrontations and disputes exist -- such as the Korean peninsula, the South China Sea, Cambodia, and so forth. Third, strengthen regional cooperation in trade and economics in order to promote economic development in each country in the region. Fourth, promote political and security dialogues throughout the region, and increase the feeling of security among individual countries within the region. Fifth, strengthen the cooperative relationship between the United States, Japan, and China. As a result of this "multifaceted approach," ideas may emerge for forming organizations or the machinery for security concerns within the region, or an international cooperation movement may arise which will satisfy specific objectives -- such as PKO, ocean patrols, or intelligence gathering for crisis management. But these are all future possibilities and depend on how the discussions will develop. Unlike in Europe, establishing objectives to be reached and setting forth arguments -- to form a collective defensive organization such as NATO or to form a collective security organization such as the CSCE -- are not suitable for this region. The role Japan must perform in connection with each of these five objectives is significant. The U.S.-Japan partnership is the basis for everything. (1) Stability of the U.S.-Japan Relationship It is not an exaggeration to say the stability of the relationship between the United States and Japan is the premise for peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. But the relationship of these two countries is now in a very grave situation because of the trade and economic relationship. Suspicion and a wary mood are evident when the two sides talk about each other. Overall, the relationship of mutual dependency between the United States and Japan has deepened to an historically unparalleled degree. Without doubt, the development of administrative reform in the political and economic field will increase U.S. trust in Japan. In fact, the active effort by the Hosokawa government on political reform and deregulation is received favorably in many sectors of the United States, starting with President Clinton. We can also expect, in the mid to long run, that suspicion directed against Japan by the U.S. public will decrease if the U.S. realizes an economic recovery and the American people regain their confidence. The problem is in the short term. Frankly speaking, the problem lies in the excessively large Japanese surplus and the protectionism and isolationism which are gaining strength in American public opinion. Moreover, these are mutually related. To overcome such problems, we must bring the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion and open up a bright prospect for the expansion of free trade. At the same time, we must shift the foundation of trade and economic relationships between the United States and Japan from confrontation to cooperation. In this respect, it is important that Japan voluntarily adopts various reform measures, namely a counter-plan to improve business conditions, which includes tax system measures and deregulation. These measures should, fundamentally, be taken by Japan based on its own judgment and for its own needs. But these are also in response to the expectations of members of international society such as the United States. This is so much the case that if Japan executes these steps voluntarily, it will have the effect of making the negative image that "Japan can decide only under pressure from foreign countries" a thing of the past. The "framework" discussion is also important. For its success, efforts by both the United States and Japan are necessary, and since it is a negotiation, what the outcome will be is a matter left to the future. But it is important that both the United States and Japan make progress in such a way that they can explain to their own people that the negotiations were successful. Three areas, governmental procurement, automobiles, and insurance, are especially important. It is not an exaggeration to say that success or failure of the third Hosokawa-Clinton meeting depends on the outcome of negotiation in these three areas. As for security matters, on the other hand, Japanese support for the United States under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is receiving high marks not only from the U.S. Government, but also from the U.S. Congress. This is significant also for the entire Asia Pacific region because it is an important and persuasive argument to help secure support from the Congress to continue America's forward deployed strategy amid increasing calls for military budget reduction in the U.S. Congress. It is also important for the relationship of Japan and Asian countries to cause Asian countries, which desire the continued presence of the U.S. Forces, to deepen their understanding on this point. (2) Promotion Of International Cooperation For The Sake Of Regional Stability In this area, North Korean nuclear arms development is the biggest issue now. Because the success or failure of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty depends on this, it also has world-wide significance. What is desired from the countries involved -- Japan, the United States, and South Korea among others -- is the use of all diplomatic means to cause the North Koreans to give up nuclear arms development through dialogue. On the other hand, to increase regional cooperation to secure long term stability in Northeast Asia is a subject we must think about now. In this respect, the fact that the U.S.-Japan-South Korean cooperative relationship has increased, with the North Korean nuclear arms development as the occasion, and that China and Russia share apprehension about the danger of nuclear arms proliferation on the Korean peninsula, may lead to something. Naturally, the five countries, Japan, the United States, South Korea, China, and Russia should not unite to exclude North Korea. Regional cooperation for the stability of Northeast Asia must work in a direction which promotes stability on the Korean peninsula and the reconciliation of North and South. In that sense, the door must be left open for North Korea [when we talk about] cooperation in this region. Moreover, the situation in the South China Sea is still unstable, and the peace in Cambodia is still fragile. Cooperating with the ASEAN countries, the United States, China, and Vietnam, consideration of a framework to secure long term stability in East Asia is also one of the future tasks for Japanese foreign policy. (3) Economic Development in Asia Pacific Region The promotion of economic growth for the Asia Pacific region is not only indispensable for the stability of this region, but also is significant for the world economy. Moreover, the economy of the Asia Pacific region, including China and Vietnam, is expanding. To build a relationship of cooperation in this region, which is based on the principles of free trade and is open to the outside, is the task given today. As for the place of discussion for this purpose, APEC exists. We can say that the unofficial conference at the heads of government level which was held in Seattle last November gave a good start for cooperation in the trade and economic area among the countries in this region. The part Japan can play in the economic area is significant because Japanese economic aid, investment, technology, and the Japanese market are indispensable for the further expansion and development of the Asia Pacific economy. (4) Heightened Feeling of Security As for the area wide political and security dialogue, the ASEAN regional forum, which is starting this year is expected to play a central part. I want to point out here the importance of the notion of "elevating the feeling of security," which Japan has been advocating so far. Often the term "confidence-building" is used. This concept was born in the process of the East West negotiations during the Cold War, and basically, its objective was to reduce the risk of war between opposing camps. That may be the reason to inform each other prior to military exercises and large scale movement of troops and to permit aerial reconnaissance to form the nucleus of so-called "confidence-building measures." Where this is necessary in Asia may only be on the Korean peninsula. The Asian countries do not view each other as antagonists. On the other hand, because of historical particulars and geographical proximity, differences in country size, and so forth, it is difficult to erase mutual suspicion and mistrust among the Asian countries. The point is clear when one looks at the relationships between Japan and South Korea, and Japan and China. The situation is similar between China and Southeast Asia, and Vietnam and its neighboring countries. Further, in the past several years, three uncertainties or apprehensions, namely "how far will the United States reduce its presence?", "How much will Japan strengthen its influence?", and "How much will China expand its military power?" have increased. Reducing such suspicion, mistrust, uncertainty, and apprehension is basic to the Asia Pacific region's security. For that purpose, dialogue among countries to discuss everything is, above all else, important. Also, it is important to further the cooperation through dialogue within the region to raise the transparency of military budgets and the defense policy of each country, to make clear the actual situation of arms imports and exports, to place further regulations on the transfer of conventional arms, and to prevent the proliferation of mass destruction weapons such as nuclear ones. But we should not just stop at such measures in the military field. It has a significant meaning for raising a mutual sense of security to think about, for example, worrisome matters which are common to all countries in areas such as environmental and refugee issues, and to cooperate for the solution of such problems. It is equally important to increase mutual understanding through measures such as cultural exchange, academic exchange, and student exchange. Also, the efforts Japan is making concerning the teaching of history for future generations will provide a sense of security for people who feel uneasy about a future Japan. What the countries in this region must do to increase the sense of security among themselves goes far beyond the so-called "confidence-building measures." Also, to increase the sense of security, it is important not only [to adopt] measures among the governments, but also to have dialogue and cooperation in the private sectors. Especially, when one thinks of the relationship between China and Taiwan, the North Korean participation issue, and the importance of obtaining fresh ideas not constrained by existing policy, we can not stress too much the importance of non- governmental level dialogue and cooperation The main role of the ASEAN regional forum seems to be to stimulate and promote such wide ranging efforts. (5) Stability of U.S.-Japan-China Relationship The direction the future U.S.-China-Japan relationship will take will have a great influence on the future of the Asia Pacific region. In that sense, the emergence of signs of the improvement in U.S.-Chinese relations is to be welcomed. The Clinton administration, out of consideration for the broader perspective on the U.S.-China relationship, is also beginning to take a posture to improve U.S.-China relations, while showing a strong political interest in securing Chinese cooperation concerning the protection of fundamental human rights and nuclear non-proliferation policy. The Clinton-Jiang Zemin meeting in Seattle was considered to be one of the great opportunities in attempting to make progress on the U.S.-China relationship. The objectives and substance of policy toward China are, naturally, different for Japan and for the United States. But just as they are constructive partners concerning the issues on the Asia Pacific region and global political and economic issues, to work on [to influence] China is a task common to both Japan and the United States. It will become more and more important for the United States and Japan to pursue this common task, while keeping in close touch with each other and keeping Clinton's [proposed] visit to China in mind. Also, it is true that Russia could play a constructive part in this region. But for now, it is necessary to make a case- by-case judgment on what sort of part Russia should play. Also, Russia must have a better understanding that, to play a political part in this region, it is important to solve the Northern Territories issue and totally normalize the Russo-Japanese relationship. Five Important Items for 1995 -- What Japan Must Do In international politics it is extremely important to have good timing. In that sense, next year will be a great chance for Japan to take bold initiatives for the peace and prosperity of the Asia Pacific region. A number of important events and opportunities relevant to Japanese relationships in this region will arise that year. We must start making preparation now. First, 1995 is the 50th year since the end of the Pacific War. Therefore, people of the countries which were involved in the war will be looking back to that period, filled with emotions. Also, for the Korean peninsula residents, which had been annexed by Japan prior to the war, 15 August 1945 is the memorial day at which time they gained independence from the Japanese control which spanned over 36 years. The year 1995 also happens to be the 30th year since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea. The fact that Japan will declare its resolve to pass on what history taught to future generations, will strengthen the moral foundation of future Japanese foreign policy. But it is not enough to reflect on and self-examine the past. It is extremely important to begin taking action which will become the point of departure for further securing the peace and prosperity of the Asia Pacific region. To provide a bright prospect for the security of the Asia Pacific region is its greatest given task. At the same time, the Japanese may give thought on this occasion to starting a large scale exchange plan funded by Japan, similar to the Fulbright Program and the Rhodes Scholarship, in an attempt to promote mutual understanding and exchange among the people who will be the support and driving force for the future of this region. Second, 1995 is the 50th year since the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Moreover, the issue of extending the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty will be examined internationally. Japan, as the only country which suffered bombing by a [nuclear] weapon, is in the position to take the leadership for promotion of nuclear disarmament. In that sense, I think, it may be an idea to plan some [event] in Japan, at which the strict nuclear non-proliferation and the promotion of nuclear arms reduction are to be pledged by the [participants] which include the nuclear possessing countries headed by the United States. Third, 1995 is the 50th anniversary since the founding of the United Nations. Therefore, it will be a year some answers on issues such as strengthening the United Nations and the reorganization of the Security Council will be sought internationally. I am hoping that at that time, the Asia Pacific counties will provide active support for Japan to become a permanent member of the Security Council. What Japan has to do now is to express its thoughts on ways to strengthen the United Nations in the post Cold War world and, to that end, to [spell out] what kind of responsibilities and what part Japan should carry out. Japan, as a non-nuclear possessing country and the only sufferer of the [nuclear] bomb, has the responsibility and the duty to consider the world's security from a perspective different from the permanent Security Council member countries. On the other hand, strengthening the UN international security function is connected to the security of Japan itself and to the security of the Asia Pacific region. This is an important point we must not forget when we consider strengthening UN functions. The review of our International Peace Cooperation Law three years after it was put into force will also be made in 1995. Needless to say, this review must be conducted, in conjunction with the strengthening of the United Nations, in terms of examining the role Japan has to play in it. Fourth, 1995 will also be an important year for the U.S.-Japan relationship, because both the review of the "framework" negotiations in the economic area and the review of the special agreement concerning the share of expenses for U.S. Forces in Japan will be made that year. The current special agreement (valid for five years) concerning expenses for U.S. Forces in Japan will expire in March 1996. If the same measures are to be continued after April 1996, it will be necessary to conclude a new agreement between the United States and Japan and to start making preparations in 1995 for the process to obtain the Diet's consent. The necessity to do that is already clear. Though the Cold War is over, Russia and China remain as nuclear possessing countries, and North Korea's nuclear development issue is also present. There is also a continuous rumor that China is attempting to strengthen its naval forces. The armed confrontation in the Korean peninsula is continuing and the territorial dispute in the South China Sea contains the danger of an armed struggle. Under such circumstances, for Japan to firmly adhere to the- no- nuclear-arms three principles and to the policy of not becoming a military power which might threaten other countries, while protecting its security, the American nuclear umbrella and the presence of U.S. Forces in the Asia Pacific are indispensable. What Japan can do in return for U.S. cooperation is provision [offer] of bases and financial support for the U.S. Forces. On the other hand, efforts are necessary to solve various problems which accompany the presence of the U.S. Forces. In Okinawa, where the U.S. bases are concentrated, the vocal desire for the consolidation of the bases is strong. Also, everywhere in Japan, from the residents around the bases, complaints are loudly heard about aircraft noise, especially night time landings by aircraft carrier based airplanes. They are also uneasy about the environmental problems related to the [presence of] the U.S. bases. Therefore, to continue the support of the United States under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, it is important to make visible progress on U.S. base consolidation and on reducing the impact U.S. Forces' activities have on the lives of the population [living around the bases]. It is the responsibility of both the United States and Japan to strengthen the relationship of cooperation both in the trade and economy and the political and security areas, and to make efforts to provide a sense of security to the future of the Asia Pacific region. Also, I want to point out that, conversely, cooperating for the common goal which further solidifies peace and prosperity of the Asia Pacific region will further open a new phase in the partnership between the United States and Japan. And fifth, in 1995 the APEC ministers meeting will be held in Japan. This is a year when countries in the Asia Pacific region will be looking back at the past with various emotions and thinking about the future. This will be a great opportunity for Japan to take the initiative toward the Asia Pacific region. To make use of the opportunity, in addition to strengthening cooperation in the trade and economic area which is the original purpose of APEC, it is important for Japan to take the initiative on issues ranging from nuclear disarmament to youth exchange, both within and outside APEC. It goes without saying that all such Japanese efforts will lead to increased feelings of security and trust toward Japan by the countries in the Asia Pacific region.
