The joint team will go to Sakhalin for three days from Monday in line with an agreement reached in November between South Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Kyongju, South Korea. During the talks, Kim asked Japan to help in arranging the temporary or permanent return of Koreans who were forcibly taken by the Japanese authorities to Sakhalin before and during World War II and were left behind when Japan evacuated the island as Soviet troops advanced. An estimated 150,000 Koreans were forcibly moved to Sakhalin, the southern half of which was ruled by Japan from 1905 until the end of the war. More than 40,000 still live on the island. The Japanese team will be made up of officials from the Foreign Ministry and the Japanese Red Cross Society, the ministry said. The members of the joint survey team will hold talks with officials of the Sakhalin government and concerned organizations to determine the number of South Koreans wishing to return to South Korea, it said.
