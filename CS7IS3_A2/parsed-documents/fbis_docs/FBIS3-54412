Khusro, editor of THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS: "Tackling Kashmir Issue"] [Text] All these years the Government of India took the position that the Kashmir issue had been settled legally and historically and that no dialogue was necessary on this score. But since 1984, particularly more recently, unimaginative and wooden nature of its Kashmir policy has led to a weakening of this position internationally. Pressures have mounted to such a degree that the matter could not be left in abeyance any longer. There has been an emergence of many new but important peripheral issues. By handling these badly it has strengthened Pakistan's position, so much so that Islamabad has been encouraged to ask the Human Rights Commission to send a fact-finding mission to Kashmir to investigate the violation of human rights by the Indian Army and the para-military forces in the valley. Even when these peripheral issues are resolved and the wood cut to be able to see the trees, the main Kashmir issue will remain and will need to be tackled effectively. But the periphery must be addressed first: (I) There has been a failure to start a political process in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, especially the valley, without the intervention of non-Kashmiri political parties in the valley, a failure to end President's rule and have an elected government. (2) There has also been a failure to win over the voting and the non-voting population in the valley which is getting sick of the terrorist activity and would be willing to go back to the pre-1984 position of staying with India, provided that (a) fair and free elections are conducted; (b) a coalition government is not imposed on the people of Kashmir and (c) adequate economic and employment opportunities are provided to Kashmiris both within and outside the State. (3) Owing to incursions by military and men from across the Line of Control into the valley, despite the presence of the army and the para-military forces at the border and elsewhere, there has been a failure to deal effectively with the terrorists and militants. There has at the same time been a failure to set up a Human Rights Commission early enough to demonstrate to the world that India does not condone atrocities by anybody. (4) There has also been an unwillingness to allow various critics such as the human right groups, Congressmen and Members of Parliament from other countries to visit the valley and to see for themselves what is happening. (5) When the population in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and specially in the valley became totally dissatisfied and the international community became a scathing critic on all the above counts, there has been a failure to start a dialogue with Pakistan and the various interested groups in Kashmir, giving the world a strong impression of adamance and total rigidity which aroused the international community further and enabled Pakistan to capitalise on this adamance of the Indian Government and unrest among the people. As international community is getting seized of the Kashmir issue and agitations and pressures are mounting, India has had to concede a dialogue -- which incidentally has been provided for in the Simla Agreement as well as in the earlier U.N. resolution. Our Kashmir policy has always been halting and Pakistan has been taking full advantage of this. However, with some dynamic thinking and action it should be possible for the country to get rid of the peripheral problems, win over international opinion and deal with the main issue from a position of strength. It would appear that some of the following measures would have to be taken in order to achieve a position of strength: (a) The composition of the newly-established Human Rights Commission could be strengthened further, in order to avoid some criticisms, and the Commission could be asked to deal firmly and fairly with every case of human rights violation and atrocities. (b) Human rights groups and other interested groups and individuals who wish to visit Kashmir should be allowed to go there freely and see things for themselves. The positive impact of having seen things for themselves and even adverse reports by these observers would be far more positive for India than the abominable suspicion generated by the clamour that India does not open the area for a fair observation as it has numerous things to hide from the world and is actually condoning the atrocities by its security forces and others. Such visits, if permitted freely, would bring out openly the killings, the rape cases and other atrocities committed by the terrorists and their allies too. If Pakistan has been sending men and arms in huge quantities across the border, visits to the valley by international observers and human rights groups can easily bring out this phenomenon and open the eyes of the world than any assertion by the Government that such incursions actually exist. There is no doubt that India has incontrovertible evidence of many such intrusions, and is said to have handed over evidence to Pakistan more than once. But anything that India can demonstrate regarding such intrusions can ever equal the effectiveness of the proof provided by international observers. Once a strong Human Rights Commission functions in a fair manner and identifies and punishes the offenders, and once free access to the disturbed areas is available to the international institutions and groups, India should publicise these facts in world forum and get rid of the sharp criticism that it has had to face. This will improve the credibility of India's arguments which in themselves are good enough but are being demolished owing to the emergence of the secondary and peripheral factors. (c) Pakistan has been asking for a dialogue on Kashmir but India has been refusing it. Now that under heavy pressure or whatever India has agreed to a dialogue, another irritant which bothered the international community has been removed. The dialogue should focus on the alternative ways of tackling the basic issue of Kashmir. India's position has all the possibilities of being substantiated and a solution around accepting the Line of Control will not be found to be the least acceptable among the various alternatives. (d) By far the most important element in the settlement of the Kashmir issue would be the generation of new signals to the Kashmir population to the effect that the political process will soon be revived, that elections will be held, that a democratic set-up will be in place, at any rate in the valley, that the Kashmiris will be able to govern themselves as freely as the Maharashtrians and Tamil people without an external party breathing down their neck, and that adequate employment opportunities would be made available to them within as well as outside Kashmir.
