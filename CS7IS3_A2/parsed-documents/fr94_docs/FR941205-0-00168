FR941205-0-00168 FR941205-0-00029 HUD Response. The commenter's point is unclear. Paragraph (a) on liens and paragraph (b) on contractual obligations permit inferior liens and obligations that are acceptable to the HFA as long as the HUD mortgage is first in line for payment. If the commenter is referring to mechanics' and similar liens, HUD permits such liens in its own projects where the title company is willing to insure over such liens. There is nothing to preclude HFAs from using this procedure if it is acceptable to them. Section 266.417␣Authority to adjust mortgage insurance amount. Comments. Three commenters (1, 7, and 12) raised questions about HUD retaining the authority to adjust the insured mortgage amount at any time up to final endorsement. The commenters are concerned that this will undermine the underwriting authority of HFAs. HUD Response. The authority to adjust the mortgage amount is discussed at length in the preambles to both this rule and the interim rule. It is required because neither the current statutory language in section 542(c) nor the legislative history contains a delegation to HFAs for insurance of advances and cost certification, among other things. In developing the interim rule, the Department examined the legal propriety of such delegations because of the desire to make these delegations to HFAs for maximum program efficiency and determined that such delegations would be sustainable if HUD retains the authority to make adjustments to the insured mortgage amount up to and including the time of final endorsement. As long as the Department retains such ultimate authority, case law supports the legality of such delegation. HUD's reservation of final authority to adjust the insured mortgage amount is not meant to suggest that HUD will, as a matter of policy, routinely review all decisions about insured advances and cost certification. On the contrary, the draft administrative instructions advise HUD Field Office staff to review a random sample against the HFA's procedures, not HUD's. Further, it states that few projects would likely be subject to any reduction in the mortgage amount. It is noted further that in HUD's own cost certification processes, few mortgage reductions are actually made. It has been emphasized in both written and oral communications to the Field staff that the Risk-Sharing program is a partnership and that the HUD Offices and HFAs should develop a strong working relationship where expectations on both sides are clear, including procedures for insured advances and cost certification. Section 266.510␣HFA responsibilities. Comment. Commenter 12 suggested that annual audits (paragraph (b)) be required to be sent to HUD only when conditions are discovered which, in the judgment of the HFA, are likely to result in a claim. HUD Response. With respect to the suggestion that annual project audits be submitted to HUD only when the HFA determines that there is a problem, please see discussion of §266.115 relative to HUD's monitoring responsibilities. Receipt of the annual project audit and physical inspection report is essential to this monitoring responsibility. Section 266.616␣Assignments. Comment. Commenter 12 objected to the prohibition against assignment of a mortgage and the requirement that legal title to the mortgage be held by the HFA. The commenter stated that substantial interest rate savings can be generated if insured loans can be sold directly in the market rather than being used as collateral for a bond issue. The commenter urged that these requirements be deleted, at least for Level I participants, where an HFA has a significant residual interest and risk, and where the HFA retains servicing. HUD Response. The regulations require that the HFA be the mortgagee of record throughout the period of insurance. For the pilot program, HUD has determined that this provision is desirable to ensure that the HFA fully maintain its risk-sharing obligation in these transactions. However, the interim and final rules do allow transfer of up to 100 percent of the beneficial interest in a loan or pool of loans. Section 266.656␣Recovery of costs after final claim settlement. Comment. Commenter 12 suggested deleting this section unless HUD also is willing to share additional losses incurred by an HFA after a final claim settlement. HUD Response. The Department has provided for a full 5 years after a claim is paid for an HFA to dispose of a project. HUD must be able to assess its total liability and 5 years was considered to be a reasonable time period. This should be ample time for disposition by the HFA, and the Department fully expects projects to be disposed of within this time. Sales of projects within this 5-year period will result in a final claim settlement based on the sales price and an actual loss amount. However, a final settlement established through appraisals that may be artificially low based on failure to sell during the 5-year period could result in a significant windfall at the Government's expense within a short time. The Department must preclude this from happening. In any event, we anticipate and expect that HFAs will endeavor to dispose of defaulted properties well within the 5 years and receive a final claim settlement based on an actual loss amount. V. Other Matters National Environmental Policy Act A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50 implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) at the time of development of the proposed rule and remains applicable to this final rule.
