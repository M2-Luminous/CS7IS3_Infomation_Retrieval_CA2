It was learned that our government made unofficial contacts with the U.S. Government on several occasions in connection with former senior Secretary Kim Chong-hwi's "request for political asylum," but the contacts continued only a tug-of-war over the interpretation of his present status, whether he is a public official or a private individual. On 22 January, however, our government requested the U.S. Government to give its official response to this matter and, at the same time, informed it of our position "opposing the granting of permanent residency" to him. The U.S. Government is expected to make a final decision on this matter sooner or later. In this connection, an official concerned at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on 22 January that "there have been `complicated and delicate differences of views' between the ROK and U.S. Governments over the matter on whether former senior Secretary Kim Chong-hwi's request for permanent residency is a simple request to extend his private stay in the United States or an official request to seek political asylum," adding that "now that we have delivered our official position to the United States, the U.S. Government is expected to inform our government of its opinion and its measures." There are three basic ways the U.S. Government can respond to our government. First, the United States can take considerably stern measures on former senior Secretary Kim, who is a figure of the Sixth Republic, in consideration of the friendly relations existing between Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Clinton. Second, the United States can protect him because he was a "witness" to the arms dealings between the ROK and the United States. Finally, the United States can regard this case as a matter of the Office of Immigration and refer it to this office, based on the experiences attained in the close-door negotiations held thus far with the ROK Government. Stern measures by the U.S. Government against former senior Secretary Kim Chong-hwi are precisely what our government has openly demanded. His departure from the U.S. Heritage Foundation no longer allows him to stay in the United States legally. Therefore, he can no longer stay in the United States and has to leave even though his passport and visa are valid for four more years. As a result of this, the United States will have to face complaints from numerous "non-Americans" residing in the United States. Relevant Foreign Ministry officials foresee no signs of the United States actively protecting former Senior Secretary Kim. Their reason is that if the United States take measures to protect former Senior Secretary Kim, it will stir up unpleasant memories in the ROK of the Kim Hyong-uk exile case and will directly spark not only diplomatic friction but also anti-U.S. sentiments, which have died down since the inauguration of the civilian government. In an attempt to prevent "discord" with the ROK Government while avoiding "discomfort" internally, the U.S. Government is expected to state openly that "it is difficult to intervene in the issue at the government level." While noting through unofficial channels, the inevitability of assuming an "equivocal attitude," it has been learned that the U.S. Government, in fact has been hesitating due to our government's repeated calls against granting permanent residency to former Senior Secretary Kim on the grounds that "domestic public sentiment makes it difficult to accept." Nevertheless, the United States continues to explain that "rather than being subject to government approval, permanent residency is granted almost automatically when requirements are met." At all events, the United States is now in a position of having to make a decision on former Senior Secretary Kim soon. It cannot continue to procrastinate on this "hot potato." It will be worth noting how our government, as well as the U.S. Government, handles this issue of former Senior Secretary Kim's "seeking refuge in the United States" because it is a very delicate one involving the domestic laws of the two countries, the international judicial cooperation treaty, and public sentiment in both countries.
