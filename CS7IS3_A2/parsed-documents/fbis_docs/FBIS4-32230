According to available information, the Albanian authorities tried to confiscate by force their houses and land, and move them to different locations," reads a statement by the Federal Foreign Ministry, which was forwarded to TANJUG today. ``What is particularly worrying is that the Albanian police used force and wounded several people, including women and children. All this has caused serious concern among members of the Serb and Montenegrin minorities and the Gorans [Slav ethnic minority], because this is yet further confirmation of the increasing pressure and the unwillingness on the part of the Albanian authorities to grant and respect the national minorities' inalienable right to their territory. ``The Federal Foreign Ministry notes with concern the fact that Albania is forcibly resettling members of the Serb and Montenegrin minorities under the pretext of a new administrative division of state territory, and is planning to settle Albanians from the areas of Dukadjin and Malesija to farms belonging to the Serbs, Montenegrins and Gorans. This is a calculated policy aimed at breaking up the territorial integrity of the ethnic Serbs, Montenegrins and Gorans in Albania, especially in the territory near the Yugoslav-Albanian border, and exerting increased physical and psychological pressure in order to speed up their systematic assimilation. ``By such action the Albanian authorities are violating basic human and civil rights, the right to physical integrity, the freedom to choose the place of abode and the inviolability of private property, which is in contravention of its obligations assumed as a member of the United Nations and the CSCE. ``The Federal Foreign Ministry calls on the Albanian authorities to stop exerting pressure on members of the Serb and Montenegrin national minorities and the Gorans, and to abandon its plan forcibly to resettle the residents of Vraka and Podgoricani. The Federal Foreign Ministry expects Albania to respect all rights of members of the Serb and Montenegrin minorities in line with relevant CSCE documents,'' the statement says in conclusion.
