According to a mainland official, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] and other relevant departments have made a long-term economic development strategy in a bid to attract more ROK enterprises to the Chinese mainland. They have also designated over 80 projects that show good potentialities as key projects for cooperation with the ROK. As for the distribution of ROK investors on the mainland, China wishes that they will focus on northeast and northern China. Currently, there are nearly 1,000 ROK enterprises investing in the mainland, with a total investment of close to $1 billion, most of which is concentrated in such regions as Shandong and northeast China. The official said: There are many medium-sized and large enterprises in the ROK. If they effectively concentrate their investments in the coastal areas of northeast and north China, they will be able to inject a large amount of foreign capital into the thriving Bohai Bay economic zone. First of all, it may counterbalance the overexpansion of Japanese investors in Northeast China and avoid the danger of a "Japanese economic invasion," bringing about the same kind of economic benefits as Hong Kong and Taiwan investments do in southern parts of China. Secondly, the overseas Chinese in the ROK mostly originate from Shandong or Northeast China. It is therefore more convenient for them to make direct investment or help bring in investment by native Koreans. Thirdly, the ROK's economic development is running into a bottleneck in the course of transformation, as many of its economic indexes rank last among the "four little dragons." Faced with strong rivalry from East Asian nations, the ROK is actively seeking a way out. In this context, Beijing hopes to attract more ROK enterprises to Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning, so that these provinces can obtain a large amount of ROK capital, energize their economic situations within a short time, and subsequently expand economic cooperation and ties in northeast Asia, truly turning Bohai Bay into an economic center of northeast Asia. The official also said: Mainland authorities have not laid down any restrictions regarding where ROK enterprises are allowed to invest, but officials concerned from MOFTEC and Liaoning, Hebei, and Shandong will take the initiative in supply information on major projects in a bid to obtain capital from ROK. Since Beijing and the ROK established diplomatic relations over a year ago, such provinces as Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu have organized large economic and trade delegations to visit the ROK. As many as six or seven provinces have held economic and trade meetings in Seoul. More and more ROK officials and entrepreneurs have been visiting provinces in the Bohai Bay zone. On another front, according to an official of Liaoning Province, the flow of capital from the ROK into northeast China used to be very slow due to misgivings about such matters as Sino-DPRK friendship. Now, because the central policy is "going all out to attract ROK capital," local officials may totally ignore the reaction from DPRK, giving rise to a rapid growth in ROK input. In some cities, ROK investments are even on a par with Japanese investments. It is learned that during Kim Yong-sam's visit in Beijing, the foreign economic and trade officials of Liaoning, Hebei, and Shandong will be meeting with ROK counterparts through the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade to strengthen their relations of cooperation and hold further consultations on strengthening bilateral trade, economic, and technological exchange.
