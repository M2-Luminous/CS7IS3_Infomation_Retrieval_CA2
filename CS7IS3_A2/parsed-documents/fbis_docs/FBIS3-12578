Talking to newsmen informally in Parliament House today, he regretted that the opposition leader is attaching greater importance to Khalistan issue rather than Kashmir. Pakistan wants a dialogue with India on all issues provided India creates prosperous [as heard] conditions. He said we would send another two nonpapers to India within next few days. To a question, the foreign minister said that if India learns to live like good neighbors and changes its hegemonic attitude, there would be peace in the region. To another question on the increase in Indian defense budget, the foreign minister said it was extremely unfortunate as it will escalate the arms race in the region and create more poverty. Responding a question on Pakistan's resolution on human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir in UN Human Rights Commission, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said it would be a test for the level of world morality and it will expose the double-standards of the world community. To yet another question, the foreign minister said Pakistan has not closed the border with Afghanistan, rather it has reestablished it as the international border.
