EFFECTIVE DATE: November 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, Suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 1, 8, 29, August 12 and 19, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 FR 33958, 35112, 38586, 41434 and 42820) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodities, military resale commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodities, military resale commodities and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities, military resale commodities and services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities, military resale commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities, military resale commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities, military resale commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities, military resale commodities and services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Commodities Yardstick 5210&hyph;00&hyph;243&hyph;3349 Clip System, Paper 7510&hyph;01&hyph;392&hyph;6965 7510&hyph;01&hyph;392&hyph;6513 7510&hyph;01&hyph;392&hyph;6964 7510&hyph;01&hyph;392&hyph;6512 Scouring Brick 7920&hyph;00&hyph;291&hyph;1237 Military Resale Commodities Sweatsuit, Recruit, Marine Corps M.R. 650 M.R. 651 M.R. 652 M.R. 653 M.R. 654 M.R. 655 M.R. 656 M.R. 657 M.R. 658 M.R. 659 Services Grounds Maintenance, U.S. Army Reserve Training Center, Wailuku, Maui, Hawaii Janitorial/Custodial, U.S. Army Reserve Training Center, Wailuku, Maui, Hawaii Janitorial/Custodial, Byrne Courthouse, 601 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Janitorial/Custodial, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Seattle, Washington This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
