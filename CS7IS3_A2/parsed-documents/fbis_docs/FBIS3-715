At a news conference in Lagos the French ambassador to Nigeria, Pierre Garrigue-Guyonnaud, said his country fully supports the diplomatic efforts employed and would very much wish that the two countries resolve their dispute peacefully. Foreign news correspondent, Godfrey Odu, reports that the envoy denied allegations that France is aggravating the Bakassi dispute: [Begin recording] [Odu] [Words indistinct] since the Nigeria-Cameroon dispute over Bakassi came to a head last month. Ambassador Garrigue-Guyonnaud explained that the response by France to Cameroon's request for assistance was part of the normal respect of commitment entered into between the two sovereign nations, and not intended prejudice to the spirit of peaceful settlement. He said that France has taken some diplomatic initiatives on its own but refused to specify. [Garrigue-Guyonnaud] It is difficult to say I agree with you, but it is important and difficult to say because it should be confidential. But the only thing I can tell you is that we encourage [words indistinct], and we think that there is room for negotiations. [Odu] Ambassador Garrigue-Guyonnaud said that in response to the Cameroonian request, France sent some military assistance, but that none of these have been deployed to the disputed Bakassi. [sentence as heard] The ambassador said that the level of French military aid to Cameroon has not increased since the Bakassi crisis, adding that Nigeria as well as Cameroon are both friends of France. NTA news took the ambassador up on charges of aiding and abetting the Cameroonian efforts to internationalize the dispute. [Odu] You have provided legal assistance (?to Cameroon) [passage indistinct]. But defense information has it that a sizable number of French troops have landed in the Cameroon along with unspecified quantities of arms and ammunition. From calculations, French interests in Nigeria alone are said to far outstrip her business interests in all of her former African colonies put together. French companies are doing lucrative business in many spheres of the Nigerian economy. Some of the largest include ELF Nigeria Limited and Total in the petroleum sector; [name indistinct] and SCOA [West African Trading Company] in freighting, haulage, and trading; CFAO [West African French Company] in the industrial and general goods sector, as well as Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited, a leading car assembly plant. There are those in the construction industry such Bouygue and (Schlumbeger) in oil field services. These account for billions of dollars accruing annually [words indistinct] in foreign exchange earnings. [end recording]
