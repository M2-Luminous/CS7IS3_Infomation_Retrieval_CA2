Officials once more will target key commodities which have greater impact on the price level, and are closely related to people's daily lives . Prices of daily necessities such as grain and cotton will receive top priority, State Planning Minister Chen Jinhua told the three-day national working conference on price inspection in Beijing. The inspection will also cover such key items as chemical fertilizer, power supplies for rural users, steel, petroleum products and service charges. Chen said that while the country takes measures to scale down investing in fixed assets and issuing currency, it should simultaneously implement policies designed to encourage grain and cotton harvests. Meanwhile, reform of modern enterprises should be pursued to increase commodity supplies. "These steps will help to create a favourable condition for curbing inflation," the minister said. He also urged officials to speed up price legislation and draft price laws and other regulations to ban illegal monopolies, profiteering and cheating on commodity prices. Chen urged that the last two months progress in nationwide price monitoring be consolidated. Price inspectors have, during the two months from March 10 to May 10, uncovered more than 190,000 cases of price violations, involving some 400 million yuan ($46 million) in illegal price charges. The meeting was told that 100,000 of these cases have been handled by fining violators 88 million yuan ($10 million). "The inspection drive helped the local government leaders as well as producers and retailers to realize that prices can not be raised arbitrarily." Chen told the meeting. Monitoring also helped implement State price control rules, including a grain risk fund at both central and provincial levels, and requiring all shops to put price tags on all commodities . According to a recent People's Daily report, Shanghai has, since last year, set aside 400 million yuan ($46 million) as cash reserves for storing such daily necessities as grain and edible oil. The action has effectively curbed the market prices of these basics in the city. However, Chen warned that some local officials have not paid enough attention to price inspection and made little progress in curbing inflation in their area. "In some places, greater effort is needed to deal with illegal price increases," the minister said. The minister anticipated improvements, however, following an announcement that those who hinder price inspectors face severe punishment.
