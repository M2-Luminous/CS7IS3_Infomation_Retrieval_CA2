FBIS4-44890 "jpjst028__l94003" JPRS-JST-94-028L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 4 April 1994 Aerospace Production Cost of H-2 Rocket To Be Reduced by Half Production Cost of H-2 Rocket To Be Reduced by Half 94P60200A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Apr 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94P60200A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The National Space Development Agency (NASDA) and aerospace manufacturers including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. will begin drastic design changes, aiming at commercializing the large domestically produced H-2 rockets. The changes, including modification of the main LE-7 engine, will be extensive. They are intended to reduce production costs of 16 billion yen incurred during the first successful launch by 30 percent within three years, and eventually by as much as 50 percent. French Ariane Space has 60 percent of the global rocket market, including the launch of communication satellites. These design changes will facilitate Japan's entry into world wide commercial competition, and also will promote other Japanese space developments, including the Japanese ``HOPE'' space shuttle which will be launched by H-2 rocket. Aerospace manufacturers and Rocket Systems, a rocket procurement company, have presented a list of several hundred modification plans, including: 1) reduction in the number of parts that make up the main LE-7 engine; 2) change in a portion of the fairing materials; 3) revision of major components for the ``LE-5A'' second stage engine. Cost reductions should be achieved through improvements in the production process and maximum utilization of mass production. MHI has proposed a new development plan for an advanced LE-7, the core of the H-2, which will reduce production costs by several hundred million yen through some changes in the position of parts without changing the main structure. IHI will reduce the number of components in the turbopump which is the major component of the LE-7 and LE-5A. KHI has proposed material changes including substitution of iron for titanium in parts of the tip of the rocket that doesn't require such high quality. Nissan Motor, which is in charge of production of the booster rocket, will work on improving the production process. NASDA will make a final decision selection of the proposals by mid-April. Launching costs, including production and fuel, total approximately 19 billion yen per rocket at present. That will remain constant for the next two rockets scheduled for launch in the near future. This 짜19 billion is a far cry from the Ariane rocket's launch cost of approximately 짜10 billion, and therefore NASDA has requested modifications in design from the Japanese manufacturers. The latest modification program which reduces production costs by 30 percent will affect the 6th and 7th launches which are scheduled for around 1997-1999. The 50-percent cost reduction of 짜8 billion is expected to be achieved during the 12th rocket launch scheduled for some time after the year 2000. This will drop per-launch costs to around 짜11 billion, including fuels and inspection. Cooperation between government and industry to promote mass production also is expected to reduce the cost of the HOPE project.
