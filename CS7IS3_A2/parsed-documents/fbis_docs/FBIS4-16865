The Foreign Ministry condemns the actions of the Serbian armed forces in Bosnia, which are aimed against the United Nations peacekeeping forces and against the "safe areas" declared by the UN Security Council. By ignoring decisions of the UN Security Council and earlier cease-fire agreements, the Serbs in Bosnia set themselves against the international community. The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Estonia greatly respects the UN decision to create "safe areas" and expresses its dissatisfaction over the fact that agreements achieved during the peace process are not being lived up to. This is one more indication that the world organization must take even more decisive steps to prevent the spread of the conflict and to achieve a general cease-fire in Bosnia.
