Bundestag President Suessmuth today called on the party to nominate a different deputy. Modrow's participation in the mission is not in the interest of the parliament because he is being accused of electoral fraud during the GDR era. In a meeting earlier of the Council of Elders, all other parties came out against Modrow. The PDS is considering taking legal action against the decision by the Bundestag president.
