"Iraq maintains that the sanctions should have been stopped long ago as Baghdad has complied with all UN Security Council resolutions including those on non-proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons," the minister told the press after a meeting with visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister Sa'id al-Sahhaf. Alatas said a letter from the Iraqi President containing the request would be handed to President Suharto by Sahhaf on Tuesday. He said Indonesia had been closely following developments involving Iraq and made informal approaches to other NAM member countries to collect their views on Iraq's stance that it had implemented all of the Security Council's resolutions. "We have the impression that Iraq has carried out all resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council. Yet the UN economic sanctions have continued to be in force," Alatas said. "Indonesia as chairman of NAM will certainly attend to matter and, after an in-depth study, make efforts to help resolve it," Alatas said, adding that all decisions on the steps NAM would take to help Iraq would be made by President Suharto.
