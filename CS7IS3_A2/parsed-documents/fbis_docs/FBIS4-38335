Yeltsin explained that the list would include factories which could not be run profitably on their own and that it would be updated monthly. He said that the decrees on tighter finances and production that he had signed earlier would be supplemented with four new decrees of the same kind. He emphasized that the Russian economy, notably its manufacturing industries, needed faster restructuring. Because this was proceeding slowly, the payment crisis was getting worse, he said. He promised that the state would help KamAz which was recovering from a fire. Foreign investments would be attracted to it and credits would be made available. Yeltsin said that KamAz was exempt from profit and value-added taxes until the end of the year.
