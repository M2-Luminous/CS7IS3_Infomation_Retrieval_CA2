These measures range from heavy sanctions against airlines that repeatedly transport them to the punishment of officials involved in the trafficking of illegal aliens. These measures result from reports an international mafia operating from Honduras is involved in the trafficking of illegal aliens to the United States. "The government's intention is to clean up public administration and whatever is associated with the Foreign Ministry in line with its fight against corruption in all fields," the minister has said. According to the minister, there are names of people, including former officials, who are involved in this business. "Irregularities have been detected in the Honduran consulates in Hong Kong and Panama," the minister said. "Both consulates are under investigation, and the responsible officials will, naturally, be punished," Paz has said. He has said the name of a former Foreign Ministry senior officer from the previous administration was being used for illegal procedures. "The former officer is aware of this, and we are investigating the matter." Paz has charged certain attorneys, whom he did not identify, handle the documentation of illegal aliens who arrive in the country. On the other hand, the minister considers it unfair the United States should take steps against the new Honduran Government for cases that were not resolved during previous administrations. Paz believes most of the claims show delays in the application of justice, "something which is linked to the general problem afflicting the Judicial Branch, which many believe should be brought up to professional standards to allow Honduras to offer legal security to foreign investors." Meanwhile, the minister expressed pride over Honduras' diplomatic victory as a virtual nonpermanent UN member. "This would be a resounding success for Honduran diplomacy," he expressed with satisfaction.
