They said that they were unaware of such an enterprise as it had never come up before. On 9 June several employees of the joint venture were caught redhanded trying to smuggle eight kg of heroin, worth a million dollars, into Russia. One of the sources suggested to ITAR-TASS that the venture might be one of those which is sometimes created by DPRK representatives in the Russian Federation without going through Russian legal processes. Knowledge of such joint ventures is, as a rule, confined to an extremely small circle of trusted people.
