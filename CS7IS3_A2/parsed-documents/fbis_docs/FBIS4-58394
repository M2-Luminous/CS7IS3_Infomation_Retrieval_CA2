Lebanese Forces leader Dr. Samir Ja'ja' was interrogated by the judicial investigating judge for the third time yesterday in the case on the assassination of Eng. Sham'un and his family. However, the investigating judge could not proceed with the interrogation due to the health and psychological condition of Dr. Ja'ja'. Judicial sources said that defense lawyer As'ad Abu-Ra'd protested against interrogating Dr. Ja'ja' in view of his poor health. The investigating judge agreed to postpone the interrogation until the health of Dr. Ja'ja' improves. Meanwhile, forensic doctor Subhi Germanus examined Dr. Ja'ja' yesterday. The report confirms that the health of Dr. Ja'ja' is good. A copy of the report will be conveyed to the defense lawyer today.
