FR940928-2-00105 FR940928-2-00067 D. For BFN Unit 2, Reactor High Water Level, Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) and High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) Turbine Steam Line High Flow, and Drywell Pressure instrumentation calibration frequencies and functional test descriptions are being revised to reflect current calculations and test methods. These changes do not reflect a change in equipment, operation of the associated system, or the safety function of that system. E. For BFN Units 1, 2, and 3, the differential pressure instrumentation, which actuates the pressure suppression chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers, calibration frequency is being revised. In addition, tables that specify the minimum number of instrument channels per trip system, function, trip level setting, actions required, remarks, functional test, and instrument check are being added. F. Corrects the capitalization of terms used on the affected BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 TS pages in order to conform with the current TS Definitions section. This part also corrects spelling and capitalization of other words on the same pages. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Part A: The Unit 3 modification, which involves the installation of an Analog Transmitter/Trip System (ATTS), replaces older devices with devices of more modern design that perform the same function. The initiation of control rod insertion to mitigate a design basis accident is contained in Chapter 14 of the BFN Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). There is no change in design bases, protective function (initiation of control rod insertion), redundancy, setpoints, or logic associated with the installation of the ATTS. The consequences of a failure of this equipment are no different than that of the original equipment. Since there is no change in any protective functions, nor the creation of any new operational conditions, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. Part B: The revision to the Units 1 and 3 reactor vessel water level safety limit and the Level 1 low reactor vessel water level setpoint do not reflect any change in plant equipment. The safety limit is being changed to reflect the actual analytical safety limit calculated by General Electric. The Level 1 low reactor vessel water level trip initiates the Core Spray and Low Pressure Coolant Injection Systems and isolates the Main Steam lines. These actions are taken to mitigate the consequences of a Loss of Coolant Accident. The change in the setpoint affects the timing of the operation of equipment necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident. A setpoint calculation has been generated which ensures these safety functions are initiated in accordance with the design basis accident analysis presented in Chapter 14 of the Browns Ferry FSAR. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. Part C: The addition or correction of Unit 2 instrument identifiers is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. These administrative changes do not reflect any change to any precursor for the design basis events or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry FSAR. There is also no change to any protective function or mitigating action for the design basis events or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry FSAR. Therefore, the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. Part D: The change in Unit 2 reactor high water level and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) instrumentation functional test descriptions reflects the equipment currently installed and the functional tests currently being performed. The changes in calibration frequencies are being made to reflect current setpoint calculations. There are no modifications to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. The calibration frequencies specified by the current setpoint calculations ensure that the associated safety functions are initiated in accordance with the design basis accident analysis presented in Chapter 14 of the Browns Ferry Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). Therefore, the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. Part E: The changes in Units 1, 2, and 3 calibration frequency for the differential pressure instrumentation, which actuates the pressure suppression chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers, is being made to reflect current setpoint calculations. The specified minimum number of instrument channels per trip system, function, trip level setting, actions required, remarks, functional test, and instrument check reflect current operational requirements. There are no modifications to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. The calibration frequencies specified by the current setpoint calculations ensure that the associated safety functions are initiated in accordance with the design basis accident analysis presented in Chapter 14 of the Browns Ferry Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). Therefore, the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. Part F: The proposed correction of the capitalization of terms in order to conform with the current TS Definitions section is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. The correction of spelling and capitalization of other words on the same pages is also administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. These administrative changes do not reflect any change to any precursor for the design basis events or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry FSAR. There is also no change to any protective function or mitigating action for the design basis events or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry FSAR. Therefore, the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased.
