They come from countries such as Zaire, Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Tanzania, Zambia, Somalia, and Zimbabwe. No Malawians have been asking for refugee status. Those people come from countries beset by internal conflicts where per capita income is very low. Some of those conflicts have been followed by the United Nations, which is supervising the Mozambican peace process now. Whoever is familiar with international politics will not have any illusions concerning the role of the United Nations. They will know that, contrary to what many people think, it is not the United Nations that rules the roost but, rather, the parties that are behind those conflicts. Even now, they are the ones that dictate to the international community the slow pace of pacification. The government stopped demobilizing its troops two weeks ago and demobilization was postponed in all assembly areas. The reason given was that the Mozambique National Resistance's demobilization process was going very slowly. Be that as it may, the Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, soldiers in Nhangao assembly area did not like that and started threatening the UN observers, even though the latter had nothing to do with national decisions made by the Supervision and Control Commission, CSC. A solution to this problem was sought with Lieutenant Colonel Tembo, Cease-Fire Commission representative in the Central Region. A total of 500 soldiers -- double the usual number of soldiers to be demobilized at any given time -- started applying pressure and received the promise that they would be demobilized on 3 May. Yesterday, 2 May, was a holiday. All officials involved in the process, including the observers, financial personnel, Technical Unit [not further identified] and International Migration Organization, OIM, officials were preparing for today but at midday were told that the demobilization had not been authorized. As I write this, we are looking for Lt. Col. Tembi, so he can inform his troops about that decision, which will almost certainly be poorly received. Whoever came from Chimoio on 1 May must have witnessed the departure of trucks carrying UN Italian forces for the last time. Many will blame the United Nations, if war resumes in Mozambique. However, peace cannot be imposed, neither by the United Nations nor by other nations. It is necessary that those who made war genuinely want peace. Everyone should understand that.
