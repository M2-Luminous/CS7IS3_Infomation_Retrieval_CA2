Liu Xilin [0491 1585 2651], Standing Committee member of the provincial CPC committee and deputy governor, and Wang Guofa [3769 0948 4099], deputy governor, attended and spoke at the conference. Other responsible persons of various city (prefecture) governments and relevant departments at the provincial level also attended the conference. After conscientiously analyzing the new situation facing the grain procurement work of 1994, participants at the conference set forth a general demand for doing a good job in the grain procurement work of 1994. That is to adhere to the open and flexible principle, strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, pay equal consideration to the interests of the state, enterprises, and farmers, and pushing the provincial economy to develop still further. The general policy is to subsidize the quota procurement price, set a protective price for market transactions, further display the state's support for agriculture, and make farmers the real beneficiaries. Participants also demanded strict compliance of contracts and policies and urged greater efforts to strive to fulfill the grain procurement tasks by the end of December. To do a good job in the grain procurement task in 1994, the conference clarified the following policy-related issues: On the issue of quota grain procurement. First we should strictly enforce the grain quota assigned after the provincial government implemented the policy of "steady procurement and relaxed sale" and insist that farmers deliver the exact amount and type of grain specified in their contract to ensure the fulfillment of state-assigned procurement task. Second, we should continue to implement the policy of disaster reduction and exemption. Those who really need the exemption and reduction may be reported by the city or county government to the provincial government for approval in the later period of grain procurement. Third, we should implement the policy of subsidizing quota procurement prices. The State Council originally decided to distribute the benefits of linking chemical fertilizer and diesel in the form of price subsidies. Later, it changed to distributing such benefits mostly in the form of goods and some as price subsidies. Jilin Province has distributed some of the benefits to farmers in the form of goods and some as price subsidies. For instance, for 500 gram of standard corn, the state pays 0.198 yuan and Jilin Province pays 0.03 yuan in subsidy, so the enforcing price for the quota procurement of standard corn is 0.228 yuan. For another instance, state price for 500 gram of standard rice is 0.351 yuan and the provincial subsidy is 0.023 yuan, so the enforcing price for the quota procurement of standard rice is 0.374 yuan. Fourth, we should adhere to the quota grain quality and variety policies. In other words, all localities should strictly enforce the quality standard for contracts on delivery of third-grade and above corn and rice. In quota procurement, the two major categories of rice and corn cannot be replaced for one another. In the delivery of quota grain, water content is not limited. On the issue of special reserve grain procurement. The policy and quantity of special reserve grain have not been determined by the state. Arrangement will be made after the state makes a decision. On the issue of free market grain procurement. The general principle for dealing with free market grain in Jilin Province is to place no restriction on the variety of grain, encourage multi-channel operation, and allow prices to float with the market. In the meantime, we should strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and control by the government and establish a protective price system to prevent great fluctuation of market price and protect farmers from low prices of grain. Concrete requriements are: 1) The province sets a minimum protective price, 0.21 yuan for 500 gram of standard corn and 0.31 yuan for rice. 2) A guidance plan for procuring a total of 5.8 billion kg of market corn should be transmitted to lower levels to satisfy market and export needs. 3) All localities should vigorously guide farmers in selling market grain to protect farmers' interest from being adversely affected by funds and market nearing the end of this year and the beginning of another year. On the issue of grain procurement funds and account settlement. The general demand is that funds must be provided during contract procurement, special reserve, and market grain and oil transactions. Giving farmers "I owe you" is absolutely forbidden. All departments concerned must ensure timely and sufficient supply of funds according to the fund raising task assigned to them. When settling accounts, we must insist settling with each and every household after delivery and resolutely stop the practice of "general estimation." Grain departments are not allowed to deduct any charges except for the amount of purchase contract deposit and agricultural taxes. On the issue of grain market management. The general principle is to adhere to opening up and revitalizing, to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, to ensure that the market is open but orderly and well managed but not stifled, to unclog circulation, and to accelerate production. Before the corn procurement task of a city or county is fulfilled, individuals and units other than grain departments are forbidden temporarily from purchasing corn. Market for other varieties of grain is open during the period of grain procurement.
