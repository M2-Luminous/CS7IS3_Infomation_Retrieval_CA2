The Turks pursued and fired shots to immobilize the boat just two and a half miles from the island's shore. They later tried to tow it to Turkey, but were unsuccessful because the Greek freighter "Avandi," which sailed from Karlovasi Harbor, arrived carrying port authority officials and soldiers. The Turks were frightened, and abandoned their efforts. Brothers Panayiotis and Mikhail Dhritsakis, each married with three children, were aboard the fishing boat and in shock from the attack. The Samos Port police boats pursued the Turks to international waters.
