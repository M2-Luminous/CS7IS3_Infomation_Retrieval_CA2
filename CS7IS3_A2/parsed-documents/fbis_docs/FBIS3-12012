Here is a report by Jesus Casasola: [Begin Casasola recording] Mario Aburto Martinez has been formally arraigned without bail on charges of being responsible for the homicide of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Judge Alejandro Ortiz, First District criminal judge of Mexico State, made the official announcement at Almoloya de Juarez Prison, where newsmen were not allowed access. The judge said Aburto Martinez is accused of carrying a weapon without a license, which means he could be sentenced to more than 55 years, considering the maximum sentence for homicide is 50 years. Aburto Martinez's lawyer has three working days to appeal the judge's decision to allow the normal course of the trial to continue. [sentence as heard] The Attorney General's Office indicated that other charges could be brought against him as the investigations progress. The Attorney General's Office has also released reports on Aburto Martinez's medical and drug tests. A report on the reconstruction of the crime and an inspection of the crime scene was compiled on the same day and includes 163 photos. In addition, the ballistic and forensic report noted that the wounds were caused by a .38-caliber revolver. According to preliminary statements by Aburto Martinez, he was not studying to be a priest, but he was to become a priest. He said he did not belong to any political party or group and that some people nicknamed him "Gentleman Eagle" [Caballero Aguila] because of a ring he wore on his left hand. Another important aspect is the testimony of Marcelina Ortiz Martinez, who said that a few days before the killing the suspect told her he was about to make a good deal of money in the next few days. She added that he showed her a revolver, which was the same .38-caliber revolver he used to kill Colosio. It was also reported that Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, arrested in Tijuana, Baja California, on Sunday, was not a member of Colosio's security guards headed by General Domiro Garcia Reyes.
