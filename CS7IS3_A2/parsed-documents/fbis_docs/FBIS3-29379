"The leaders of the two nations have agreed on the need for a cooling-off period for the Japan-U.S. economic talks," the top government spokesman told a news conference. "We expect the U.S. Government to act sensibly." Takemura's comments came a day after U.S. President Bill Clinton said he expects to have policy recommendations drawn up in the next few days to slash Japan's vast trade surplus with the U.S. The policy options under consideration reportedly include the renewal of a U.S. trade law that allows retaliatory measures against countries which refuse to change what Washington deems unfair trade practices. U.S. press reports said a White House decision to revive the Super 301 trade measure through executive order is imminent, possibly by Thursday. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to narrow differences with Clinton during a summit meeting last Friday over U.S. demands for cutting Japan's trade surplus and boosting the sale of foreign goods in Japan. Takemura said Hosokawa will convene a meeting Thursday afternoon of Japanese officials who negotiated with the U.S. in the economic talks held under a bilateral trade framework accord concluded last July. A meeting joined by cabinet ministers will also be held sometime in the immediate future, the chief cabinet secretary said. Asked about a proposed dispatch of a special envoy to the U.S. to break the deadlock on the strained bilateral trade ties, Takemura said, "it is a thinkable option." Ichiro Ozawa, a senior leader of Shinseito and the main strategist of Hosokawa's ruling coalition, suggested in a press interview that the government send an envoy to Washington in March to restore trust in the Japan-U.S. relations. Takemura said Tokyo has just unveiled a new economy-spurring package and is not considering additional pump-priming measures right now. But he also spoke of the need for efforts to reduce Japan's trade surplus, which totaled 130 billion dollars last year, including about 60 billion dollars with the U.S. "As the Japan-U.S. ties are most important to us, the government should do its utmost to solidify the relations once again," he said.
