The battle is at its fiercest between the opposition, led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and the People's Party government, which returned to power led by a non-iron woman, yet one who has firmly established her presence in a country where power has always been wielded by men. Nusrat Bhutto is the wife of the respected politician Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who was executed by former Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq, on the charge of having carried out the murder of a member of the opposition. Her maiden name was Nusrat al-Isfahani; she is Iranian, of the Shiite sect. Her husband became acquainted with her, then married her. Our meeting with Nusrat Bhutto was at Sindh House in Islamabad, which is composed of connected residences for the convenience of politicians in this state, seen as the most important of Pakistan's states by far, for when they visit the new capital established by former Pakistani President General Muhammad Ayub Khan in 1964. Nusrat Bhutto looks to be in her early fifties, but is actually in her late fifties. She is surrounded by a group of male and female attendants, all of whom await her on the lower floor, while she prepares herself for a full day on the upper floor of one of the residences at Sindh House. [passage ommitted] Wholesale Accusations We were not with Nusrat Bhutto long before asking about the relationship between her and her daughter, though we avoided entering too directly into this subject. She embarked on her answer as she seated herself in a comfortable chair in a beautiful and orderly sitting room: "She will hurt herself. She will be the victim of her own unpredictable behavior." Nusrat Bhutto spoke on, ignoring the protests of one of those present who did not want to turn the session into a discussion of family matters. She said, "Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, God rest his soul, gave her two pieces of advice: to obey her mother, telling her that paradise lies at the feet of mothers, and never to distance herself from the poor; to take up their problems and issues constantly." She went on to say, with no pause at the remarks and gestures of those who came in to stop the interview, "She has done the exact opposite of what her father advised. She has distanced herself from the poor, and surrounded herself with a retinue of (former President) Zia-ul-Haq's bunch, and the Reform Party. She no longer listens to a word from me, or to one particle of my advice." She said that she herself is to blame, because she spoiled her daughter Benazir more than necessary, having gotten into the habit of refusing her nothing. Nusrat Bhutto said that the poor are the ones who had made Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto the leader of Pakistan, and that he had focused most of his attention on providing every Pakistani with his or her daily bread and clothing. She added, with bitter sarcasm, "Zulfiqar was grooming Shahnawaz [the son who is said to have committed suicide in France some years ago] for leadership and governing. To him, Benazir was just a spoiled girl he wanted to be educated, to graduate from the finest universities." Bhutto's Ring Without stopping, without even paying the slightest attention to the protests of some, Nusrat added that her daughter Benazir is "bewitched," and that she became certain of this when she sent one of her friends to inspect her bed: "This friend actually went and inspected the bed and found twelve fingernails painted black in the bedstead over the bed." In a fiery tone she exclaimed, "I never believed these things, but I checked myself, and we found these black nails in Benazir's bed frame. I took them to a clergyman who is famous for fighting evil spirits. He took them and poured a certain oil over them, then burned them. At that point I noticed that Benazir's behavior changed, and that she had become rational again, but that was only temporary." Begum Nusrat told the story of the struggle for leadership between the Bhutto family and the family of Benazir's husband. She said that her son Murtaza, currently imprisoned in a Sindh prison, had asked for his father's ring, which had been kept by his sister Benazir after Zulfiqar's execution, "but she put him off, procrastinated, and avoided doing it." She continued with this story, which is a highly painful one for her, saying, "When I found out that she wanted to keep this ring for herself and her children later on, I asked her to give it to me temporarily so that I could take it to a jeweler for him to make one exactly like it for Mortaza. She refused. I found out that she had had made a ring just like it made for her son, who is still a young child." Nusrat Bhutto repeated the story of this ring again and again, and told how she had given the specifications of the ring to a jeweler, and asked him to make one like it based on her description, "but the jeweler was not able to. He gave us a ring that did not look one thing like Zulfiqar's ring." Rats in Prison Begum Nusrat moved on from discussing Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's ring, which Benazir had insisted on keeping for her and her children, to the story of her son Murtaza, who had been imprisoned on the charge of hijacking a plane in the early 1980s. She insisted that the charge was fabricated, and that the intention was to put an and to the Bhuttos' rule and finish off their political life in Pakistan. The widow of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, and mother of Pakistan's prime minister, asserted that she did not want to interfere in the case, but that all she was asking was for Benazir to intercede to speed up the trial, "because the conditions Murtaza is enduring in prison are unbearable. He has been put in a small cell, like a criminal's cell." Nusrat Bhutto says that her son told her the water in his cell was shut off some time ago, and that he cannot shave himself; and that mice and rats can roam freely and play. "We asked the director of the prison why there are rats, and he said the reason is the changes in the climate. But I found out that they brought them on purpose to frighten and terrorize him." Nusrat Bhutto returned to the subject of her daughter, describing her as stubborn and moody. "I told you she is bewitched. I am afraid she will be murdered, because her enemies have been able to infiltrate her entourage, and because she does not listen to the advice of her father's friends, who want only the best for her."
