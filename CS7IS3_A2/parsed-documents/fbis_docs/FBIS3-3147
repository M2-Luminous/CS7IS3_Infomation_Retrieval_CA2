It was presided over by CPPCC National Committee Chairman Li Ruihuan. Members of the Standing Committee first examined and passed the agenda and schedule of the current Standing Committee meeting. According to the agenda, the meeting will examine and approve the Standing Committee's work report and the person to deliver the report at the Second Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee; discuss the "Report on the Work of the Government" (draft for soliciting opinions); examine and approve the "CPPCC Constitution (Draft Revision)"; hear and discuss a report by Comrade Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, on the current situation of the anticorruption struggle; and examine and approve the namelists of the additional members to be elected to the Second Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee and the members to be elected to replace members of the Second Session. At the meeting, Zhu Zuolin, deputy secretary general of the National CPPCC Committee, made an explanation on the agenda (draft) and schedule (draft) of the Second Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee. Chen Jinyu, deputy secretary general of the National CPPCC Committee, made an explanation on the drafting of the work report (draft) of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee Standing Committee. Lu Zhichao, deputy secretary general of the National CPPCC Committee, made an explanation on the "CPPCC Constitution (Draft Revision)." National CPPCC Committee Vice Chairman Wang Zhaoguo made an explanation on the namelists (draft) of the additional members to be elected to the Second Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee and the members to be elected to replace members of the Second Session. In his speech, Li Ruihuan hoped that, during the session of the current meeting, Standing Committee members will seriously examine the aforementioned drafts, freely express their opinions, and submit the drafts to the current Standing Committee meeting or the Second Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee for examination and approval. In November 1993 National CPPCC Committee member Shi Jiuyong was jointly elected a judge of the International Court for a nine-year term by the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. To abide by and to implement relevant stipulations of the International Court's rules, he tenendered his resignation as National CPPCC Committee member. National CPPCC Committee member Qian Qing tendered his resignation as member of the National CPPCC Committee's Foreign Affairs Committee for health reasons. After examination, the 10th chairmanship meeting has approved their requests to resign. The above was reported to the Standing Committee for the record. The meeting examined and approved a decision on approving Comrade Song Demin's resignation as secretary general of the National CPPCC Committee for health reasons. Because Liu Hanzhen supported and took part in fraudulent activities of "seeking treasures [zhao bao (2109 1405)" and "presenting treasures [xian bao (3759 1405)," and because Ma Liesun committed serious crimes, the meeting examined the cases and approved a decision on annulling Liu Hanzhen's and Ma Liesun's credentials as members of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee and its Standing Committee. Those attending today's meeting included National CPPCC Committee Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Yang Rudai, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Hong Xuezhi, Zhao Puchu, Qian Weichang, Hu Sheng, Qian Zhengying, Su Buqing, Ding Guangxun, Dong Yinchu, Su Fuling, and Ann Tse Kai.
