(6) Loading and unloading. (i) The transport vehicle shall be positioned to provide working clearance between the vehicle and the deck. (ii) Only the loading or unloading machine operator and other personnel the employer demonstrates are essential shall be in the work area during loading and unloading. (iii) No transport vehicle operator shall remain in the cab during loading and unloading if the logs are carried or moved over the truck cab, unless the employer demonstrates that it is necessary for the operator to do so.

While enroute, the operator shall check and tighten the tie downs whenever there is reason to believe that the tie downs have loosened or the load has shifted. (8) Storage.
