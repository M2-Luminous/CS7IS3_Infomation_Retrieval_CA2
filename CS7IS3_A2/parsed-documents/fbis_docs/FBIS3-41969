It also asks the Commission to submit to it as soon as possible: --the major outlines of its master plan on nuclear safety in the East; --a detailed analysis of the recent joint report by the World Bank, IEA [International Energy Agency] and EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] on the different alternative scenarios concerning nuclear safety in a global energy context; --an energy strategy for the East, environmentally sustainable and based on the priority of massive and accelerated development of energy efficiency in energy production, transport and consumer sectors. In the framework of this strategic plan, it asks the Commission that financial assistance in the framework of the PHARE [Poland-Hungary: Actions for Economic Reconversion] and TACIS [Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States] programmes places emphasis on projects involving true partnership, parallel actions between operators and safety authorities and on twinning between Eastern and Western European power stations and safety organisations. In negotiations with the countries concerned, the Commission has to take account of the following objectives: (a) commitment by countries to drawing up plans for shutting down the most dangerous power plants (VVER-230 and RBMK); (b) introducing a legislative framework for controlling safety in each of the countries concerned with provisions which conform to those adopted at Community level; (c) defining global energy programmes; (d) setting up independent safety authorities; (e) adopting energy saving measures; (f) gradually introducing a real price for energy. EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community] loans for nuclear safety in the East remain blocked Commissioner Chistophersen not having given Parliament the assurances it regarded as necessary concerning the conditionality of aid, at the request of its rapporteur, Parliament sent back to Committee a second report by Mr. Herve concerning the capacitation of the Commission to contract EURATOM loans to contribute to funding towards improving the degree of the efficiency and safety of the nuclear sector in countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Republics of the former USSR. During the debate, Mr. Christophersen told Parliament that the European Commission shared their objectives, but that there were differences in the means of attaining these. In particular, he considered that Parliament was going a little too far and that it was hardly possible to require of the Eastern countries that they close down their plants in order to obtain Community aid. As for the proposal to create a task force responsible for these questions within the European Commission, Mr. Christophersen considered that the implementation of the PHARE and TACIS programmes had, after some difficulties, found their cruising speed, and that it was not essential to take further initiatives at organisational level. The Commission intends acting in four fields: --on-the-ground-support for modernization; --analysis of construction safety of those plants which already exist in the countries concerned; --setting up independent controls; --restructuring and storage. As for the possibility of recourse to EURATOM loans, Mr. Christophersen regretted that Parliament had on several occasions postponed the debate on the subject, pointing out that, to guarantee safety in Central and Eastern Europe and former USSR comparable to that which exists in the West, it would require at least ECU [European Currency Unit] 10 billion a year (notably by mobilising international capital). The co-president of the Green Group, Paul Lannoye was not satisfied with Mr. Christophersen's replies on: (a) the EURATOM Treaty and the recycling of irradiated fuels: the Treaty does not mention this at all, otherwise, tell me which Article, Mr. Lannoye asked Mr. Christophersen, who affirmed that this was a priority issue in the Treaty; (b) the import by COCEMA [Comittee of European Manufacturers of Plant for the Food Industry] of uranium from Russia: the Commission, Mr. Christophersen recalled, has already approached France. To Mr. Lannoye who pointed out that the problem was not a recent one and that it had been going on for twenty years, Mr. Christophersen replied that the Commission had sent France a warning. In favour of uniform rules of safety in the Community, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union at the same time, Parliament adopted a resolution on nuclear safety, submitted by the Socialist Group, by which it considers that the rules to be respected in the field of nuclear safety have to be harmonized at Community level, as well as in Eastern Europe and the CIS, on the basis of more rigorous safety. It urges the political authorities of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS to commit themselves to drawing up plans with a view to an immediate decommissioning of the most dangerous nuclear power plants. It insists on the need for these countries to look at other forms of energy, taking account of environmental considerations. It calls on the Council and Commission to ensure that Community aid does not encourage the construction or renovation of nuclear sections in these countries aimed at promoting export strategies of cheap electricity, but produced to the detriment of safety rules of countries in the European Union or EFTA [European Free Trade Association]. It calls on the Commission and the Council to be extremely vigilant and to ensure, on one hand, that the Community and all the States concerned by the transport of radioactive material are beyond such incidents, and, on the other hand, that the means used for this kind of transport fulfill the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safety standards. It calls on the Commission to find a solution to the problem of storing radioactive waste, and to study, for each Member State, the possibilities of long-term storage, and also to analyse medium and long-term radiological effects on man and the environment.
