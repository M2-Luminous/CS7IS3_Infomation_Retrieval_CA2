Attempts to bypass the barrier of U.S. rejection of any UN resolution that goes beyond the superficial measures Israel has taken to absorb the world's anger have all failed. These measures sketch the state of the settlement activities and acknowledge their danger. But, they do not go beyond that to take a practical stand to end their tangible and potential effects, in the absence of any international deterrence of a repetition of the settlers' crime. Today, when voting starts on the draft resolution, the United States will selectively choose the paragraphs that agree with its viewpoint. It will prove conclusively that the UN Security Council might be a forum for exchanging views on various international issues, but basically, and in the end, remains a mere reflection of the U.S. viewpoint, subject to predetermined strategic considerations. No one can influence this, regardless of how justified and logical his reasons may be, and regardless of how much they agree with the principles of justice and peace. In all honesty, in its current position in the UN Security Council, the United States has shown a concern for its commitments. It has been faithful to the pledges it made to Israel in the form of assurances before the Madrid Conference and before the negotiations began. These assurances kept Jerusalem and the settlements outside any formula. The U.S. president recently reaffirmed this fact to freshen the memory of those who have forgotten the Madrid formula. This explains the U.S. objection to any paragraph that includes a reference to Jerusalem in the UN Security Council resolution that will establish a known reality, something the Arabs have already accepted implicitly. What remains to be said is that the negotiations, suspended in protest against the shedding of Arab blood, will resume on the basis of generalities. This will save face, but will not change the reality that reaffirmed the facts, facts forgotten by the Arab mind and facts that taste of blood and suppression.
