This topic is dominating the thoughts of Netherlands voters. There is no more room for asylum-seekers. Hardly any racist arguments are being advanced, mainly economic ones. That is the most significant opinion expressed to 30 reporters from NRC HANDELSBLAD during approximately 500 interviews conducted with voters in the Netherlands last Monday [17 April]. Few of those interviewed professed to disliking foreigners. Most interviewees saw a direct link between cuts, rising unemployment, lower benefit payments, the shortage of housing, and the "foreigners," who are supposedly to blame. In order to go further than the meager opinion polls, last Monday the Central Bureau for Statistics visited 30 selected neighborhoods which together accurately reflect the Netherlands as a whole. In all, 527 people were interviewed about their voting behavior and the arguments behind it, about the country's main problems in their eyes and what "politicians" are doing about them. Of all those interviewed, 35 percent spontaneously cited "foreigners" as the country's most serious problem. "Unemployment" and the Old Age Pensions Law [AOW] followed a considerable distance behind, each of these two topics being mentioned by approximately 15 percent. The planned cuts on old age pensions and other benefits for the elderly have stirred up a lot of bad blood. The voters regard "crime" as being less important than many politicians believe: Only 10 percent spontaneously ranked this topic among the important issues. Issues such as "social security," "discrimination," and "the environment" remained some way behind, being mentioned by between 5 and 10 percent of those interviewed. [passage omitted]
