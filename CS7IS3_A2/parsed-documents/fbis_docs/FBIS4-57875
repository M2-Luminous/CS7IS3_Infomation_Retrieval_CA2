They also approved the first five candidates for the Senate by a majority. The executive committee of the majority faction of the party also approved the report drafted by its Political Affairs Committee -- thus confirming what EL PAIS published yesterday -- recommending that the faction's convention on 22 May approves these two points. Ramirez' proclamation, which was the first point, was unanimously approved. The second point, regarding the list of members for the Senate, received a negative vote from Deputy Arturo Heber and reservations from two other leaders. Senator Jorge Silveira Zavala, president of the Herreraist faction, announced this at the end of a two and a half hour meeting. He confirmed that the Senate list will be headed by Transport and Public Works Minister Juan Carlos Raffo, San Jose Mayor Juan Chiruchi, Deputy Luis Alberto Heber (Rivera Department), Deputy Carlos Garat (Colonia Department), and Uruguay Tourne, a former senator and current member of the National party's executive board. The executive board decided to postpone selecting the candidate for the vice presidency. [passage omitted]
