The news analyst says: The traitor Kim Yong-sam during his trip to Japan asked Japan to "take responsible measures" over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. He also called the U.S. President on the phone and begged for "close cooperation" of the United States in South Korea's campaign over the issue. The South Korean "foreign minister" advertised the "need of international sanctions" against the DPRK during his trip to the United States and Japan. This shows the South Korean puppet clique's dependence on outside forces and flunkeyist treacheries against the nation have been carried into the extremes. The Kim Yong-sam group regards it as the only way of prolonging its days to harm and stifle fellow countrymen as a shock brigade in the anti-DPRK hostile policy of outside forces. That is why the puppet clique is persisting in confrontation and war moves against the North. The Kim Yong-sam group must ponder over the grave consequences that might come from its reckless act of driving the situation to the brink of war in collusion with outside forces.
