The Iraqis said that the dead escort, who held the rank of captain, came from Tikrit, Saddam's birthplace. The Iraqi president (last summer) himself shot and killed his escort Mu'ayyad al-'Ayyash because he had informed an Iraqi family of a secret place in southern Baghdad in which Saddam was present. Al-'Ayyash, too, came from Tikrit and had family ties with the president. The Iraqis who spoke about the new attempt believe that it occurred less than a month ago just outside Baghdad and that a quick reshuffle was made immediately in the protection teams assigned to guard the Iraqi president. The most recent report leaked from Baghdad spoke about the blowing up of an agricultural tractor on a road through which the Iraqi president's motorcade passed on its way to one of his bunkers outside the capital. At the time suspicion revolved around the president's escorts and senior leaders, who were the only ones who had known that the president's motorcade would use this country road.
