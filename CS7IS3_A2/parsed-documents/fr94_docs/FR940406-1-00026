FR940406-1-00026 FR940406-1-00008 7. Enforceability Issues All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)). The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above under section 3 entitled ``RACM (including RACT).'' The State, while relying on the soil conservation measures of the FSA, has not adopted these measures into the SIP or taken any credit for these measures. Since these measures are federally mandated and will be implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they are considered to be federally enforceable. Thus, it is not necessary for the State to adopt these measures into the SIP. As discussed in section 3 above, there are State-wide regulations that will also impact the emissions of PM&hyph;10 in the Lamar nonattainment area. These regulations include Colorado Regulation No. 4, which requires all wood stoves sold after July 1, 1991 to meet the emission requirements of EPA's Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters in 40 CFR 60.532(b), and Colorado Regulation No. 3, which requires construction permits for new or modified stationary sources. EPA previously reviewed Colorado Regulations No. 3 and 4 at the time these regulations were approved by EPA as part of the SIP, and it was determined that these regulations met the enforceability criteria of the September 23, 1987 Potter Memorandum (see the TSD for information on EPA approvals of these regulations). 6 6 Note that the current version of Colorado Regulation No. 3 approved by EPA does not meet all of the applicable requirements of the amended Act. As discussed in footnote number 4, the State submitted revisions to Regulation No. 3 in January of 1993 which are being evaluated by EPA. EPA will act on that submittal in a separate notice. The State of Colorado has a program that will ensure that the measures contained in the SIP are adequately enforced. The Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) has the authority to implement and enforce all emission limitations and control measures adopted by the State, including the requirements of any emission control regulations, the SIP, and any permit. The APCD has the authority to impose civil penalties of up to $15,000 per day per violation, as well as criminal penalties. Thus, EPA believes the State has adequate enforcement capabilities to ensure compliance with the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP and the State-wide regulations. The TSD contains further information on the State-wide regulations, enforceability requirements, and a discussion of the personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation of the control measures. 8. Contingency Measures. As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544. These measures were to be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Thus, the measures were due separate from the requirements addressed in this notice. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. The Lamar SIP submittal addressed in this notice did not include any contingency measures. The State submitted the contingency measures for Lamar as a revision to the SIP on December 9, 1993. EPA will act on the December 1993 submittal in a separate notice.
