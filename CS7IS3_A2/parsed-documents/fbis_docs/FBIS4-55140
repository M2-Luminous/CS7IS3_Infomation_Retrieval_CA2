FBIS4-55140 "dreeu091__a94007" FBIS-EEU-94-091-A Daily Report 11 May 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Press Comments Reported Press Comments Reported AU1105121594 Sofia BTA in English 1028 GMT 11 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1105121594 Sofia BTA English BFN [From BTA's 11 May "Press Review"] [Excerpt] Sofia, May 11 (BTA) -- The press provides extensive comments on the forthcoming cabinet changes. Most dailies say that Prime Minister Lyuben Berov can hardly be expected to introduce the intended cabinet changes before parliament today, as promised in an interview last Sunday. DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), quotes Socialists' parliamentary floor leader Nora Ananieva as saying that the document which the prime minister gave to the parliamentary forces contained just outlines. Interviewed for TRUD, MP Osman Oktay of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) says that the prime minister has not convinced the DPS that Rumen Genchev, Prof. Berov's nominee as the third deputy prime minister, is competent for this office. "DPS disapproves of Gechev's nomination as deputy prime minister", STANDART NEWS says in a front-paged headline. According to DUMA, in most probability the DPS position is a bid for a deal involving influence in key departments. The DPS MP's, who are expected to meet with the prime minister on Thursday [12 May], oppose the BSP interference in the cabinet's overhaul and advised the prime minister against introducing the cabinet changes before parliament today, 24 CHASA writes. Referring to what are described as well informed sources, DEMOKRATSIYA cites former parliamentary DPS deputy floor leader Sherife Mustafa as saying that she would not support the prime minister's proposal for changes because "she does not want to go to prison together with Ahmed Dogan (leader of the DPS)". DUMA says that Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov is the likely deputy prime minister, and MP Gospodin Atanasov of the New Union for Democracy (expelees or breakaways from the Union of Democratic Forces) will probably be nominated as the new minister of justice. "The Socialists describe Stoyan Aleksandrov's threat for some ministers resigning en bloc and his claim he could cope with Bulgaria's foreign debt problem alone as overdoing it," DUMA says. "They All Fell Out," reads the headline of an article in DEMOKRATSIYA which says that the BSP and the DPS will wait until the conference of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) is held. According to KONTINENT, the overhaul of the cabinet has been put off until May 18. "The second overhaul of the cabinet stands a good chance of entering the Guinness Book of Records as the most time- taking bargain ever in world practice," a signed commentary in KONTINENT says. An editorial commentary in 24 CHASA says that the tourist season and the cabinet overhaul seem to have a common fate: both ending before ever starting. DUMA writes in a commentary that both the prime minister and the parliamentary forces will benefit by protracting the overhaul. OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes President Zhelyu Zhelev as saying that he is skeptical about the cabinet overhaul. STANDART NEWS writes that MP's have opened negotiations on a new cabinet.
