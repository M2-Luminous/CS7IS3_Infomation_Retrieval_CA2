Even if the GNP were to be about 1 percent higher in 1994 than it was in 1993, this does not change anything concerning the economic and, above all, the difficult long-term structural problems. Therefore, an "active German and European economic policy" is necessary. Thus, the Bundesbank should lower the prime rate to about 3 to 4 percent by June. The European Union must decide quickly on its infrastructure program of about 29 billion German marks. After the signing of the new GATT agreement, the agreed reduction of trade barriers are to be implemented quickly. In addition, an innovation offensive should be started, Jens said.
