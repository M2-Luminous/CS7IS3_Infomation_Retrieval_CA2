As this year ends we have legitimate reasons to feel satisfied. The recent presidential and parliamentary elections concluded a phase of our history in which Chile happily rescued its democratic traditions. We Chileans live in peace, respecting our legitimate differences and striving to overcome them through understanding. Authority is exercised within the framework of the law; the peoples' basic rights are respected; the state institutions, although they need to be perfected, function normally within the framework of our democratic system; the country continues to develop. With the limitations characteristic of a developing world, Chile grows and improves the living standards of its people. Production, income per capita, job opportunities, savings, and investments continue to grow. Unemployment and inflation rates are dropping. More houses, highways, ports, and other infrastructure works are being built. The great efforts to improve our public health and education systems are beginning to yield positive results. Yet, we must be careful. These achievements which fill us with pride and hope must not make us complacent. Although we have reasons to be optimistic, nothing justifies any sort of vanity or arrogance. We are neither tigers nor jaguars. We are one of the many developing countries in the world greatly limited by the poverty that affects a great part of our population and by our economy's dependency on fully developed countries. A single example is enough to show what I mean. During the year that is ending, the drop experienced by our main exportable goods, as a result of the recession affecting most of the rich countries, has reduced Chile's income from exports by 8 percent regardless of the fact that the volume of our exports has continued to grow. This fact requires that we continue with our policy for growth with equity with each and every one of us cooperating, according to our own possibilities, with the clear understading that work, perseverance, and time are necessary to be able to reap the desired results. As we tackle this challenge we must bear in mind that we belong to an increasingly interdependent world. This is why we must persevere in the effort made during these past years in order to increase and strengthen our relationship with the other countries of the world and cooperate with them in the task of consolidating peace, of increasing and liberalizing world commerce, and building a more fair international order. The steps we have taken to solve problems and increase cooperation with neighboring countries and other Latin American sister republics, and our recent acceptance as an APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] member country represent valuable contributions in that regard, that open new possibilities for the future of our country. Likewise, the recent agreement reached at the GATT Uruguay Round and the approval of the North America Free Trade Agreement represent legitimate reasons for optimism for our future. In September 1990, before the UN General Assembly, I had the honor to urge jointly tackling the poverty problem which is one of the main threats to world peace. Accepting this suggestion, the United Nations has summoned a world summit on social development that will be held in March 1995 and will be organized by a committee headed by the Chilean ambassador. Therefore, we must, as a country, contribute with constructive ideas and promote efficient international agreements so that this summit will be fruitful. I urge my fellow countrymen, in the year that is comming, to accept this challenge as a national commitment. The year 1994 has been declared the International Year of the Family. It is only natural that human beings value the family which, by essence, is the natural home of love and the nearest social nucleus we all have. Undoubtedly, some characteristics of modern life threaten to undermine the strength of the family. In modern culture, selfishness prevails over love for our fellow man. More often than not there is more interest in material issues than in people and the desire to have material possessions prevails over the desire to have good friends. The greed for pleasure overwhelmingly surpasses the willingness to make any sort of sacrifice. These facts weaken family ties and affect the family's stability, obviously harming its members, especially the children. I cordially urge all my fellow countrymen to calmly ponder about this very important subject and to contribute in the search for the most adequate paths to fortify our family life. Next March the new government recently elected by the people, which will be headed by my friend Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, will assume the presidency. I hope the new government will be able to continue and strengthen, in keeping with its government program, the job of perfecting our democracy, economic development, and social justice for which we have worked these past years. In addition to thanking my fellow countrymen for their support and sense of responsibility with which, in general, they have honored my government, I ask them for the same for my successor. I wish that the new year will be a year of peace, development, and justice for Chile and the entire world. I wish happiness to all my fellow countrymen. May God bless you all.
