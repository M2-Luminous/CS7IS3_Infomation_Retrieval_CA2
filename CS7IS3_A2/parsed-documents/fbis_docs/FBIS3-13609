[passage omitted] While the statements attributed to U.S. President Bill Clinton, in which he considered "Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel," have provoked Palestinian condemnation, the Foreign Ministry believe that these statements "cannot be taken seriously, because they were remarks reportedly made by the U.S. President at a dinner banquet and did not emanate from him personally." In a statement to AL-HAYAH a Foreign Ministry source added that, if these statements were "a declared official position, they would have been dealt with differently." Besides, "the way in which they are currently being dealt with is exaggerated." Meanwhile, official sources have denied that Cairo offered to host a meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin in Egypt. They said: "The offer is American." Cairo expressed willingness to host the meeting if 'Arafat agrees and believes that it would be useful. They said that "'Arafat turned down the offer."
