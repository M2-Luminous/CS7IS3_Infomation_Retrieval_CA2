They described his excellency as a national leader of a new type and as the most courageous politician in the world. In statements to an INA correspondent in Moscow, the Russian personalities hailed the Iraqi people and their unbending steadfastness at the historical battle, the Mother of Battles, and their support for their brave leadership. They said that the Iraqi leadership stands as a symbol of defiance that will continue to be recalled by all free people and all of mankind for many generations to come. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party and member of the Russian Federation's Parliament, hailed the unique, historic Iraqi leadership. He described President Saddam Husayn as a national leader of a new type and as the most courageous politician in the world in recent times. He said that President Saddam Husayn represents a dauntless national leadership that defends the interests of its country and people. He said that, from this perspective, Saddam Husayn offers a model for how any national leadership should be in a world that the United States and hostile Western circles are trying to control. He added that a leader who confronted the aggression of 30 states, led by the United States, deserves to be appreciated and respected. He indicated that the Iraqi leadership's wisdom and brilliant and successful management of the national economy despite the criminal blockade is unmistakable evidence that Iraq is a lofty, lively, and deep-rooted country. He said that had any other country in the world been subjected to such a blockade, it would have died a long time ago. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stressed that the Liberal Democratic Party and the grass-roots Russian masses that supported it in the recent parliamentary elections constantly call for lifting the blockade imposed on Iraq. He said: We are continuing our consultations and efforts in this regard inside and outside the Parliament. During my recent European tour, I held numerous meetings with leaders of various parties and political and social organizations and discussed with them the need to lift the embargo against Iraq. He stressed the importance of escalating the international campaign to put an end to the crime that the United States and the evil powers are committing against the steadfast Iraqi people. Gennadiy Zyoganov [name as received], leader of the Russian Communist Party and member of the Russian Federation's Parliament, called for the resumption of relations between Russia and Iraq, proceeding from the deep-rooted relations of friendship and cooperation that once existed between the two countries. In statements to INA correspondent, he said: Time will not erase from the memory of our people years of extensive relations of cooperation and mutual benefit. Our people are certain that the black clouds darkening the skies of our country will disappear and that relations with Iraq will return to normal. He added that the Russian Communist Party is looking forward to the day when difficulties are removed and when relations between Russia and Iraq are restored to normal for the interest of the two peoples and their progress and prosperity.
