During the disarmament ceremony, which was held at the Quilali community that borders Honduras, Esteli Bishop Abelardo Matta invoked God and thanked Him for the rebels' decision to give up their weapons "for the sake of peace" in this part of the country. The weapons surrendered by the "recontras," approximately 150, included Soviet-manufactured AK rifles, pistols, several surface-to- air missiles, and other military materiel, were destroyed at the location of the demobilization ceremony. The disarmament process of "Chacal's" men started on 2 March and continued on 25 March. On those dates, approximately 300 "recontras" gave up their rifles and entered civilian life. Almost 100 demobilized rebels entered a police academy in Managua, where they will receive training in the fields of security and public order so they may, in the coming months, join police units in northern Nicaraguan municipalities. A military source in Quilali, reached by telephone, told ACAN-EFE that chieftain "Chacal" surrendered his rifle and ratified his commitment to work "from the civilian field" to improve the living conditions of the now-demobilized "recontras." The disarmament ceremony was attended by Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta for the government; Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock for the Army; Bishop Abelardo Matta, who is the International Commission of Support and Verification coordinator; Argentine Sergio Caramagna; and human rights organization representatives. The government and the rebels agree that now that the last phase of the 3-80 Northern Front's disarmament process has concluded, northern Nicaragua will initiate "a new phase of peace" and leave behind a war that left thousands of soldiers, civilians, and rearmed rebels dead or injured. "Hopefully God wants this (the peace process) to advance so that we can find tranquility," Bishop Matta exclaimed. Matta is one of the representatives of the Catholic Church in the area who contributed to the signing of the peace agreement between the government and the rebels. The Catholic bishop, who expressed his satisfaction with the government's decision to create the necessary conditions "that would result in the successful" disarmament of the rebels, called on the country's authorities to promote true socioeconomic programs to avoid a new rearmament process. The rearming of the rebels started in Nicaragua in 1990, a short time after Violeta Chamorro assumed office as president, when several thousand of the 22,000 former "contras" who had demobilized initially, rebelled because they considered that the government had not kept the promises it made to them to get them to reenter civilian life.
