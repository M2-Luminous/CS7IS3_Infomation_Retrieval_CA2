He added that this problem must be resolved by the central government, taking into account that it affects the public and that the problem was created by the government when it implemented Legislative Decree No. 776, which pruned the municipality's tax benefits. Dibos indicated that this month (March) it will be very difficult to cover the employees' payroll, which amounts to some 4.5 million new soles. He stated that the estimated deficit amounts to 60 million new soles per annum. "The problem is very serious, and we do not have the resources needed to pay employees' salaries," he said.
