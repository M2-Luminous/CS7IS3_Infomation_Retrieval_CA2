Permission was issued by the Fishing Industry's Sakhalin Oblast Department on approval from the Russian Federation Committee on Fishing in connection with a shortage of funds to provide the islands with fuel oil, gasoline, and diesel oil. According to Aleksandr Medvedev, head of the Sakhalin administration fishing department, the Kurils thus will be able to get from Japan and South Korea 45,000 tonnes of diesel fuel and 15,000 tonnes of fuel oil, quite sufficient to solve these islands' energy supply problem.
