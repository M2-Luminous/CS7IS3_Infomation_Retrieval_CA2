Even in Somalia I Did Not See Such Things,' Said Canadian Observer About Elections in Crimea"] [Text] More than 60 percent of the electors participated in the Crimean elections. It was evident that the Russia bloc would win and preliminary results confirm this. While communists reportedly received 10 to 12 percent of the vote, the Party of Economic Rebirth -- 7 to 8 percent, the Party of Social Guarantees and the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea received 3 percent each, the Russia bloc is expected to hit the mark of 65 to 70 percent. Although the 14 seats allocated for parties will not determine the nature of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, representatives of the bloc are the leaders in single-seat districts, where elections will have to be repeated. Names of winners have already been announced in 10 electoral districts. The new professional legislature will be comprised of an electrician from a grain elevator, a messenger from a small company, a mechanic, and a deputy manager of a television center. In two districts (Yalta and Yevpatoriya) the Crimean Supreme Soviet elections did not take place at all. Elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet took place in all the districts, although many electors responded to President Meshkov's televised appeal and instead of dropping their ballots into ballot boxes, took them home. Pro-Ukrainian organizations, along with the Organization of the National Movement of the Crimean Tatars, have issued a declaration and held a news conference emphasizing that representatives of the Russia bloc and members of electoral committees themselves were campaigning right at the polling stations, advising the electors what to do. Ihor Banakh, deputy chairman of the committee "Crimea With Ukraine" cited a remark by Canadian citizen Alexander Shelak, an observer from the Ukrainian Congressional Union of America, who had said: "I am shocked. Even in Somalia I did not see such things." At any rate, after Meshkov, the top official of the Republic of Crimea, advised on television to vote for the Russia bloc and ignore the Ukrainian elections, after he termed the national quotas the Supreme Soviet's mistake and a "departing legislature's deal," few things can be considered shocking. Meshkov's concern over the national quotas is quite understandable. The results of voting in the Crimean Tatar constituency have demonstrated Kurultay's [Tatars' congress] convincing victory. According to incomplete reports, some 88 percent voted for Kurultay candidates which amounts to the political death of the Majlis [Tatar council] opponent, the National Movement of Crimean Tatars. Kurultay's deputies in the Crimean legislature are the only thing casting gloom over the festive mood of pro-Russian forces. They will hardly put up with this situation, all the more so since Yuriy Meshkov outlined his stance in the following way: "There's God, there's the nation, and there's the president. This is what determines our strategy." That is why the results of the 27 March poll on changing Crimea's status and granting more powers to the president, not yet announced, will provide guidance for action. The Crimean president solemnly promised this to the "Crimean people." It is worth pointing out that Yevgeniy Saburov, after returning to the Crimea, immediately left for Kiev to meet with Leonid Kravchuk. Under the current circumstances, the subject of their talks seems very intriguing.
