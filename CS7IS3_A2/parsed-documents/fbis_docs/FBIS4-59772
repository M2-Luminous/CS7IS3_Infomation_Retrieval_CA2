Indeed, the signing seemed to be in doubt for a moment. Does that mean that there are still differences? [Rabin] When we signed the 1993 Washington declaration, we knew that we were taking on a great many difficulties. However, we realized that we had to take risks to achieve our goal: the end of 100 years of conflict between the Jewish and Arab populations of Palestine, between Israel and the Palestinians. Why? Because we are not concluding peace with another country, but with a population without a state. If we sign a peace treaty with an Arab neighbor, then we what we are concluding is a treaty based on a particular border, and we then go on to decide how that peace is to be implemented along the clear dividing line between us and our neighbors. That means: On our side of the peaceful border, we bear the responsibility, on the other side, the other country -- each side bears a responsibility toward the other. [Ruehl] As in the case of Sinai and Egypt? [Rabin] Yes, as in the case of Egypt. It was not possible to achieve a permanent solution with the Palestinians in one move. The reality of this was accepted at the Madrid international conference as the basis for Israel's participation in negotiations with the neighboring countries that are in a state of war with us: Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. This means that the process consists of two phases: The first phase centers on the interim agreement on an internal settlement for the Palestinian people to occur over a transitional period and only after that, once the reality on the ground has changed, will we enter phase two, in which we will negotiate a solution. There is a web of ties linking both populations to each other. The situation in Gaza is much simpler, but is still complicated enough. The Israeli settlements there will remain. [Ruehl] How many settlers are involved? [Rabin] About 5,000 people, but their settlements are in the middle of territory that will come under Palestinian administration. These settlements are extra-territorial with regard to the jurisdiction of Palestinian local autonomy. There are a certain number of roads linking these settlements to Israel, and we will also have to ensure the security of those routes. Under these circumstances, organizing a peaceful coexistence between two populations who live intermingled with each in a confined area is a difficult task. That is why the agreement must be detailed enough to allow the Palestinians to run their affairs on the one hand while, at the same time, Israel can remain responsible for the Jewish settlements and for the security, including external security, of all the Israelis. I was in favor of the interim agreement settling as much as possible. [Ruehl] But did that involve risks? [Rabin] It would have been riskier to leave certain points unclarified and then to argue about them. It will also be difficult enough to cooperate on changing reality in the spirit of peaceful coexistence, but we will try. That is the acid test for the value of the agreement with the PLO. However, one must also take account of the fact that it was possible to conclude the negotiations with an accord, that is, the interim agreement, only one month after the Hebron tragedy. There was only a short delay. Even if one compares the date with the one that was set by the Washington declaration for the implementation of Gaza-Jericho autonomy, 13 April 1994, I see no reason why the implementation cannot be accomplished by the end of May. [Ruehl] However, has the delay not placed a burden on the psychological situation surrounding the implementation of the autonomy agreement? [Rabin] All the opponents of the agreement and, in addition to that, of peace between Israel and the Arabs have sought to use the delays to torpedo the peace process. It can, however, be seen that the detailed result facilitated rapid implementation and that is why the actual implementation of the agreement could overlap with the last stage of the negotiations. I assume that we now need no more than three to four weeks, if the Palestinians are ready to exercise policing duties shortly. [Ruehl] But that does not mean that all the dangers have been eliminated. [Rabin] On the Palestinian side, the strongest opposition to the treaty and peaceful coexistence with Israel primarily comes from extremist Islamic fundamentalists. They represent a great risk. Islamic terrorist groups murder Israelis not just to fight Israel, but also to try to bring about the collapse of the peace process. I do not dispute the fact that terrorist attacks in Israel reduce the level of support for the treaty. People in Israel have been writing letters of this kind to me: "I was in favor of a political solution of the kind that you have been pursuing, but what purpose is served by a agreement with the PLO if it fails to provide us with more security than before?" Of course, the Palestinian extremists know that, and that is why I say that the fulfillment of these security hopes on the part of the Israelis combined with the fulfillment of the Palestinians hopes regarding the running of their own affairs will determine whether or not the Gaza-Jericho agreement will create prospects for a political solution to peaceful coexistence. We said to our people that terrorism will be reduced, and the PLO has told the Palestinians that autonomy will result in effective self- administration, which will bring social and economic development. If these two goals are not achieved, then we will have a problem. [Ruehl] When you talk about security for Israel, what do you mean by that? [Rabin] For Israel, it means the personal security of its citizens. That is because the Palestinians do not pose a threat to Israel's existence. [Ruehl] It is being said in Israel that Rabin's government has neglected its national security, because it has said that it is prepared to negotiate the return of Arab refugees from the 1967 war. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs would return and "flood" Israel. Is there not an indirect threat of this kind? [Rabin] Of course not. If you read the Cairo agreement, you will see that it does not contain anything about refugees that was not already mentioned in the Camp David accord, which former Likud chairman Begin agreed with Egypt, namely, a discussion about the refugee problem, irrespective of what territories are the subject of an autonomy agreement. The bulk of the refugee problem concerns those people who fled from their homes in 1948/49, from territories that have belonged to Israel since that time. We will then raise the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab states. The Washington declaration states that refugee issues will be raised in later negotiations on a definitive political solution. Another question is that of the 1967 "displaced persons," that is, those Palestinians in what was formerly west Jordanian territory who fled during the Six Day War. A committee composed of the four parties concerned -- Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and the PLO -- will start discussing these issues one month after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. We have not agreed on any figures or numbers in this respect. We have not assumed any obligations. [Ruehl] Is this related to the presence of about 120,000 Israeli settlers in territories that have been occupied since 1967, to the question of land that belonged to Arabs until then? [Rabin] The Washington declaration states that the settlers will remain during the interim period and that this issue will not be raised until negotiations take place on a permanent overall solution. That is in line with the 1978 Camp David accord. Nothing has changed in this respect. The refugee question, the question of the settlers, the border question, and the question of the status of Jerusalem are being kept for the last set of negotiations, which will also deal with the principles for respecting religious freedom and free access to all the holy sites for the various religions in Jerusalem. [Ruehl] Since 1967, Israeli settlement policy has led to the appearance of large housing complexes where settlers are concentrated. Do these new settlements belong to the city of Jerusalem? [Rabin] Until now, no Israeli Government has annexed territory under Israeli control and added it to the territory of the city of Jerusalem as set out in the 1967 law on the unity of the capital of Israel. The situation has not changed since the July 1967 law, which placed Jerusalem under the sovereignty of the Israeli state. Until the outcome of future negotiations on a permanent political solution, the remaining territory on the Jordanian West Bank, which was occupied during the 1967 war with Jordan will remain under Israeli military rule in accordance with international law. Until now, we have only concluded a treaty on internal Palestinian autonomy in the two areas of Jericho and Gaza. Jerusalem belongs to Israel, and it is and will remain the capital of Israel. [Ruehl] Has the PLO the ability to effectively exercise political and administrative responsibility for the two areas and to make a success of autonomy? [Rabin] The PLO must begin by gaining experience in administration. It will have an opportunity to do so in Gaza and Jericho, because all the wishes and demands of the Palestinian population in those areas will be directed to it. This involves political practice and the local administration, which has remained in Arab hands since 1967. In Gaza, we make a distinction between Israeli military rule, which will now come to an end, and civilian administration under military rule. The civilian administration is essentially Palestinian: Of the 6,000 employees, only 160 are Israelis. All heads of administrative agencies are Palestinians. All together, Israel employs 24,000 in the public service, and 18,000 in transportation and public utilities, and other facilities. Each month, $10 million is paid out of the Israeli state budget for salaries and wages. I put the following question to 'Arafat in Cairo: "What is going to happen to this expenditure? Who is going to pay when we leave?" [Ruehl] What was the PLO chairman's answer to that? [Rabin] He is relying on international donors, who have promised support for the development of autonomy. The Washington conference of prospective donors has envisaged a sum of about $2.2 billion spread over five years. The PLO will now have to assume responsibility for the 750,000 Palestinians in Gaza and the 20,000 or so in Jericho, and it will have to prove to the population that it can discharge its responsibility. That is the criterion for measuring the success of autonomy. This means preventing terrorist attacks above all. The PLO must see to it that these two regions do not serve as springboards for terrorist attacks against Israel or against Israelis living in these areas. [Ruehl] That is the key issue in the debate in Israel on the autonomy agreement and the withdrawal of Israeli troops, as well as in discussion of the protection of settlements in Gaza and the security of Israel itself. [Rabin] There are risks, and there is a risk for the PLO in this respect, too. In future, the PLO must see to security in its own areas. Without security, there will be no further positive developments, including economic ones. It is in the vital interest of the Palestinians to foster security, just as it lies in Israel's interests for the Palestinian population to make economic progress and see the light at the end of the tunnel. That is the only way in which a lasting solution can be achieved. That is why we are interested in a strong PLO police force, financial support for autonomy, as well as investment by the international community in those areas. [Ruehl] Will you reopen the border crossing-points for Palestinian workers and businessmen? [Rabin] Yes, as long as they are not used to bring in terrorists. During the negotiations on the border, the security question must be solved in a way that is in line with Israeli security interests. Between 25 and 33 percent of GDP in Gaza and the West Bank, which have been administered by Israel since 1967, comes from Palestinians who work in Israel. This population has to cooperate with Israel when the borders are open in order to improve its standard of living. [Ruehl] What kind of international cooperation can provide a framework for that? [Rabin] We have to distinguish between several different aspects: financial support for the Palestinians, that is, aid totalling $2.2 billion; regional cooperation; and economic relations with Israel. Trade between the European Union [EU] and Israel was the main subject of the talks that I have held in five European countries, including Bonn. In 1993, the Israeli trade deficit with the former European Community amounted to $4.5 billion and to $7 billion if all of Western Europe and the EFTA countries are included. We are not asking for membership, but we cannoyt tolerate discrimination on the part of the EU. [Ruehl] What do you mean by discrimination? [Rabin] For example, Siemens can make a bid for Israeli power company investment projects, but Israeli firms cannot put in bids in Germany and the EU countries in the same way. Certain community rules prevent us from being given a chance to compete fairly. The value of our exports to the United States is almost the same as that of our exports to Europe. Trade with the United States is balanced, and in addition, we receive $3 billion of U.S. foreign aid each year. We are not asking for special terms or European support, but we do insist on fair "terms of trade" with a European market open to us. We cannot demand that the Israeli people pay the price for peace if we cannot simultaneously offer prospects for positive economic development within the framework of regional cooperation with our Arab neighbors and internationally. [Ruehl] What is your view of the EU's intention of offering more funds to provide economic support for Palestinian autonomy? [Rabin] We support it. We do not want European contributions, but a significant adjustment to the foreign trade deficit with Europe through appropriate agreements with the EU. Every billion dollars that is earned in exports means between 15,000 and 20,000 jobs in Israel. A peaceful settlement for the region must also bring economic advantages to Israel. [Ruehl] What are the prospects like for extending peace to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon? [Rabin] Unfortunately, Lebanon is not prepared to take even one step unless it receives a green light from Damascus. Even Jordan is watching Damascus and waiting for a signal before it takes further steps, although we have already held negotiations. I cannot understand why the Jordanians see themselves as being dependent on the Syrians, but this is the case. As far as Syria is concerned, there is a great gulf between us. Syria has also condemned the agreement with the PLO and has not embarked on the path to peace with Israel, despite all the U.S. attempts at mediation. These U.S. efforts will continue, but I would not venture to make any predictions. However, we need a reliable peace, not just the consolidation of a truce. [Ruehl] You have only had that kind of peace with Egypt. [Rabin] President Sadat dispelled mistrust with his visit to Jerusalem. He went 90 percent of the way to convince the Israeli people that he was serious about peace. Begin only needed to go 10 percent of the way. Sadat was actively committed to peace. That is the difference between him and Al-Asad, and that is where the problems start. The questions that people in Israel ask are: We should believe him when he talks about peace, but can we believe him? [Ruehl] Do you want Al-Asad to come to the Knesset in Jerusalem like Sadat? [Rabin] I did not say that and I do not expect that. However, President Al-Asad does not have the right to demand the kind of conditions for peace of Israel that Sadat had claim to. [Ruehl] You have indicated that your government would be prepared to discuss the return of the Golan Heights to Syria during negotiations on peace and if Syria were to respond appropriately. [Rabin] I have actually said even more than that, namely, that I would be prepared to put the question of a significant withdrawal form the Golan Heights to the Israeli people in the form of a referendum, if we can draw up a sensible peace treaty with Syria. [Ruehl] That is to say, mutual conditions for the demilitarization of the border and arms controls? [Rabin] Yes, and in conjunction with normalization and a phased withdrawal over a given period of time. We must have a clear-cut border agreement and take account of the fact that in the north, vis-a-vis the Golan, Israel has no territory to withdraw into for defensive purposes and needs security.
