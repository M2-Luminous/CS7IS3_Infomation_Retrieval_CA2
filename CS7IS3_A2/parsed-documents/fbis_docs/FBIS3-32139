But the opposition Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) is already claiming the measures will fail. "Nothing in the presentation will alter the present course of the economy or halt the slide" of the dollar, insisted opposition leader Edward Seaga in response to Prime Minister Percival Patterson's address in parliament late Tuesday. Since June last year, the Jamaica dollar has slipped from what was then a relatively stable rate of 4.5 U.S. cents to just over three U.S. cents. The slide has fuelled high inflation of three percent a month in the last eight months, seriously increasing economic hardships for the majority of Jamaicans. At the same time, anti-inflationary measures by government have led to a hike in commercial interest rates to well over fifty percent, dampening the investment climate in the process. Patterson announced that in a bid to increase the flow of hard currency through the official system, unify the currency exchange rate, and reduce currency black marketeering and tourist harassment, authorised dealership in foreign exchange would be expanded in "two parts." First, a "cambio system" would be introduced, incorporating more than 100 hotels which currently buy hard currency from tourists through foreign exchange bureaux. The prime minister said that under the new system, hotels would be licensed "to buy and sell foreign exchange, 20 percent of which will be sold to the Bank of Jamaica" (central bank). Secondly, the more than 20 merchant banks operating here will be given limited foreign exchange dealer status. This will allow them to take foreign currency deposits, make foreign currency loans, borrow foreign currency abroad, and arrange foreign currency lines of credit for their customers. The merchant banks will be able to "access" the foreign currency facilities of the development credit banks to "support ... the export sector and thus improve the supply side of the economy," Patterson reported. The oil refinery, Petrojam, will also be given a limited foreign exchange license in order to meet its oil importing requirements, according to the prime minister. He stressed that with the new measures, laws against black market currency dealers would be strictly enforced. Under existing laws, people buying and selling hard currency without a permit may be subject to heavy fines or imprisonment. Patterson also announced plans to float a U.S.25 million dollar foreign exchange bond, expand the lending capacity of the Exim Bank by 50 million Jamaican dollars, lower lending rates by developing banks, and provide differential interest rates for small farmers and small businesses, in order to encourage production. He said the proceeds from the bond issue would go to the National Development Bank and the Agricultural Credit Bank for on-lending to the productive sector. Negotiations were taking place with international lending agencies including the World Bank to find "a compromise" that would allow for the differential lending rates. The various multi-lateral lending agencies on which the Jamaica economy is dependent have steadfastly opposed such measures in the past. Patterson renewed promises made to exporters last month that effective April 1, all import duties on raw materials for the export market would be removed, manufacturers would be allowed to accelerate capital depreciation of machinery over two years, and there would be a tax credit of 25 percent on the nominal value of bonus shares issued from the profits of a company, to expand its equity base. While Patterson appeared optimistic that the new measures would work and that the Jamaican economy was on track to recovery, opposition leader Seaga poured scorn on the initiatives. He said the increase of the number of dealers in the market will not increase the flow of foreign exchange into the official system but will only "ensure that there will be even more dealers" in the hunt. "What this will do is create even more pressure on the rate of exchange, as more "dogs" chase the same "bones." What the economy urgently needs is more "bones" not more "dogs," Seaga said.
