If reports in today's state-owned press are to be believed, Shehu Musa Yar'Adua was one of 23 presidential candidates disqualified from taking part in last year's presidential elections, and while he supported the scrapping the election results last June and is himself a member of a previous Nigerian military government, he is opposed to the Army's takeover last November, and it looks as if that's what got him into trouble, as Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos: [Begin recording] There is no official confirmation of General Yar'Adua's arrest, but a local newspaper in Kaduna quoted members of his family as saying that he was picked up at his residence in Kaduna on Saturday [12 February] shortly after his arrival from a business trip abroad. The federal government-owned DAILY TIMES in Lagos also reported that the general was being detained in Kaduna. Normally, the state security service does not announce arrests and detention of people. Information of such action comes from the detainee's families and, only on very few occasions, from government spokesmen. In this case, the press office at the Presidency in Abuja said this afternoon that it could neither confirm nor deny the general's arrest. Hints of possible government action against Gen. Yar'Adua were given two weeks ago by Information Minister Jerry Gana in a public speech in Makurdi. He was quoted as saying that Gen. Yar'Adua fled the country because he appreciated the consequences of the statement which he made at a press conference in Lagos. The minister described the statement as offensive. Addressing journalists in Lagos, Gen. Yar'Adua has criticized the apparently indefinite tenure of the new military regime of General Sani Abacha and suggested that it should not extend beyond this year. He also said that the forthcoming constitutional conference should be a sovereign national conference rather than one whose decisions would be subject to approval by the Provisional Ruling Council. A day after the conference, the police reminded politicians of the ban on political activities and warned them to stop making further statements on political issues or risk arrest. Gen. Yar'Adua's arrest and detention will signal to other politicians that the warning should be taken seriously. [end recording]
