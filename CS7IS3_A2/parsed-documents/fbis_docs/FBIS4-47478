Inasmuch as most advantageous is transition of noble gases to a condensed phase and among all excimer lasers these lasers emit shortest- wave radiation, lasers, the most easily achievable Xe[.sub]2[/]-laser is considered for specificity. The first problem is avoiding absorption of emission-wavelength radiation under conditions of high gas densities. The solution of this problem is based on analysis of the known structure of lower energy levels and origin of molecular luminescence bands, also helpful being the known luminescence spectrum of crystalline solid xenon at 5 K temperature. The most difficult next problem is adequate pumping of the entire solid or liquid active medium, electric-discharge pumping being preferable to inefficient pumping by another laser and difficult to arrange pumping by a lamp. The necessary conditions for attaining a homogeneous electric discharge with sufficiently high energy for excitation of Xe atoms by electron impact are established by analyzing the drift of fast excess electrons through gaseous and liquid or solid xenon with attendant elastic scattering by its atoms. As the intensity of the electric field is increased above E* ï¿½ _e_/b= 2 kV/cm for xenon (_e_- electron energy, b- mean displacement of electron prior to its thermalization), the energy lost by ``hot'' electrons during their collisions with Xe atoms is increasingly compensated by the energy imparted to the field so that the net loss becomes negligible in an electric field of intensity E > > E* (3 kV/cm for xenon). A solid Xe-laser constructed according to these guidelines has an H-form cell with already liquid xenon between two plane mirrors parallel to its two wide walls. Two electrodes,anode and cathode, are lining the cell wall on opposite sides along the narrow middle segment so as to produce a transverse electric discharge through xenon within this segment. No electron multiplication takes place in this system and use of an external electron source is inconvenient. Instead, for sustaining the discharge, the metal cathode is covered with a layer of a radioactive target material and a photoemissive coating of a high-yield (low work function) material on top. This ensures an electron avalanche by chain multiplication and thus makes it very likely feasible to build 30 kW lasers emitting ultraviolet radiation in pulses of up to 1 ms duration with an up to 30 % efficiency, not only Xe- lasers (172 nm) but also Kr-lasers (145 nm) and Ar-lasers (128 nm).
