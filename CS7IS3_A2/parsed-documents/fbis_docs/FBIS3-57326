The head of cabinet stressed that "we shall not deviate from the course we have chosen." Viktor Chernomyrdin assessed positively the "serious and substantial talks" which took place in Orel today both on the region's problems and the economic and political state of affairs in Russia as a whole. Summing up the results of 1993, the head of government annnounced that Gross Domestic Product last year fell by 12 percent as against 19 percent in 1992 and industrial output by 16 percent in comparision with 22 percent in 1992. Viktor Chernomyrdin stated that "the overall volume of trade grew considerably." The population's money income in real terms, according to him, grew by 10 percent in comparison with 1992. The average monthly rate of inflation fell from 26 percent in January 1993 to 12 percent in December. However, there was a considerable growth in the rate of inflation at the beginning of this year. Chernomyrdin said also that "everything the government does is toward implementation of its program, which is tightly linked to maximum restraint of inflation." The head of the Cabinet announced that budget expenditure for the first quarter of 1994 has been held at the level of the fourth quarter of last year. Spending items will be financed as and when revenues are received by the federal budget. He also announced that four trillion rubles have been earmarked in the first quarter of 1994 to pay off the state's most outstanding debts to the agro-industrial, defense and some other sectors. "We must not allow this money to go solely on wages or on financing dubious measures or organizations", he stressed. Chernomyrdin set out the government's primary economic goal in 1994: "Not to accept any impossible commitments." The premier hinted that if the required finance is not available then the state will have to refuse to carry out some decisions reached earlier at federal level. Chernomyrdin then spoke of the need for a thorough reform of the social sphere by way of rational use of state resources. He stressed in particular the need to strengthen financial stability in the country with a sensible and effective investment policy. "In this, I see one of the principal ways of achieving a sounder budget," Chernomyrdin remarked. Speaking at the gathering, one of the main aims of which was to resolve problems of food supplies and development of agriculture in Russia's central oblasts, the premier said that he had adopted a decision yesterday to issue 2.3 trillion rubles to the agro-industrial complex in the first quarter of 1994. "The government has supported and will continue to support agriculture in the country".
