FR940323-0-00099 FR940323-0-00024 OPM does not publish all of the raw data collected in the survey because of the tremendous volume of data. As Runzheimer stated in its report, over 16,000 price quotes were collected. The report, however, provides detailed information on the results of the survey. In addition, OPM provides to those who request it additional data to the extent authorized under the Freedom of Information Act. One commenter referred to the confidentiality statement on the information collection materials that was included in Appendix 5 of the report. The confidentiality statement says that the Government will hold all micro or ``raw'' data in confidence. The commenter stated that OPM should not keep secret the survey data that it collects. Runzheimer inadvertently included an obsolete version of the information collection materials in Appendix 5. This version was not used in the surveys. OPM's policy is to release ``raw'' or micro data to the extent authorized under the Freedom of Information Act. In conducting OPM's surveys, Runzheimer does not pledge to hold confidential the survey data unless such data are covered by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act that allow certain data to be held in confidence. One commenter stated that the model was inappropriate and said that OPM should measure differences in levels of living rather than differences in prices. Comparison of levels of living implies comparing lifestyles and that involves comparing differences in needs and preferences. This is a highly subjective area because one person's ``need'' might be another person's luxury. OPM is examining this complex issue and plans to include a discussion of it in its report to Congress. One commenter stated that OPM should include a component to compensate employees for the allowance area's remoteness and isolation. He suggested that 5 percentage points be added to all COLA rates to reflect intangible living costs caused by remoteness and isolation. The commenter did not provide an example of an intangible living cost. OPM does not know what the commenter meant by the term ``intangible living costs.'' The commenter may have been referring to monetary costs that are difficult to measure, or he may have been referring to nonmonetary factors, such as hardship and inconvenience. OPM believes that the COLA model adequately measures differences in monetary costs, although improvements and refinements in the model may be possible. For example, OPM is researching certain additional items, particularly those that might be purchased more frequently in remote areas. These items include air transportation, out-of-area college and university education, and extraordinary medical expenses. OPM is looking at ways the tangible cost of these items might be included in the COLA model and plans to address this issue in its report to Congress. OPM believes, however, that nonmonetary factors, such as hardship and inconvenience, should not be part of the COLA program. There are other programs that compensate Federal employees for such circumstances. One commenter maintained that an item needed in an allowance area, but not needed in Washington, DC, should be priced only in the allowance area. The commenter said that the frequency of need also should be a factor. Generally, the model compares the cost of an item in an allowance area with the cost for the same item in the DC area. OPM believes that this is consistent with the settlement of Hector Arana, et al. v. United States, in which the plaintiffs asked that OPM adopt a methodology that compared specified brands, models, and sizes whenever possible. Nevertheless, the COLA model does reflect some differences between areas. For example, the model assumes that cars in Alaska have certain accessories, such as engine block heaters, that are not common in the DC area. Also, differences in home construction (e.g., triple pane windows and greater wall insulation common in Alaska) are included in the model to the extent that these differences are reflected in real estate prices. OPM is researching related issues and plans to address them in its report to Congress. A few commenters objected to the use of national consumer expenditure patterns in the living cost model. The commenters believed that local consumption patterns should be used. More than one commenter noted that the spending pattern data were old. To compare living costs between areas, Runzheimer assigned a common set of weights to each item, category, and component. These weights reflect how consumers spend their money and were used to derive comparative indices measuring overall living costs. Runzheimer used Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) nationwide Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) data for these weights. As discussed in the report, the COLA model uses an indexing methodology similar to the Laspeyres index. As the report also notes, it would be preferable to use Washington, DC, consumer expenditure data with the Laspeyres approach. Washington, DC, CES data, however, are not available by income level, and OPM regulations require measurement of living costs at multiple income levels. On the other hand, nationwide CES data are arrayed by income level. Therefore, Runzheimer used these data in the COLA model. CES data are also available for Honolulu and Anchorage; but as with the Washington, DC, data, the Honolulu and Anchorage data are not available by income level. BLS CES data are not available for any other nonforeign area (outside the 48 contiguous States), and OPM knows of no other source of comprehensive consumer expenditure information by income level suitable for use in the COLA model. Therefore, the use of local weights is not practical. Both OPM and Runzheimer recognize that the CES data are old. OPM is developing a methodology to introduce gradually more recent CES data into the model. OPM plans to use this approach beginning with the surveys to be conducted in the summer of 1994. One commenter suggested that the COLA model be simplified to use only one income level. The commenter believed that using only one income level would reduce survey costs and the number of subjective assumptions required. As noted earlier, OPM's regulations require the measurement of living costs at multiple income levels. This approach recognizes that relative living costs may vary by income level and that the distribution of employees by income level may vary among areas. Therefore, the multiple income approach yields a more accurate measure of overall living cost differences than a single income approach. Nevertheless, to the extent that multiple income levels require additional subjective assumptions, the overall integrity of the model might not be impaired by using a single income level. OPM is examining this issue and plans to include its findings in the report to Congress. One commenter objected to Runzheimer's recommendation that OPM include income taxes in the COLA model. The commenter believed that this would unduly complicate the model and argued that it would also be necessary to compare the level of government services available in each area. Another commenter, however, stated that income taxes were high in Hawaii and recommended that income taxes be included in the model.
