After a meeting of environment-related ministers presided over by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, the government said it would adopt as the Korean Standard (KS) to the norms on environmental management of the International Standardization Organization (ISO) which will be completed by 1996. The government also decided to join the convention on biological diversity which has been in effect since last December, the Montreal Protocol and the Copenhagen Protocol or the Amendment to the Montreal protocol in the first half of this year. The ministers said the country should join by May 15 the second term (July 1994-June 1997) Global Environment Facility (GEF), which was established with the aim of preventing global warming, protecting the ozone layer and world water resources, and preserving the diversity of species. To that end, the government decided to contribute 5.6 million dollars to the GEF. In another effort to prepare for the upcoming Green Round negotiations, the government drew up a plan to reinforce the activities of "the task force for the international environmental management standards" set up at the Korea Employers' Association (KEA). The government hopes that the task force's activities would lead industries to seek environment management systems. Concerned that perhaps South Korea, sandwiched between the developed and developing countries, may not make itself heard, the ministers who attended the meeting agreed to carry out aggressive diplomacy to defend Seoul's interests during the Green Round negotiations. The ministers also agreed to minimize trade regulations imposed in the name of environmental protection, given that free trade serves the causes of the world trade organization. In addition, they decided to host the first intergovernmental meeting sponsored by the United Nations Emvironment Program (UNEP) to enhance cooperation in Northeast Asia. North Korea will also be invited to the meeting. To join in global efforts to protect wild animals, the ministers will establish laws banning the sale of tiger bones and tiger-bone medicines by October this year. Moreover, some 10 billion won will be provided to businesses for the establishment of recycling facilities and waste storage centers.
