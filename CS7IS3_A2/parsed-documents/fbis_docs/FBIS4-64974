That is what the first stage of the government formation is all about. The art for all involved is to keep their options open, while the others show their true colors. The recommendations to the Queen from the leaders of the four principal parties all perfectly respect this approach. The job of Tjeenk Willink, charged by the Crown to investigate whether a proposed government formation will succeed, is to try and read between the lines and, above all, proceed with extreme caution. It all in fact revolves around the color purple. The only party to clearly come out in favor of a "purple" coalition [comprising the PvdA [Labor Party], the D66 [Democrats 66], and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] is the D66, the big election winners. The PvdA and the VVD are not going any further for the moment than to say that they do not rule out such a coalition. Both of them are also keeping their options open to enter into a coalition that includes the CDA [Christian Democrat Party]. So far the positions adopted are just as inflexible as they were before the election. Tjeenk Willink can now try to make them more flexible in order to establish which coalition option should be the first to be investigated. In other words: Which three parties will be the first to sit down at the negotiating table. If that is indeed the PvdA, the VVD and the D66, then it will be the first time since 1918 that the CDA has not been involved in forming a government. But it takes some time and explaining to set aside around 75 years of history. This is why it was decided to appoint Tjeenk Willink in order to consider which coalition possibilities are worth subsequently exploring. His mission is limited and he is under no obligation to do very much. He must simply consider "which possibilities exist, on the basis of the election results, for the formation of a government which can count on fruitful cooperation with the parliament. He also has to prioritize the coalitions possibilities and see what method of investigating offers the best prospects of quickly forming such a government." The key word here is prioritize. For D66 leader Van Mierlo, this prioritization is clearly established. He is the only one to have expressed before the elections a clear preference for a coalition consisting of his own party together with the PvdA and the VVD. Not out of an anti-CDA feeling, as he stressed again yesterday, but because a genuine alternative government is in the interests of a healthy democracy. But do the other partners needed to form a "purple" coalition share this opinion? PvdA leader Kok was still keeping his options open in yesterday's recommendation. In any event, he wants a government founded upon a "progressive basis." This would have to be formed by the PvdA and the D66. Whether or not they should be joined by the CDA or the VVD depends on the agreement which can be reached on the government program. VVD leader Bolkestein wants his own party and the D66, the two election winners, to be included in the new government. Whether the third party is to be the CDA or the PvdA would also depend for Bolkestein on the agreed government program. Tjeenk Willink's job is to bring an end to this policy of awaiting developments on the part of the three parties. The recommendation from CDA leader Brinkman to the Queen can be of help to him [Willink] in this respect. Brinkman stated that the first option to be investigated should be the "purple" coalition. If the negotiations between the PvdA, the VVD and the D66 fail, then the door is open for the CDA to participate in the government formation process. But in that case with one trump card: The knowledge that a coalition without the CDA is not possible. That would be a very strong negotiating position. The other parties are fully aware of this, which explains their hesitant behavior. Tjeenk Willink's mission is limited. PvdA leader Kok has spoken of a "lengthy period of consultation." At some point Tjeenk Willink will have to decide whether or not there is any point in Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo sitting down at the negotiating table. In fact it is only the first two who are really involved. It is well-known for example that Kok and Bolkestein have totally different opinions regarding the introduction of a basic social security system. Tjeenk Willink will probably not be able to avoid investigating whether or not they are prepared to come to a compromise on this. How exactly they will achieve it is then a matter for the next round of the formation process. That is the moment for CDA leader Brinkman to start getting worried. And if certain subjects remain excluded from any discussion between Kok and Bolkestein, Van Mierlo must then assess the situation.
