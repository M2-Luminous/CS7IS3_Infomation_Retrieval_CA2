The government and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating teams today approved 18 points regarding specific principles for national reconciliation. The negotiating teams today revised the document point by point because UNITA is always recanting. Thus, after verifying the document, government chief negotiator Faustino Muteka and UNITA chief negotiator Eugenio Manuvakola signed it in the presence of UN special representative Alioune Blondin Beye and the observers. The negotiating teams will now begin discussing the modalities ?ad implementation of the dossier of national reconciliation. The special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola has already delivered to the government and UNITA negotiating teams the intermediary document on the modalities and its implementation. The government and UNITA will have to react to it by 29 June. Meanwhile, the issue regarding the modalities and its implementation includes Jonas Savimbi's special status which was scheduled to be discussed in the specific principles, but at UNITA's request the document was postponed until the end. Now UNITA wants to withdraw the issue from the agenda, claiming that it is not necessary to discuss a special status for its leader, because the document on the accommodation and security of UNITA and its high officials includes Jonas Savimbi. The government has rejected this, saying that on point eight the issue only related to UNITA leaders -- that is, deputies, members of the political commission, and those who will eventually take administrative and military posts at a higher level, but Jonas Savimbi was not included. To avoid future obstacles, the government wants Jonas Savimbi's status to be discussed, because UNITA is always recanting, and one cannot withdraw a point from an agenda of negotiations as delicate as this, as UNITA intends to.
