Les Tanyuk, member of the presidium of the Supreme Council of Ukraine and of the central leadership of the Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka [Rukh], said this to a RUKH-PRESS correspondent. The act committed by Leonid Kravchuk on 14 January in Moscow did not give any advantages whatsoever to Ukraine, either in the political or the economic spheres, Les Tanyuk is convinced. By signing the Russian-U.S. categorical demands, Kravchuk proved that he can only be a sprinter but not a long-distance runner in world politics. Les Tanyuk also believes that the absence of the mechanisms of eliminating nuclear weapons in the signed trilateral statement deprives Ukraine of any guarantees of its own security. The Rukh leader stressed that the United States has again made a drastic mistake, as far as Russia is concerned. Even the outcome of the latest election did not cause the United States to refrain from supporting the imperial policy conducted by Moscow which, following the czarist and communist regimes, is now being revived under the banner of Zhyrynovshchyna [code of ideas and norms of behavior associated with Zhirinovskiy]. All this reminds Les Tanyuk of the events connected with the official recognition of the USSR by Washington in 1933, precisely when the famine in Ukraine, engineered by Moscow, was at its peak. By such dangerous actions the West is forging nails for its own crucifixion by Russian national chauvinism, Les Tanyuk emphasized.
