The delegation is headed by Mr. Petru Lucinschi, the speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, who, following the meeting with President Iliescu, made the following exclusive statement to our reporters: [Begin Lucinschi recording] First I would like to say that in my assessment we both confirmed that the relations between our countries are quite intense [relatii destul de intense], and they are developing in every way, although we cannot say that we are satisfied, we wish for more, we think that the efficiency of our relations could be even higher and better. But, currently, both our countries are in transition, in a crisis situation. Our talks concentrated on the concrete aspects of the relations between our countries. Thus, we discussed economic issues. For instance, the fact that the current emotional state and the spiritual problems -- the consequences of which may be seen in the spiritual life -- also appear in the press and in public opinion. However, little is being done to support the furthering of relations among persons, localities, and industrial or economic enterprises, by which one could solve the majority of the problems currently facing our peoples. Today we have to be realistic -- and this term was recurrent during our talks -- because if we disregard the real situation we will again end up beating the air, causing either confusion or revolt among the people. Thus, the current real situation makes it necessary for us to back all those who wish to undertake concrete things to better our relations at all levels. This was, in my opinion, the leitmotif of our talks today, and we agreed to accomplish some of the things we had previously convened. As far as state relations are concerned, indeed, sometimes we have neglected them, we had an electoral campaign, and you may have also been busy with other things, so there are such intervals that are not very intense, which is normal. However, as far as relations among persons are concerned, they are relations as among relatives, which is also normal. Besides all this, we have the relations between the businessmen, and here we have to establish a better social-economic framework for our future cooperation. [end recording]
