[Szeremietiew] It most certainly does. People need to have this option open to them. This is attested to by the more than 2 million votes cast in favor of the right-wing and center parties in the latest parliamentary election. Over the past 50 years, Poland engaged in a left-wing rule experiment, and now we must move away from that. All over the world, the left-wing orientation is being exposed as a false direction these days. I believe that what Poland needs today is not only a right-wing party but also a sorting out of the entire political scene. This process has already begun. Before long, only a few large, significant parties will be left in our country. These will most probably be the Union of Labor, the Freedom Union, a peasant party, a center-right movement, and an extreme right-wing party. I am an optimist but the kind of optimist who always considers coolly all of the pros and cons of any given situation. I believe Poland will win. [Stecki] What was the chief reason for the split within the Movement for the Republic [RdR] group? [Szeremietiew] Before the latest parliamentary election, I was largely viewed as a defeatist and a panicmonger by my RdR colleagues. I maintained that we should either put all of our money on one horse and devote our election campaign exclusively to high-power promotion of the RdR or, if we plan to form a coalition, do it decisively and unconditionally, even if it means deciding not to put up RdR candidates to run side by side with the other partners' candidates on the joint election lists. However, as it turned out, the RdR aimed its campaign moves in all directions, and it ended in disaster. When it came to electing new RdR authorities, it turned out that my concept was the correct one. [Stecki] To what extent has the RdR changed since you became its chairman? [Szeremietiew] Its leadership functions differently now, and we cooperate with the media better than before. Jan Olszewski was against all unification moves, whereas today the RdR conducts unification negotiations, and we are already close to finalizing them and calling into being a center-right confederation. The character of the party has changed, too. Today we focus first of all on promoting the economy and the younger cadres, who are needed by Poland today. [Stecki] You have mentioned a planned unification of the center and right groups. On what plane do you envisage it? [Szeremietiew] On the program-formulating and organizational plane. We have analyzed the programs of our prospective partners and found that there are no points there that could not be coordinated. Whenever, during our talks, we arrive at a point at which differences in details could spoil everything, we interrupt the course of the negotiations. In other words, details must not be allowed to overshadow the more basic concepts. As far as organizational matters are concerned, we believe that party structures should cooperate among themselves, first in selecting and nominating joint candidates to the Sejm and then in selecting and nominating the right-wing group's candidate to the office of president. [Stecki] Is there room for Olszewski's adherents in the future confederation? [Szeremietiew] Of course. The entire problem is caused by the unfortunate fact that people do not understand that there are certain rules to be observed in such situations and that people who have lost an election do not necessarily have to take umbrage. I do not feel personally insulted by my opponents when they accuse me of usurping my present position, but I am surprised that, in their defeat, they were unable to resort to democratic procedures and thereby improve their positions. Once they regain their composure, they will realize that there are no objections to their joining us in the confederation. [Stecki] Is the proposal submitted by Professor Rafal Krawczyk, your plenipotentiary for the economic program, that stipulates that you attack Polish bureaucracy through the universal privatization scheme intended also as yet another tool in the decommunization campaign? Or does the RdR have some other plans in this sphere? [Szeremietiew] Of course we do. However, the principal objectives of privatization are quite different: to enhance the numerical strength of the middle layer of society--that is, the group of private owners. I personally do not like the word "decommunization" because its meaning has become too diluted by propaganda. I prefer the term "de-Sovietization." It is de-Sovietization that should be carried out in our armed forces so that they cease to resemble the Soviet Army in its structure and its philosophy. However, de-Sovietization implies predominantly a return to national values and a deliberate scattering of cliques and exclusive interest groups. To this we should add revised tax and criminal legislation. [Stecki] Prof. Krawczyk talks about the significance of a national identity in both our economy and politics. How does that relate to Poland's plans to join European structures? [Szeremietiew] As I said earlier, we should foster a return to national values in Poland. Indeed, these values should be a matter of priority to politicians. This actually ties in with the concept of our joining Europe. Here we have two options to consider. The first is the Gaullist option, which envisages a Europe of fatherlands, or national communities preserving their individual national identities. The second is the attempt to create a European union of supranational institutions--and that is unacceptable to us. In many countries, people protest against it already because they understand only too well that such a leftist concept carries with it a distinct whiff of large-scale bureaucracy. We believe that Poles will be the more European the more they are allowed to remain Polish. [Stecki] Can you list for us the mistakes the RdR has made to date? [Szeremietiew] First of all, we must appreciate that all of the movements that fought for Poland's independence stopped the struggle and rested on their laurels far too early after 1989. They all believed that because communism was no more everything else would take care of itself automatically. As regards the RdR, I must admit that we did not make optimal use of the opportunity to create a mass-membership party, when, following the collapse of our government, so many people came to RdR headquarters. We did not seize the chance to use the RdR parliamentary party as a perfect propaganda tool--which the Union of Real Politics did so brilliantly with its own parliamentary caucus. Finally, there is the question of the latest parliamentary election. We failed to form a coalition then, despite having a perfect opportunity to do just that. [Stecki] Thank you for talking to us.
