FR940620-2-00069 FR940620-2-00042 Finally, based on representations from the CBOE, the Commission believes that the CBOE and Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') will have adequate systems processing capacity to accommodate FLEX Options containing a contract term relating to settlement currency. 19 In addition, OPRA has represented that any additional traffic generated by the CBOE's proposal is within OPRA's capacity. 20 19 See letter from Charles J. Henry, President and Chief Operating Officer, CBOE, to Francois Mazur, Attorney, Options Branch, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated May 23, 1994. 20 See letter from Joseph P. Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Bill Barclay, CBOE, dated May 23, 1994. IV. Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the Act, and, in particular, Sections 6 and 11A of the Act. In addition, the Commission also finds, pursuant to Rule 9b&hyph;1 under the Act, that FLEX Options with a contract term relating to settlement currency are standardized options for purposes of the options disclosure framework established under Rule 9b&hyph;1. 21 21 17 CFR 240.9b&hyph;1 (1993). As part of the original approval process of the FLEX Options framework, the Commission delegated to the Director of the Division the authority to authorize the issuance of orders designating securities as standardized options pursuant to Rule 9b&hyph;1(a)94) under the Act. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31911 (February 23, 1993), 58 FR 11792 (March 1, 1993). On May 4, 1993, then-Chairman Richard Breeden, pursuant to Public Law 87&hyph;592, 76 Stat. 394 [15 U.S.C. 78d&hyph;1, 78d&hyph;2], and Article 30&hyph;3 of the Commission's Statement of Organization; Conduct and Ethics; and Information and Requests [17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3], designated that persons serving in the position of Deputy Director, Associate Director, and Assistant Director in the Division be authorized to issue orders designating securities as ``standardized options'' pursuant to Rule 9b&hyph;1(a)(4). Accordingly, this subdelegation provides the Division with the necessary authority for designating FLEX Options with contract terms that may vary with respect to certain specified foreign currencies as ``standardized options.'' See Designation of Personnel to Perform Delegated Functions in the Division of Market Regulation, dated May 4, 1993. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 22 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;33) is approved. 22 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 23 23 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
