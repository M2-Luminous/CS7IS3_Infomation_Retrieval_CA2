In December they had time to resign themselves to the latest surprise, and not the most painful: under the new television broadcasting schedules, television channels have been working only from 1800 until midnight on working days. Broadcasting resumed in full in the New Year, but it turns out that viewers' rejoicing was premature. This was just a small Christmas present, and the restrictions come back into force on 10 January. Naturally the official reason remains the same: the shortage of electric power. However, local authorities in certain regions do not conceal their own view on the matter, using figures to prove how small the savings have been as a result of these restrictions and describing them as primarily a political move.
