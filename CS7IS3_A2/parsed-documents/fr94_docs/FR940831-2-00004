FR940831-2-00004 FR940831-2-00002 Northwest Baranof Timber Sale(s), Tongass National Forest, Chatham Area, Sitka Ranger District, Sitka, AK AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Revise the July 12, 1993 notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental impacts of proposed actions within the Northwest Baranof project area. This notice is an amendment to the original notice of intent for this project, published July 12, 1993. The proposed action provides for: (1) Construction of approximately 28 miles of new road, and reconstruction of approximately 7 miles of existing road in conjunction with up to seven timber sales; (2) harvest of approximately 1,800 acres of timber, and regeneration of new stands of trees. This level of development would result in the harvest of approximately 58 million board feet of sawlog and utility timber volume; (3) 1,000 foot uncut timber buffers along Nakwasina Passage, St. John Baptist Bay, and the north side of Fish Bay for the protection of wildlife and subsistence uses; (4) log transfer facilities in Nakwasina Passage and Nakwasina Sound, St. John Baptist Bay (barge facility), Schulze Cove, and Rodman Bay; (5) no clearcut harvest in areas which are visible from the Alaska Marine Highway route (6) no harvest in VCU 289 or 290; and (7) no harvest in the Rodman Creek drainages and limited harvest in Fish Bay drainage. The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State and local agencies as well as individuals and organizations who may be interested in, or affected by, the proposed action. DATES: Comments concerning the scope of the analysis should be received in writing by October 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Northwest Baranof Planning Team, USDA Forest Service, 204 Siginaka Way, Sitka, Alaska 99835. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gordon Anderson, Team Leader, USDA Forest Service, 204 Siginaka Way, Sitka, AK 99835, (907) 747&hyph;6671. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This EIS will tier to the 1979 Tongass Land Management Plan (TLMP) EIS, including the 1985&hyph;86 and 1990 amendments. The TLMP provides the overall guidance (Goals, Objectives, Standards, and Management Area direction) to achieve the desired future condition for the area in which the project is proposed. The Northwest Baranof Project Area is located about 10 air miles north of Sitka, Alaska, and 30 miles east of Angoon, Alaska, on the northwestern part of Baranof Island. It encompasses ten Value Comparison Units (VCUs) including 287 through 292, 299, 301, and portions of 300 and 302 as designated in the TLMP. These VCUs are located within Management Areas C40 and C41 as described in the TLMP. VCUs 310, 312, and 313 were dropped from the project area following initial field review. The project area is administered by the Sitka Ranger District of the Chatham Area, Tongass National Forest in Sitka, Alaska. The purpose and need for the Northwest Baranof project is to make 30&hyph;100 million board feet of timber available through up to seven independent timber sales or offerings to the Ketchikan Pulp Company under the conditions of its long-term timber sale contract. This timber is needed to provide a sustained level of wood products to meet local, national, and international demand; and to provide local employment in the wood products industry. A comparison of the desired future condition for the project area (as identified in the TLMP) with the existing condition shows the need to convert suitable stands of old-growth timber to managed productive stands capable of long-term timber production. Gary A. Morrison, Forest Supervisor, Chatham Area, is the Responsible Official and will decide whether or not to authorize timber harvest within the Northwest Baranof Project Area. He will decide (1) If the design of the timber sale offerings are consistent with meeting resource protection standards and guidelines in the TLMP; (2) how much timber volume to make available; (3) the location and design of the arterial and collector road system needed to develop the project area; (4) the location and design of timber harvest units and log transfer facilities; (5) mitigation and monitoring measures for sound resource management; and (6) whether there may be a significant restriction on subsistence uses, and if so, other determinations required by section 810 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
