[end recording] Silva Cimma met President Patricio Aylwin for more than an hour to discuss the issue. Asked if the Argentine publication somehow constitutes undue Argentine pressure on the judges who will decide the Laguna del Desierto dispute, Silva Cimma said: [Begin Silva Cimma recording] It does not really represent pressure, perhaps a precedent. We thought it was our duty to note it officially, despite the fact that the brochure was not really published by the Argentine Government, as you all know. The document was issued by a provincial authority, the equivalent of a Chilean intendant or governor. We are investigating it. It seems that it is not even an official document but something published by the province without that character. In any case we are investigating the problem, and we already have presented a note describing the situation to the Arbitration Tribunal. [end recording] So far the government has not received any answer, which is obviously expected. [passage omitted]
