If Japan and the United States collide, not only will both nations be losers in a trade war, but the post-Cold War world economy will also fall into confusion. There is no other way but for both countries to look at the problem from a global viewpoint, aim at expanded equilibrium, and seek a solution to the impasse. U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor, who came to Japan amid the political confusion within the Hosokawa administration caused by the economic stimulation plan, stated before he left for home that "If we see no actual results, we might have to consider other options." He indicated the possibility of sanctions against Japan. Kantor thought that stubborn Japanese bureaucrats were obstructing any progress in the framework talks, and he attempted to effect a breakthrough through political consultations with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, and Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai. However, he did not succeed. The United States demands the setting of numerical targets to promote market opening in automobiles and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement. In response, Japan firmly maintains its position of rejecting such numerical targets. It is common sense in world economics that the setting of numerical targets will lead to "managed trade." Last fall, a group of key U.S. economists, including Nobel Prize awardees, issued a statement urging Japan to say "no" to U.S. demands. Recently, a group of Japanese economists also suggested that "numerical targets will promote government-guided managed trade, and constitute a basis for the theory of Japanese heresy [nihon ishitsu ron]." Numerical targets also run counter to the Hosokawa administration's goal of economic system reform. Furthermore, if Japan-U.S. trade, which ought to serve as the model in world trade, were to be managed by the government, this would negate the principles of free trade. In the final phase of the framework talks, Japan and the United States should reaffirm the principles of free trade, more than anything else. Nevertheless, it will not be good for the arguments between the two countries to just continue to go round and round in circles. Due to the gap in economic conditions, there is a strong possibility that the bilateral trade imbalance will expand even further. While the Japanese Government has indeed worked on liberalizing its market, we can hardly say the Japanese market is sufficiently open. As a nation enjoying a huge trade surplus, Japan should strive, at least, to avoid accusations that its market is closed. A number of U.S. negotiators lamented that "it is like talking to the wall." Japanese negotiators should not only argue back at U.S. demands, but should also heed the call for market liberalization humbly. Japan should come up with market opening proposals in each sector to the extent of not involving any numerical targets. For instance, a framework for private sector consultations between Japanese and U.S. automobile makers on marketing, parts supply, environmental measures, and so forth can be established. Economic stimulation measures to break out of the recession also hold the key to negotiations with the United States. Measures to expand domestic demand, such as a large-scale income tax reduction, can do much to expand the world economy and correct the trade imbalance. It is high time for the Hosokawa administration to decide on bold pump-priming measures as the trump card to correct the imbalance between Japan and foreign countries. If Japan is unable to open its market, and unable to come up with economic stimulation measures, thus leading to an expansion in the trade imbalance, this will only aggravate the pressure to appreciate the yen. This may also bring about legislation in the U.S. Congress calling for retaliation against Japan.
