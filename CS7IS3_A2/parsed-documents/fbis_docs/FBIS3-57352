In an interview published in today's KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA he notes that at the Ashgabat summit the positions of CIS countries moved closer together on all matters, notably on economic ones. Kazakhstan believes that the economies of CIS countries can be stabilized through strengthening the integration processes within the framework of the economic union, which has now been set up. Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that the introduction of individual currencies is a powerful enough impetus for the integration of Commonwealth states. He believes that at some stage a currency will emerge that will be valid in all CIS states. All problems ought to be solved in close cooperation with fellow Commonwealth members, and for Kazakhstan that means first and foremost with Russia, Nursultan Nazarbayev noted.
