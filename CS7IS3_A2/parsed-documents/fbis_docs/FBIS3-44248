Ajello said the Mozambique National Resistance has used more than 70 percent of its assembly areas, while the government has used 30 to 35 percent. At its meeting in Maputo on 27 January, the Supervision and Control Commission recommended that the government speed up the confinement of its troops and pledged the necessary logistical assistance to speed up the process. Minister Armando Guebuza said the government has not sent sufficient troops to specific assembly areas because the latter lack the technical capacity to accommodate people. He said several areas face food problems, adding that a number of technical units cannot register more than 50 people.
