Although Turkey in recent years has become one of Russia's leading partners, the protocol signed by the commission's cochairmen--Oleg Davydov, head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and Onur Kumbaracibasi, minister of Public Works and Housing--sets an increase in trade of up to $5 billion as a realistic objective. And then Turkey could catch up with and surpass America as Russia's partner. In and of itself, a trade turnover that has increased by more than 400 percent over the past eight years--and that is without counting the activities of the army of many thousands of Russian "shuttles"--attests to the successful development of commercial relations. Of course, there are problems. And everyone who has kept track of Russia's negotiations in recent years readily guesses that they consist in debts (Russia's defaulted debt amounts to $320 million). Granted, in the case of Turkey one must speak of bilateral debt: Turkey owes for the construction of the Beskamberun Metallurgical Mill (about $35 million), which was built with Russia's assistance. Yesterday Turkey proposed its option for getting out of the existing situation--to repay the Russian debt with deliveries of gas and military hardware. In particular, the proposal was to sell Ankara $60 million worth of military helicopters and $200 million worth of small arms. The interest in the Russian armaments is so great that Onur Kumbaracibasi expressed the desire to increase purchases of military equipment and armaments by an amount of up to $600 million a year. As KOMMERSANT has learned, First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets has already given his consent to the export of the small arms, and this year $60 million worth of deliveries will be made toward the repayment of Russia's debt. But by solving the debt problem this way, Russia risks acquiring a heap of unpleasantness far from Turkey's shores. The problem is that Turkey's enthusiasm for acquiring the aforementioned types of arms is directly proportionate to the intensity of Ankara's war with the Kurdish separatists, against whom the weapons are being used. The situation is a sensitive one: The FRG, under extremely strong pressure from other NATO members, recently refused Turkey precisely the types of arms in which it is interested (the pretext was that they are being used for fighting political opponents and for punitive actions against civilians). Moscow, on the other hand, while experiencing a need to increase the market for its arms, simultaneously fears NATO's negative reaction and is not especially rushing to accommodate Turkey's desires. The Kurdish problem may, however, become an obstacle to the development of one of the most promising branches of bilateral cooperation--tourism. And the possibilities here are considerable: the mild Mediterranean climate and comparatively low prices (in comparison with the resorts of France or Spain), along with first-rate service, are making Antalya, the center of Turkish tourism, for example, increasingly attractive to Russians who are not spoiled in terms of resort service. However, their mass influx onto Turkish beaches could quite possibly be prevented by considerations of personal safety. At present, for example, many foreign groups are refusing tours and reservations in prestigious hotels on the coast in connection with the step-up in terrorist activities by the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which recently declared war on tourism throughout Turkey's entire territory. Several explosions have already gone off in Istanbul (including in the famous St. Sophia's) and Antalya lately. However, tourism does not hold the leading place within the total range of economic relations between Russia and Turkey. And therefore hopes for the future are more bound up with traditional forms of cooperation, rather than with tourism. Thus, in yesterday's negotiations it was decided to raise deliveries of Russian gas to Turkey to 8 billion cubic meters a year (and by another 2.5 billion over the next two years--current deliveries are 6 billion cubic meters). It was noted that the chief problem today is transit across Ukraine, which has been pumping gas from the gas pipeline without authorization. The Turks also voiced complaints to the representatives of Gazprom [Gas Industry Joint-Stock Company] who were taking part in the negotiations regarding the price of the gas, which in their opinion is too high. The development of investment and technical cooperation also remains promising. Interest here is mutual: the Turks, who are already carrying out $2.5 billion worth of contracts in Russia, are prepared to take part in new projects (primarily in the power-engineering industries). The Russians are not lagging behind, either--the Tekhnostroyeksport Foreign Trade Association is carrying out a number of contracts in Turkey that were signed back during the time of the USSR and are connected with the electrification of a railroad and the construction of three highways near Ankara and a hydraulic engineering complex and dam. Tekhnostroyeksport views winning the Turkish market as a long-range strategy, which is especially important following Russia's loss of its former positions in Asia Minor and the Middle East. The main thing is that the Russians offer only first-class goods and services. The only problem is that, according the Viktor Velichko, chairman of the foreign trade association, the Turks are chronically late in their payments, which is interfering with the expansion of Russian firms' activities in Turkey. In the course of negotiations, the question of the shipping regime in the Black Sea straits was also raised. The Russian side insists on strict adherence to the 1936 Montreux shipping convention. Lately Ankara has been trying to restrict it under the pretext of an "environmental threat to Istanbul"--most of the freight shipped through the straits is related to the export of energy sources. And the recent collision of two tankers in the Bosporus only intensified those fears. As an alternative, the Turks are proposing to Russia to extend the oil pipeline across the bottom of the Black Sea. Moscow is prepared to consider that project, according to Oleg Davydov, minister of foreign economic relations. Some Figures on Economic Cooperation Between Russia and Turkey (Based on the Information of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations) Trade turnover: In 1993--$2 billion (with a positive Russian trade balance of more than $600 million). The increase in bilateral trade since 1986 exceeded 400 percent. Some Russian projects in Turkey: - Construction of the Pazarcik-[Karegli] gas pipeline (200 km). Estimated cost--$4.5 million; - construction of the [Komkyurler]-[Osmanis] railroad section (78 km). Estimated cost--$80 million; - modernization and expansion of the alumina and electrolysis production facilities at the Seydisehir Aluminum Mill. Estimated cost--$200 million. Turkish business activity in Russia: $2.5 billion worth of construction contracts alone have been concluded as of this time. They include a sugar refinery in Krasnodar Kray and chemical plants in Siberia, Tataria and Bashkiria. Designs are being worked up for the modernization of the petrochemical industry and airports in Tataria. Military-technical cooperation: In 1993 an agreement in principle was reached for the purchase in russia of MI-28, K-126 and K-226 helicopters and MiG-29 planes, the latest antiaircraft and armored weapons, and also small arms. $60 million worth of arms will be sold and credited toward the payment of debt to Ankara. Russia's defaulted debt to Turkey: For credits from the Turkish Export-Import Bank--$320 million. Formed as the result of the granting of two credits for $150 million each to the former USSR in 1989, and two credits for $200 million each in 1990-1991 (only $300 million of the latter was used).
