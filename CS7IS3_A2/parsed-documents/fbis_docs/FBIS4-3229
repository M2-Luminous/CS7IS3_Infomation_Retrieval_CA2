With this, Tibet has embarked on the road of administering education according to law. Tibet has made great strides in elementary education since its peaceful liberation. The school-age children's enrollment or attendance rate at the end of 1993 was 63.2 percent as against 2 percent before liberation; the illiteracy rate among young and middle-aged people dropped from 95 to 44 percent. Tibet has 3,111 primary schools with a combined enrollment of 213,777 and 71 regular secondary schools with an enrollment of 25,365. As primary education develops, an educational contingent composed mainly of Tibetan teachers has come into being and is growing continually. The number of teachers and other employees in Tibet's primary and secondary schools has risen to 12,869. Some cities and towns have, for the most part, attained the goal of universalizing primary education. Tibet, which was backward to start with and was late in starting to develop education, still lags behinds other provinces and regions. To speed up educational development in Tibet, the recently adopted "procedures for implementing the law on compulsory education" sets forth the task of implementing nine-year compulsory education in stages in a well-planned manner. The "procedures" set the requirements, steps, and measures for implementing compulsory education in Tibet and provide guidelines regarding school age, school systems, funding, teachers' qualifications, administration, evaluation, and administrative and legal liabilities, thus making it possible for Tibet's educational undertakings to develop under legal protection. Following the adoption of "procedures for implementing the law on compulsory education" by the regional people's congress, the regional people's government and educational administrative departments have also stepped up efforts in formulating rules and regulations for exercising macroadministration of education. A number of supplementary rules and regulations, including suggestions for implementing compulsory education in Tibet, regulations on decentralized administration in regard to primary education, regulations on the system of objective-based management for school years, and standards for schools of all categories at all levels will soon be promulgated for implementation.
