The Stalinist state has sped up production of steel wire and is ordering more from China and Southeast Asian countries to encircle the 746-square-kilometer "Najin-Sonbong" zone, according to the sources. Pyongyang elevated the zone last year to Najin-Sonbong city and added more land to enlarge the area from 621 square kilometers to 746 square kilometers in an ambitious move to attract foreign companies and investment. The recent attempt to isolate the zone is another concrete measure to expedite the process while preventing negative repercussions that might force an opening of North Korean society or the introduction of foreign culture, the sources said. They added that North Korea is busy obtaining all available barbed wire and has asked for a possible South Korean supply through third countries.
