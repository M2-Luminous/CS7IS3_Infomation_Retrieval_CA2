In 1993 alone, the gross amount of wages for both staff and workers in the country in 1993 increased by 22.6 percent over that in 1992. Second, with implementation of the scheme aimed at increasing wages for civil servants in government organs, payment to people working in enterprises and institutions will also increase, resulting in the growth of income. Third, with the gradual improvement of the securities markets in the country, residents investing in stocks and bonds will keep increasing and their income from this sector will increase. Fourth, people with a second job are increasing with their income earned from this additional source rapidly increasing. For this reason, the per capita income of urban residents for their living expenses will be up to RMB 2,577 in 1994 and RMB 2,933 in 1995, respective increases of 15.3 percent and 13.8 percent while the growth of their spending for living will be 13.58 percent and 12.41 percent respectively in these two years, lower than the growth of income by one to three percentage points.
