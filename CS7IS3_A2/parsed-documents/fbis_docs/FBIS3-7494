Continuation of the decade-old trade practice will not serve the interest of either Japan or the United States, International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai told a news conference. Kumagai explained that U.S.-bound Japanese auto shipments have been dwindling and stayed below annual ceilings in recent years. "The step has lost its originally intended function of easing trade friction between Tokyo and Washington," Kumagai said. The step is also against new trade frameworks established under the recently concluded general agreement on tariffs and trade (GATT), Kumagai said. Kumagai said Japan's auto exports to the U.S. are on the decline due to increased production by Japanese makers at their U.S. plants in the wake of the yen's appreciation against the dollar in recent years. Improving performances of U.S. carmakers have also helped prevent robust sales in the U.S. of Japanese cars as seen 10 years ago, Kumagai said. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) introduced annual ceilings on U.S.-bound Japanese car shipments in fiscal 1981 as a tool to correct huge trade imbalance lopsidedly in favor of Tokyo. In the first six years, export records totaled exactly the same amount as respective year's ceiling that was set at 1.68 million vehicles in the first year, reflecting brisk sales of Japanese cars in the U.S. But exports began dropping in fiscal 1987, affected by successive launches of local production by Japanese makers via transplants. As a result, shipments have been below set limits in the past six years, despite a cut to 1.65 million vehicles in ceilings in fiscal 1992 compared with a peak ceiling of 2.3 million vehicles during fiscal 1985-1991. In fiscal 1992, exports totaled 1.57 million vehicles against the 1.65 million ceiling. For the current year, shipments are expected to stand at 1.39 million units, also falling short of the 1.65 million ceiling, MITI said. The current voluntary restraint arrangement expires Thursday. Kumagai said the MITI decision is in line with the global trade accord calling for terminating practices such as voluntary export restraints within four years. Under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks concluded in December, GATT member countries basically agreed to regard voluntary export restraints as "gray areas" under GATT provisions and scrap them eventually. Industry sources said the MITI decision reflects the ministry's judgment that Washington sees no further need for auto export restraints. The sources pointed to remarks recently made by U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, who said it would be "a waste of time" for Tokyo to think that keeping the restraints would appease Washington in trade disputes. The Japanese voluntary auto export restraints began in 1981 at the request of Washington at a time when U.S. automakers were experiencing strong competition from Japanese makers that shipped a flood of small cars to the U.S. market in the wake of the outbreak of the first oil crisis in 1978.
