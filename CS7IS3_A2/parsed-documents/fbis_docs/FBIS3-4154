The mission, which includes about 30 business people, is led by Canadian Minister for International Trade Roy MacLaren. The entrepreneurs represent such industries as telecommunications, power generation and aerospace. MacLaren is the first Canadian cabinet minister to visit China since the Liberal Party assumed power. "Asia-Pacific is the most dynamic region in the world today, with average annual growth rates between 6 and 9 percent," the minister said before he left for China. After leaving China on Thursday, MacLaren will visit South Korea and Japan. "China, South Korea and Japan are among Canada's top six trading partners, together accounting for $20.3 billion worth of trade with Canada," he said. "Increasing trade and investment with these countries is of vital importance to economic growth and job creation in Canada." Canada's Power Corp and two other companies have joined hands to set up a special $1 billion fund for power projects in China. Canada has also pledged to provide China with close to $2 billion worth of loans, at favourable terms, for its postal service, telecommunications hydraulic power stations, petrochemicals, paper-making and urban construction. By September 1993, Canada had promised to invest $1.4 billion in 1,321 projects in China. But the actual amount spent was only $177 million. China's actual investment in Canada amounted to $400 million by the end of last year. Sui Hui, an official in the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec), said MacLaren's visit will send bilateral trade and investment to new highs. On his visit, MacLaren will confer with Moftec Minister Wu Yi. Wu has expressed hopes that Canada could increase its investment in China, which is attracting more capital from many other countries and regions. Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju has noted that the city approves an average of two foreign-funded projects per day, but so far only one Canadian company has invested in the city. Bruised by competition from other international corporations, Canada's Northern Telecom, which has sales of $300 million in China, is negotiating for a joint venture with a Chinese partner in Guangdong Province. But the details weren't available. The Quorum Co, which helps finance smaller Canadian enterprises that want to enter China's hi-tech markets, is scheduled to open investment forums in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in the summer . Sui Hui, the Moftec official, said Canada is China's 13th largest trading partner, with $2.57 billion in bilateral trade in 1993.
