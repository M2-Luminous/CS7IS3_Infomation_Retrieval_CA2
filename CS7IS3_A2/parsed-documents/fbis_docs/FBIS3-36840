In an interview with Interfax he said that if today the Chechen leadership had wished, under Moscow pressure, to re-enter the Russian Federation, the "Chechen people would not have understood it." If Moscow recognizes Chechnya's right to independence which it proclaimed two and a half years ago, "we shall remain good friends with Russia," said Yusef. He believes that economics may be the basis for any political dialogue, including between Groznyy and Moscow. He said that the prospects for a political dialogue must lead to such dialogue. Yusef said that the need for the earliest settlement of relations with Russia was the reason for the Chechen president's refusal to visit the United States "at the invitation of the American side." The minister did not specify who precisely invited Dudayev.
