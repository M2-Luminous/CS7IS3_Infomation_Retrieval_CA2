Eight years have passed since the day of the tragedy that affected not only all of Ukraine, but, as we now know, the entire planet. Much has been said about Chernobyl, but not everything. As chairman of the Kiev Oblast Executive Committee at the time, you took part in liquidating the effects of the accident from the very first day. However, in all these years, you have virtually kept silent, only rarely referring to your participation. In light of all that we now know about Chernobyl and in light of the office that you held, is it not time to return to those days in April of 1986? [Plyushch] I remember the first fire I ever saw. This was after the war, and it was my aunt's house that was burning. The memory of that fire has stayed with me all my life. Since that time, I have known the rules at work at a fire. First, there is the superstitious belief that you must not take anything from the site of the fire because it brings bad luck. Second, people rush to a fire to help: to carry water, or to beat down the fire, but not to stand by and pass judgment. And no one I knew ever bragged that he had done the most to put out a fire. In other words, when that terrible Chernobyl fire, that global catastrophe, broke out, the first thing we had to do was to put it out. I think that everything that has been said and written about Chernobyl consists of first impressions and does not tell the whole truth. These things do not begin to explain the real meaning of Chernobyl, why it happened, and what needs to be done to make sure that nothing like it ever happens again. [Mykhaylenko] Do you believe that the whole truth will be told in our generation's lifetime? [Plyushch] That will depend on the direction in which our society moves. If it evolves in the direction set down in the Declaration on the State Sovereignty of Ukraine, I am certain that we will still have the opportunity to say and write and hear the whole truth. Above all, about the real causes and effects of this accident. I urge you to read Vitaliy Sklyarov's book, And Tomorrow There Was Chernobyl. I wrote a foreword to the book, in which I stressed the service that Sklyarov performed by describing the Chernobyl problems. As a citizen and a professional, as a person who was in Chernobyl from the very beginning, he told the truth. We were there together, getting covered with radioactive dust together and washing it off together at the bathhouse of the rayon electric power system. [Mykhaylenko] Perhaps I was not completely accurate when I said that you have kept silent all these years. Undoubtedly, many people remember the speech you made at a session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 16 February 1990 during the discussion about the ecological situation in Ukraine. You spoke of Chernobyl in a way that none of the party or state leaders of the time dared to speak. In effect, you accused the then existing system from a high tribune of causing Chernobyl to happen. Were you not afraid to say this at the time? [Plyushch] After a tragedy of that magnitude, after everything I had seen and experienced firsthand at Chernobyl, there was nothing left to fear. Following a meeting of the Government Commission in Chernobyl that ended in the early hours of 1 May 1986, I had to return to Kiev because a blood test showed that the dose of Roentgens I had received exceeded acceptable levels. Shcherbyna, the commission's chairman, surprised me by saying to me: "Ivan, you have turned out to be a weakling." Not understanding the real meaning of his words, I took his remark as a verdict that meant the end of me. By fall, my blood had returned to normal, and on 15 September I took up the watch a second time, this time to put the ill-fated third reactor in service. It had to be put into operation by the October anniversary celebrations no matter what. To make it appear as if nothing had actually happened at Chernobyl. Thus, anyone who experienced Chernobyl firsthand, anyone who went through the hell there, has nothing left to fear... [Mykhaylenko] Let us return to your speech at the session. You said: "The Chernobyl accident was not an elemental calamity. There are specific culprits involved who should pay for the losses they caused." You then went on to name those responsible for the accident: the specific Union ministries and departments -- the Ministry of the Nuclear Power Industry, the Ministry of Energy, and the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Did these entities ever attempt to compensate the losses they caused, be it even partially? [Plyushch] If we had lived in a civilized, rule-of-law state, then the departments which had run the nuclear power station for many years and earned large profits from it would have been compelled to pay for the losses. But the situation was quite different in the society in which we then lived. Although it was operated under Kiev's jurisdiction for the benefit of the whole Union and a number of foreign countries, the station did not contribute a single kopeck into the oblast budget. The local authorities had to carry out the station management's demands unconditionally and provide everything that was necessary for the maintenance of its personnel. We were all the station's drudges -- the Prypyat city authorities, the oblast authorities, and even the republican government. Even Kiev had no jurisdication over the Chernobyl AES. The station's managers feared only the Central Committee, because this body could expel them from the CPSU and that meant that it would take a long time to find another job. They disregarded all other authority. When we were in the former Union, we worried where to get the one billion karbovantsi we needed to provide medical care for the residents of Kiev Oblast and to meet the needs of public education. This program cost 1.7 billion karbovantsi in the prices of the time. For a long time, we did not know where this money would come from. But when the Chernobyl disaster occurred, just in 1986 alone, close to 9 billion karbovantsi disappeared seemingly without a trace to cover the costs of liquidating the effects of the accident. For that, the money was found... But that was for putting out the fire as soon as possible. Thus, no one in Ukraine believed that anyone would compensate us for the losses we had suffered. Although the economy of the former Union was strong, and it was easier to liquidate the effects of the accident then than it is now. Ukraine's national economy is only rising to its feet, whereas, according to our modest and far from complete estimates, the work that needs to be done requires over 15 percent of the budget annually. This would be too much to handle even for developed countries. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the people who suffered losses and for whom the state is unable to show the concern they deserve. No matter how difficult things are for them, I ask them to be patient and be assured that as the national economy grows, the appropriations for their needs will also grow. Because it is hopeless to count on any significant aid from the outside world at this time. Of course, the European and world community, which is showing some interest in providing humanitarian assistance in liquidating the effects of the accident, could do more to help us in our trouble... [Mykhaylenko] At that same session, you spoke of the need for an integrated state program involving large-scale scientific, medical, and socioeconomic measures. How urgent are these problems today, eight years later? [Plyushch] Just as urgent as they were then. This program was developed and is being implemented. But we lack the funds to finance it adequately. I was present at a meeting of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg when they discussed the safety of the population that had suffered the effects of the Chernobyl catastrophe. Leading specialists from the International Atomic Energy Agency had prepared a thick volume of documents. But in their speeches, they argued that no definite conclusions had been reached whether, for example, it is safe for children to live in Kiev. I said to them: "There are nearly 70 of you here, discussing a painful issue. After listening to the experts, you have reached the conclusion that science has so far not demonstrated that living in Kiev poses a danger to children. Yet we have no idea how this will affect their health in the future. Which of you will volunteer to go and live there yourself or send his children?" Everyone present at the meeting smiled sadly. I then said to them: I beg you not to draw any more such conclusions, because they are inhuman and cruel. Just because there is no money for financing assistance at this time does not mean that we need to prove that this program is unnecessary. No, we need to make an effort and look for funds. I believe that our public organizations need to be more persistent in their appeals to developed European countries and to other countries of the world for help -- at least in providing medical treatment for children. [Mykhaylenko] Four years ago you said that sympathy had been dulled for people who require maximum consideration and kindness. Has this insensitivity not increased even further with time? [Plyushch] We have been brought up in the spirit of conducting campaigns. There were sowing campaigns, harvesting campaigns, meetings, celebrations, anniversaries, etc. And once these were over, we forgot about them. But Chernobyl is the kind of tragedy that only grows more painful with time. Even back then, in 1986, not all of those who should have been sensitive to human pain by virtue of the offices they held exhibited such sensitivity. Only some five months after the accident, they were forcing us to return the people evacuated from 14 settlements to their homes. We returned people to two villages, but not the rest. I was crucified for this by high-ranking officials. I remember Col. Gen. Kozlov, who insisted at the time: "The commission members have already drunk water from the well, and yet you keep putting off bringing the people back into the zone." I told him: "We will not send the people back until we are sure that it is safe for them to live there." And we did not bring them back... Naturally, all wounds heal with time. But Chernobyl is not an ordinary wound. This is the first wound of its kind in the history of mankind. It will hurt even more, and it will fester. Most radioactive elements need dozens of years to decay. The results will be known in about seventy or eighty years. It is our unlucky lot to be hostages of the atom, to be subjects of the largest ever experiment -- to determine the effects of radiation on man and on the rising generation. The tragic experience of Ukraine, which has been burned by nuclear fire, is not solely our internal affair. To survive, mankind must master the lessons of Chernobyl. [Mykhaylenko] Yes, Chernobyl is a phenomenon of worldwide significance. But in all likelihood Ukraine will be left to fight its aftermath on her own. Speaking at the UN conference on the environment and development in Rio de Janeiro on 12 June 1992, you urged: "Let us make of Chernobyl a sphere of global partnership and joint actions to decontaminate the destroyed reactor at the Chernobyl AES, to decontaminate large territories of land and water sources, to bury the radioactive wastes, and to solve the painful human problems resulting from this catastrophe." There was also an appeal from the president of Ukraine to create an International Chernobyl Fund. Did the world hear these appeals? [Plyushch] I have not missed a single opportunity when travelling abroad to broach some aspect of the Chernobyl problem. Just as I did at the international environmental forum in Rio de Janeiro, which was attended by representatives from 118 countries. These included such prominent world leaders as Bush, Major, Demirel, Mitterand, Castro... I cannot say that the world has remained indifferent. We received assistance. Although it was not always used in the best way possible. But these issues need to be repeated and raised at every European and world meeting in order to draw public attention to Chernobyl so that the world not grow complacent. I would like to say some kind words about Cuba. This country is going through a difficult time. But the old popular saying still holds: a poor man is more generous. Cuba has assisted Ukraine in the past and is still providing assistance in the form of medical treatment for our children. We are sincerely grateful for this. I do not want to say that the rich are not helping, but their possibilities are much greater than Cuba's. [Mykhaylenko] You stated that humanitarian aid is not always used in the best way. [Plyushch] Our legislation requires that all aid be distributed under public supervision. The public organizes unions and elects the leaderships of these unions. When any kind of abuse is discovered, we look for someone in these unions to put things in order. These public organizations and the leaders of these organizations must be held accountable for any abuses that occur. [Mykhaylenko] Such expressions as "before Chernobyl" and "after Chernobyl" have become part of popular usage. Just as once we had "before the war" and "after the war." What does this boundary mean to you personally? [Plyushch] In my mind, this boundary has two dimensions. The first is that nuclear energy is a Satanic form of energy. I am convinced that Ukraine has not exploited all her available natural resources in order to not have dangerous nuclear reactors on her territory. Chernobyl was like a cold shower that sobered us up. If it had not brought us to our senses, there would be new reactors and nuclear power plants going up in hernobyl, Crimea, and other places. In Odessa, there were plans to heat buildings using water from the nuclear heat and power station. Anatoliy Petrovych Aleksandrov used to say: the time is not far off when even peasant houses will be heated with nuclear fuel. Thank God that we never got that far. The second dimension is that we feel the breath of Chernobyl every day on our health... [Mykhaylenko] Speaking of global problems, it would be interesting to hear more of your firsthand impressions of the events in which you were personally involved during those terrible days. [Plyushch] I heard the news of the accident at two o'clock in the morning at my dacha. They telephoned to tell me that a fire had broken out at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. It just so happened that a civil defense exercise had been planned for the next morning throughout the oblast! I thought that perhaps the telephone call was part of the exercise, and so I rang the oblast administration of internal affairs. They confirmed that there had indeed been a fire at the fourth reactor but that the fire brigades had arrived and the fire had been put out. When I arrived at the oblast executive committee, I called the civil defense headquarters. They informed me that they were determining the scope of the fire and the degree of danger. At seven o'clock in the morning, we were gathered together by the first secretary of the oblast party committee and assigned our tasks in the planned civil defense exercise. Carrying out my assignment, I started out for the rayon where the reserve administration center was located. Instead of going to Chernobyl, we traveled in the opposite direction. When I reached Kaharlyk, I received a message that Shcherbyna, the chairman of the Government Commission, and other commission members were flying out of Moscow, and that I had been included in this group and should return immediately [to Kiev], meet them at the airport, and accompany them to the zone of the accident. I did as ordered. From Zhulyany to Chernobyl, I rode in the same car with Academician Valeriy Oleksandrovych Lehasov, Borys Yevdokymovych Shcherbyna -- God rest their souls -- and Mykola Fedorovych Nikolayevych, the deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of Ukraine. In Prypyat, we familiarized ourselves with the situation. At seven o'clock that evening, we held the first meeting of the Government Commission. Shcherbyna reported to the highest leadership in Moscow that everything was normal, that the people were reacting normally, that several weddings had been held. At the same time, just in case, preparations were being made to evacuate the residents. Unfortunately, we were lying to ourselves and to the people. Not deliberately lying. Incidentally, the evacuation was conducted not because of radioactive contamination or radiation, but in case the reactor should explode. If there had been complete certainty that it would not explode, there probably would have been no evacuation. This tragedy, more than anything, showed the "advantages" of our administrative-command, totalitarian system. On the one hand, a crudely low standard of technical design and equipment, and, on the other hand, a wholly unwarranted lack of concern and an irresponsible attitude towards people. Had anyone known that the time would come when they would be held responsible, no one would have built such stations... [Mykhaylenko] You spent a lot of time in all at the station and in the zone, did you not? [Plyushch] I think I spent a total of eighty-seven days at Chernobyl. A lot of days and a lot of Roentgents... [Mykhaylenko] What do you think of the books about Chernobyl? [Plyushch] I have tried to read the authors I know and whom I believe. I have no time to read books by those who wrote on the basis of the accounts of others. I recall one brochure by a doctor of physico-mathematical sciences who was also there from the first day. What he wrote was not long, but it was the truth. He also mentions me. He describes that the chairman of the oblast executive committee was extremely economical and did not understand what was happening around him. To load the sand they were using to put out the fire in the reactor, the helicopters were landing on the clover. This was early spring, the grass had grown beautifully, and I ran around begging: "Careful, you'll trample a lot of grass!" I knew how badly the farms needed this grass. The author describes this with goodnatured irony. But this fact itself shows that we did not realize the real scale of the accident at the time. [Mykhaylenko] There is frequent mention these days of the notorious May Day demonstration held that year. They blame its organizers... You remember it too? [Plyushch] I do... I left Chernobyl at one o'clock in the morning of 1 May and arrived in Kiev sometime after three o'clock. In the morning, I was standing on the official reviewing stand, and it seemed to me that the tower on the trade unions building was swaying the entire time... I stood there until the demonstration was over and then went to the polyclinic... Today we know that these festivities harmed people. But how could we have known this at the time, if a top ranking official in the USSR civil defense force reported at the meeting of the Government Commission: "Two buildings have already been washed down in Prypyat, there is zero radiation, the people can be brought back." Specialists and officials were sending such reports both to Kiev and to Moscow... [Mykhaylenko] On what note would you like to conclude this conversation about the planet's greatest tragedy? [Plyushch] Let us pray to God that the people of Ukraine and the world never experience another Chernobyl or anything like it.
