Statistics show that the city's individual households involved in the private economy numbered 42,000 by the end of 1992, with a total registered capital of 440 million yuan, up 71 and 66 percent from the previous year's figures. The city government has implemented more than 20 preferential policies for the expansion of the private economy to cope with establishing the socialist market economy in the country, said Qian Dihua, mayor of Daqing. The policies include the widening of private business coverage and the reduction of taxes for self-employed workers. The city government has worked hard to promote its private economy by learning from the experience of Chinese coastal cities in line with its own conditions, the mayor said. Private manufacturers are engaged in the deep processing of petroleum and chemical products, making use of Daqing's abundant resources. They produce necessary accessories for petroleum production equipment. Using leftover bits and pieces of materials of a chemical factory, more than 100 households in the city's datong district make plastic fiber bags. The bags, costing half the price demanded by similar products, sell well both in and outside of the city. Shi Fuxiang, a self-employed worker, set up a glass fiber factory with an investment of more than one million yuan. The factory uses leftover bits and pieces of glass to produce glass cloth, which is used to wrap oil pipelines. The factory turns out more than 1,000 meters of glass cloth a day. The city government is now improving its market system to further promote its private economic sector.
