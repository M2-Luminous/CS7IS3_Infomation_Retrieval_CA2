Reports from there say about 13,000 people had set up temporary homes which are believed to be about 40 km from the main Rwandan refugee camps. Many of the Hutus are said to have fled from atrocities committed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] which is mostly Tutsi. The reports add that RPF soldiers were killing many people and burning down houses during the advance. The RPF, which now controls much of eastern Rwanda, has denied the systematic killing of civilians.
