He had promised to continue "the process of lowering (excise) rates when they become unduly high"; it appears prominently on the budget giveaways that had accounted for a respectable Rs. 2000 [rupees] crore. What was overlooked was the fine print that the budget has reduced "the number of special exemption notifications by about half." It now appears that most of the 383 notifications rescinding exemptions relate to small-scale units. Manmohan Singh had stressed, at least twice that the budget was going all out to fulfil "major" and "persistent" demands of small-scale industry. This assurance seems to have gone by the wayside. He has little time for the problems of the unglamorous common man. The duty payable by small units producing steel utensils, rubber chappals [sandals], canvas shoes, or paper boards from bagasse goes up from nil to 15 percent ad valorem. That the net tax is covered by a special plan called Modavat is no consolation. The small producers have to coax suppliers of inputs to issue receipts, a difficult task in a climate of rampant sales-tax evasion. Duty discounts will not be easy to claim. In truth, often nonpayment of sales tax on inputs is what becomes the survival margin of small producers. Maintaining books of accounts to the satisfaction of excise inspectors with itchy palms, can be costly, if not cumbersome. Under the exemption regime, it is also superfluous. There is a puzzling contrariness in the new excise strategy. Excise has been raised from 15 percent in 1993-94 to a stiff 20 percent on small-scale registered production while the unregistered units with a clearance value of up to Rs. 7,500,000 have been excused, thus encouraging benami [illegal] whales in the business to acquire their ownership.
