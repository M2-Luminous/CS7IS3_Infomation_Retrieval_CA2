This will be the first such work. According to officials from the China Association for Sciences and Technology (CAST), eight volumes of the book have already been published. Zhu Guangya, chairman of the association, who is in charge of the compilation, said that the book is a reflection of the contributions made by the scientists to China's achievements in science and technology and social progress. The book contains precious records about the history of the country's scientific and technological development, said the chairman, who is one of the country's best known scientists. In another development, a scientific and technological experts' publishing fund was set up today, with about one million yuan allocated by cast as capital. The fund is designed to finance publication of the book, audio and video products about Chinese scientists and history of science and technology in modern and contemporary China. Despite China's gradually increasing investment in sciences, many academic books could not be published because of inadequate financing. The fund will accept donations from home and abroad.
