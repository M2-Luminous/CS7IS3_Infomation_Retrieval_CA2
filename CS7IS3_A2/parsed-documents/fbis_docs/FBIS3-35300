The official, who is Hushyar Zibari, representative of the Kurdish Administration in Britain, said the authorities in al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate have begun interrogation of the two pilots -- Habib Ruhaymi, a Kurd who requested political asylum, and Iraj Kalanaljin, an Iranian who expressed a desire to return to Iran. There has been no Iranian comment on this matter. This is the first time the Kurdish Administration has been faced with such incident since the parliamentary elections held in May 1992 resulting in the formation of a government in Iraqi Kurdistan. It should be noted that relations between that administration and Iran deteriorated seriously last month as a result of the Iranian forces' artillery shelling and penetration of Kurdish areas on the pretext of hunting Kurds opposed to the Tehran regime and using Iraqi Kurdistan as a base. It is known that the region's administration provides shelter for the Iranian Kurdish opposition parties and allows them political activity in the areas under its control. It has firmly rejected Iranian requests for the extradition of these oppositionists or their expulsion from the region, but it did ask these parties to move their offices to areas away from the borders with Iran to prevent them being used as an excuse for continuation of the shelling and penetration operations which have already claimed some Kurdish civilian victims.
