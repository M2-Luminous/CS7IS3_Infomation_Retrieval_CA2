FR941207-0-00051 FR941207-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Parts 864, 866, 868, 870, 872, 874, 876, 878, 880, 882, 886, 888, 890, and 892 [Docket No. 94M&hyph;0260] Medical Devices; Exemptions From Premarket Notification for Certain Classified Devices AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is exempting 148 generic types of class I devices from the requirement of premarket notification, with limitations. For the exempted devices, FDA has determined that manufacturers' submissions of premarket notifications are unnecessary for the protection of the public health and that the agency's review of such submissions will not advance its public health mission. The exemptions allow the agency to make better use of its resources and thus better serve the public. DATES: Effective January 6, 1995. Beginning on January 6, 1995, all device manufacturers who have 510(k) submissions pending FDA review for devices falling within a generic category which is subject to this rule, will receive a letter stating that the device is exempt from the premarket notification requirements of the act. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph M. Sheehan, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;84), Food and Drug Administration, 2094 Gaither Rd., Rockville, MD 20850, 301&hyph;594&hyph;4765 ext. 157. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background In the Federal Register of July 21, 1994 (59 FR 37378), FDA issued a proposed rule to exempt 164 generic types of class I devices from the requirement of premarket notification, with limitations. Interested persons were given until October 19, 1994 to comment on the proposed rule. II. Comments During the comment period, FDA received comments requesting that various devices be added to the list of devices that the agency was proposing be exempt from the requirement of premarket notification. The agency also received comments requesting that existing exemptions from the requirement of premarket notification for several devices, when made of certain materials, be expanded to include all devices within the classification, regardless of material composition. FDA is considering these comments and will address them in a future issue of the Federal Register . Several comments requested that certain devices proposed for exemption from premarket notification also be exempted from the requirements of current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's) and records and reports. FDA has decided not to grant these additional exemptions at this time. Pursuant to 21 CFR 820.1(d), any person petitioning for an exemption from any device CGMP requirement is required to follow the procedures set forth in 21 CFR 10.30. Accordingly, the devices listed in this final rule as exempt from premarket notification continue to be subject to applicable CGMP requirements. FDA believes that compliance with CGMP's is necessary in order to ensure adequate protection of the public health. III. Conclusion Several comments questioned the appropriateness of the proposed exemptions for a small number of the devices. In addition, FDA is reconsidering the appropriateness or scope of the proposed exemptions for several devices included in the proposed rule. Therefore, FDA is deferring action on the following 16 devices in order to review these comments and to reevaluate whether certain of the devices should be exempted from the requirement of premarket notification.
