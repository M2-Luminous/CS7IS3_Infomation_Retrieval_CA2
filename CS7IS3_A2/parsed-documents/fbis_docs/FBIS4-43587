At issue specifically is whether Finland should be represented by its head of state or by its prime minister as the top official at EU summit meetings. According to the wording of the Constitution the president, since March of this year Martti Ahtisaari, has the right and the authority to represent Finland in foreign policy matters. This authority was utilized to the fullest extent by Urho Kekkonen, head of state from 1956 to 1981, particularly in the area of ostpolitik. In contrast his successor, Mauno Koivisto, left such policy matters up to the government. A committee of experts has determined that both of these models are provided for in the wording of the Constitution. The transfer of decisionmaking powers to the government and the parliament during Koivisto's term of office could take place without requiring changes in the articles of the Constitution because these articles are quite broadly formulated, thus permitting some leeway. Prime Minister or President Of course this determination does not answer the question of whether Finland should conduct itself in keeping with the French model (President Mitterrand actively participates in the summit meetings) or in keeping with the model of the other member states, whose prime ministers lead the delegations. The committee of experts defines this situation as a legal stalemate, of which the only thing that can definitely be said is that it is "complicated": "Neither the president nor the prime minister has the authority set forth in the Constitution to commit Finland to specific EU decisions since the realm of foreign policy belongs to the president, while domestic policy guidelines are established by the prime minister -- and the issues discussed at EU summit meetings typically contain both foreign policy and domestic policy components." Because it would run contrary to the interpretation of the Constitution of the eighties and nineties to invest the head of state with additional domestic policy authority, the committee feels it would be best to charge the prime minister, currently Esko Aho (Center), with the job of representing Finland at EU summit meetings. The prerequisite would be that the president would transfer at least part of his foreign policy authority to the head of government and to individual ministers, as is already widely the case based on Koivisto's practice. Of course, the opinion of the experts would not exclude the president from appearing in specific cases in the summit round, for example in debate over issues that are of central importance to Finland's foreign and security policy. With the recommendation that the decision should be made on a "case-by-case basis," the experts have lobbed the problem ball back into the court of the politicians. As a "golden bridge" they suggest that the president should regularly participate in the meetings of the governmental committee on foreign affairs; it would then become a suitable platform for the transfer of power to the government. To emphasize parliament's role, it should receive a constant flow of information regarding developments in the EU, both directly and via its committees. Ahtisaari has spoken out in favor of an expanded process in which regular and confidential meetings would take place between the president and the party chairmen, during which foreign policy guidelines could be agreed upon. As Ahtisaari notes, this model has proven successful in Sweden. The committee does not like it, however. The proposed body could too easily begin to compete with the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, thereby working against the desired strengthening of the parliament in the political process. The Date for the Referendum Has Not Been Set In principle, Ahtisaari has let it be known that he plans to follow the Koivisto line of noninterference in the affairs of the government, including foreign policy. Still, as a former diplomat he has a taste for international involvement, as he demonstrated most recently during an official visit to Russia, when he assured Boris Yeltsin that Finnish membership in the EU would serve to strengthen rather than weaken economic relations between the two countries. At the same time Ahtisaari recommended that Moscow initiate a complete withdrawal of Russian military units from Estonia, as this would exert a "stabilizing influence" on the Baltic region. Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev reacted promptly with the remark that there was "no need" for a Finnish mediator in the discussions with Estonia, which, in fact, Ahtisaari had not proposed. Nevertheless the Finnish president maintains that his country will assume a cautiously active role on this issue. Whether or not Finland will become a member of the EU, as Ahtisaari recommends, will be decided in a referendum, to be held on a date in the fall that has not yet been set. Although the referendum is not directly binding, the parliament may orient itself based upon the results. A yes to membership is probable in the referendum, but not certain. According to the results of the most recent poll, conducted on behalf of the industrial associations, 40 percent are in favor of EU membership, 37 percent are opposed, and the remainder are undecided. In a similar poll taken in the fall of last year, those opposed to membership were in the majority with 41 percent, while 39 percent were in favor of membership.
