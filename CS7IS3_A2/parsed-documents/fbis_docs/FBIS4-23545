Inienger, has assured that in spite of all difficulties in the peace process, efforts are still being made at high levels to effect disarmament and pave the way for a democratically elected government in Liberia. Gen. Inienger made the disclosure recently during his working visit to the Ugandan contingent at the SOS encampment village and the Tanzanian troops assigned at Carey near Gbarnga. The ECOMOG field commander said to ensure the implementation of the disarmament process, ECOMOG has already begun meetings and consultations with factional leaders and other players of the Liberian conflict for the resumption of the disarmament and deployment exercises. He then urged members of the peacekeeping force to continue their good work and not to be discouraged by attempts by the factions to frustrate their efforts. Meanwhile, officers and soldiers of the Ugandan and Tanzanian contingents of expanded ECOMOG have been commended for exhibiting a high degree of tolerance and restraint in the face of extreme provocation by fighters of the armed groups. The commendation was made by the ECOMOG field commander, Maj. Gen. John M. Inienger, during his working visit to the locations of (Ugabart), (Sistring), and SOS encampment village and other [words indistinct] set aside at Carey and Gbarnga. Referring to incidents in which nine Ugandan ECOMOG soldiers on a routine patrol were ambushed and abducted and others in which they were shot at without justification, the ECOMOG field commander said that the incidents were regrettable and unfortunate. He enjoined them to continue to exercise restraint and patience which, he said, were the cornerstone of peacekeeping. Gen. Inienger observed that the task of the peacekeeper was not an easy one, citing as example the case of an unarmed Senegalese member of the small UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda, Captain [name indistinct], who was recently shot dead in Kigali, and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] abduction of five Nigerian ECOMOG soldiers out of which three have been released. While at the same time of talking to them, two were still being held. However, he assured them that ECOMOG was totally behind them, irrespective of whatever happened. He referred to the recent spate of orchestrated accusations by the various armed groups, which tended to cast doubts on ECOMOG's neutrality in its efforts to bring peace to Liberia, saying that in peacekeeping if you are not accused it means that you are not working. Gen. Inienger assured them that in spite of all the difficulties, efforts, including meetings, consultations are still being made at higher levels to effect disarmament and pave the way for a democratically elected government. He urged them to continue to endure until peace is finally achieved in Liberia because a large proportion of Liberians are still languishing as refugees. The field commander has, meanwhile, promised to look into the administrative and logistics problems of the peacekeepers, especially in the areas of efforts to urge the United Nations to speedily pay them their stipends which had accumulated for several months. Gen. Inienger was accompanied by some of his principal staff officers and UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] officials.
