FR940610-2-00189 FR940610-2-00097 Research and Special Programs Administration International Standards on the Transport of Radioactive Materials; Public Meeting AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Department of Transportation. ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: This notice is to advise interested persons that RSPA will conduct a public meeting to discuss issues to be considered at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Technical Committee Meeting (TCM) during June 27&hyph;July 1, 1994. A TCM is a meeting of experts from member nations assembled to address the technical aspects of a particular proposal. DATES: June 15, 1994 at 9:30 am. ADDRESSES: Room 8442, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George Brown, Chief, Radioactive Materials Branch, Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590; (202) 366&hyph;4545. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This meeting will be held to discuss several issues being considered for incorporation into the next publication of international regulations. The IAEA meeting will be held in Vienna, Austria, June 27&hyph;July 1, 1994. Topics to be covered include: 1. The impact of the new recommendations proposed by the International Council on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the draft of the IAEA Basic Safety Standards on the ``Regulations for Safe Transport of Radioactive Material,'' IAEA Safety Series # 6. 2. Review status of changes to the ``Q'' System. The ``Q'' system is an index of the relative hazards of each radionuclide, and is the basis for determining such issues as Type A and Type B quantities. 3. Exemption/Exception criteria. The issue is to investigate the merits of replacing the current generic radioactivity threshold of .002 uCi/g of any radionuclide with a threshold based on each individual radionuclide. 4. Minimum weight limit for packages labeled ``Radioactive Yellow III''. The proposal is to require a minimum weight of 10 kg for these packages. The public is invited to attend without prior notification. Documents Copies of documents related to the issues to be covered at the tenth meeting of SAGSTRAM may be obtained from RSPA. Documents may be ordered by contacting RSPA's Dockets Unit (202&hyph;366&hyph;4453).
