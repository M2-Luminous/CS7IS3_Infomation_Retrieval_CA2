FR940511-1-00065 FR940511-1-00012 However, in adopting the option to continue child care services without a request for TCC, the State must still provide all of the required notifications, including appeals rights, regarding the termination of AFDC benefits and child care services pursuant to §§205.10 or 250.36 as appropriate. The family must also be notified of the requirements for their continued eligibility for TCC, including the payment of fees if applicable, pursuant to the requirements at §§256.2, 256.3 and 256.4. We propose amending §256.1(a)(6)(i) to have States specify in their Supportive Services Plan whether they have adopted this option. In proposing this option we recognize that, in some cases (e.g., where a State does not have current or complete information on a family), a State may find it difficult to provide TCC in the absence of a request. Therefore, the State will still need a mechanism in place to collect the information necessary to determine eligibility and payments. For many families, the need for child care will not arise until they get a job which terminates their AFDC eligibility. Other families who leave AFDC due to employment may not need child care at that time (e.g., because their child is enrolled in Head Start), but may need care subsequently. Whenever the need for child care arises, the State must make a prompt determination of eligibility for TCC in order to assist the family. ACF remains concerned that States have not established such timely, efficient procedures. The request or application process should be simple so as not to hinder the applicant's ability to accept work or continue working. Because we continue to hear concerns that the requirement for a request for TCC is problematic and that TCC utilization is low, we are requesting comments on whether: (1) This provision to make requests optional is a sufficient response; (2) the request requirement constitutes a serious barrier to the receipt of TCC; and (3) other changes should be made to make TCC more accessible to eligible families. Retroactive Requests for TCC The existing rule at §256.2(c) specifically provides for families to receive TCC ``notwithstanding when the family requests assistance under this Part *␣*␣*.'' States have asked whether they may establish a cut-off date for TCC requests as they have received requests after the family's 12-month period of TCC eligibility has expired. There is no existing Federal policy which addresses a cut-off date for TCC requests following the 12-month eligibility period. We believe a cut-off date should be a State decision. We propose to revise §256.2(c) and add a new paragraph §256.2(g) to provide States the authority to establish a reasonable time limit for accepting TCC requests following the close of the eligibility period. We also propose to amend §256.4(c) to require States which have elected to establish a time limit for accepting requests for TCC, pursuant to §256.2(g), to notify families of the time limit. Fee Requirement In order to be compatible with the At-Risk Child Care Program at §257.31(c) and CCDBG at §98.42(c), we propose to amend the TCC regulation that requires some level of contribution to the cost of TCC by all recipients. Section 402(g)(1)(A)(vii) of the Act requires a family to contribute to the cost of TCC according to its ability to pay. The existing regulations at §256.3(b) require that a sliding fee be established that provides for some level of contribution by all recipients. As is the case with At-Risk families, families eligible for TCC are only one step away from actual receipt of AFDC. We believe it is appropriate to give States the option to treat TCC families the same as other similarly-situated families in the State. Therefore, we propose to revise §256.3(b) to give States the option to waive the contribution from a family whose income is at or below the poverty level for a family of the same size. Gaps in Employment During TCC As discussed in the preamble to part 255 we propose to amend §256.1(a) and add §256.2(f) to allow States the option to continue child care that would otherwise be lost, for a limited period of time for families waiting to enter employment or who have a gap in employment. Section 256.2(f) codifies into part 256 the existing and proposed title IV&hyph;A child care gaps policy. PART 257_AT-RISK CHILD CARE PROGRAM Child Care That Is ``Reasonably Related'' to Parent's Employment As discussed in the preamble at parts 255 and 256, we propose to amend §257.21(a)(6) to have the State include in its At-Risk Child Care plan a description of its policy on what constitutes child care that is reasonably related to the parent's hours of employment. Gaps in Employment During At-Risk Child Care As discussed in the preamble at parts 255 and 256, we propose to amend §257.30(c) to allow States the additional option to continue child care for a limited period of time for families that lose a job but are searching for another and whose child care arrangements would otherwise be lost. We also propose to conform the At-Risk regulations regarding the provision of child care during the two weeks prior to start of employment with the corresponding regulations in part 255 and the proposed amendment to part 256. With these proposed amendments, States will have the flexibility to create a consistent gaps policy across the three title IV&hyph;A child care programs. Other Proposed At-Risk Child Care Amendments We propose amending the At-Risk regulations concerning in-home care and the effects test, as discussed earlier in the preamble. List of Subjects
