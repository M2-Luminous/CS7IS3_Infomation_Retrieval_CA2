After a long controversy over the choice of the new head of government, the parliamentary majority, formed by a coalition of the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], recently declared that they have agreed on a name for the post of prime minister. However, since then the people have been waiting. How does the Office of the President of the Republic react to this impasse? Tonight we have invited Koffi Panou, spokesman for the Presidency of the Republic. He is interviewed by Kodjovi Gbadayi: [Gbadayi] Mr. Koffi Panou, good evening. [Panou] Good evening. [Gbadayi] You surely heard our colleague Koffiblah's introduction. Do you have any clarifications to make on this statement? [Panou] Yes, certainly, I am going to do that right now. On the afternoon of Wednesday, 25 March 1994, the head of state received a letter from the chairman of CAR requesting a meeting with the two leaders of the parliamentary majority, Mr. Yaovi Agboyibor and Edem Kodjo, to discuss the condition for the appointment of a prime minister. The head of state accepted this request, but he could not get a hold of the two leaders. In lieu of the meeting scheduled between him and the chairmen of CAR and UTD to collect their views on the person to be appointed prime minister, it was through a UTD-CAR joint communique issued on 26 March 1994 and broadcast on the radio that the head of state learned that the CAR had officially chosen somebody for the post of prime minister and that the UTD had agreed to this choice. Yesterday, Monday, 28 March 1994, it came to the attention of the head of state, through a statement jointly issued by the CAR and UTD on 26 March 1994, that they had agreed on the following: 1. The person proposed by the CAR for the post of prime minister and which was agreed upon by the UTD is Mr. Yaovi Agboyibor. 2. A joint delegation of the two parties composed of (Mr. Egbor Gahoujor) of CAR, (Georges Ahidame), CAR, (Yao Fegni) of UTD, and (Atchiabesson Ajavon) of UTD have been charged to transmit the name agreed upon to the president of the Republic. The head of state regrets to say that the two leaders of the parliamentary majority did not deem it necessary to meet with him so that together they can collect their viewpoints on the conditions for the appointment of a prime minister, because, according to the provisions of Article 56 of the Constitution, the prime minister is not appointed by the parliamentary majority, but is appointed by the president of the Republic from among that majority. This calls for a constant dialogue between the head of state and the two leaders. It is within this context that, during the recent discussions the president had with the two leaders of the majority, the two leaders were asked to propose several candidates from whom a prime minister could be appointed in accordance with the Constitution. Consequently, the president of the Republic deems it indispensable that consultations should continue to be held directly between him and the two leaders of the majority. [passage omitted]
