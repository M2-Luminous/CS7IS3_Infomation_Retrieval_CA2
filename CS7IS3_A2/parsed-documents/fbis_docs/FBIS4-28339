MAINICHI SHIMBUN Foreign Affairs Department reporter Bumigo Ozawa has interviewed Hiteshi Takesata, chief of the First Research Office of the Second Research Department of the Defense Agency's National Institute for Defense Studies on the present state of and prospects for the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons. [Ozawa] Why is North Korea so hastily removing fuel rods from its experimental (five-megawatt) nuclear reactor at Yongbyon? [Takesata] North Korea is doing so because it is actually hastening the development of nuclear weapons. There is an argument that the DPRK has suffered a loss of prestige because it has been criticized for developing nuclear weapons although it has not actually engaged in developing them. I do not agree with this argument. North Korea has refused to give IAEA inspectors access to the removal of the fuel rods at the expense of resuming high-level U.S.-DPRK talks, and this is evidence that the country is developing nuclear weapons. [Ozawa] At what stage is North Korea's development of nuclear weapons? [Takesata] The DPRK is said to have extracted plutonium from the experimental nuclear reactor in question, and the plutonium is enough to build one or two atomic bombs. Once North Korea extracts weapons-grade materials from the experimental nuclear reactor, the next stage is to develop detonation devices for atomic bombs and technology to miniaturize the atomic bombs. According to a South Korean defense white paper, in North Korea, about 70 craters have been found where detonation devices are believed to have been tested. The DPRK has provided Iraq with missile technology and has the technology to assemble MiG-29 fighter jets. Given these technological capabilities, North Korea is close to building nuclear weapons. [Ozawa] Is there any relation between North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and the present situation of that country? [Takesata] The power base of Secretary Kim Chong-il, the heir apparent to President Kim Il-song, is not as solid as is his father's. Secretary Kim Chong-il has no experience in fighting against the Japanese, and this lack of experience is a fatal blow to him in terms of his assuming power in North Korea. The development of nuclear weapons is a means to make up for this lack. Perhaps the DPRK aims to earn foreign currency by exporting nuclear weapons. [Ozawa] What effect will economic sanctions have against North Korea? [Takesata] It is difficult for the United Nations to adopt a resolution imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK because it is believed that China would veto the resolution. Some take the view that there has been a change in China's policy toward North Korea, but there is no change in its stand against the economic sanctions. If China exercises its right of veto to block the United Nations from adopting the resolution, this would create an irreversible situation for the Clinton administration, which has renewed most- favored-nation trading status for China. The United States will withdraw the resolution when it finds that China will certainly exercise its right of veto. Any economic sanctions imposed by Japan, the United States, and South Korea would be 80 percent ineffective. On the contrary, the economic sanctions would prompt North Koreans to unite. The economic sanctions must be viewed as a necessary means for a diplomatic "settlement" to the issue. [Ozawa] Is there any possibility that North Korea will compromise with the international community in the future? [Takesata] The DPRK aims to resume high-level talks with the United States. North Korea will put forward a compromise proposal at the talks, and the United States will accept it. There is a possibility that the United States will shift to a policy under which it will not make an issue of North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and will seek a pledge from the DPRK that it will not sell nuclear weapons to other countries. With midterm elections soon to be held in the United States and an international conference scheduled to be held next year to discuss the question of extending the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons is likely to continue to remain deadlocked for the time being.
