FR940602-2-00157 FR940602-2-00094 a. Recreation Residence Continuance. The applicable direction is found at FSM 2347.03 and 2721.23e. The broad direction on continuation of the recreation residence use (paragraph 3, FSM 2347.03 of the proposed policy) stated: ``Continue to authorize those existing facilities now occupying National Forest land under special use authorization that (a) are consistent with management direction given in the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, (b) are at locations where the need for an alternative public purpose has not been established, (c) do not constitute a material, uncorrectable offsite hazard to National Forest resources, and (d) do not endanger the health or safety of the holder or the public.'' The proposed policy's guidance on the decision to reissue the permit is found at FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 1 as follows: ``The Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest plan) provides direction for continuance of the recreation residence use (FSM 1920). As Forest plans are revised, recreation residence use shall be explicitly addressed in the plan through delineation of management areas and associated management area prescriptions (FSM 1920).'' Comment. There were 136 comments received on these two provisions of the proposed policy. The use of the Forest plan as the means of determining recreation residence continuance is the most significant departure the proposed policy makes from the 1988 policy. Most of the respondents were suspicious of this change, stating their concern about inconsistent or arbitrary local treatment of the residences, inability to participate in the decision-making process involving Forest plans, and the failure to use environmental analysis standards when amending or revising Forest plans. Respondents felt that the decision process on continuance was flawed because continuance was determined by whether the use was consistent with the Forest plan. They advocated a return to the process described in the 1988 policy which stated the decision to continue the use was to be made by a separate, free-standing analysis that did not depend on the language of the Forest plan. In the proposed policy, the consistency determination in the context of recreation residences would be made on the basis of a comparison to the land and resource allocations made in the Forest plan. If land allocated to the recreation residence use was consistent, the use could continue. If not consistent, the use would be analyzed to determine if it could be made consistent or must be removed in favor of the proposed action, or alternative public use. Other respondents described the policy provision allowing continuance of those existing facilities which ``.␣.␣. are at locations where the need for an alternative public purpose has not been established'' as a ``Pandora's box,'' since there are always alternative purposes. They were concerned that the direction provided no guidelines or criteria for use in weighing alternative uses of National Forest land and thus would allow decisions which were arbitrary and capricious. The respondents asked for a definition of alternative public purpose. Others opposed these provisions because they believed use of the phrase ``continue to'' biased the decision to offer a new permit. Finally, respondents felt that the determination of whether the use should continue based on a policy promulgated by the agency's Washington Office could result in arbitrary action by individuals removed from the issue as it should be addressed. They suggested instead that each location should be viewed on its own and not be part of a nationwide policy. Conversely, some respondents felt the proposed policy left too much up to the whims of local forest officials where decisions could be made arbitrarily and capriciously without regard to national policy. Response . The proposed policy significantly changed the 1988 policy's direction in the way recreation residence continuance decisions would be made. Making the Forest plan the foundation for the decision to continue the use is a major departure from the ``analysis of continuance'' process set forth in 1988 policy. Most permit holders are not familiar with the forest planning process that produces the individual National Forest Land and Resource Management plan. In fact, many indicated they were unaware that a plan encompassing all activities on the National Forest existed. Those that were aware of the planning process often did not make the link between their permitted use and the broad guidance set forth in the plan. The agency recognizes the significance of this departure from previous policy. However, it must be guided by statutory authority and its own implementing direction. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires the agency to use an integrated, interdisciplinary forest planning process to make the land and resource allocation decisions for each National Forest. Further, section 6 of the 1976 Act requires that all permits, contracts, and other instruments for the use and occupancy of National Forest System lands shall be consistent with the Forest plan. Thus, recreation residence use and continuance must be brought into compliance with that direction.
