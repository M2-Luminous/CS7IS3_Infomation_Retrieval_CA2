[Plyushch] If I become the president, I am not going to request any powers in addition to those specified by the Constitution. [VYBIR] What about the proposals of left-wing factions in the parliament to provide the president only with representative functions? [Plyushch] They propose this since our president was not able to efficiently use the powers delegated to him. Therefore, left- wingers want the parliament to possess such functions. However, to do this the Constitution should be amended which requires at least 300 votes. The left factions do not have such number of backers. They would have never gotten even 170 votes to elect the Speaker if they had not been supported by the president. [VYBIR] Whom would you appoint to the key posts in the government? [Plyushch] Too early to speak about that. Too early. The other day, I was going to go to Donetsk and came to the airport 20 minutes before the flight but they did not permit me to enter the plane. They said I was 10 minutes late. Too early to speak about the government now. [VYBIR] What is your attitude to the new speaker? [Plyushch] He is an experienced politician. Mr. Moroz is supposed to do what he says. The speaker should have no party affiliation. Still, sometimes I do not understand Mr. Moroz. Look, he says that political council of the Socialist Party suspended his membership in the party, then he says that it was his party that nominated him as a presidential nominee, that communists supported him... [VYBIR] What do you think of the president's proposals concerning the ruling posts in government? [Plyushch] I haven't seen the list but I believe that a new premier will again become a scapegoat. [VYBIR] What is your attitude to the memorandum, signed by communist parties of ex-Soviet republics, including Ukraine, concerning restoration of the USSR? [Plyushch] My attitude is absolutely negative. Such activity of the communist party is illegal. [VYBIR] Which international blocs are the most attractive for Ukraine. Where are Ukraine's interests -- in the West or East? [Plyushch] We should enter the blocs which admit us. East or West does not matter much. We have state-of-the-art technologies but no investments to introduce them. We should try to reestablish the common market of ex-Soviet republics. Ukraine lost its market, sold it for nothing, for bribes. We gave it to false friends trying to get rich using our difficulties. [VYBIR] Who is your chief rival in presidential marathon? [Plyushch] The one who is governed by common sense. [VYBIR] If you become the president, will you keep trying to create the Baltic-Black Sea zone? What is your attitude to the so- called Visegrad triangle? [Plyushch] I will insist on the worldwide summit to solve the global problem facing all countries today. "Cold war" is over. Bipolar world exists no more. Each country has a great responsibility to the world community. Such summit must be similar to that held after WWII. Ukraine should initiate this process. The world community, not some countries, must be peace-maker today. Look, now Russia wants to be the peace-maker in the "near abroad" and the United Nations to play this role elsewhere. I am against any division of the spheres of influence. There are some questions as well -- today the Warsaw Pact does not exist, but what about NATO? [VYBIR] Thank you.
