In the evening, the premier met with model workers from various fronts in Inner Mongolia and posed for a picture session with them. He extended Labor Day greetings to the working class and people in the autonomous region and throughout the country. He said his visit to the four Central Asian nations and Mongolia was successful because it had expanded China's good-neighborly friendship with these countries and had accomplished the anticipated objective. Success in diplomatic work has been made possible through the remarkable achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization drive; while an independent and peaceful foreign policy has in turn provided a favorable external environment for domestic economic construction. He said: In the past nearly 10 years, I have visited Inner Mongolia on three occasions and witnessed its great achievements. The autonomous region is rich in natural resources and enjoys unity of nationalities; therefore, it has great potential for growth. So long as the people of all nationalities in Inner Mongolia earnestly implement the party's line, principles and policies and work concertedly under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, Inner Mongolia will certainly score even greater achievements. He pointed out: Model workers who are pace-setters in various fronts have made outstanding contributions to the socialist modernization drive. Guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has implemented the policy of reform and opening up and promoted vigorous economic growth. Now is the time for large numbers of people to come forth and to develop their ability to the full. More advanced models will certainly emerge on all fronts. While promoting the building of material civilization, we should also attach great importance to spiritual civilization. It is hoped that model workers shall exemplify themselves in building not only material civilization but also spiritual civilization. They shall make still greater contributions to the motherland's prosperity. At 2000 in the evening, Premier Li Peng, accompanied by regional party secretary Wang Qun and government chairman Wuliji, attended a soiree held by the autonomous region to celebrate the International Labor Day, and viewed a brilliant ethnic literary and artistic performance. At the end of performance, the premier ascended the stage, put on Mongolian costumes, and had pictures taken with performers. Ismail Amat, Ye Qing, Yao Zhenyan, and Han Zhubin attended the soiree.
