One is a draft amendment to the Regulations on the Military Service of Active-Duty Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA], proposed by Premier Li Peng and the Central Military Commission chairman Jiang Zemin; and the other is a draft amendment to the Regulations on Military Rank of the Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army proposed by the Central Military Commission chairman Jiang Zemin. The proposal made by Li Peng and Jiang Zemin on amendment of the active-duty officer's military service regulations says: With the constant progress in reform and construction of the country and the army, some new circumstances and new problems have emerged with respect to the building of the PLA's officer corps. The modernization of the PLA in the new period necessitates higher standards for the officer corps. So, some articles in the "Regulations" are no longer adequate to meet the needs of new circumstances and new tasks, and it is necessary to make some amendment, supplement and improvement. The proposal made by Jiang Zemin on amendment of the military rank regulations says: With further progress in reform and construction of the country and the army and with the smooth substitution of younger officers for the older ones in PLA's officer corps, particularly among high-ranking officers, some stipulations in the regulations are no longer in complete conformity with the reality of the officer corps, and some contradictions and problems happen during the course of their implementation. So, an amendment is necessary. At the request of the State Council and the Central Military Commission, Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission and director of the General Political Department, made an explanation on the two proposed draft amendments. On the draft amendment to the active-duty officer's military service regulations, Yu Yongbo said: The regulations were adopted by the Third Session of the Seventh NPC Standing Committee on 5 September 1988 and were put in force on 1 January 1989. The guiding principle for the proposed amendment is based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period and on relevant instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. It proceeds from the PLA's reality, properly draws on the experience of foreign armies and our local governments, and aims at making the leading bodies and the officer corps become more revolutionary, younger in average age, better educated, and professionally more competent. It is designed to make the "Regulations" more conducive to maintaining a stable officer corps, to arousing enthusiasm among the vast number of officers, to the healthy growth of outstanding young officers, and to normal substitution of younger officers for the older ones in the leading bodies. Yu Yongbo explained questions concerning the power of officer's job assignments and removal, procedures for officer's job assignments and removal, the age limits for active-duty officers on various levels of posts, officer's pay scale, and removal of officers from active duty status. On the proposed amendment to the military rank regulations, Yu Yongbo said: Since they were put in force on 1 July 1987, the regulations have played an important role in perfecting the army cadres' work system, arousing enthusiasm among the vast number of officers, enhancing the PLA's cohesion capability, and promoting the revolutionization, modernization and regularization of the PLA. The guiding principle for the proposed amendment is based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period, as well as on the realities of our country and our army. Aimed at longterm army building, the proposed amendment is designed to meet the needs of modern army command and management, improve the officer's military rank system, specify more clearly officer's responsibility, harmonize the command relations, enhance the sense of honor and sense of responsibility among officers, arouse their enthusiasm, and promote the building of the officer corps in an all-round way. Yu Yongbo also answered questions in connection with the proposed amendment. They included questions regarding officer's military ranks, the T/O [table of organization] military ranks for chairman and vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, the T/O military ranks for various job posts held by members of the Central Military Commission, the T/O military ranks for various job posts of military, political and logistic officers, the T/O military ranks for various job posts held by specialized and technical officers, the waiting period for promotion from second lieutenant to first lieutenant, and the authority to approve promotion of officers in military rank.
