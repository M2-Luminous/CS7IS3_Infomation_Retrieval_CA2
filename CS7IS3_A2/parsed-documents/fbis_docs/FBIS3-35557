The text of the eminent leader's statement is as follows: In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. The villainous attack by the Zionists against worshippers in the occupied town of Hebron, which left dozens dead and hundreds injured, is one of those model crimes which can only be brought about by the cruel and bigoted hands of the Zionists and is in keeping with the villainy and wretchedness of the usurpers of Palestine. This tragic blow is a reminder of the Zionists' other mass killings throughout the years of occupation, with this difference, that, today, this enormous crime took place before the eyes of the entire world. Will the consciences which have remained indifferent to what has been happening to Palestinians in their own homes be awakened by this tragedy? Will the false seekers of peace with the usurper enemy realise their mistake now? Will organizations and governments that claim to defend human rights, which have disregarded the gravest violation of a nation's rights over a period of years, finally end their shameless silence now and confess to their past sins? Will the American Government accept that it is an accomplice to those who have shed the blood of innocent Palestinians, because it has consistently given its unconditional support to the Zionist government? Or will everyone ignore this tragic incident once again, without accepting its implications and learning any lessons just as they have failed to pay any attention to the other great tragedy of the times in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Nevertheless, the Palestinian nation will undoubtedly learn the appropriate lesson from this incident. Today, once again, the bitter truth has been driven home to that oppressed nation that it must fight in its own home in order to be able to live there. It has been driven home to them that the Zionists -- despite the elegant statements of some of their leaders -- continue to be the same racist and bigoted savages they have been for the past 50 years. And they only need the slightest opportunity or excuse to inflict the most villainous blows on the Palestinians who are the true owners of the land. Even the most slow-to-believe Palestinians must now be convinced that the arrogant regimes that make so many claims about the need for the security of the Zionists do not care in the slightest about the security of Muslim Palestinians; otherwise, the Israeli Army would not dare to massacre sacred worshippers in this way. It is through arming and attacking the interests of the usurping regime that the Palestinians can obtain the right of life and livelihood in their own home. Such is the lesson of the Friday morning incident at Hebron. Muslim governments and nations also have a great responsibility. The least that Muslim nations can demand is the handing over of the murderers and their collaborators in the Zionist army to Muslim Palestinians for the execution of religious retribution and the dismissal of that army's commanders. Of course, the final and only solution is to dispossess the usurping Zionists and to transfer Palestine to Palestinians of all religions and nationalities. While expressing condolences to the innocent people of Palestine, in particular the relatives of the martyrs of the incident, I beseech God Almighty for forgiveness for the deceased, the recovery of the wounded who were fasting, the reform of the Muslim conditions, and a just solution to the Palestinian issue, and call on all to pursue this matter with all their might.
