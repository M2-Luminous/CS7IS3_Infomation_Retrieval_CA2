The 15 April sittings were attended by officials of all branch ministries and organizations with a stable share of Libya's market. The discussions focused on the future of the bilateral cooperation in a number of spheres, including industry, agriculture, transport, trade, construction and health care. The Bulgarian side informed their Libyan counterparts on the drafting of a bilateral agreement on reciprocal investment protection. During their stay in this country the Libyan guests met Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev, Agriculture Minister Georgi Tanev and Industry Minister Rumen Bikov, as well as representatives of different companies. They expressed their positive impressions from the performance of Bulgarian construction and engineering experts working in Libya. Secretary for Agriculture 'Isa 'Abd-al-Kafi, who heads the Libyan delegation, today met the leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party Zhan Videnov. The Libyan side was welcomed to send a delegation to Bulgaria to investigate the cooperation opportunities this country's industry has to offer. The food-processing industry, transport machine building, metal processing, the pharmaceutical industry, refrigerating equipment and the leather industry are of particular interest for the future cooperation between the two countries, according to Mr. Totev. The guests pledged to approach the competent Libyan authorities to help overcome the payment-related difficulties facing Bulgarian specialists in Libya. The document that was signed today also seeks to ease the work visa regulations for Bulgarians. An expert meeting will be followed by singing an accord for reciprocal recognition of university diplomas and degrees. The Bulgarian delegation to the session reiterated this country's readiness to sign an interdepartmental accord in health care and an intergovernmental accord on the employment of Bulgarian citizens on Libyan territory. This country will come up with a draft agreement on employment by the end of this June. Bulgaria and Libya started to develop extensive economic, trade and scientific cooperation some 30 years ago, Mr. Totev told BTA. Following a 3- to 4-year break, the work of the joint commission is now expected to double the number of Bulgarian experts in Libya, overcoming a sharp drop of this figure, the construction and regional development minister said. About 6,000 Bulgarians are now working in Libya, most of them construction engineers, workers and medical staff. According to Mr. Totev, some 4-5 years ago the Bulgarian-Libyan commercial exchange was as much as 900 million U.S. dollars per year and there was a total of 15,000 to 18,000 Bulgarian experts in Libya.
