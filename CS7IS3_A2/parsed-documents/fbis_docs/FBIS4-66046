In statements to Antena 3 Radio, Aznar emphasized that he has no interest in "looking backward or lifting carpets," but this did not prevent him from again accusing the Socialist government and its political allies of being directly responsible for corruption in Spain. The People's Party chairman asserted that his sole concern is to offer the electorate a blueprint for Spain's future. "We have no other interest, either in looking backward, or in lifting carpets, or in the Spanish people's persisting in distinguishing between one another," he asserted, since his concern is to turn over a new leaf in Spanish democracy. Aznar warned that he is not prepared to accept anybody's setting his personal interest above general interests. In addition, he stated that he does not believe in the existence of the so-called captive vote, and asked what message of hope the Spanish Socialist Workers Party can offer when it is constantly having recourse to the vote of fear -- an "irresponsible and intolerable" political strategy aimed at dividing the Spanish people's votes. Jose Maria Aznar did not rule out the possibility of submitting a censure motion against the government after the European elections, once the final results are known, and reiterated that this political action is not advisable right now, since he does not have the necessary parliamentary support. Criticisms of CiU In this connection, he criticized CiU [Convergence and Union] for exclusively defending its particular party interests, without heeding those of the country or of Catalonia; a community in which, according to him, unemployment grew by 30 percent over the past year. "CiU's stance is inexplicable," he concluded. The People's Party chairman, who yesterday visited a rehabilitation center for drug addicts in the Madrid district of Barajas, stated at the end of the visit that although all the opinion polls give his party as the winner in the 12 June European elections, he does not want "the slightest overconfidence. We have a vital opportunity to try to emerge from the crisis, and it must not be missed if we wish to safeguard Spain's future." Next, he asserted that his party does not intend to dismantle the levels of social protection achieved in Spain over the past few decades, although he emphasized that "they are still below those of the advanced countries of the European Union," and stated that his party aims to set under way an "open public administration that will not stifle social initiatives and will allow citizens access to education, health, and other quality services." With respect to Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra's recent appearance in the Congress [of Deputies], Jose Maria Aznar asserted that "it is not through stances of entrenchment and rancor that Spain will move forward," but rather through a blueprint for the whole country that will offer it a future and hope, and he identified the People's Party as the only party that can guarantee those aims today.
