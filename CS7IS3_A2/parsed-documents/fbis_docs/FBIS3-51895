The goals established in the program for 1994 include reducing inflation to 8-10 percent, achieving a production increase (real GNP) of between 5 and 6 percent, increasing employment, increasing savings and investments, increasing exports, consolidating fiscal reforms, and increasing competitiveness among banks. During a lecture to the members of the Salvadoran Association of Business Administration Professionals, Orellana Milla said social conditions were beginning to improve, per capita income was on the rise, family income and job opportunities had increased, and inflation was being reduced. Orellana said: "Substantial progress has been achieved in the new economic system -- the social market economy. Thanks to this new system, the economy is growing steadily and a reduction in the fiscal deficit has been achieved." He also termed as successful the financial reforms of recent years, adding that the privatization of banks has engendered financial transactions that are much more effecient than in the past. Moreover, he said the stock market was rapidly growing and had great potential, adding that greater access to international credit has allowed businessmen a greater availability of funds for mid-term investments. According to the BCR President, the outlook for 1994 is very encouraging, both for the financial system and the economy in general. Nevertheless, he said there are major mid-term challenges. He defined the challenges for the next five years as follows: Reducing extreme poverty, broadening and consolidating social policy, consolidating the social market economic system, continuing to encourage high and sustained growth with its corresponding creation of jobs, consolidating macroeconomic stability, eliminating the fiscal deficit, effectively integrating with the world economy, and reforming the state. The BCR president concluded by saying, "The economy now presents many opportunities for businessmen seeking new markets and new business."
