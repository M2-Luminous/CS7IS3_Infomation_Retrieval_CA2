In addition to worsening unemployment, the inflow of rural migrant laborers into the cities in large numbers, the deterioration of inflation, the increasingly seriousness of crimes, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor, the problem most worrying to the CPC authorities was the appearance of organized labor movements. There were also some indications that some labor organizations were linked with some intellectuals. If there is indeed an outbreak of labor unrest with the support of some intellectuals who give advice to the workers, that will be the most serious challenge CPC authorities will face. In the past, the CPC mounted the political stage by soliciting support from workers and peasants. At present, in addition to the growing labor movements, the sentiments of the peasantry are also unstable. Although peasant unrest has been limited to particular areas, if trouble appears among the worker and peasant masses and if intellectuals are also involved in the turmoil, than the nightmare of the CPC authorities will come true. We may first view the living conditions of the workers. The authorities have admitted that one-third of the state-owned enterprises are running in the red; another one-third have incurred invisible business losses; and only the remaining one-third are making slight profits or making profits merely in the accounting books. A large number of workers are in fact living in the worst condition. In particular, some large manufacturing and mining enterprises have no money to pay wages to workers at all. The well-known Jixi Mining Bureau of Heilongjiang Province could only give 40-yuan-worth of meal coupons to 420,000 workers every month. The workers had to bring their families to the canteens to fetch the limited food rations, and they had no money for other consumption at all. Another example was Lianzhao Coal Mine of Hunan Province. It was a coal mine developed according to Mao Zedong's plan for meeting energy needs in the south. Production was suspended there, and 120,000 workers became jobless. Some of them took to the streets and expressed their hope for "work, food, and money." According to the analysis of a certain official brain trust, four workers now have to support one jobless person (that is, one-fifth of the working force is now laying idle). The situation in factories and mines which are running in the red is even more serious. In some cases, three or even two workers have to support one jobless person. People add burdens to each other, and there is no way to improve their livelihood. Strong worker resentments inevitably increases labor-management disputes. According to statistics by the Ministry of Labor, last year the number of large-scale labor-management disputes exceeded 12,000. In some 2,500 cases, workers besieged plants, set fire to facilities, staged strikes, or detained bosses or leaders. Such events directly threatened the personal safety of party leaders in various factories and mines. In Jixi Mining Bureau, enterprise leaders did not dare to go to the pits for fear that they might be attacked by the workers. The local governments did not want to report such events to higher authorities because assessment of their work performances might be affected. Therefore, the national federation of trade unions only recorded 460 strikes last year. However, investigators sent by the central authorities found that in Zhejiang Province alone, the number of strikes exceeded 400 last year. The discontent of workers was also related the corrupt and exploitative practices of enterprise leaders and local officials. According to some internal investigations made by the national federation of trade unions, although many factories and mines were running in the red, the account books still recorded such items as "director funds" or "director-disposed funds." On the surface, such funds were used to develop business; in fact, the money was only used by the factory directors to develop their personal relations with leaders of other enterprises, or they might even line their own pockets with such money. This aroused strong indignation among the workers. Recently, a court in Beijing sentenced Guan Zhicheng, former general manager of an iron and steel company in Beijing, to death after finding him guilty of embezzlement, and the convict was executed immediately in order to calm down the indignation of the masses. However, because the masses found that the authorities were evasive when handling the case, they denounced the execution of Guan Zhicheng as being aimed at doing away with a witness in a syndicated crime. Thus, other officials involved in the corruption case might be at large. As workers are facing increasing pressure in their daily lives, their relations with enterprise leaders also become tense. In Sichuan, leaders of state-owned factories and mines all have pistols for self-protection. Some leaders even bring police barons along with them. This shows that authorities were indeed guarding against labor unrest. The authorities did not dare to recklessly take highhanded action against resentful workers because they knew that workers, unlike intellectuals who may be persuaded, may react violently. On the one hand, the authorities managed to improve the living conditions of workers; on the other hand, an old method--ideological education--was used. Recently, Zhu Rongji approved the allocation of 500 million yuan as a relief fund for jobless workers who are in financial straits. However, this was something like trying to put out a burning carload of faggots with a cup of water, and would be of no avail. In addition, the CPC Central Propaganda Department recently organized many activities. It held work conferences on ideological education for workers in Shanghai and Sichuan. The meetings were chaired by Xu Weicheng, deputy director of the Central Propaganda Department. The authorities hoped that through such education, the working class would serve the overall interest and support reform. However, the ideologues also tried to consolidate their personal position by stressing the importance of political and ideological education. When they discussed the interests of the workers, they particularly shifted the contradictions to the foreign-funded enterprises and encouraged workers in the foreign-funded enterprises to organize trade unions. The workers knew that this was not exactly what they urgently needed. Some workers came to realize that they had to rely on their own strength to strive for better conditions for their own survival. Beginning 1992, some fragmented organizations appeared among the workers. Originally, the authorities tried to include such organizations in the national federation of trade unions. However, they found that this was not feasible. So they made the regulations more stringent for controlling the worker organizations. Those which were not registered according to the regulations were regarded as illegal underground trade unions that would be banned. However, underground trade unions still continued to develop rather rapidly. Although they were rather fragmented, they gradually spread in all parts of the country. In particular, there are more underground trade unions in South China. The authorities originally intended to encourage workers in the foreign-funded enterprises to organize trade unions, but they themselves are now facing the threat of underground trade unions in the state-owned enterprises. The authorities later even discovered that some of the underground trade unions had joined hands with some intellectuals and were greatly shocked by this trend. In early 1994, the authorities found that the trend was getting more and more unfavorable to them, and they had to check it without delay. Material prepared by the Ministry of Public Security showed that 10 underground trade unions had grown on a considerable scale. They grew stronger by means of helping workers seek a livelihood when the factories and mines failed to guarantee it. Jobless workers were thus organized to seek livelihoods. Such legal activities were independent of trade unions controlled by the authorities. Before and after 4 June last year, the authorities for the first time discovered that intellectuals pointed out the failure to identify themselves with workers and peasants when drawing a lesson from the 4 June incident in 1989. This aroused the attention of the authorities. A more obvious example was that during the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] in March this year, some worker organizations even directly submitted their organizational charters to the people's deputies. Some people's deputies even brought such documents to Beijing in order to spread them. This discovery further strained the nerves of the CPC authorities. Before the NPC session the Yuan Hongbing incident happened. Yuan Hongbing submitted a petition letter legally to the Complaint Office of the NPC Standing Committee, and the petition was supported by a large number of workers and ordinary people. After that, more than 200 people visited the Complaint Office at the same time. The CPC authorities found that the workers must not be allowed to join hands with intellectuals in the labor movement. Last month, an underground trade union case reflected the action taken by the CPC authorities against such trend. In the case, four of the 16 accused people are workers, two are cadres, two are self-employed workers, three are jobless people, and the remaining five are intellectuals, namely, Hu Shigen, former lecturer with the Beijing Language College; Kang Yuchun, former doctor with Beijing's Anding Hospital; Lu Zhigang, former student at the Law Department of Beijing University; Wang Tiancheng, former teacher in the Law Department of Beijing University; and Wang Peizhong, former graduate student in the Research Institute of Science and Technology for Petroleum Prospecting and Exploitation. The authorities accused them of organizing the "Liberal Democratic Party of China," the "Progressive Alliance of China," and the "Preparatory Committee for the Chinese Free Trade Unions." They drafted party constitutions and charters, "action principles and work methods," "interim rules for members of the Alliance," a "free forum," and wrote such articles as "Heroic Souls of 4 June Will Exist For Ever" and "On Free Trade Unions." They also distributed such documents and articles in large quantities. While the feelings of the workers were unstable, the peasants were also quite upset. According to secret statistics kept by the authorities, 44 local post offices and banks were stormed and looted by peasants, because the peasants could not withdraw money remitted to them by their relatives from the coastal areas. When peasants lost their temper, they did not care how high-ranking the officials they were facing. Last December, when Jiang Zemin visited Shaoshan, the home village of Mao Zedong, to unveil a Mao statue, he encountered a large number of petitioning peasants. Jiang was surrounded by the peasants for nearly one hour. Finally, the Hunan Provincial CPC Committee sent officials to coax the peasants to go away. The authorities thought that if the peasants were kept from migration, less trouble might happen. However, a research project conducted by the CPC Central Committee's Policy Research Office on the movement of the rural labor force between different regions showed that peasants were moving on a large scale, within broad areas, over a long period of time in all parts of the country, and they were also involved in more and more trades and industries. As long as peasants leave home, they will immediately find that they are living at the bottom of society, and they cannot match urban residents in any aspect. They will even feel that they are being exploited by the urban residents. This is root cause of the potential turmoil. According to the findings of the research project, in the six provinces of Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Jiangxi, people going out to seek jobs numbered 24 million in 1993 as compared with only 2 million in 1982. If peasants from all parts of the country are included, the number is be much greater. Resentment also existed among people who were neither workers nor peasants. Even urban residents also learned to express their discontent by taking to the streets. There were two petition incidents in Shanghai recently, and the municipal government was driven to an embarrassing position. In one case, the residents found that government land requisition was unfair, so several hundred people held a sit-in in front of the government building. Shanghai television broadcast this event. The municipal government originally hoped that the television report might explain the situation to the residents so that the dispute might calm down more quickly. However, the station even broadcast footage that showed the miserable conditions of the residents, and the petitioners won wider sympathy from other people. In another case, a large number of Shanghai people were taken in by unscrupulous merchants who sold counterfeit rings, and they petitioned the authorities for seeking help. Various signs showed that if any events occurred and triggered off widespread popular indignation and resentment, the authorities would not be able to bring the situation under control any more. In order to prevent the potential crisis, the authorities had no other option but taking preemptive highhanded measures.
