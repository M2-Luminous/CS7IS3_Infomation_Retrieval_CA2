The PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate made this commitment during talks he held today in Bonn with representatives of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. During a recent visit to Bonn, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim had assured German Government officials interested in the progress of that plant that it would be built. Yet Lula and Marco Aurelio Garcia, the external area coordinator of the PT program, did not succeed in convincing German businessmen. They were both evasive regarding foreign trade financing and the PT approach to the foreign debt. The representative of the Deutsch Sud Amerikan Bank walked out of the room in protest over Lula's confusing positions about the Brazilian reality. In a meeting with German Vice Foreign Minister Helmut Schafer, Lula stated that a PT government would honor all of the agreements signed by Brazil regarding nuclear nonproliferation and the missile control regime.
