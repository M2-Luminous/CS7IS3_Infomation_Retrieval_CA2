DPA learned this from government circles on Thursday [7 April]. This already applies to the next batch, which would have been due on 15 April and comprises optical gun sights and spare parts. The decision was made in coordination between the Chancellor's Office, the Defense Ministry, and the Foreign Ministry. According to information provided by the responsible government circles, the decisive factor was the current examination of claims that Turkey is using materiel from German armament deliveries against Kurdish guerrillas in the country, which violates the NATO treaty. NATO equipment aid, which is to be provided until the end of the year and is not to be resumed as of 1995, includes, among other things, 16 F4-F jets. This outdated photographic reconnaissance version of the double-jet U.S. combat fighter is being gradually discharged by the FRG Air Force.
