ACTION: Public land order. SUMMARY: This order revokes a public land order insofar as it affects 60 acres of National Forest System land withdrawn by the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, for the Albeni Falls Dam Project in the Kaniksu National Forest. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn. This action will open the land to surface entry and mining, and will permit the Forest Service to dispose of the land by exchange. The land has been and will remain open to mineral leasing. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Larry R. Lievsay, BLM Idaho State Office, 3380 Americana Terrace, Boise, Idaho 83706&hyph;2500, 208&hyph;384&hyph;3166. By virtue of the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior by Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988), it is ordered as follows: 1. Public Land Order No. 1703, which withdrew National Forest System land for the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers' Albeni Falls Dam Project, is hereby revoked insofar as it affects the following described land: Boise Meridian T. 56 N., R. 4 W., Sec. 34, lots 3 and 4. The area described contains 60 acres in Bonner County. 2. At 9 a.m. on June 15, 1994, the land shall be opened to such forms of disposition as may by law be made of National Forest System land, including location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. Appropriation of land described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. Dated: May 4, 1994. Bob Armstrong, Assistant Secretary of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11811 Filed 5&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;GG&hyph;M
