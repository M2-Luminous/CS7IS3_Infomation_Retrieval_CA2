Although the United States did not use the veto against the resolution, it did something worse by opposing the consolidation of Palestinian identity in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with Jerusalem as an integral part of it. It is difficult for us to see this U.S. position as anything but negative, especially as the Arabs -- individually and collectively -- offered numerous concessions to make the peace process sponsored by Washington a success. The danger in the U.S. abstention from voting lies not only in the complete bias toward Israel and its crimes in the occupied territories, but in the credibility of the peace process sponsored by it in its early and final stages. If the United States does not believe that the occupied territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are Palestinian territory, this means it espouses the Israeli position, which regards them as disputed territories -- which conflicts with all international charters and laws and the letters of guarantees and assurances the U.S. Administration sent to the parties concerned and on the basis of which it participated in the Madrid peace conference. As for the U.S. abstention from considering Jerusalem an integral part of the occupied Arab territories, it can only be interpreted in one way: There is no guarantee of the inclusion of this fundamental issue on the agenda of the final phase of negotiations. And even if it is included, it might not encounter U.S. support. This U.S. position put all Arabs, not just the Palestinians, in a very embarrassing position. Because the Arabism of the land has become threatened and the future of sovereignty over Jerusalem has become more vague. What arouses astonishment and amazement is some Arab parties' rush to respond to the "telephone" demand by the U.S. to return to the negotiations, without having obtained specific clarifications to determine the true U.S. position after the recent voting, especially with regard to the identity of Jerusalem. More than one Israeli newspaper has quoted U.S. President Bill Clinton as calling Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel. We were surprised by some Arab newspapers' rush to publish a denial of these remarks by U.S. officials who volunteered to make this denial to save the Clinton administration among Arab circles. The abstention of the U.S. representative to the Security Council from the vote on considering Jerusalem part of the occupied territories justifies Israeli press reports about President Clinton's position on Jerusalem and his view of its future -- a dishonorable situation for the Arabs at any rate. And if Dr. Barukh Goldstein and those who participated with him in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron have revealed serious loopholes in the declaration of principles agreement vis-a-vis the Palestinians' security in the occupied territories, the recent voting in the UN Security Council has revealed bigger loopholes in the U.S. position on fundamental issues -- loopholes that could kill the current peace process in all its early and final stages. All the calamities afflicting the Arabs are the result of the lack of coordination among the parties concerned and the complete submission to U.S. policies in the region, beginning with the embargo imposed on Iraq through to the sanctions imposed on Libya and the swift response to the appeals to return to the negotiating table without any conditions or guarantees. It is regrettable that the Hebron massacre and the subsequent smaller massacres, which occurred in confrontations between Arab demonstrators and Israelis armed to the teeth, should take place and yet we hear no Arab call to convene an Arab League meeting at any level to discuss the matter and agree on a unified plan to raise the issue in international forums.
