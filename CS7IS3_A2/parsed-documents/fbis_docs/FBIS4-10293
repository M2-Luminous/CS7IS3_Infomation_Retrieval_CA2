FBIS4-10293 "drlat069_o_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Colombia Denies Meddling in Munoz Case Denies Meddling in Munoz Case PA1004183894 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 16A PA1004183894 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Spanish BFN ["Text" of communique issued by the Prosecutor General's Office in Santa Fe de Bogota on 7 April] [Text] In view of the wrong interpretations that some media have made regarding the letter sent by Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff to Honorable Judge Sterling Johnson, the Prosecutor General's Office states the following: 1. [number as published] The Prosecutor General's Office, in its missive, simply provided the honorable judge with a piece of information requested by the defense lawyers of Mr. Dandenys Munoz Mosquera in the sense that a person being prosecuted in Colombia had claimed responsibility for the unfortunate incidents surrounding the bomb attack on Avianca Flight No. 203 and that no charges had been filed against the person being prosecuted in the United States. Constitutional mandate (Article 250) states that in Colombia the Prosecutor General's Office is compelled to investigate both the favorable as well as unfavorable elements surrounding the case of an indicted person, and, as a result, the prosecutor general contends it is his duty to inform the honorable U.S. judge about the information being requested by the defense lawyers of Mr. Munoz Mosquera without attempting to meddle in the judge's jurisdiction, let alone to assume the defense of a person being prosecuted in another country. That is why the information provided by the Prosecutor General's Office does not contain statements but, rather, specific verifiable facts that should be taken into consideration by those in charge of determining the person's culpability in the incidents. Just as in the past, the Colombian Prosecutor General's Office has provided the documents requested by the U.S. Justice Department that led to the correct identification of Dandenys Munoz Mosquera and to his sentencing in that country for the crime of providing false identification. The office has also provided the list of charges that have been brought against him in Colombia, including charges against him for his participation in a band of paid assassins and the judicial charges against him for the possession of weapons and for assisting in a prison escape. In this case, at the request of Munoz's defense attorneys, the prosecutor general is referring to a specific incident, the Avianca case, for which Munoz is not responsible, according to the evidence on the case contained in our country's files.
