The leaders at various levels and the masses should emancipate their mind, change ideas, and smash the bonds of the planned economy. On 12 June, accompanied by Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; and Wang Xianming, secretary general of the provincial party committee, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party committee, went to Shuangyashan city to conduct investigations and study. He respectively inspected the country fair trade town of Jixian County and several enterprises, including a marble plant. Yue Qifeng said: Shuangyashan city is an industrial city with rich coal resources. So, it is very important for the city to grasp coal production. However, an economically strained situation will certainly emerge if this city only lays an emphasis on coal production at the expense of neglecting the development of other industries and diversification of the economy. Therefore, we should attach importance to the development of the county-level economy but must not simply regard the rural areas as an accessory to urban areas. As long as the rural economy is well developed, essential changes will take place in the overall economic pattern. Yue Qifeng maintained: Up to now, our province has been subject to the pattern of a planned economy because although we stand by a gold mountain, we live a poor life. Our province's wasteland, lakes, and coal fields are important resources. But, we do not make good use of them. Our province still fails to turn its special products, such as aquatic products and mountain products, into advantages of appropriate scale. Therefore, we should give free rein to vigorously developing town and township enterprises, and mobilize the masses to develop the natural resources in stages and then process natural resources intensively and precisely. So, the governments at various levels should create a favorable environment for town and township enterprises, and [words indistinct]. Yue Qifeng said: Town and township enterprises are important sources for secondary financial resources. So far, it has been necessary to change the current situation so that now 80 percent of the province's financial resources are from state-owned large enterprises. Heilongjiang will become hopeless if it does not develop secondary financial resources. Yue Qifeng stressed: Emancipating the mind, changing ideas, straightening out the strategic ideology of economic development, being inspired with enthusiasm, making concerted efforts, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of all fronts is a major task ahead of the whole province. Only when we strive to grasp and fulfill this task can an overall economic development situation possibly emerge in Heilongjiang.
