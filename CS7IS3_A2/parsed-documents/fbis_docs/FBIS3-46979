"I believe that the request will be accepted by all MPs in the spirit of national reconciliation," Chea Sim told AFP. However, the move was adamantly opposed by many MPs from the royalist FUNCINPEC party, several MPs confirmed. One of those at the centre of the controversial request is Prince Norodom Chakrapong -- half brother and bitter foe of co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh -- who was deputy prime minister in the former communist Phnom Penh regime. The other is the former National Security Minister General Sin Song. The two resigned their seats in parliament to lead a secessionist movement to protest against the Cambodian People's Party's loss to FUNCINPEC in the U.N.-supervised polls in May. The movement collapsed within a few days and the leaders' seats in parliament were subsequently occupied by other CPP representatives as the former battlefield foes formed a coalition government. The prince and the general, however, recently reappeared out of the political wilderness claiming they wished to "serve the nation" and indicated they wanted to return to their seats in parliament. Chea Sim expressed his hope that the party leaders would instruct their members to approve the move beforehand so the reinstatement would not meet opposition in parliament. But FUNCINPEC MP Ahmad Yahya said it was "illegal" to let the two men back into the assembly as the constitution prohibited it. The constitution states that in the case of death, resignation or dismissal of an MP, "another representative shall be chosen to replace him or her". Another royalist MP deemed the move against the law. "Normally the law would not allow for the return of these two persons to the National Assembly, but Chea Sim counts on the spirit of national unity to accept these two persons back," he said. "Formally speaking the law does not allow this and he acknowledges this." Although ardently opposed to move, the FUNCINPEC MP said he was a "disciplined party member" and would abide by the official party line on the matter. When asked what the official line was, cabinet director to co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh Ly Thuch had no comment. Party Secretary General and Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Norodom Sirivut was unavailable for comment. But MP Ahmad Yahya said there was no room for compromise on the issue. "Even if the party agrees on it, I am going against it," he said. "I do not want to do something illegal and I believe many others will support me". Another FUNCINPEC MP said the two hardliners were "blackmailing" the party leadership to get their seats back. "Chakrapong and Sin Song threaten that if they are discarded from power, they will reveal many things bad to the CPP mainstream," he said. "They're blackmailing them." The radical Khmer Rouge claimed the attempt to rehabilitate the two secessionists proved that the government was still under the control of the leaders of the former Phnom Penh regime -- despite the fact Prince Ranariddh is co-premier and FUNCINPEC is the largest party in the coalition government. By appointing "traitors, killers and corrupt officials" as MPs, the government was "eating the flesh, drinking the blood, and sucking the marrow from the Khmer people's bones", a Khmer Rouge statement said.
