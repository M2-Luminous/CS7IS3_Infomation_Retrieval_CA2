At a regular press conference at the presidential office, Tai said that Li would be glad to accept the invitation to visit the United States extended to him by U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Hank Brown (R-Colorado), but that his willingness to visit could not by itself guarantee that a visit will come off, given that the invitation did not come from the Clinton administration itself. However, a Li visit to the United States would be good for the economic and trade relationship and cultural interflow between the two countries, Tai noted. Taiwan is the sixth-largest trading partner of the United States and along with the United States is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, Tai said. He quoted Li as saying that if given the chance, he would also visit Britain, France, Germany, or any place a visit would benefit Taiwan.
