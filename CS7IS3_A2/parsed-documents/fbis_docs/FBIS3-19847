[Kanther] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. [Wickert] Mr. Kanther, how was the nationwide action by the Kurds possible without the police knowing about it? [Kanther] We will clear up this matter. I believe that the violent criminals must be arrested immediately. All possible investigations have to be initiated by the police. [Wickert] It would be important to know why that was possible. The Kurds started their actions several days ago. The police should have known that something might happen. [Kanther] We know that, unfortunately, the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] can rely on good logistic structures -- not only in Germany. It is also clear that we will have to increase our efforts to obtain relevant information. The ban of the PKK was an initial step. However, it is obvious that we must adopt more far-reaching measures. [Wickert] Are the current incidents not proof that the ban of the PKK was not efficient? [Kanther] No, it is the other way around. The question is: Should we have refrained from this step and done nothing? We naturally collected information and data, and we found weapons but not enough. Thus, we must now adopt tough measures against the offenders and use this opportunity to obtain additional information on the PKK. The ban must be further implemented, and the possibilities provided by the aliens' law -- particularly deportation -- must be fully utilized. [Wickert] Do you proceed from the premise that the PKK is behind the actions? [Kanther] I am quite certain. [Wickert] Can you prove it? [Kanther] I am certain that there are no other Kurdish organizations that would have been in a position to organize rallies by hundreds of thousands of people in several large German towns last Sunday [20 March]. I am convinced that today's actions on the motorways were organized by the same group. I will do everything possible to use these data together with the interior ministers of the laender to initiate criminal proceedings and trials on the basis of the aliens' law. [Wickert] You are offering the laender the help of the Federal Border Police. Do you believe the police in the laender are not capable of solving the problem? [Kanther] No, not at all. I am convinced that my counterparts in the laender -- the interior ministers -- are aware of the danger that these actions pose in the criminal sense. I am sure they know that these actions may disturb the peaceful coexistence between Germans and foreigners -- between Germans and Kurds in particular. They will take vigorous action to clear up these things. However, if barricades are established in many places on motorways and if fires are laid, the help of the Federal Border Police might be welcome. This is the reason I offered it. [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Kanther. [Kanther] Good bye, Mr. Wickert.
