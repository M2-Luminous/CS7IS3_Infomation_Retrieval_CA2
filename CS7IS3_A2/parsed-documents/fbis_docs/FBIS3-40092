This symposium was jointly sponsored by the Enterprise Department of the State Bureau of State-Asset Management, the Research Department of the Chinese Industrial Economics Association, the Wage Institute under the Labor Ministry, the journal JINGJI GUANLI, and the Siyuan Merger and Bankruptcy Consulting Agency of Beijing, and was organized by the Siyuan Agency. One hundred and thirty-six people, including representatives of the relevant agencies of the central and local governments, the Supreme People's Court and some superior and intermediate people's courts, enterprises, institutions of high learning, institutions of scientific and technological research, news organizations, and the International Bankruptcy Association and renowned bankruptcy judges and accountants from Poland and Hong Kong, participated in the symposium. The symposium carried out extensive and in-depth discussions of policy issues which had emerged in the process of handling enterprise mergers and bankruptcies after the going into effect of the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of our country, and which needed to be resolved. Combining discussion and study, combining theory with practice, combining the government and private individuals, and having entrepreneurs, scholars, and government officials "perform on the same stage" were prominent features of this symposium. Cao Siyuan, president of the Siyuan Agency, thoroughly expounded the proposed draft of the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law (Tentative) of the People's Republic of China that he had put forward. According to him, in revising the bankruptcy law, it is necessary to follow three principles: First, move further toward international practices; second, be conducive to improving case-handling efficiency during the process of implementation; and, third, pay attention to maintaining continuity. Therefore, he favored moderate revision rather than radical revision. The nine revision proposals put forward by him were as follows: 1) Extend the scope of application from all people-owned enterprises to all enterprise legal persons. 2) The statement of the legislative purpose should be simplified, and should not have ideological colors. 3) Bankruptcy should be defined in a uniform way and it should be clearly stipulated that bankruptcy mean "being unable to pay debts as they are due." 4) As for the issue of placement of employees of bankrupt enterprises, since the State Council has already issued rules, there are no additional rules in the text. 5) It is necessary to abolish some rules such as the rule that a petition in bankruptcy or for amicable settlement and consolidation has to be approved by the enterprise's supervisory agency and endorsed by the workers' congress after discussion. 6. Introduce the concept of the bankrupt's creditor. 7) Shorten bankruptcy cases' handling time, and one measure in this regard will be to change the time limit on filing creditor claims from three months to two months. 8) Do not directly cite criminal law provisions in the bankruptcy law; it would be adequate to just have the explicit wording in accordance with the relevant criminal law provisions. 9. The work of establishing liquidation teams should be regulated by the market. The main current obstacle, he also said, to the implementation of the bankruptcy law is that in the course of implementing the bankruptcy system, creditors, especially the banks, lack the enthusiasm for using the bankruptcy law to protect their own economic interests; the second is the issue of placement of employees of bankrupt enterprises. China will see the emergence of a new industry--the property rights trading industry and the emergence of the new occupation of the "merger producers," he predicted very confidently. Their business is to "trade" in enterprises, and "trading" in enterprises is not a bad thing. They buy enterprises, have the enterprises consolidated, transformed, and packaged, and then sell the enterprises. After going through this process, enterprises would emerge with entirely new looks, and would have levels of efficiency totally different from those in the past. Turning from "money eating" enterprises into "money spitting" enterprises. Producers of enterprise mergers would make a great deal of money through first devouring and then throwing up enterprises. But such money is not made through exploiting national calamities but made through benefiting from competition and prosperity. Professor Xiao Zhuoji of Beijing University made five points with regard to the issue of merger and bankruptcy. First, merger and bankruptcy represent the objective demands of a market economy. Under a market economy, the law of survival of the fittest is effective, and it is inevitable that some enterprises will face bankruptcy; at the same time some enterprises need to develop and grow and the main way to develop is to have mergers. Second, merger and bankruptcy constitute an important way to have resources allocated in an optimum manner and can result in limited resources being transferred to sectors and industries equipped with advantageous conditions, thereby producing economies of scale which are conducive to the development of the social productive forces. Third, merger and development themselves would improve the overall quality of enterprises. To enterprises, merger represents a driving force, and bankruptcy represents a pressure. Because of such a driving force and pressure, every enterprise must strive to improve the standards of its business operation and management; otherwise, it would face the danger of elimination. Fourth, merger and bankruptcy constitute an effective way to safeguard state properties. A loss making enterprise is subsidized by the state, and the state's losses are unlimited; however, if the bankruptcy method is used, there will be some losses of state property, but the losses will be limited. Furthermore, it is possible to utilize the original assets for making up the losses through transferring properties. Fifth, merger and bankruptcy also constitute an important way to maintain social stability. If some enterprises which should be liquidated are kept alive with difficulty, it would seem on the surface that workers are not unemployed and society would seem stable; but society's resources would be wasted or remain idle, and such a situation would mean the greatest instability. Only by adopting the merger and bankruptcy method so as to achieve the optimum allocation of resources, develop the economy, and improve efficiency, would it be possible to fundamentally ensure social stability. Guan Weili, director of the Enterprise Department of the Bureau of State-Asset Management, put forward ten ideas on the issue of enterprise merger and bankruptcy. 1) Enterprise bankruptcy and merger are an indispensable link in the market economy, and merger and bankruptcy constitute the main way of adjusting the allocation of factors of production. 2) Bankruptcy and merger can both be positive means, and constitute metabolism. Letting bankrupt enterprises control resources means wasting resources, and it would be better to have bankrupt enterprises absorbed by enterprises equipped with advantageous conditions. At the present stage, it is proper to take larger steps with respect to merger and bankruptcy. 3) The current situation of state-owned enterprises has two major characteristics: First, the level of efficiency is low while the problem of asset washout is serious. Some enterprises cannot be saved, while some others are not suited to remaining in their respective industries; to them, merger and bankruptcy are good things. Second, the speed is high but the figures are inflated; the situation is governed by plans but also unbalanced. Enterprises face a heavy task of carrying out structural readjustment. 4) To have mergers and bankruptcies, it is first of all necessary to clearly define property right relationships and to make clear who have ownership; we must have agencies which exercise ownership rights over enterprises. In the transition period, enterprises' supervisory agencies must continue to exercise supervisory and management rights. 5) It is proper not to take away an enterprise's legal person status after it has been absorbed, and this practice can serve as a nonstandardized method, and be reflected in some way in the future enterprise merger law. 6) To have enterprise mergers as well as bankruptcies, it is necessary to transform the function of financial institutions. 7) Amidst enterprise bankruptcies and mergers, it is necessary to resolve the issue of placement of employees. 8) To have enterprise bankruptcies as well as mergers, we must establish a system of asset evaluation. 9) Change views, clarify understanding, and have a new understanding of the property right structure of state assets. 10) Enterprise bankruptcy and merger are dependent on the establishment, development, and perfecting of a property rights trading market. Enterprise bankruptcy itself needs a market; the existing state-asset management agencies and structural reform agencies are doing the relevant work in this respect. The Enterprise Merger Society established by the symposium should play its due role in this respect. Dr. Li Shuguang, vice president of the Siyuan Agency, submitted to the symposium the proposed text of the Enterprise Merger Law (Draft) prepared by the research group led by him, and delivered a speech entitled "The Development of the Market Economy Needs an Enterprise Merger Law," expounding the proposed text. The main breakthroughs and additions contained in "The Proposed Text" with regard to the existing economic laws and regulations were: Clarifying the legislative purpose and application scope of the Enterprise Merger Law as well as the concept of enterprise merger; containing specific rules on the modes and categories of enterprise merger and on merger agreements; containing clear rules on dividing enterprise assets in merger asset evaluation under the new accounting system and on sources of funds for mergers; containing more detailed rules on the placement of employees of absorbed enterprises than "The Tentative Provisions"; containing a chapter dealing exclusively with "legal responsibilities." The purpose was to raise the merger law's statutes and authority in an effort to impose norms on the conduct of all parties. "The Proposed Text" aroused strong reactions from the participants of the symposium. According to the participating foreign scholars and experts, China should, as other countries, have a merger law which, while in line with international practices, is also appropriate to China's realities. People from government agencies and the business community argued that both carrying out practical work and invigorating the merger market would keenly need the Enterprise Merger Law, and expressed the hope that this law would come into being as soon as possible.
