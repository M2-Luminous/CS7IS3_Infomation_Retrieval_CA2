Last year's cold weather brought about a poor harvest of rice crops throughout Japan, forcing the government to import rice from foreign producers as an emergency measure. The northern and eastern regions of Japan are known as rice producing areas and officials said the expected cold weather for a second year in a row may possibly result in another poor harvest.
