AL-'AHD met with him shortly before he left to return to Afghanistan and spoke with him about key issues in Afghanistan. [Salman] Can you apprise us of the political climate in Afghanistan since the departure of communist rule? ['Alami] Let me first salute the souls of the martyrs of truth, the martyrs of Lebanon and Afghanistan, and the martyrs of the Islamic world. After the overthrow of Najibollah's rule and control over Kabul, the mojahedin groups met in Peshawar, Pakistan, which is considered the center of gravity of the mojahedin because of the many Afghan political groups there. Everyone agreed that Sebghatollah Mojaddedi [faction leader of Jebheh-ye Nejat-e Melli--the National Liberation Front] would be the president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for one month and that Borhanoddin Rabbani would assume the presidency after him for four months, during which Mr. Rabbani was to prepare the climate for general elections, so that the people could voice their opinion regarding who was to be entrusted with the political program that would determine Afghanistan's future. However, Mr. Rabbani unfortunately did not implement the plan under which he assumed the presidency for an interim period. Instead, he formed a consultative council of influential people, comprising his followers and members of this entourage. And he did so without at least consulting with the mojahedin movements or parties. That complicated problems and deepened disagreements, ultimately resulting in battles erupting between the Afghan political parties. These parties became divided into two groups. One group, loyal to Rabbani, comprises Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union] led by 'Abdol Rasul Sayyaf, and Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party]--Yunes Khales faction. The latter two are Wahhabi groups. The other group includes most of the Afghan opposition parties, headed by Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami and Hezb-e Eslami--Hekmatyar faction under Golboddin Hekmatyar. At this point, the Islamic republics in Iran and Pakistan thankfully sent delegations to resolve the problem. They were able to obtain the consent of all of the parties to hold negotiations in Islamabad, Pakistan. The Islamabad negotiations produced an agreement between all of the political parties in Afghanistan. The agreement stipulated that Rabbani remain president of the country and that Hekmatyar be appointed prime minister. The agreement was signed in Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, each of whom signed official texts of the agreement. Mr. Rabbani was obligated to set a date for elections after preparing the atmosphere, and the people were supposed to elect representatives in complete freedom to form a state based on these elections. However, the regime's consultative [council], under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, Jami'at-e Eslami's military commander, and 'Abdol Rasul Sayyaf, the faction leader of Ettehad-e Eslami, did not implement this agreement. They voided it. The war erupted anew, preventing the government from performing its functions in the central capital of Kabul. [Salman] What are the domestic and regional political circumstances that produced the Islamabad Agreement? ['Alami] As I have said, Mr. Rabbani, who was appointed to be president for an interim period after Mojaddedi's presidency tenure ended, was not committed to readying an appropriate climate for elections. He formed an interim parliament representing his interests and was able to ensure his reappointment as president of the country for two years. This is what most of the other mojahedin movements--such as Hezb-e Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami, Harekat-e Watani-ye Eslami [National Islamic Movement], Jebheh-ye Nejat-e Melli, Harekat-e Eslami, and others--objected to. They considered it illegal. Battles erupted in Kabul. Then, delegations arrived from Pakistan and Iran as reconciliation committees. Immediately after the mediations succeeded, former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called for negotiations in Islamabad. Those negotiations led to the Islamabad agreement, which was signed by all of the mojahedin movements in Afghanistan and by the sponsor countries, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. Despite the agreement's deficiencies and unfair treatment of Hezb-e Wahdat-e Melli [National Unity Party] and many other parties, we signed it to achieve a reconciliation in Afghanistan. Regarding the regional factors, it is well known that the efforts of our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in Pakistan, despite the difficulty of bringing all of the parties together for talks, opened the door to the Islamabad agreement. [Salman] It is said that the Islamabad agreement is a minimalist agreement. What are Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami's observations regarding the agreement? ['Alami] In the matter of the Islamabad agreement, the Pakistanis dealt with the Afghan political reality based on two factions, one headed by Hekmatyar and the other by Rabbani. Regarding this division, we noted that the problem concerns the Afghan people and its representatives in the mojahedin movements, not individuals. Also, what was agreed upon was not honored. Furthermore, the stature and presence of other movements and parties--such as Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami and Harekat-e Watani-ye Eslami, which enjoy a strong political, popular, and military position--were disregarded and not taken into account. We agreed to sign, despite this lack of fairness, out of our commitment to our people's interest and the country's supreme interests. Then, this agreement was an interim agreement. Its duration is coming to an end without the climate having been prepared for elections, as the agreement stipulates. [Salman] Could you address the obstacles blocking the Constitution Writing Committee that was to be formed under the Islamabad agreement? ['Alami] If elections had been held as agreed in Islamabad, the people would have formed a committee to write a constitution. However, this did not happen. In this regard, Mr. Rabbani, as the person directly responsible for holding elections, should be asked about the reason for the delay. [Salman] You said that the agreement is an interim agreement whose end has approached. What is the solution in your opinion? ['Alami] Officials of the parties should meet to arrive at a solution agreed to by everyone, determine the destiny of the people and the country, and stop the bleeding. Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami--through its secretary general, Sheykh 'Abdol 'Ali Mazari--has recommended that both Mr. Rabbani and Mr. Hekmatyar resign, and that general presidential and parliamentary elections be held. [Salman] If this recommendation is not implemented, can the present government, as a government of national unity, be a forum for dialogue that can produce something new for the future? ['Alami] This is possible, because Mr. Hekmatyar and the members of the government meet periodically at Darolaman Palace (the center of the government), from which President Rabbani is absent for reasons unknown. [Salman] Do Mr. Rabbani's authorities empower him to intervene to block a political measure undertaken by the government regarding a conciliation? ['Alami] The Jalalabad agreements give authorities to Mr. Rabbani and Mr. Hekmatyar. However, due to a lack of cooperation on the part of the president of the republic, there was no opportunity to exercise these authorities. [Salman] In other words, the authorities given to Mr. Hekmatyar remain inactive. ['Alami] This is because the Jalalabad agreements were not implemented. They laid the foundation for a practical program to implement the Islamabad agreement. Naturally, Mr. Hekmatyar has not exercised the authorities granted him in the agreements, because the agreements were not implemented, because Mr. Rabbani is blocking them. It is only natural that political alliances in Kabul with or against Mr. Hekmatyar will affect the exercise of his authorities. [Salman] Does that mean that political alliances play a role in impeding implementation of the agreements? ['Alami] Somewhat. [Salman] Do the new ethnic alliances play a negative or positive role in this respect? ['Alami] They have a positive effect in pressing for implementation of the agreement. The ethnic alliance facing Mr. Rabbani comprises more than 70 percent of the Afghan people. Mr. Rabbani cannot rely on this element, which was supportive of change in the past. Perhaps his evasion of implementing the agreements and of holding elections is related to the weakness of his alliances. [Salman] Does that mean that ethnic balances have resulted in the separation of northern Afghanistan? ['Alami] I find that farfetched, because Mr. Rabbani rejects this matter. [Salman] In view of all of these givens, in your opinion, what is the most appropriate solution for Afghanistan's political problem? ['Alami] The only solution is for all the parties to sit down at the negotiating table. [Salman] It is said that Jami'at-e Eslami, under Rabbani's leadership, fears an alliance between Hezb-e Eslami and Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami, and it feels that it would be excluded from the game. What guarantees would you and your allies offer if all of the parties sit down at the negotiating table? ['Alami] All guarantees are possible. Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami and Hezb-e Eslami are ready to discuss anything, provided that foreign powers bent on destroying the Islamic jihad in Afghanistan and on discrediting the victory it achieved after the termination of communist rule do not interfere. [Salman] Is Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami preparing an initiative or some mediation in this regard? ['Alami] There are initiatives. Jami'at-e Eslami is well aware of this. A number of meetings were held between Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami and Jami'at-e Eslami. Then, a central delegation headed by Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami Secretary General Sheykh 'Abdol 'Ali Mazari met with Rabbani and Sayyaf. [Salman] What about Jami'at-e Eslami and Hezb-e Eslami? ['Alami] The relationship between Hezb-e Eslami and Jami'at-e Eslami requires greater trust and better intentions on the part of both parties. I think that the failure to implement the Jalalabad agreements provides an opportunity for the two to sit at the dialogue table. Otherwise, problems are possible. [Salman] In conclusion, we thank you. Do you have a final remark? ['Alami] I thank AL-'AHD. I wish, through it, to give a salute of respect to the mojahedin of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon and the intifadah in Palestine, because they are proving and confirming God's sublime utterance, "And [they are] never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault" [Koran 5:57], by standing on the front line in the confrontation with American and Zionist arrogance and fulfilling their divine mission with the utmost pride and honor. We entreat God to grant them victory and show them the right way to the victory of his religion.
