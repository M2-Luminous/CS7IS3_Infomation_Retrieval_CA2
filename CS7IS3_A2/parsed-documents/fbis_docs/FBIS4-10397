FBIS4-10397 "drlat070_b_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Haiti Senators, Party Leaders Criticize Resolution Senators, Party Leaders Criticize Resolution Larosiliere: Actions `Bluff' FL1104200894 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 11 Apr 94 FL1104200894 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Excerpt] Any viable solution to the Haitian crisis must facilitate the lifting of the embargo, according to statements by [Senator] Julio Larosiliere, who labels the actions of the second office of the Senate of the Republic a bluff. The true solution is the one that will answer the desiderata of the Haitian people, says Sen. Larosiliere. [Begin Larosiliere recording, in Creole] In my opinion, this is a bluff because any solution that does not take into account the entire Haitian people and the lifting of the embargo will fail, is not good. I have the impression that those who want it have something up their sleeve. Many of those who want it would like to see a government established even though they know it will not be ruling for longer than two months. Meanwhile, they will have time to dissolve the parliament, raise the money ceiling, put money into circulation. It will also allow them to put some money in their pockets. As exile does not harm them, this is not a problem for them, even if they find a way to remain in Haiti. But at least they will have time to make some money. [end recording] In addition, the quaestor of the legitimate [Senate] office has asked the 18 January senators to refrain from participating in the sessions, as provided for by the New York pact.
