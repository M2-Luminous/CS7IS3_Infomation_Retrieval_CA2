The debate, which is being held at the Atlapa Convention Center in Panama City, is sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies (ILDEA) and the Media Presidential Debate Committee, and is moderated by Ricardo Alberto Arias. Arias begins by saying the debate will focus on four topics: the national economy, the Panama Canal and reverted areas, social and political problems, and the country's present and future. Three television journalists will pose questions to the candidates: Luz Maria Noli of Televisora Nacional, Dora de Reyna of Telemetro Television, and Julio Miller of RPC Television. The debate gets under way with Noli asking Blades what he plans to do regarding the $3.4 billion in overdue payments the Panamanian Government owes international banks. Blades replies: "One possible answer is this: Nothing, which is exactly what those individuals in charge of negotiations on the foreign debt have been doing. We have a huge problem with the international banks. Under the current circumstances, we have no resources to amortize this debt." Blades continues by saying that, from 1982 to 1992, Latin America disbursed more than $110 billion for a debt that originally amounted to $330 billion and now amounts to $420 billion. He says the nation must concentrate on development when dealing with this "immoral and unpayable debt." Asked by Noli about Panama's commitment to repaying its foreign debt, Blades replies: "While the Papa Egoro Movement recognizes the debts contracted by the Panamanian state, it also takes into account the need to repay domestic debts, as well as the need to create conditions that will make economic development possible." Commenting on this same topic, Carles says: "These debts have been incurred by the state and must be repaid, but the various options available must be negotiated with dignity and firmness. I have already said that the current government should stop all negotiations with commercial banks and let the next government resolve this problem." Vallarino also comments on this issue: "Blades is right to a certain extent, but we cannot ignore the fact that Panama, for its entire commercial life, has been bounded to the international community. Although it was not the Panamanian people who incurred this debt, it was illegally agreed upon, the money has been spent, and we really have to repay it. We should seek rapprochement with the banks and try to utilize the Brady Plan or other options, such as exchanging our debts for environmental guarantees." When the discussion turns to how the Panamanian Government can meet its social goals in light of the burden of the foreign debt, Perez Balladares says: "Governments can implement their social programs in three ways. One is to levy taxes; another, to secure financing through public debt; the third, by way of savings." He fails to say which of these means he favors. According to Blades, a government with clearly outlined goals can successfully handle negotiations on the foreign debt. He says, "The problem we have had so far is that we have not been taken seriously." Next, Dora de Reina asks Carles how he plans to restructure public finances to encourage greater investment. Carles answers: "We must continue to stick to the methods we have been applying for four years, and we must apply them with discipline, seriousness, and honesty." When asked by Reina which government agencies he would concentrate on to attain his goals, Carles replies people should be required to act in a trustworthy manner. The problem in Panama, he says, is not money, but the way in which money is used. "We must ensure that those funds allocated to public services are returned to the public." Efficiency and willingness to work is the key, he says. Vallarino says he views investment differently. "The problem of investment in Panama is that investors must be able to trust in the government, and the government must be honest." He adds: "More investments are necessary, particularly from the private sector. This can be engendered by a country that inspires confidence." When discussing how to operate the government in tight financial times, Perez Balladares says he will encourage reduced public spending, although he admits this is not enough. He adds: "We are inviting the private sector to participate in financing and developing infrastructure works projects. The private and public sectors must work together to achieve national goals." Blades comments that the country's economic difficulties are artificial because the country possesses natural and human resources. "Panama's economic difficulties are the result of official corruption and the lack of willingness by authorities to develop the country. If we eliminate official corruption and the lack of imagination and willingness, the economic problems will disappear." Carles says he has been arguing for four years that the problem is not the lack of money but the use of available resources. "We depend very heavily on the private sector." Miller next asks candidate Vallarino if he thinks the next government should privatize some state enterprises. Vallarino replies: "The next government should privatize everything it can, but we must be careful not to harm workers with large-scale dismissals. Workers should also be allowed to share in the enterprises' ownership." Asked by Miller if obligations with the international financial institutions should be honored in relationship to this privatization, Vallarino replies that he never agreed with the obligations with international banks but that they exist so they must be honored. "Public interest comes first, then the state's interest. Public interest includes the people, families, and the unemployed." Perez Balladares comments: "The criterion for privatization should be greater social efficiency. I do not believe in privatization for the sake of privatization. I disagree with Mr. Vallarino." Blades adds that it is risky to privatize strategic national assets such as electric services and telecommunications. "I do not think any enterprise in Panama should be privatized if it would result in large-scale dismissals. If it must be done, we should first try to relocate the workers who would be fired." Carles argues that international banks should not be cause for too much concern about privatization matters. "We have to privatize services, not institutions. Certain activities of all existing institutions can be privatized to prevent loss, waste, corruption, and inefficiency." Vallarino concludes: "Privatization must benefit the workers. When I spoke about privatization, I meant all those services that are not monopolies. I disagree with Perez Balladares. Ventures in the 1970's and 1980's impoverished the Panamanian people and have cost many millions that could have been well invested in hospitals, schools, and roads." Noli then asks candidate Perez Balladares the last question on the national economy. Asked for his position on the money laundering charges made by the United States against Panama, Perez Balladares says: "Aside from cosmetic actions, this government has not taken the steps that should have been taken." He says corporations are chiefly to blame for this illegal activity. "The existing instruments in the banking system are good enough if they are used. All reports on deposits exceeding $10,000 should be fed into a central computer. That would make it possible to see at a glance if companies are making cash deposits that exceed the sales figures reported to the Finance Ministry. Someone should make sure that goods sold in the Colon Free Zone actually leave the area to prevent false sales, which can be used as a method of money laundering." Blades comments that money laundering is a very particular activity that will be very difficult to eradicate, but certain measures could be taken. He states: "Control over amounts up to $10,000 should be extended to pawn shops and loan companies. I am amused when I hear about smuggling, considering that we have 1,500 miles of coastline and only a few boats. I wonder why the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet ratified the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty." Carles says: "I cannot accept the North Americans' drug trafficking accusations against Panama after they issued good conduct certificates to Noriega." Thus ends the national economy segment. Regarding the topic of the Canal and the reverted areas, Reyna mentions that some analysts have suggested that the Neutrality Treaty curtails Panama's capability to generate revenues. She asks candidates if they have studied the subject and their opinion on the analysts' statement. Ruben Blades replies that ``although the Treaty does strain our capability to generate revenues, we should not emphasize the aspect of tolls.'' Blades emphasizes: "The Canal must have a broader function in addition to the simple aspect of toll rates. The Canal must be incorporated into a process of economic development and the creation of an array of services that do not now exist." Asked about an increase in toll rates, Blades argued that Panama cannot implement an increase out of the blue. He added: "I would call for a direct meeting with the United States and the countries that use the Canal most and tell them that we must do something because otherwise the operation, maintenance, and efficient management of the Canal will be at stake. I strongly believe they will be willing to accede to changes in the toll policy." On the same subject, Carles argues: "From any angle, the Canal is ours and we are the ones who, with good judgment and solid criteria, must decide on changes regarding the toll policy and services." Considering that Panama does not have a monopoly on interoceanic transportation, Panama must examine the effects an increase might have on Panama's competitive capability, he adds. Vallarino notes that although Article 3 of the Neutrality Treaty poses difficulties to Panama regarding tolls, they are negotiable. Vallarino stresses: "Article 4 sells our sovereignty, and that is why I do not agree with the argument that we should not look back." He says running for president is like applying for the most important and delicate job in the country and says presidential candidates must present their references just like any other job seeker. Perez Balladares agrees that users must have some input regarding the toll policy. He emphasizes: "What is important is not the revenues generated by tolls but the considerable wealth that the future utilization of areas bordering the Canal could generate." Blades concludes that increases should be considered only if they are necessary and that all the benefits resulting from the Canal's return to Panama must be invested nationwide. Miller next asks Carles if he agrees with the structure and functions of the ARI, the Interoceanic Region Authority. Carles replies that the ARI must be given an opportunity and be pressured to work efficiently and rapidly, because gaining control of the Canal is a blessed opportunity to profit from a geographic situation that is key to the country's development. Questioned by Miller on how to prevent the ARI and the Canal from becoming a political pinata, Carles says that it happened before during the military period. He adds: "I am optimistic that the ARI will be able to make significant contributions to the country's progress." Along this line, Vallarino asserts that the ARI is good and that it should draft all its regulations and send them to the National Assembly for approval. Vallarino believes that "to a great extent, the success of ARI depends on who is managing it, and that is the bottom line." Perez Balladares comments: "First, I believe that ARI decisions must be approved by the president before they are implemented. Second, the ARI board of directors must be broadened to include more sectors of Panamanian society." Blades states that there are a number of opinions regarding the use of the reverted areas. He claims: "I do have problems with the way the ARI has been drafted because I can see a future conflict between the path the ARI assumes and the path that I, as president, would assume regarding the tapping of the reverted areas." Noli then asks Vallarino for his opinion on recent polls showing that Panamanians want U.S. bases to stay in Panama. He replies that the Panamanian people are very much afraid of what the government will do with the reverted areas and bases because of the many failures. "Panamanians can put all the reverted areas to good use and create jobs. A project I studied a few days ago would provide between 25 and 50 percent of the jobs presently provided by the U.S. Armed Forces stationed in the Canal Zone." Asked by Noli if he would favor changes regarding the bases, Vallarino replies: "I would show the Panamanian people all the things that can be done with the reverted areas." Perez Balladares comments: "I think attention has been focused on the wrong issue. The military bases are a military problem, not an economic one. Wherever there are military bases, the two countries involved agree that the presence of those bases benefits them both militarily. In Panama's case, the North Americans have said clearly that they do not want to stay. If they have changed their mind, they should say so." Blades says the discussion seems like rhetoric. "Panama is better off without foreign military bases. We can reap high profits from the reverted areas and protect our national identity at the same time. An honest government can dispel fears of instability and economic depression." Carles counters by saying: "The national identity was destroyed by Omar Torrijos when he placed us under the Pentagon's umbrella." Vallarino comments that Panama should not offer the national territory for the bases to stay if the U.S. Government itself has said it is not interested. "I am sure that we can turn those bases into an emporium of wealth through honest work for the people's good. The return of the bases can mark the beginning of our great economic growth." Reyna asks Perez Balladares the last question on the constitutional amendment proposal on the canal, and he says it is not bad. "I would support constitutional reforms regarding the canal administration." As for the possibility of keeping party politics separate from canal affairs, he replies: "The country must make progress between elections and strive for national goals regardless of who governs the country during the five-year term. This is what we intend to do." Blades says that regardless of what the Constitution says, an honest government is required. Carles adds that the canal is a delicate matter. "The norms introduced in the proposal to amend the Constitution by the commission headed by Vallarino considers the most important subjects in the canal administration. We cannot wait until the year 2000." Vallarino says it is not normal to handle these things through the Constitution, "but considering the corruption we have seen, it is a good idea to include these things in the document to remove them from the influence of politics and nepotism and other forms of corruption in the government." This marks the end of the discussion on the canal and reverted areas and the topic turns to social and political problems. Miller asks Blades what he will do to solve the Social Security Fund members' complaints about the shortage of medicines and hospital beds. He replies that the Social Security Fund problem is a complex one. "The government owes the fund $828 million in bonds and notes payable. The state has been used to divert funds from certain institutions. In addition, the state has not developed national economic projects. Funds should be redirected to the health sector." Asked by Miller about the current retirement age, Blades replies that it is risky to speak of bigger pensions and retirement unless we can be sure of where the necessary funds will come from. "What we need is an honest government that manages health resources properly." Carles says the dictatorship and the PRD did away with the fund. "We should first consider the technical studies that have been done and proceed from there." Vallarino says the health problem is serious because many people cannot afford to pay for private services. Perez Balladares and Blades agree on the need to improve the services offered by the Social Security Fund. Carles adds that water service can be improved in a number of ways. Vallarino, Perez Balladares, and Blades agree. Reyna then says Panama lags behind the rest of the world in terms of education and asks Vallarino what he proposes to correct the situation. He replies that "teachers must be trained and reassured of their benefits and salaries. We must also build schools." Asked about the establishment of private universities, Vallarino says they will help raise Panama's cultural level. Perez Balladares says: "Our government will make education a priority." Blades says education is closely associated with health. "We have to make breakfast and lunch available to children while they are at school, but we must first make sure of our goals." Carles and Vallarino agree that education is fundamental. Miller next asks Perez Balladares about the crime rate linked to the lack of security. The candidate replies: "The police have to be given back their self-esteem." "Drug trafficking must be fought at its various stages. We must keep young people from being lured into it by strengthening the family. Schools must be protected, and traffickers must be punished. The police must be professionalized." Perez Balladares clarifies that by professionalization he does not mean militarization of the police, which should be professional nevertheless. Blades advocates attacking the causes of corruption. "Officials in positions of authority need to set good examples." Carles adds: "We need a civilian police force without traces of militarism. We should start by creating a real police academy." Vallarino says: "I think it is essential, as several have already said, that we must avoid impunity, we need to punish the guilty, especially those higher up and the white collar criminals, especially when they are public officials. We need to punish and act tough with those who are the true source of the drug problem." Perez Balladares agrees that the punitive part of drug control has to be beefed up but adds: "To truly face up to this problem we need to strengthen the structure of the Panamanian family." Arias announces that during this last stage of the debate with the four presidential candidates, "the topic will continue to be social and political problems. Due to time constraints, no follow-up questions will be allowed in this stage." Noli asks Blades, if he were president would he back a duty free port law for Bocas del Toro Province similar to the law already approved for Colon Province, since both places have similar unemployment problems. Blades replies that Papa Egoro is proposing something even better -- provincial inventories: "Each province is being examined to determine its human and natural resources and what are its infrastructure and public service needs. Once we can determine exactly what are the strong points of each province, we will then have the opportunity to truly define what the best path is, in economic terms, for each province. Nevertheless, as I know the people of Bocas del Toro are watching, they should know right now that similar to what has been done for Colon, they can rest assured that we are not going to forget them, as has been the case up to now." Carles then replies to the same question, stressing that Panama is a country and we cannot have the country sprinkled with duty free stores all over. Instead, Panama needs a national economic policy. "We must first test the Colon free port system and see how this concept works and then see what can be done in the future." Vallarino says that he welcomes the question because it gives him the opportunity to explain something: "You may not believe what I am about to say, but Colon is probably the richest city in the world on an average per capita income basis. Nevertheless, there are a number of people in Colon who live very, very, very badly. The problem is not Colon; the problem is helping the people of Colon take advantage of the opportunities they have around them." Perez Balladares replies: "To my way of thinking the Colon free port proposal is very appropriate for the area of Colon and its idiosyncrasy because Colon is located at one of the Canal's terminal ports. I sincerely do not believe this is applicable to other provinces of the Republic, which have a vocation for agriculture, self-production." Arias says that Reyna will ask Carles a question. Reyna says that in general, the government in Panama has kept women out of posts requiring responsibility. She asks whether Carles can make a formal promise for women's participation in his government. Carles replies that in the Comptroller General's Office nearly half the heads of department were women and that they were excellent workers. "In my administration women will have the same opportunities as men because experience tells of their capacity, dedication, and efficiency." Vallarino again refers to his party's pact and says: "In my government, if elected, all land deeds that are distributed will be in the name of the couple, in a family. Perez Balladares says: "I want to say that the idea is not to passively create equal conditions. I think that we must actively and positively establish equal conditions; and under equal conditions, we should favor women. Why do I say this? Because the contrary has been true historically." Blades points out that his Papa Egoro Movement is "the first party in Panama's history to offer, by statute, 50 percent of its positions to women." The candidate says he is pleased by his colleagues' opinion regarding women. Blades adds that "women must be considered not only simply for humanitarian reasons, but because they are simply better educated, in primary and secondary school and the university, and it would be absurd to not use their intellect in a national development project." Carles says that "people are treated equally if they have opportunities and are capable. In Panama, education has been offered to men and women and this is why both sexes are able to compete in the private and public sectors. I think that Panamanian women will have great opportunities in the future. We have respected their status and will continue to give them opportunities and responsibilities." Journalist Miller points out that the citizens are constantly complaining about the high rates of utilities, such as electricity. He asks Vallarino whether he will promote a decrease in rates. Vallarino answers: "Definitely yes. Public utility companies are monopolies, and as with all monopolies, they abuse people. They abuse with poor services and high rates." He calls for the regulation of public utilities as should be done with any monopoly. Perez Balladares says that "we must find ways to ensure efficiency in the granting of public services." He calls for the privatization of certain services. Blades points out that this situation is "a product of corruption and administrative inefficiency." He calls for a law to force, for example, the telephone company, to invest a certain amount of money to improve its services. Blades proposes a law to allow public utility companies to be run with the same flexibility that private companies are run. Carles recalls that he has faced this problem for years. He adds that public enterprises "must be supervised and controlled; we must strive to prevent the continued growth of such institutions when many of their activities can be privatized." As examples, Carles lists cellular telephones, electricity, and water processing plants. Journalist Noli poses the last question of this debate to Perez Balladares. She notes that the state payroll was reduced by nearly 5,000 persons but salaries increased by $5.39 million in 1993. Noli asks the candidate how he will effectively reduce state bureaucracy without further worsening the unemployment situation. Perez Balladares points out that "we must clearly say that the private sector is the one that can create jobs in the future, not the state." He adds that public servants earning low salaries were fired and new servants with higher salaries were hired. This is, he says, not only unjust but absurd. Perez Balladares points out that the public sector is generally efficient. He notes that "I think that all candidates have been excessively harsh in criticizing the public sector. I am very proud of our public sector." Perez Balladares says public employees could be better paid to ensure they do a better job. He promises to promote approval of the civil service law because public servants deserve respect.
