Baykonur, which accounts for a third of all the country's space launches and from which all the manned programs are executed, has today become one of the most complicated problems in interstate relations. After receiving the ministry of foreign affairs, the Russian military -- specifically, acting chief of the cosmodrome, Maj. Gen. Grafinin -- assured him that the solution to the situation would be an agreement in which we leased, from Kazakhstan, the cosmodrome and the city of Leninsk, which covers 6,711 sq km of the Kzyl-Orda Oblast. The cosmodrome can be saved -- that is, not only its infrastructure of nine launch complexes and 15 launch pads designed to launch rockets ranging from the small Tsiklons to the superheavy Protons, but also its unique technologies and first-class specialists -- only if it is operating, if there are launches. The military department wants guarantees of ownership of at least the shipments subsequent to 31 August 1991, which is when the cosmodrome was declared the property of Kazakhstan, because the organizations involved in executing space programs are feel apprehensive about participating in tests at Baykonur until its legal status is ascertained. Kazakhstan today, of course, is not in a position to maintain that monstrous complex, which takes R38 billion monthly to stay in operation. To many, the creation of a Russian military base at Baykonur and the status of military specialists for the officers serving here seems an acceptable way out of the problem. But Kazakhstan could and apparently will insist on the demilitarization of the cosmodrome, and in Kiev, Nazarbayev suggested -- the last time, not the first -- the joint use of the cosmodrome. Be that as it may, the cosmodrome now exists in the territory of a different state, and the fact that Andrey Kozyrev in Alma-Ata was discussing humanitarian problems and questions of citizenship together with military agreements indicates that Russia and Kazakhstan cannot resolve their differences on each problem separately, but are linking them to military-political concessions they're making to each other. But for now, the Russian military who are servicing Baykonur are still facing a legal case: operating here in the Russian military unit are organs of security transferred to the jurisdiction of Kazakhstan; in the city, there are two police forces, two courts -- a Russian court and a Kazakhstan court; for over a year now, according to the testimony of Maj.-Gen. Grafinin, there hasn't been a single draftee here, and as for contract workers, he has only 1,400 of the 8,600 he needs (local draftees -- who are not citizens of Russia -- cannot be brought here for contract labor). Meanwhile, the cosmodrome remains almost R11 billion in debt for construction and repairs, and it owes Kazakhstan R3 billion for electric power. That is why the military department, threatening to disrupt even more the existing space programs, is insisting that the combat units stationed here be assigned status as Russian units and that the use of Baykonur and the city of Leninsk be stipulated in the leasing agreement. Meanwhile, possibly the strongest impression on the cosmodrome is made by its satellite city -- and that comes from the sharp contrast between, on the one hand, the grandiose cosmodrome structures and the world-class technologies used here and, on the other, the standard of living of those who service that space arch. Many officers are hurrying to take their families out of the city, which used to be under the special guardianship of Moscow and used to be a relatively pleasant "reservation" in an impoverished country. Now even the asceticism of the Soviet example cultivated in the armed forces cannot stop the grumbling among the military, many of whom -- first-class specialists all -- are making several times less than are their wives, who left for Russia. Those who remain are forced to resign themselves to periodic shutoffs of electricity and heat and to incredible prices in what is one of the most "expensive" cities. A recent survey of officers indicated that only 20 percent of them have agreed to continue their service according to the existing contract, 30 percent will do so on the condition that they receive a higher allowance, and the rest would prefer to leave the service. And that when the officer corps here is staffed at a 70-percent level, which forces them to work knowing that the production process is being violated. It needs to be borne in mind here that skills take years to get and are "passed on" literally from person to person. When the veterans complete their service and their work, that chain could be broken. The cosmodrome, over which Russia and Kazakhstan could be in difficult negotiations for many long years, could fall into disrepair by the time the negotiations are completed, and no one knows when it could be resuscitated or who could do it. The problem, obviously, is not only whether Russia is capable of executing ambitious space programs, but also whether it will be possible in the future to make up for the loss of the level of technology and skills that has been reached.
