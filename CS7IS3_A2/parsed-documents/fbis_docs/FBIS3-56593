It was again stressed at the news conference that this NATO program is open for all East European states, irrespective of whether they have expressed the wish to be involved in NATO. Representatives of the Latvian Government have agreed to that program. Latvia would also feel more secure if it participates in it. Asked why the United States has not reacted to Russia's increased military readiness [reference to 10 January deportation of two Russian generals], Ambassador Silins noted that not all tensions in interstate relations warrant a special U.S. statement. At the end, it was once again indicated that the United States favors a speedier withdrawal of the Russian Army from Latvia.
