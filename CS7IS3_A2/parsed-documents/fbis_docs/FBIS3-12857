FBIS3-12857 "drnes044_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-044 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Mar 1994 SYRIA Paper Denies `Claims' Syrian Jews `in Danger' JN0503070194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 5 Mar 94 JN0503070194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [From the press review] [Text] In its editorial today under the headline "Israeli Lies," TISHRIN speaks about claims of U.S. Jewish organizations about the living conditions of Jews in Syria. The paper says these claims are part of a systematic campaign to create confusion and cast doubt on Syria and its positions that call for achieving a just and comprehensive peace, as well as putting an end to Israeli attempts to blow up the peace process. TISHRIN asserts that when Israel raises doubts about the situation of Jews in Syria, it knows well that it will only reap failure and will not be able to exonerate itself of the crimes it is committing in broad daylight against Arab citizens and holy shrines. Noting the massacres Israel itself has committed against Jews to drive them to emigrate to Palestine, the paper says: We recall these official practices only to assert that Israel and its terrorist and extremist organizations seek --by propagating their illusions that Syrian Jews are in danger -- to distract attention from the denunciation and condemnation of what it did at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. The whole world regards the unbelievable Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories with anger, rage, and suspicion. The paper adds: The world, and the Jews of Syria, have acknowledged that they are living in their homeland and enjoying full peace and security. Israel has no right to fabricate lies and launch claims and falsehoods about the status of Jews in Syria, because they form an indivisible part of the Syrian people and enjoy, without discrimination, all rights of citizenship to travel, movement, ownership, responsibilities, work, and residence. The Jews of Syria are in no need of misleading Israeli claims. They have said that they do not accept any substitute for their homeland, Syria, and they are capable of producing evidence to reply to Israeli lies. The paper concludes: Israel should be the first party to acknowledge that it entertains illusions about what is it saying. The result will be similar to cultivating the sea. Its lies, no matter how skillfully fabricated, can fool no one. Israel is facing the results of its own terrorism and is held responsible for its crimes and massacres.
