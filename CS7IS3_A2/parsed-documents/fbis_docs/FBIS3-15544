[Rosca] I believe that the Communist Block [The Democratic Agrarian Party, the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo, and the Social Democratic Party] has ensured itself two-thirds of the votes. We can say that the Alliance of the Democratic Christian Popular Front [AFPCD] did not succeed in winning elections in competition with Russia. We had to compete with Russia. The balance of forces was somehow unequal. [Caramete] The AFPCD nevertheless will have 10 parliamentarians. [Rosca] Something like that. [Caramete] Logically, Ilie Ilascu's release should follow now, he was the second candidate on the AFPCD lists. [Rosca] This would be normal. However, it is certain that the struggle for his liberation will intensify, providing that he succeeds in ending his current hunger strike and stays healthy. [Caramete] According to the law he should be released. [Rosca] Certainly. When we enter parliament, the first issue that we will table will be the release of Ilies Ilascu and his group and the majority will not risk spoiling its image by failing to support such an initiative. [Caramete] It is possible that the parliamentary majority will support this idea in word only. [Rosca] Yes, it is possible, as has happened in the past two years. However, when we are in parliament we will be able to see whether something is indeed being done or whether everything stops at certain futile declarations that can cover up the complicity between the authorities of Chisinau and Tiraspol. [Caramete] Are you going to dispute the elections? [Rosca] We advanced several appeals disputing the results during the electoral campaign and now, too, one day after the elections. We will set down all cases of violation of the electoral law, but these appeals certainly can have only a propagandistic character. I do not think that they will have any legal consequences for the current leadership, especially considering -- as far as I could notice -- that the international observers who were here almost unanimously recognize the correctness of elections. I even heard somebody who represented the Council of Europe saying on Chisinau radio that the elections took place without violence. As if violations were carried out with tanks. Thus, I do not believe that we will obtain more than to succeed in drawing the public's attention at home and abroad to the fact that these elections were not democratic. Everything that is state authority, from the very top down to the mayor's office, had been put at the service of the Agrarian Democratic Party. [Caramete] How do you think the political situation is going to develop in the future? [Rosca] The prospects are pretty gloomy. The program of the Communist Block is known: federalization and immediate adherence to the CIS. Thus, for the first time the 1940 occupation will be legalized definitively. Then, the law regarding the official language will be reviewed and possibly the 14th Army will be transformed from an occupying army into a long-term Russian military base to ensure peace and stability in the area. I believe that unfortunately the West will hail such an idea. Probably the aggression of official anti-Romanian propaganda will increase and new attempts to condemn the idea of unification [with Romania] will follow. However, what the imperialists always overlook are the fundamental human feelings: a religious, and then a national feeling. In no way can these be defeated by totalitarianism or a parliamentary majority. I was talking with my colleagues the night of the elections about what is going to be the first initiative of our parliamentary group. We will turn to the parliamentary majority with the request to let us keep our alphabet. Thus, this would be the last stronghold. We might feel pretty bad if, in a probable multinational state, it were finally recognized that we are a Moldovan people and that we speak the Moldovan language [in contrast to Romanian]. Just as dramatic will be the discontinuation of relations with Romania in the area of education and educational programs. [Caramete] Have you thought about opposing the anti-Romanian offensive? [Rosca] Ilie Ilascu's book was issued in 250,000 copies. We have paved Bessarabia with this book and this is the most useful and most concise history of the Romanians and the most touching assertion of the national identity in the present Republic of Moldova. We are also preparing a long-term plan for our activity and I believe that everything will turn out fine, because communists do not understand this, namely that anything that is against God will collapse, sometimes very rapidly and spectacularly.
