[Kato] But I think the food control system helped settle the confusion at an early date. It seems the concept of staple food is not common in the United States and European countries. I think it is Japan's characteristic concept. The recent uproar was the event which made us reaffirm the importance of a stable supply of rice. Because rice is storable, I would like to promote arguments about storing rice from now on. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] When you were farm minister in 1986, you asserted that the essence of the food control system be maintained. [Kato] I would like to back down a little from that position and say the basis of the food control system should be maintained. Japan has accepted minimum access of rice (minimum import quota); as such, we do not say no to everything. I will think things over by taking a different position from that which I took before. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you mean you will promote reform of the food control system? [Kato] I would like to promote agricultural administration in such a way that it benefits the people. On the other hand, I have to consider two issues, which are, ensuring a stable food supply and heightening farmers' will to farm. We are now in difficult times, far more difficult than when I was farm minister before. Also, because the Hata cabinet is a minority government, it is certain to have tough times. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is your opinion about rice prices? [Kato] The government-purchased rice is priced at 300,000 yen per ton, while Thai-grown rice is sold at about 40,000 to 60,000 yen in Thailand. Because the people now eat foreign-grown rice, they know about this. The government needs to discuss rice prices with the people, while taking into consideration rice growers and agricultural organizations. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think the imported rice sold in Japan is high priced? [Kato] Certainly, it is priced a little high. But because the government imported rice as an emergency measure to fill the shortage of rice caused by a poor crop at home, high prices are inevitable. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is it possible to reduce the price of rice, which is to be imported next year and beyond, in accordance with the minimum access agreement? [Kato] This is a difficult issue. We will have in-depth discussions on this issue. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There are many farmers who sell their rice on the black market, where rice is traded at high prices. [Kato] They should think about how long the current high prices will be maintained. In the near future, the rice crop will be average. I hope farmers will realize this. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The Hata cabinet backed by a minority ruling coalition will have to have the Uruguay Round agreement ratified by the Diet this autumn. [Kato] We intend to have the agreement ratified by all means. This issue concerns Japan's role in the international community. Diet members will be asked to act sensibly, and not be bound by their positions as ruling and opposition parties.
