FR941017-1-00039 FR941017-1-00009 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 201 of the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994, Public Law (Pub. L.) 103&hyph;296, enacted August 15, 1994, contains several provisions affecting the payment of Social Security and supplemental security income (SSI) benefits to individuals whose medically determined drug addiction or alcoholism (DA&A) is a contributing factor material to the finding of disability. (For ease of reference in this Notice of Intent, we refer to these individuals as being ``disabled based on DA&A.'') The provisions may affect individuals currently receiving benefits, as well as those awarded benefits in the future. The law places new restrictions on Social Security and SSI benefit payments to individuals disabled based on DA&A, which are intended to discourage a beneficiary from using Social Security or SSI benefits to support an addiction. It also requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations necessary to implement the statutory provisions by February 11, 1995. HHS decided to request advance comments on the provisions involving nonpayment or termination of benefits under section 201 of Public Law 103&hyph;296 for several reasons. Congress mandated in the law that in promulgating the required regulations we consult with professionals in the field of DA&A treatment. This consultation must take place before the regulations can be drafted. We also believe it warranted that we obtain public comment on the novel program requirements of the law and policy issues at the same time. In addition, it is clear from the law that HHS must have regulations in place by February 11, 1995. Accordingly, we are seeking advance public comments to be used in the initial formulation of the rules through this request. In addition, we have requested individual comments directly from various treatment professionals and advocacy groups around the country. We are holding and attending meetings with various treatment professionals, representatives of referral and monitoring agencies (RMAs), and others with knowledge of DA&A-related issues to discuss, in general, contemporary treatment philosophies and receive the individual views of those in attendance. II. Summary of DA&A Provisions Prior to the Passage of Public Law 103&hyph;296 Prior to the passage of Public Law 103&hyph;296, there were no special program rules for Social Security DA&A beneficiaries. SSI beneficiaries disabled based on DA&A were required to receive payment through a representative payee. These SSI beneficiaries are required to undergo treatment, when available, at approved facilities. They also must comply with the terms of their treatment program and take part in the monitoring and testing procedures established by the Secretary. III. Major DA&A-Related Provisions of Public Law 103&hyph;296 Involving Nonpayment or Termination of Benefits A. Payment Limitation The payment of SSI benefits will be limited to 36 months for individuals disabled based on DA&A. Also, the payment of Social Security benefits will be limited to 36 months, but this limitation will begin with the first month for which treatment is available, and only months for which treatment is available are counted in the 36-month period. The 36-month DA&A payment restrictions for both Social Security and SSI benefits will cease to be effective with respect to benefits for months after September 2004. Medicare and Medicaid benefits will continue as long as a DA&A beneficiary whose benefits have been suspended for less than 12 months, or terminated after 36 months, continues to be disabled and otherwise eligible. Dependents' benefits will continue as long as the DA&A beneficiary whose benefits have been suspended, or terminated after 12 months of noncompliance or the 36-month payment limit, continues to be disabled and otherwise eligible. The payment limit will not apply to individuals who are disabled independent of their DA&A. Suspension months will not be counted in the 36 months. B. Suspension for Noncompliance Benefits will be suspended for noncompliance with treatment for both Social Security and SSI beneficiaries, beginning the first month following the month beneficiaries are notified of such noncompliance. Once an individual is determined to be in noncompliance and benefits are suspended, benefits must continue to be suspended until after the beneficiary demonstrates compliance with treatment requirements for specified periods_a minimum of 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively, for the first, second, and third or subsequent instances of noncompliance. Suspension of benefits for 12 consecutive months for noncompliance will result in termination of benefits. C. Treatment Requirement The treatment participation requirement, which now applies only to SSI beneficiaries, will be extended to Social Security beneficiaries disabled based on DA&A. Additionally, SSA will be required to provide for the monitoring of progress in treatment. The provision is to be implemented beginning after the effective date with newly adjudicated cases and Social Security beneficiaries already on the rolls with a primary diagnosis of DA&A and extended to other applicable beneficiaries as quickly as possible. D. Referral and Monitoring Agencies (RMAs) Contracts with RMAs are in place in most States as a result of statutory requirements that the Secretary provide for the monitoring and testing of title XVI DA&A beneficiaries. Pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;296, new RMA contracts must be established in each State and regulations must be issued which define appropriate treatment and establish guidelines to be used to review and evaluate compliance and measure progress for individuals disabled based on DA&A. The new contracts are needed in part because the RMAs will handle additional workloads (i.e., title II beneficiaries) and will take on additional functions. New regulations are required by the legislation to implement the new program requirements.
