The Slovak minister's talks in Warsaw focused primarily on economic cooperation. This is the first foreign visit by the Slovak foreign minister after the recent change of government in Bratislava. After talks with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, the Slovak foreign minister said that Bratislava would submit a formal application for membership in the European Union next year. [Begin Kukan recording, in Slovak with superimposed Polish translation] The division of Czechoslovakia has delayed negotiations on our membership in the European Union. Last year, we had to negotiate from the beginning and sign an association agreement. Now the 12 countries should ratify it. Denmark and Great Britain have done it so far. We would like the other union members to ratify the agreement by the end of the year. [end recording] The Slovak minister arrived in Warsaw with an invitation for Waldemar Pawlak to pay a visit to Bratislava. Most probably the visit will take place before the summer holidays. Economic agreements, including an agreement on investment protection and one on avoiding double taxation, are to be signed during the visit. [Begin Olechowski recording] The talks went smoothly and easily and we now have a great many plans for the future. I am not sure--we may have too many plans, and we will probably not be able to implement them all. [end recording] Our trade turnover last year amounted to only $300 million. Poland is eighth on the list of Slovakia's economic partners. The situation could be improved by the abolition of customs duties, as part of the Central European Free Trade Association, and by constructing more border-crossing points. Although Poland's joint border with Slovakia is the longest--700 kilometers--only eight border-crossing points are in operation. The construction of a further 11 points is planned.
