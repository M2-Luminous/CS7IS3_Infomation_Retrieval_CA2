The meeting was chaired by Souban Salitthilat, deputy minister of foreign affairs and chairman of the Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control. It was attended by (Ms. Amerera Haq-perera), representative of the United Nations Development Program, along with many representatives from 10 northern provinces and representatives of various ministries and departments concerned. Souban Salitthilat noted drug addiction as a problem which seriously threatens the world society at present. He said: Drug addiction and trafficking have been widely expanded, thus bringing about an adverse effect to the world. It is considered a problem for which everyone must be jointly held responsible. The deputy minister of foreign affairs noted: The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] has regarded as an important task the reduction of supply of opium and other addictive plants. To achieve the said goal, the LPDR Government has utilized all sources of funds totaling some $28 million from various countries as well as from international organizations to implement four projects in five provinces in the northern region, such as the Pha Lavek project in Vientiane Province, the Lao-American project in Houa Phan Province, and the rural development projects in Xieng Khouang, Bokeo, and Luang Namtha Provinces. At the same time, the government implemented a strategy of persuading people who have earned their living on slash-and-burn cultivation to switch to plains land to do rice farming and plant other types of crops, which can bring about higher revenues. This strategy can also help preserve the environment. Souban Salitthilat stressed: The Lao Government presently has been prepared to cooperate, through every possible means, with all countries and international organizations in solving this problem on the basis of the principles of respecting each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and mutual benefit. In cooperating with the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the Lao Government has adopted a comprehensive narcotics control plan for implementation for the period from now to the year 2000. Stipulated in the said plan are the urgent needs as noted in the government's strategic plan, policy, and (projects) for actual practice, including the gradual reduction of poppy plantation; the elimination of the planting of marijuana for commercial purposes; the reduction and control of narcotics demand; the suppression and control of illicit trading, production, and other illegal acts involving narcotics; and working in cooperation with the world in dealing with this problem.
