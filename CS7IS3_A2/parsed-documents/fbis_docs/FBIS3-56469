But Yegor Gaydar muddled up all the premier's cards by refusing to take the post of first vice premier in the reorganized government. Why? This post was guaranteed him through the endeavors of the president. Initially it was believed he would be in charge of 13 federal organs, including the ministries of the economy, finances, and foreign policy relations and the Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Administration of State Property]. But experience of work with Chernomyrdin over the past four months (also in the post of first vice premier, incidentally) has given Yegor Timurovich no grounds for illusions. "Gaydar had nothing to do. He had no functions left. Chernomyrdin had plugged every hole for him," one high-ranking government official commented on the position of the "father" of Russian reforms in the present cabinet of ministers. Obviously, before 13 December Yegor Gaydar was gambling on a victory for his bloc at the elections. The press was engaged in a thorough discussion of the possibility that he would be nominated for the post of prime minister.... The results of the elections buried all hopes. Most of all they reinforced the positions of Chernomyrdin, who after the victory of Zhirinovskiy and the success of the Communists, remained in the role of a "centrist" -- a favorite and honored role among Russian politicians and soviet directors. To all appearances Gaydar's position would in no way have been strengthened in the "renewed" government. The Goskomimushchestvo was dropped from the list of departments under his control after Chubays was appointed vice premier by Yeltsin personally. And what does being in charge of the Ministry of Finances mean when Boris Fedorov is alive? Or in charge of foreign economic relations when Aleksandr Shokhin is in good health? (Rumor has it that Chernomyrdin favors Shokhin more than Gaydar -- probably after Aleksandr Nikolayevich also declared himself to be a centrist and began to abuse Yegor Timurovich). And, finally, what does it mean to be in charge of the Ministry of the Economy, controlled by we do not understand what, when all sectorial industrial departments are subordinate to top-ranking First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets? Probably the true role which Viktor Chernomyrdin intended for the second first vice premier was the role of whipping boy. After all, when prices leap after the unification of the Russian ruble with the Belarusian "hare" there will have to be someone to blame for the "ill-considered consequences of the shock reforms." Will Yeltsin accept Gaydar's resignation? To judge by the tone of the statement made by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, on Sunday, Boris Nikolayevich would very much like to refuse it. But to refuse it would mean not simply leaving Gaydar and repealing (or deferring) a decision on the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems and putting a ban on the construction of the parliament building. To refuse Gaydar's resignation would mean embarking on strengthening the reformist wing in the government. And ultimately embarking on confrontation with Chernomyrdin who has essentially become the second man in the country and who, incidentally, relies on the support of two very powerful lobbies -- the industrial and agrarian lobbies. The president can hardly allow himself such whims in the present political situation. Incidentally, if you compare this with September 1993, when Yeltsin imposed Gaydar on Chernomyrdin (although the latter hastened to state that it was his own initiative) then the difference is not only in the strength of the president's political positions. At the time the economic situation was somewhat different: The country was sliding toward hyperinflation. But today, not least thanks to Gaydar's efforts, the ruble does not look that bad. So that there would seem to be no urgent, insurmountable need for so-called "monetarists." In addition Boris Fedorov is still in the government for the time being. Incidentally, if Gaydar goes the post of first vice premier will be free. And the prime minister could very well offer it to the finances minister. If, of course, Viktor Stepanovich or Boris Nikolayevich is interested in Fedorov remaining in the government. Then, you see, the Zaveryukha-Fedorov conflict would be resolved, even if only partially. It is true that this would scarcely make any easier the further fate of the Ministry of Finances leader in a government of sector lobbyists. But if you consider that in the present situation the positions of Boris Fedorov's long-standing opponent, Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, are automatically strengthened, then it may be supposed that following Gaydar and Social Protection Minister Ella Pamfilova, the Ministry of Finances leader will also think of resigning.
