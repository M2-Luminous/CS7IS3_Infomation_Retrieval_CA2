When is production of electricity expected to start? Leny: In fact the first stage has already started to produce electricity in the framework of the tests scheduled in the contract. It has even operated at 100 percent of its power, but it is not contractually finished and it will only be taken over by the client in January [1994]. This first stage is therefore currently being run experimentally. It has passed the most important test, which consists of operating for 100 hours at full power, without interruption. The second stage will start in the spring, in other words, this summer the nuclear power generated on the site will reach almost 2,000 megawatts. However, our teams will not all return to France. Indeed, we have just signed a maintenance contract which will necessitate the presence on the site of around 20 people, which is far from the 400 European expatriates that we had at the peak period out of a staff of 4,000 people. Rochard: When the contract was signed in 1986, constructing a nuclear power station of this size in China must have seemed like attempting the impossible? Leny: It has not always been easy. But we had considerable experience abroad, because we have constructed nuclear power stations in Belgium, in Korea, and in South Africa--power stations which break world records for uninterrupted operation. The most difficult thing is to construct a nuclear power station on the spot with local labor; it is not like a plane which would be built in our factories. By the transfers of technology made, the Chinese have acquired some experience in the nuclear sphere. We think that it would be opportune to continue. Rochard: Does China have adequate technology to construct a nuclear power station and does it intend to pursue its nuclear program? Leny I think that the Chinese still need us to construct a large-scale nuclear power station. But they will certainly do more on the next power station, and so forth. China has very big energy requirements. We were told that by all the officials we met, including Prime Minister Li Peng. These requirements can be satisfied by coal. But coal is difficult to transport and it raises problems of transportation within the country. For the southern provinces, nuclear power is the best means of producing electricity in quantity and cleanly. We have offered to help our Chinese interlocutors to build a nuclear industry and to create a joint venture with Chinese partners. This joint company would be formed with a substantial program. Its role would be to do in China what we have done in France. This proposal interests Beijing greatly. But there is a political problem to be solved first. It was not concealed from me. Rochard: Do you think that the right conditions exist for a settlement of the dispute which resulted from the supply of Mirage planes to Taiwan? Leny: The prime minister, who received me on a private basis, was friendly and he said that he was ready to welcome positive gestures which the French Government might make with a view to restoring confidence. This confidence reigned, he stressed, when we signed our contracts. I had the impression of people who were open to reconciliation provided the French Government initiated it. I found the atmosphere markedly less tense than a year ago but it is up to the French Government to take action. Moreover, there is no shortage of opportunities, whether it be the official opening of Daya Bay which is due to take place in February or March or the 30th anniversary of China's recognition by France. But it will take more than a symbolic gesture. Rochard: Do you have the impression that the Chinese nuclear program is being established and that there will be a follow-up to Daya Bay? Leny: China is indeed busy establishing its nuclear program with all the hesitations and considerations that it involves. For instance, in Guandong province, two sites are being envisaged. Which should be started first? The answer has not yet been given. The other question is the degree of participation by Chinese industries. Some people think that China can do everything immediately, others that it still needs help. But it is now that the thinking is taking place. It is therefore preferable not to waste time if we want to join this circuit. Rochard: Is foreign competition fierce? Leny: Of course. The American company Westinghouse has just made an official visit to China. The Japanese have a strong presence. As for the Germans, we are associated with them and the situation is different. In Guandong province, where Daya Bay is situated, it is planned that it will be Framatome and GEC Alsthom which reply to the invitations to tender. On the other hand, everywhere else in China, it is NPI [expansion not given], our joint subsidiary with Siemens which is operational for the nuclear sector. But I still think that we have a good position in view of what we have just done. Rochard: Let us return to Europe. Do you think that the freeze on the German nuclear program is irreversible? Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said last Friday [10 December] that, if that was the case, your association with Siemens no longer had much sense. Leny: I greatly regret this situation which I do not think corresponds to anything rational or reasonable. The SPD [Social Democratic Party] and the German Greens have a totally unjustifiable position with regard to nuclear power. This being the case, Siemens, our partner, which knows the hidden forces of its country better than I do, is fairly calm. This wait-and-see situation has no effect on our cooperation. But we would obviously like the situation to be more dynamic in Germany for the sake of our agreement. Rochard: What progress has been made in the plans to change your capital leading to Alcatel Alsthom taking control? Leny: I know absolutely nothing about it. We are in the position of any company which has shareholders. They are free to buy and sell. It is up to the management to adapt to that, and to ensure that these changes do not affect the smooth running of the enterprise. This is what we are doing. I have simply said that, if that was the decision of the public authorities, we would ensure that it goes smoothly. We have not expressed any wish in either direction. Rochard: Alcatel Alsthom is a serious competitor for Siemens. Would a majority share held by Pierre Suard's group not be likely to jeopardize your cooperation with your German partner? Leny: Do not think that. Big groups can be competitors in one or two spheres and be linked in a third. This is not contradictory. Rochard: What will Framatome's results be in 1993? Leny: I will stand by the forecasts made. The net profit should be slightly less than Fr900 million. But in 1994, the turnover should take a leap forward, because we will invoice the two Chinese stages in the next financial year. The turnover should increase from Fr16 billion in 1993 to Fr20 billion in 1994.
