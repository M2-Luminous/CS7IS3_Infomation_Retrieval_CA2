On the Taiwan issue, Li Peng says: Any attempt or move to separate the motherland will be in vain, "no matter what kind of trick is used." The sixth part of Li Peng's government work report, which is on "actively promoting the motherland's reunification," very briefly reviews the progress of bringing about reunification with Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and deals with the Hong Kong issue in quite a moderate tone. The full text of the part on "reunification" in Li Peng's speech is as follows: In the new year, we will continue to unswervingly implement the policy of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" and will actively promote the great cause of reunifying the motherland. The dates for China to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao are approaching. As always, the Chinese Government will abide by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region, and the relevant decisions of the NPC Standing Committee in making all kinds of preparations for ensuring Hong Kong's and Macao's smooth power transfers and steady transitions. Now Chinese-Portuguese cooperation on the Macao issue is proceeding smoothly. The talks between Chinese and British representatives on Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements have ended and the responsibility is completely on the British side. According to the decision of the NPC Standing Committee, the Preliminary Work Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's Preparatory Committee has started its work. No matter what setbacks occur, the Chinese Government and people have the determination and ability to restore the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled and ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. As a result of the common efforts of the people on both sides of the strait, both sides' economic and trade cooperation continued to develop last year. People-to-people contacts, as well as exchanges in the cultural, scientific, technological, and sports fields, further increased, and an initial understanding was reached through consultations on routine matters. We insist that the differences between the two sides of the strait should be resolved by increasing contacts and consultations under the principle of one China. "The realization of the motherland's peaceful reunification is the common wish of all Chinese people. Any attempt or move to separate the motherland violates the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and will be in vain, no matter what kind of trick is used. We hope the Taiwan authorities, and all the more hope the Taiwan people, put national interests above everything else and, together with us, make common efforts for the development of both sides' relations and the advancement of the motherland's peaceful reunification." The possibility of Li Peng making revisions while delivering the speech to the NPC session cannot be completely ruled out.
