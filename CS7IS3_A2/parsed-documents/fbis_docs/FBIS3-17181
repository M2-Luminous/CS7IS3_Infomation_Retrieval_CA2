He said at a sitting of the government presidium that the policy of economic stabilization should lie in implementation of the most promising projects capable of bearing fruit in 1994-1995. The deputy prime minister believes that if such a policy is carried out, within a year the slump in industry will reach 12 percent, while the gross domestic product will be 80 percent of the 1993 level. If this happens, Shokhin predicts that the monthly rate of inflation could reach seven to nine percent by the end of the year. The deputy prime minister believes it necessary to mobilize all means of increasing the revenue side of the budget.
