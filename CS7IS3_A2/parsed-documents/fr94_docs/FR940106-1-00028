FR940106-1-00028 FR940106-1-00007 Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. No additional time burden or monetary requirements would be placed on physicians or dialysis facilities in order to comply with the provisions of this proposed rule since physicians should already have appropriate laboratory findings and generally accepted diagnostic criteria to confirm a diagnosis of ESRD. In addition, changes in the resumption of entitlement regulations would have no effect on physicians or on dialysis facilities. For the reasons stated above, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. We are, therefore, not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act. List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 406 Health facilities, Kidney diseases, Medicare.
