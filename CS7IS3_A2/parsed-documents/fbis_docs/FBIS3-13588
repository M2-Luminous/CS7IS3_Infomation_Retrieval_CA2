Robin Raphel, the under secretary of state and chief of the Clinton administration's committee on South Asia and the Pacific, told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that aid to Pakistan was suspended under the Pressler Amendment. The Pressler Amendment has been helpful in slowing down Pakistan's nuclear program. After assuming office, the present government gave the nation good news that it would not only bring Pakistan out of the isolation resulting from the wrong policies of the previous government, but that it would also improve Pakistan-U.S. relations to such a level that it would lead to the annulment of the Pressler Amendment and resumption of U.S. aid to Pakistan. Stories about world support on the Kashmir issue and further revision in the Pressler Amendment by the United States, especially Pakistan's exclusion from it, could be heard in those days. But all the fond hopes are now evaporating one by one and it is becoming clear to the people that what they witnessed was a dream and what they heard was merely a story. At first, the UN General Assembly was approached about the Kashmir issue and the government declared that once again they were raising the issue at the world body. A resolution was also presented about which the opposition claims that it was planned during the Nawaz Sharif government and it had also secured the support of most of the friendly countries as a result of lobbying by the previous government. But suddenly, the present government announced the withdrawal of the resolution and the people were told that it had been done due to the insistence of "friends" and their reported assurances. It was also said that those friends had assured that they would exert pressure on India and ensure that the Kashmir issue is resolved through negotiations. Naturally, the whole nation's attention was focused on the Pakistan-India talks in the first week of January. However, the talks remained unproductive and India not only repeated its old claim that Kashmir is an integral part of India, but also belied hopes of normalizing relations between the two countries by embarking on a major operation against Kashmiris in Sopor. The siege of the Hazratbal shrine also continued. The government then adopted the policy of raising the Kashmir issue at the UN Human Rights Commission and the prime minister said that she would herself go and raise the issue at the UN body. Well, she did so and tried to convince the nation that India would face a defeat at the global forum and it would eventually lead to an end to Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir and that India would be forced to resolve the Kashmir issue. An impression was also created that the United States was backing the present government and it was putting pressure on India. In an attempt to satisfy the United States, the prime minister also announced that Pakistan does not help the Sikhs. Despite all this, the latest resolution was also withdrawn, thereby belying the government's claim that Pakistan is no longer an isolated country like before. Whatever happened in Geneva is nothing but a clear manifestation of the failure of Pakistan's foreign policy. It has also been proven that not only did we fail to appease the United States, but we also deprived ourselves of the warm relationships we enjoyed with our traditional friends. India has now declared that it will not allow ambassadors of Islamic countries to visit Kashmir. The stand taken by the United States and European countries on this occasion is very obvious. The Pressler Amendment is a discriminatory law against Pakistan as a result of which U.S. aid to Pakistan has remained suspended since 1990. The previous government paid no attention to improving relations with the United States or securing aid. The previous government, by launching the self-reliance program, created an impression that it did not need U.S. aid. However, the present government is quite active in this regard and it has been saying that restoration of warm relations with the United States will be its major and historic achievement. Propaganda was also launched about the withdrawal of the Pressler Amendment. But the sweet dream has now vanished. Because not only is the amendment still in place in its original form and aid to Pakistan for 1995 stopped, but the Clinton administration has also indirectly praised the amendment. Robin Raphel said that the amendment has helped bridle Pakistan's nuclear program. It seems that the talk of warmth in Pakistan-U.S. relations was only fiction and we as a nation were involved in self-deception in hoping that the new government and its leader are capable of taming the United States. Reports say that her proposed U.S. visit has also run into trouble and expectations from the United States are not likely to be fulfilled. Given the situation, the government instead of keeping its eyes closed like an ostrich should pay attention to overhauling the country's foreign policy and make fresh initiatives for creating a consensus between the government and the opposition on major issues. It should also do away with mistakes which have been causing successive failures. We have tried every means to appease the United States and put ourselves under its patronage only to find out that no encouraging response has been forthcoming from the other side. We are gradually losing the love and affection of our defendable friends due to our efforts to appease the United States. Our national dignity has also been injured due to our policy and it has also stalled our forward movement toward the goal of self-reliance. Therefore, instead of wasting any further time, the government should take the opposition along and devise a comprehensive strategy. It is not wise to keep trying that which has already been tried. No one was surprised at the U.S. behavior, but we are still being overwhelmed by absurd optimism, or at least pretending to be.
