Northern army units loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih moved to within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of Aden, as a northern minister said they were now in a position to capture the city after four weeks of civil war. Salih's troops captured the villages of al-Waht, 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Aden, and Lahij, 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of the city, southern commanders confirmed. Dozens of people were killed in the battle for the two villages on Thursday and Friday, and hundreds of villagers fled the fighting. Southern troops loyal to the president's rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid said they were forced back to Bi'r Nasir, some 15 kilometers (nine miles) north of Aden. Northern troops advancing on Aden from the east also moved forward to within 30 kilometers (19 miles) of the port city after fighting in the Abyan region. Two surface-to-surface missiles were fired at Aden in a dawn attack Friday, without causing casualties. A military spokesman in Aden, capital of a breakaway southern state, said southern anti-aircraft fire intercepted one missile while the other landed in an uninhabited area of desert. In Sanaa, Information Minister Hasan al-Lawzi told reporters that northern forces were now "able to enter the city, but they are awaiting a political decision." Salih's troops have mounted "fierce offensives on all fronts, destroying villages and killing civilians," the southern command charged in a statement. "We are resisting with all our strength to protect our land and our honour." A military spokesman in Aden said southern forces on Thursday repelled an offensive by northern troops in the oil region of Shabwah, 300 kilometers (180 miles) northeast of Aden. The spokesman told Aden Radio that the northern troops commander in Shabwah, Colonel Muhammad Salim al-'Arif, lost his right arm in the fighting, while "several" northern soldiers were killed or injured. Southern army units destroyed four tanks and three troop carriers and captured two tanks and several northern army vehicles, the spokesman added. [passage omitted]
