A treaty has been signed by Chita Oblast Administration and the Manchurian Government. Both sides are very keen for tracklaying equipment to traverse the local steppes as quickly as possible. The point is that the existing "rail-link" is overloaded at this section, and at times up to 7,000 railcars accumulate on the border. Our foreign trade vector is shifting ever more toward the East, Aleksandr Dovgyallo, chief of the Transbaykal Railroad, believes.
