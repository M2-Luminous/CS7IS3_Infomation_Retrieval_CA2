FBIS4-28215 "dreas111_m_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Thailand More on Iranian Bomb Suspects More on Iranian Bomb Suspects Envoys Given Access BK0906065994 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 9 Jun 94 p 2 BK0906065994 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] The Police Department will make arrangements for Iranian diplomats to visit three Iranians arrested in Hat Yai last week in connection with an attempt to car-bomb the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok in March. The Police Department will also ensure that the three suspects, now being detained at a police private training school in Bang Khen, are in good condition. The department's pledges followed reports by an international news agency that Teheran had staged a protest early this week against the arrest of the suspects identified as Hossein Shahriari Far, Babak Taheri and Basr Kazemi. Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, however, denied the reports, saying Iran's Foreign Ministry had only asked the Thai ambassador there to inform the Thai Government that it wanted Iranian diplomats in Bangkok to have access to the suspects. Deputy police chief Phong-ammat Amattayakun yesterday insisted police had done their duty according to the law in arresting the three Iranians. He guaranteed fairness for the Iranians. According to Pol Gen Phong-ammat, the US Embassy in Bangkok has asked the Police Department for information about the suspects. Somchai Nilaphaichit, a representative of the Muslim Lawyer Group, quoted the suspects as saying that they had no involvement with the plot to attack the Israeli Embassy and that they came to Thailand to do business. Mr Somchai and Charan Malulin, a researcher at Chulalongkon University, yesterday visited the three Iranians during which he briefed them on Thai laws and the punishment they face if convicted. Mr Somchai said Babak had allegedly told him he was innocent and that the police had no evidence against him. He quoted Babak as saying that he would not have come back to Thailand if he really was involved in the foiled car-bomb plot. Hossein, meanwhile, also denied involvement, reportedly telling Mr Somchai that he entered Thailand to extend his visa since he had a business concerning the trade of radio and television sets here. Hossein also denied reports that he had relations with a Thai woman, Mr Somchai said. Hossein and the other suspects were arrested at a Hat Yai hotel last week after immigration officers at Songkhla's Sadao District informed local police that his photo looked similar to a sketch produced by Lumphini police. Hossein is wanted under an arrest warrant for allegedly attempting to bomb the Israeli Embassy with C-4 plastic explosives last March. The plan, however, failed after the bomb-laden six-wheel truck allegedly driven by Hossein hit a motorcycle-taxi a short distance from the embassy. He later allegedly abandoned the truck and fled the scene. The bomb hidden in a water tank in the bed of the truck, and the body of a Thai man were accidentally found by the truck owner about a week later.
