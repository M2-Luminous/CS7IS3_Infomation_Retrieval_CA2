That is why its chief Anatoliy Kuntsevich was dismissed by presidential decree.'' This was the explanation of the wording of Kuntsevich's dismissal ``for a single gross violation of duties'' given by the head of state's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov at a briefing in the Kremlin today. Moreover, Vyacheslav Kostikov noted that Anatoliy Kuntsevich had spent many years working on the creation of chemical weapons and ``it is difficult for a person to part from his child even if the child is dangerous.'' For this reason, the president's press secretary said, the person dealing with the destruction of the chemical arsenal should not be one who was involved in its creation.
