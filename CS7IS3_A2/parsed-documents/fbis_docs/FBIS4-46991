I will not give the names of the people I spoke with, because I do not want to create additional problems for people who are already sufficiently well-known. I will stress, however, that these people were not "extremists," but completely loyal residents of the republic: Most of them are citizens of Estonia (and consequently are not experiencing these difficulties personally) and some even acquired this status through a special procedure for the extraordinary services they performed for the young state. "They Cheated Us Again!" Minister of Nationality and Population Issues Peeter Olesk recently commented on the resurgence of tension in Estonia. He was right: There could be an explosion, because they cheated us again. During the arguments over citizenship, we told the "internationalists" not to be ridiculous: The "zero option" was unacceptable to the Estonians and incomprehensible to the West. In the final analysis, Estonia was regaining its statehood with an alarmingly skewed demographic tendency: Before the war 8 percent of the population was Russian, but now Russians represent 38 percent of the total. All we wanted was for each inhabitant who had a permanent residence permit prior to July 1990 to be granted the status of a permanent resident. This status would secure virtually all of the necessary rights and all forms of social protection. Here is what we achieved: The law on foreigners stated that everyone would receive a residence permit, but one word was left out of the text--permanent. The result was a procedure by which each non-citizen would first receive a temporary residence permit and the right to apply for permanent resident status in three years. At that time officials could either approve or deny the request. What is even worse is that according to the published regulations, the present temporary document will expire on 12 July 1995. At that time non-citizens will have to apply for a new temporary permit, and whereas Estonia promised to issue the present document to everyone, it can be selective in issuing the next. If they catch a "temporary resident" in an intoxicated state, they will have grounds for denying his application. For that matter, the government could decide that the country does not need that many temporary residents.... Return My Property More than 600,000 of the 1.5 million people in the republic are Russian-speakers. The Estonians believe that this poses a threat to the very existence of their nationality: It could be diluted to the point of its complete disappearance. They say that the proportional number of Russians should be reduced to a more acceptable 25 percent of the population. They encourage "Estonization"--requiring the non-Estonian spouse in a mixed marriage to take the Estonian surname. This was already the case in the years between 1932 and 1938, when a person had to have an Estonian name to get a job. Many of today's prominent Estonians are the descendants of people who changed their names (for example, Foreign Minister Juri Luik). For this reason, the suggestion that the Russians represented only 8 percent of the population before the war is a myth. [Boxed item: "The goal of Russian policy is not armed intervention. The Russians have economic ambitions. They want to buy economic property of strategic significance through figureheads and then demand maximum rights for all of the people living here" (Tiit Viahi, chairman of Tallinn Municipal Assembly, DEN ZA DNEM, 28 April 1994).] The official slogan of the campaign--the suggestion that the Soviet Union pursued a policy of Russification in Estonia--is also a myth. The Soviet Union had no demographic policies at all, including a Russification policy. It pursued a policy of assistance in the economic development of outlying regions. The Estonians, who are conformists and are loyal to the existing government, joined the "socialist competition" for the highest indicators of regional industrial development. Estonfosforit was turned into an industrial giant at the request of the Estonian Government, and so was Dvigatel, the New Tallinn Port, and Estonslanets--all in response to local initiatives. The industrial giants needed manpower, and the Estonians themselves did not want to work in industry, transportation, or construction. According to one theory (not all of the people I spoke with agreed), the movement to "get rid of the Russians" had no political aims in the beginning. It was simply that the Estonians were frightened by the growth of the Russian-speaking intelligentsia, which had begun to strive for secondary, if not primary, positions in public administration, science, and culture. There is a suspicion that the present move to turn all non-citizens into temporary residents of the republic is based on purely materialistic motives. During the three years it will take the Russians to acquire the status of permanent residents, all property in Estonia will be privatized, and the republic "pie" will be divided up among a million residents instead of a million and a half. The establishment of a non-state economy will be completed during those years. Today the "Russian Estonians" are stronger than the ethnic Estonians in the economic sphere, but the opposite will be true in three years. Miscalculations Estonia began pursuing its stringent economic policy with this slogan: We will suffer for a while and we will endure, but "they" will not be able to take it and they will leave. Special sociological surveys confirmed that eight out of ten Estonians were still in contact with relatives in the countryside, which would help them survive the hard times. Only one out of every four Russians had connections of this kind. No one, however, expected the state of the Russian economy to undergo such rapid deterioration. Only 80,000 people left in two years. According to projections, the same number of "Russian-speaking residents" will leave the republic in the future. The rest have nowhere to go. The main problem is housing, and buying a home will be almost impossible even for those who manage to sell a home in Estonia: Apartment prices in Tallinn, for example, are only one-fourth as high as they are in Moscow. [Boxed item: "The issue of ethnic minorities is still unclear to many people. Only a handful of people in Estonia can categorize themselves as members of ethnic minorities. The rest, according to international law, are immigrants. If we continue to stress this fact, Russia will have no more arguments in defense of its minority...." (Mart Rannut, director of Language Department, DEN ZA DNEM, 28 April 1994).] These prices are likely to drop again in the near future. The last military troops are expected to leave soon (making 1,500 dwellings available), and there is a plan to force the veterans out--leaving another 10,000-12,000 apartments vacant. This will not change the demographic situation in the republic, but as a result of its efforts to get rid of the "dead weight," Estonia is now losing the most highly skilled segments of its labor force: The people who are leaving are those who can expect to find good jobs elsewhere. The youngest and most confident individuals are moving to the West, and the others are heading east. The people who are staying are those who are not needed anywhere else. Meanwhile, the rate of unemployment in the republic is rising, primarily in "Russian" production areas. As a result of this, the crime rate is also rising. The northeast has become a high-crime zone. Police records indicate that thefts are not confined to valuables. Thieves are stealing food out of refrigerators and cellars. The transfer of non-citizens to the category of temporary residents could make them ineligible for unemployment benefits, and this could lead directly to a life of crime. The lumpenization of the Russian-speaking population is being fostered by the quick transition to the "official state language": The number of Russian schools and classes is decreasing, and instruction is being offered only in the Estonian language in tekhnikums and in vocational and technical institutes as well as in higher academic institutions. Difficulties in obtaining an education or training in a special field are helping to turn Russian-speaking youths into criminals. Russian Policy: Just Imagine!... At the end of last year Pavel Grachev suddenly announced that he was stopping the withdrawal of troops from Estonia. Everyone here, however, saw the continued departure of one echelon after another. Recently there was another such statement: The troops will not be withdrawn! But there are no more troops in Estonia. Estonian radicals are quite pleased with these announcements: We have an enemy in the East! The National Independence Party holds demonstrations--with picketers holding up signs saying "Russians Go Home!"--each Monday in front of the headquarters of the naval base, where the remaining staff consists of only around 15 officers. The admiral sitting in the headquarters building gets extremely irritated. This is certain to affect the Russian community in the republic. The next parliamentary elections will be held in a year, but the campaign has already begun. Many parties and politicians are building their campaigns around the "enemy image" of Russia. The logical extension of this is the suggestion that the Russians in Estonia are the enemy within. They are even using a new term to refer to the Russians: the civilian occupation. There are many things Russia could have done. If it had just pursued a more or less consistent policy toward the Baltic countries, or if Russia had used its authority to influence the European countries when Estonia wanted to join the Council of Europe, so that this membership could have been conditional upon several factors--this would have been fully in accordance with international standards. Instead, just two days before the ceremonial act, after everything had already been decided, Andrey Kozyrev made a fiery speech. He had his say, Estonia was accepted as a member anyway, and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs fell silent again. There is so much that Russia could do without interfering in the internal affairs of other states: It could offer legal assistance or legal reviews of the legislative instruments and administrative ordinances pertaining to the Russian-speaking population. After all, the Russians here have a problem: There are no experts in international law! They can sense that an inhumane legal instrument has been passed in violation of international law. They can say that it is a violation, but they cannot say exactly why it is a violation. When the delegation from Russia at the talks with Estonia was headed by Sergey Shakhray, he would state his objections in the most precise terms, saying that something was in violation of a specific article of a specific document, and no one could argue, because he was an expert! Economics and Politics Russia took the wrong approach to the Baltic problems from the very beginning. One of Boris Yeltsin's advisers came to Tallinn, brushed our questions aside, and made this promise: Everyone owes us money, he said, and Estonia owes us 7 billion rubles. It will give us the union enterprises in payment of the debt, and everything will be as it was before! This aroused a wave of protests in the republic: Even if the government had wanted to make concessions to Russia, it could not do this any longer. Estonia had to apply to the West for credit, but it did pay its debt to Russia. After this, Russia even had difficulty buying a mineral fertilizer plant in Estonia--even on the most beneficial terms for Estonia. There was a time when Russia could have taken the metallurgical combine in Sillamae "under its wing"--becoming a shareholder on the strength of its raw materials (the combine had always worked with raw material from Kazakhstan and the Urals). This is a city with 20,000 inhabitants, and almost half of them were employed by the combine. If Russia had done this, they would not be living in a state of almost total unemployment today and they would have kept the Russian schools and cultural centers open. Instead of living like parasites, they could be respectable individuals and taxpayers and would be defending Russia's strategic interests here. Instead of this, Russia decided to support the Estonian middlemen who were sending Russian nonferrous metals to the West: If an Estonian and an Estonian Russian applied to a Russian official for an export license, the Estonian was more likely to receive preferential treatment. [Boxed item: "I think Mr. Peeter Olesk--minister of `nationality and expulsion issues'--and Mrs. Marju Lauristin--minister of social `ills'--should ask the government to consider establishing a special ward in some hospital for people who have been driven to distraction by the government and the inhumane laws, so that they could come to terms with life with a physician's help. Civilized countries have hospitals of this kind for cancer patients, but we should have them for people in a completely hopeless situation" (from a letter by Z.S. to MOLODEZH ESTONII, 28 April 1994).] Today the "troubled waters" that once offered such lucrative fishing opportunities no longer exist. This means that the Russian immigrants in Estonia have an even more critical need for Russia to pursue a reasonable protectionist policy. Transit shipments through Estonia, for example, should be handled by Russian firms, which would be willing to do excellent work even with a lower profit margin as long as they could have long-term contracts. These firms would spend part of the profit on social programs to aid the Russian-speaking population. The Business League in Estonia and the Estonian-Russian Business Chamber could aid in finding these partners and in monitoring the fulfillment of obligations. In fact, a relationship of this kind is already being established with Moscow because of the policies of the pragmatic Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov. This could serve as a model of relations with other countries that were once republics of the USSR. After all, there are Russians (or "Russian-speakers") everywhere today, and the attitude toward the ethnic Russians would change if people could see how diligently Russia can support its "fellow-countrymen"....
