It has been his style since he left the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which often made crucial decisions in high-class Japanese restaurants during its 38-year-old grip on power that ended last August. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government shuns such posh "ryotei" restaurants and many of them, already hit hard by the burst of Japan's bubble economy, are going under one after another. Policy-makers of the seven-party coalition such as the 51-year-old Ozawa make decisions with help from a handful of bureaucrats bargaining on crucial issues behind closed doors, sources said. Ozawa, co-leader of the Shinseito Party and a faithful servant of one-time LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru, is a strategist who has sometimes disappeared from reporters and the public to persuade Hosokawa to decide on such key issues as a cabinet change and tax hikes. During their reign, LDP faction leaders and senior policy-makers held their "backroom" talks in restaurants and made bargains on Diet business with leaders of then opposition parties. Ozawa is known as a "kuromaku," or mastermind who pulled the strings from behind the scenes to topple the government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa last year, ending the LDP's 38-year reign of power. He and dozens of his fellow parliamentarians, once members of the LDP's strongest faction led by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, bolted from the LDP and formed a new party last June. Ozawa has stepped out of the public eye since Hosokawa failed to reshuffle the cabinet on March 2, a move that was chiefly aimed at removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Ozawa was seen as the key person backing the reshuffle, the sources said. Ozawa, once dubbed the "prince of the LDP" before leaving the party, also temporarily disappeared from reporters in December after catching the ire of the press with his statement that he was holding news conferences as a "service." During that time, Ozawa reportedly demanded that Hosokawa remove Takemura from his cabinet, sources said. Takemura and Ozawa hold differing ideas, including about the realignment of Japanese politics. In addition, Ozawa also helped fashion a 7 percent national welfare tax scheme in early February, which was promptly withdrawn because of strong opposition from both inside and outside the fragile coalition. Prime Minister Hosokawa publicly apologized for the welfare tax and Takemura episodes, but Ozawa managed to avoid bearing the brunt of the failures. Ozawa, who in early January ended his two-month-old self-imposed ban on news conferences, is once again out of sight. The Japanese public seems to be frustrated because Hosokawa's promised "change" has not materialized despite the change of venues of politicking from "ryotei" restaurants to hotels and other secluded places. Will Mr. Ozawa, who has promised to make Japan a credible world power, please stand up?
