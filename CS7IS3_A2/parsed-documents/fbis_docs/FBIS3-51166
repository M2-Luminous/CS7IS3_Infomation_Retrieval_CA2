The fact that 485,000 grass-roots leaders are the first to receive training to better organize discussions at work centers reflects the labor leadership's interest in [words indistinct]. Workers will voice their opinions on the viability of planned economic measures at open and democratic assemblies. The implementation of such measures or others has been postponed until a national consensus is reached. In recent years, the population has created an excess cash flow that amounts to 10 billion pesos because of a smaller product supply. This resulted in a lack of motivation, work inefficiency, and a thriving black market. In addition, the state operated with a budget deficit estimated at 4.2 billion pesos by late 1993 because expenditures exceeded treasury revenues. The financing of education, health, and social security increased the budget deficit because Cuba did not have access to international loans. Cuban workers, therefore, will voice their opinions on the best ways to reorganize national finances, such as the possibility of establishing a tax system and reducing or eliminating subsidies for family basket products and channeling those funds to people who have lower incomes. At union assemblies supported by their leadership, Cuban workers will suggest ways to face current irregularities, such as the fraudulent accumulation of personal wealth. Cuban unions will also discuss the fact that certain workers are not working as efficiently as their positions require. Meanwhile, there are people who reach legal employment age but turn down job offers because they think such jobs do not match their educational level. Cuban unions will also discuss costs, profitability, efficiency, and productivity at these meetings, which seek to become another forum for collective reflection, just as the Cuban parliament already is.
