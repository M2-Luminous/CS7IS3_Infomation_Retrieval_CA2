It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .

Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil, and possible loss of a propeller blade or hub, accomplish the following: (a) Within 30 days after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), perform an initial torque check of the propeller hub retaining nuts, as follows: (1) For Hamilton Standard Model 14RF&hyph;9 propellers, in accordance with Temporary Revision (TR) No. 61&hyph;6, dated March 15, 1993, to Hamilton Standard Maintenance Manual (MM) P5186.

(b) If propeller hub retaining nuts are found not to meet the acceptance criteria in accordance with the applicable TR to the Hamilton Standard MM's during the initial torque check in accordance with paragraph (a), and during the repetitive torque checks performed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this AD, remove the propeller hub from service and inspect for cracks in accordance with the applicable TR's listed in paragraph (a) of this AD. Remove propeller hubs with crack indications and replace with serviceable propeller hubs prior to further flight. (c) If the initial propeller hub retaining nut torque check is acceptable in accordance with the applicable TR listed in paragraph (a) of this AD, support the propeller with an appropriate lifting fixture and loosen all the propeller hub retaining nuts. Tighten the propeller hub retaining nuts as follows: (1) For Hamilton Standard Model 14RF&hyph;9 propellers, in accordance with TR No. 61&hyph;7, dated July 27, 1993, to Hamilton Standard MM P5186.
