The attraction of foreign capital has been found to be a boon in Lithuania, and in the new legislative acts the republican authorities envisage a number of benefits for foreign investors. Thus, if a joint venture is instituted -- or investments are carried out in any other way -- until the end of this year, then part of the profit amounting to the share of the foreign investor will for five years be levied with a tax decreased by 70 percent. True, on the condition that it has not been used for the payment of wages. On the expiration of five years this tax will for another three years be 50 percent less than usual. If a JV is instituted or the investments of foreign capital are made in the course of two subsequent years -- i.e., from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 1995 -- the share of the foreign investor's profit will for a whole six years be levied with a tax diminished by 50 percent. The dividends received by foreign investors in Lithuania will in general be tax free. Not liable to taxation will also be their profits repatriated abroad. Moreover, it will be possible to do this in the shape of goods and services purchased on the domestic market. Under Lithuania's laws, it is not only juridical but also persons of other states, as well as persons without a citizenship permanently residing abroad, that are recognized as foreign investors. The latter category is granted the same benefits, which may present an interest to some inhabitants of the republics of the former USSR. The decisions on the foreign investments of up to three million dollars are taken by Lithuania's Ministry of the Economy. For making investments in state enterprises enjoying a monopoly position on the Lithuanian market there is already a need to obtain a permission from the government. Considered to be a monopoly owner is an enterprise manufacturing at least 50 percent of the products made in the republic, and the government has even approved a list of enterprises whose controlling interest can be purchased solely with its permission. Enterprises run with the participation of foreign capital and instituted as joint-stock companies may be registered on the list of Lithuania's enterprises solely after the payment by all founders of initial fees to the tune of at least a quarter of the nominal cost of the shares. The remaining fees must be paid not later than in the two years after the registration date. The term of the leasing of land by foreign investors may be as long as 99 years with the priority right of its prolongation. The size of the rent to be paid for the plot of land is not liable to be changed throughout the term when the lease is in force unless, of course, it envisages something different. It is noteworthy that Lithuania's legislation envisages guarantees for foreign investors. The loses sustained by them as a result of actions by the republic's state managerial bodies and officials must be fully compensated on the basis of the international law norms. And the disputes on foreign investors' rights or legitimate interests being violated may be considered by the courts not only of the Lithuanian Republic, but also by foreign or even international agencies.
