What Is the Fate of the Moscow Plan for a Karabakh Settlement?"] [Text] The unexpected finale of the two-day negotiations in Moscow between the defense chiefs of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh with the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's mediation has given rise to various forecasts about the future of the Russian peace plan. Some tend to believe that the refusal by the Azerbaijan delegation to sign the final protocol means nothing but yet another failure of the talks, while others predict confidently that Baku at any moment will accede to the document, which has already been signed by the Armenian side. The conflicting statements by the negotiating parties also fail to clear up the situation that has emerged. Thus, Col.-Gen. Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian Federation deputy defense minister, said that Azerbaijan Defense Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov had no authority to sign the protocol, although Mamedov himself does not think so. "I had full authority to sign the final protocol," he stated, "but I did not do so only because some questions called for additional study." The minister nonetheless did not specify which of the protocol provisions appeared dubious to the Azerbaijan military. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent was advised by an informed source, overnight on 17 May Mamedrafi Mamedov had a lengthy telephone conversation with Azerbaijan President Heydar Aliyev who ordered him urgently to return to Baku for a detailed discussion of the possible implications of signing the Moscow protocol. The piquancy of the situation is that a day before, on 16 May, Mamedov gave no indication that he might not sign the final document. This prompted Russian Defense Minister Grachev to announce that Moscow's plan was fully approved by the sides. The somewhat strange behavior by the Azerbaijan defense department chief can be apparently attributed to the fact that the negotiations in Moscow took place amid a sharp aggravation of the internal political situation in Azerbaijan. Nearly all political forces in opposition to the present powers charged Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev, who had earlier signed the Bishkek protocol, with high treason and demanded an urgent convocation of a parliament (milli mejlis) session. Last Saturday Rasul Guliyev, appearing on national television, sharply criticized the opposition and warned it against any attempts to destabilize the situation in the country. The parliament speaker's position however was exacerbated by the fact that disapproving assessments of his performance were also made within the presidential team itself. According to information obtained by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent from confidential sources, some influential people who shape the republic's foreign policy told the president that the parliament speaker had exceeded his powers by signing the Bishkek protocol. Furthermore, they warned President Aliyev that they might resign in the event that Defense Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov signed the Moscow protocol on 17 May, giving the "go ahead" to the introduction of Russian troops into Azerbaijan. Therefore Heydar Aliyev has been confronted with a complex dilemma: Either to ignore the warnings from a number of his close associates over the possible negative effects of signing the Moscow protocol or to opt for a stalling tactic in order to make a final choice. As can be seen, the president has chosen the second. He had to postpone indefinitely his official visit to Georgia's capital which was to have begun on 17 May. In the past few days the president has been holding tense consultations with members of his team and also trying to reconcile the supporters and opponents of the Moscow protocol. The division in the presidential team over the upcoming introduction of Russian troops to Azerbaijan is indirectly confirmed by the admission of President Aliyev's adviser that "neither the president nor the foreign minister has seen the document now being discussed in Moscow" and therefore there can be no question about a speedy signing of the Moscow protocol. An informed source in the republic's Foreign Affairs Ministry stressed that Azerbaijan's foreign policy department does not support the position of the defense minister and the parliament speaker who advocate the signing of the Moscow protocol. The Foreign Affairs Ministry leadership is trying to convince Aliyev that the peace-keeping forces should be introduced into the conflict area only within the CSCE framework. "It is not known just how Russian generals will behave in the absence of oversight by international observers over the actions of Russian troops in the region," a source in the Foreign Affairs Ministry told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent. Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Federation president's special envoy who arrived in Baku, has been trying in the past few days to persuade President Aliyev to support the position of Azerbaijan's parliament and Defense Ministry leadership on the issue of accession to the 17 May Moscow protocol. At the same time the National Assembly met in session on the morning of 18 May in Baku, where demands were heard to annul Azerbaijan's signature under the Bishkek protocol and to prevent the signing of the Moscow protocol. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA was going to press it was not yet known which decision was made.
