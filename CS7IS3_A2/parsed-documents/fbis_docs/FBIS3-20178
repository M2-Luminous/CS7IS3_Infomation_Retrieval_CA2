The human rights issue was of great significance in Sino-German relations, the minister said after talks with her Chinese counterpart, Yang Xiao, in Bonn today. A "basic agreement" on human rights is indispensable to cooperation with Beijing. Germany and China joined international agreements based on the universal applicability and indivisibility of human rights, the minister stressed. The interstate dialogue on human rights became a component of international law after the World War II. Thus, a dialogue of this kind is not inadmissible interference in a country's internal affairs. Bonn does indeed recognize the significance of "national and regional distinctive features as well as different historical, cultural, and religious prerequisites." However, "basic human rights criteria" are valid everywhere. In the "very open" dialogue with the Chinese politician she stressed the human rights of the individual. China, on the other hand, has focused on "collective human rights." It is important that these different views be discussed openly. However, it would be "very desirable" if agreement could be reached on the "basic human rights criteria." [passage omitted] Yang Xiao stressed that they were able to achieve a consensus on many issues. However, given the differences in social order and economic development and the different cultural prerequisites, it is obvious that they would also have differing views. Nevertheless, his country is ready to enter a dialogue "based on equality."
