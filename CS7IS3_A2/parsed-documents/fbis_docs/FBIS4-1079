This was decided yesterday evening at a meeting between the peacekeeping force and the defense force. A spokesman for the peacekeeping force, Major. Math Anderson, has told our Johannesburg news staff that details of the combined operations will be released today. This follows heavy fighting in Thokoza earlier this week which claimed several lives. Reports say that the problem stemmed from a mutiny by more than 100 peacekeeping force troops. On Tuesday [19 April] the group allegedly refused to obey orders and locked their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Quinton Painter in his car.
