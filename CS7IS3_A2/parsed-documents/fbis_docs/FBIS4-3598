The issue of how to boost the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises is not only an important task faced by the province but also the key content of conducting reform throughout the country. Before 1988, the rate of the state-owned money-losing enterprises was about 10-20 percent. The present rate of state-owned enterprises that have suffered losses and whose profits are false and losses are true is 70 percent. However, the rate of state-owned enterprises that have overtly or covertly suffered losses actually is more than 80 percent calculated in term of new accounting systems. The proportion of output value scored by the state-owned industrial enterprises in the total industrial output value decreases year after year. The yearly average decrease in this regard before 1992 was 2 percent, that of 1992 was 4 percent, and that of 1993 was 6 percent. It is thus clear that if we fail to fundamentally boost the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises, it is impossible for the country to make success in its reform. Heilongjiang is one of the provinces that have more large- and medium-sized enterprises. This represents the province's glory in its history but becomes a heavy burden that has perplexed the province's economy. By judging from the focal points of the province's economic development strategy, the province has 429 large- and medium-sized enterprises. Of these enterprises, 409 are people-owned ones; 17 are collectively owned ones; and three are of other categories. The province has 17,671 small enterprises and most of them are privately or individually owned. The original value of fixed assets owned by large- and medium-sized enterprises is 68.15 billion yuan and the net value of them is 47.52 billion yuan; as well as that of fixed assets owned by small enterprises is 17.16 billion yuan and the net value of them is 12.6 billion yuan. By carrying out comparison among these values, we may realize that in the structure of the province's enterprises, the proportion of publicly owned enterprises in the original value of fixed assets accounts for about 80 percent and that of net value accounts for about 79 percent. Such high proportions prevailing in this regard in the province are rare in the country as a whole. This shows that placing hopes for the province's whole situation and fate of economic development on the development of privately owned and township enterprises in an effort to improve the backward economic outlook seems very unsuitable to the province's reality. Without the vitality of large- and medium-sized enterprises and the radiation function exerted by these enterprises, it is also difficult for privately owned and township enterprises to achieve great development. Establishing modern enterprise systems represents a final way out for large- and medium-sized enterprises across the province. However, this also represents an arduous and complicated task. By no means should we rush headlong into action in this regard and indulge in formalism. It is imperative to accumulate experience, to create conditions, and to gradually push the establishment forward. First of all we must obtain an accurate and overall understanding of modern enterprise systems that can meet the demand for socialized mass production and the market economy. Those are of new-style enterprise systems with the standardization and improvement of enterprise corporate system as the main content and with the limited responsibility system as the core. Thus, we should understand these systems from the following several angles: 1. Modern enterprise systems are of microeconomic ones; are not the systems only with one or two specific contents; and are the setup of systems which involves various fields in the external environment and internal mechanism of enterprises. 2. Modern enterprise systems do not refer to the equipment and managerial levels and managerial methods of enterprises but indicate the reflection of internal and external production relations of enterprises. Therefore, by no means should we make the conclusion that success can be made merely by boosting enterprise and enterprises can get rid of the possibility of being eleminated from markets as long as modern enterprise systems have been established. As a matter of fact, the nationally famous U.S. Rockefeller Financial Group was sold to another due to the 51 percent shares held by the Mitsubishi Financial Group of Japan. 3. Although modern enterprise systems have cropped up along with the development of the market economy and there is common character between systems and the market economy, we must find out the point of contact which is suitable to our reality in conducting the reform of modern enterprise systems on the premise of observing the common character. Meanwhile, it is imperative to integrate the experience scored by China in conducting enterprise reform in the past and the method of creating something new with the international convention and feasible methods and to establish in a creative way modern enterprise systems suitable to Chinese history and culture and to the characteristics of the age. 4. Whether enterprise can establish modern systems cannot be decided by their ownership. This means that all enterprises may take up the establishment in this regard. The state-owned enterprises may exercise mixed ownership in carrying out company-style reorganization. As for whether hold-shares can be decided by the character of enterprises and by the social and economic position and role played by enterprises -- meaning that "whether the proportion of the state share right in the company is relatively adequate," we may handle the issue in line with the difference of industries and trades and according to the scattered extent of share right. Lastly, we must push forward the reform in various fields in a coordinated way to ensure the smooth progress of "shifting the enterprise business mechanism and establishing modern enterprise systems" because having the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises to "shift their business mechanism and establish modern systems" represents a complicated and systematic project. In enforcing the project, a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole. The present burdens undertaken by the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises for the retirement and convalescence leave of staff members and workers are very serious. According to statistics, 20-30 percent of on-the-job personnel in the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises across the country are surplus ones. In addition, the number of staff members and workers who are going to retire from their posts accounts for more than 20 percent in the total. By putting the two figures together, the state-owned enterprises in the country are shouldering the burden of 50-percent surplus personnel and so doing the large and medium-sized enterprises throughout the province. For this, we must further accelerate the reform in the systems of social security and establish or improve the social security setup. Meanwhile, we must adopt the method of "gradually being stripped" to handle the financial burden the enterprises have to bear in supporting social undertakings.
