The force was initially scheduled to have been deployed in the southern districts yesterday, but the exercise was postponed for 24 hours "on technical grounds." The High Command of the Congolese Armed Forces and the command of the intervention force met again today to examine "the logistic and financial difficulties" which are hindering the deployment of the 400-man-strong force. By late this afternoon, no new date had been announced for the operation. According to a reliable source, differences surfaced over the selection and distribution of members of the force, which should include 200 pro-opposition and 200 pro-Lissouba men. This report was, however, not confirmed by military sources. [passage omitted]
