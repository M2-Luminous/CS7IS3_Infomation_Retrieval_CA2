FR940721-1-00047 FR940721-1-00012 3. People Mover Gap Standards The Special Standards Division of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has petitioned the Department to modify its technical standards concerning horizontal and vertical gaps for automated guideway transit (AGT) vehicles and systems, better known as ``people movers.'' 49 CFR §38.173 requires that the horizontal gap between a stopped AGT vehicle's door and the platform be no greater than one inch, with a vertical gap of plus or minus one half inch. The regulation allows other rail systems (e.g., rapid and light rail) to have horizontal and vertical gaps of 3 inches and plus or minus 5/8 inch, respectively. ASCE suggests that the regulation should recognize a distinction between AGT systems based on vehicle speed. AGT systems vary in speed from 5 to 80 miles per hour, ASCE says, and it is, in the organization's view, more appropriate for higher-speed AGTs to meet the more flexible standards applicable to rapid and light rail systems than the narrower AGT standard. ASCE cites the Access Board's preamble discussion concerning AGT systems, which refers to ``AGT vehicles that travel at slow speed,'' and subsequent Access Board manuals suggesting that the rapid/light rail gap should apply to faster AGT vehicles. ASCE surveyed existing AGT systems, determining that most do not comply with the current AGT gap standards. The petition cites engineering reasons (e.g., the need in higher-speed vehicles for larger and more complex suspension systems, which in turn make it more difficult to meet existing gap standards) for this phenomenon. Based on its data and engineering analysis, ASCE recommends that 20 miles per hour be the dividing line: systems that operate below that speed can reasonably meet the current AGT standard, while faster systems should be allowed to meet the rapid/light rail standard. (The Access Board has interpreted its guidelines, as presently worded, to permit the construction urged by ASCE. The Department does not object to this interpretation; nevertheless, for the sake of clarity in the rule text, we are proposing to amend the language. The Department will also work with the Access Board to incorporate changes in the guidelines that may be made with respect to vehicle/platform gaps in AGT systems.) 4. 14-day Advance Reservations 49 CFR §37.131(b)(4) provides, with respect to complementary paratransit services, that ``the entity shall permit advance reservations to be made up to 14 days in advance of an ADA paratransit eligible individual's desired trip.'' This provision, not a part of the NPRM that led to the Department's final ADA rule, was added in response to comments to the NPRM. Two separate petitions urge the Department to eliminate this provision. One is from Doug Douglas, Assistant Vice-President, Paratransit Services, of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). Mr. Douglas draws a distinction between advance reservations in a context like the airline industry, where the customer goes to the point of service, and paratransit. In the former, he says, if a passenger cancels a reservation or does not show up for the plane, the airline can simply fill in the reserved spot with a standby passenger. Paratransit does not have this flexibility, since the vehicle must be rerouted in the case of a cancellation or makes a futile trip in case of a no-show. Cancellations and no-shows are a major problem for his system, Mr. Douglas asserts: There are a number of arguments to support the repeal of the 14 days advanced reservation requirements as prescribed by §7.131. The most obvious reason is the waste of precious resources on clients who reserve trips well in advance, forget the trip has been scheduled, and do not call the provider to cancel the trip. Even when the client does remember to cancel the trip, they are only required to do so within an hour prior to the scheduled pick-up time, which does not allow us to effectively utilize the time slot for another client. We are averaging 16,183 canceled trips and 2,936 no-shows per month. Fourteen days advance reservation does not appear to be operationally feasible in a paratransit environment, and should be repealed or revised to make it more palatable for providers of specialized transportation services. Patrisha Piras, a California transportation consultant and Board member of AC Transit, also petitioned the Department to eliminate this provision. She views this provision as an impediment to the effective implementation of ``real-time'' scheduling for paratransit services. Her rationale is the following: Real-time scheduling provides a dynamic ability for the service provider to respond to the current level of demand from service users. Adjustments in wait time and vehicle trip patterns are based on the current situation ``on the street.'' This is a significant contrast to traditional ``advance reservation'' systems, where trips are booked several days in advance, creating an artificial picture of actual service, since often users would subsequently cancel or rearrange trips, and the provider would then have to rearrange planned vehicle deployment and assignments. [In my experience] *␣*␣*, often up to one third of trips booked on an advance reservation system are ultimately cancels or no-shows. This further creates a ``blocking'' mechanism, so that potential users would call farther and farther in advance to ensure a better chance of getting a ride *␣*␣*. What the 14-day advance provision does is to institutionalize capacity constraints, with a preference for people who have decided on their trip long in advance. This is counter to other philosophical bases of the regulation, which call for paratransit service to be relatively comparable to fixed-route, including the sense of ``spontaneity'' without having to pre-plan a trip. The 14-day advance provision also imposes or allows an implicit priority to certain kinds of trips, such as medical or other appointments, where the rider (and often the provider as well!) wants to have the certainty in advance that the trip is available. This, too, is counter to the basic service criteria of the regulations. The 14-day advance reservation provision should be eliminated (or, at a minimum, be made permissive and subservient to the other criteria) *␣*␣* (emphasis in original). By eliminating the 14-day provision, or making it permissive, the NPRM would permit transit providers to decline to accept reservations farther from the date of travel than the day before. The minimum reservation time requirement_that providers must provide next-day service_would, of course, remain in place. DOT-Proposed Adjustments to the Rule 1. Reduction of Paperwork for Paratransit Plan Updates Under the Department's ADA regulation, each fixed route public transit operator was required to submit a paratransit plan to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) by January 26, 1992. Section 37.135(c) of the rule requires that ``each entity shall submit an update to the plan on January 26 of each succeeding year.'' Section 37.139(j) requires these updates to include information needed to update the information requirements applying to the original plan, significant changes or revisions to the timetable, whether milestones for progress toward full compliance have been met, explanations of any slippage that has occurred in meeting the timetable for full compliance, and corrective action for any slippage. The same public participation requirements that applied to the original plan (including notice, a public hearing, and consultation with the disability community) apply to updates.
