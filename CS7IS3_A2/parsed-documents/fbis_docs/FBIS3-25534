The minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation, the Honorable Joseph Rwegasira, who was in Liberia for a three-day visit, told journalists in Dar es Salaam that the reports which were carried in some private local media were baseless. He said contrary to the reports, he found all the soldiers healthy and in high spirits, apart from only one soldier who is hospitalized following a leg injury in a football match. He said Tanzania's move of sending its soldiers to Liberia was a move of implementing the Cotonou Accord brokered by Economic Community of West Africa States, ECOWAS, OAU and the United Nations that called for, among other things, an expanded peacekeeping force to include peacekeepers from Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.
