Reliable sources in Beijing had earlier said Balladur, accompanied by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet would visit China from January 27 to 30 to mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Catherine Colonna, deputy spokesperson at the Foreign Ministry, said: "No decision has yet been taken on an eventual visit." The sources in Beijing said a close Balladur aide, Jacques Friedman, visited China at the end of December to prepare for the visit which would come a year after a cooling in relations brought about by French sales of fighter aircraft to Taiwan. Speaking on January 4, Juppe had said Paris this year hoped to rekindle relations with China.
