FBIS4-13446 "drnes076_j_94001" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Kuwait Assembly Speaker Rejects Iraqi Assembly Claims Assembly Speaker Rejects Iraqi Assembly Claims LD1904154294 Kuwait Radio Kuwait in Arabic 1000 GMT 19 Apr 94 LD1904154294 Kuwait Radio Kuwait Arabic BFN [Report on address by Assembly speaker Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun at the National Assembly in Kuwait on 19 April--recorded] [Excerpts] The National Assembly, chaired by its speaker Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun, held its regular session this morning. The assembly meeting opened with an address by the speaker in which he discussed claims by the president of the so-called Iraqi National Assembly that the Baghdad regime is not holding any Kuwaiti prisoners, hostages or others, and his invitation to a delegation from Kuwait's National Assembly to visit Iraq to verify this. The following is a recording of the speaker's address: [Al-Sa'dun] To begin with, this is not the first time an Iraqi official has made such statements; they have said this on many occasions. Similar statements were made by the foreign minister and other officials. We did not take any notice of them and did not try to respond to them because we felt that they did not deserve answering. However, the statement made this time by the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, inviting members of the Kuwaiti National Assembly to discuss some issues, as he put it, to serve what he described as the pan-Arab cause, the interests of both sides, in order to achieve stability and put an end to [word indistinct], compels us to respond. What also makes us respond to this statement is his belief -- as came across clearly in the text of his interview with the INA - that statements of this kind made by various officials have been concealed from the Kuwaiti Parliament by the Kuwaiti Government. Because of this, it is necessary to let the speaker of the Iraqi National Assemby and the Iraqi regime know the truth of the position of the Kuwaiti people, all the Kuwaiti people -- government, people, and parliament. The position of the Kuwaiti people was not taken today, but during the darkest of circumstances. It was taken when Kuwait was occupied, when there were disputes. Yes, let him hear, there were disputes between us on how to handle matters, but there were no differences on two issues; on the liberation of Kuwait when it was occupied and who should govern Kuwait. Let him know that clearly. [passage omitted] The stance of the Kuwaiti people toward the Iraqi regime, its occupation, and its practices was clear. Despite all that the Kuwaiti people faced then, not only at the hands of the Iraqi regime and its army but also at the hands of some of the people [as heard], our people managed to rise above all their wounds. Our people managed then, at a people's conference held under the patronage of his highness the amir and the chairmanship of his highness the heir apparent, at which representatives of all sections of Kuwaiti society were present -- our people managed at that conference to rise above all their wounds and adopt, with a clearly defined stance, Resolution 15 [words indistinct] which while condemning the practices of the Iraqi regime made it clear that the Kuwaiti people do not harbor any malice or grudge against the Iraqi people. Indeed, we said in Resolution 15 that part of the suffering faced by the Iraqi people or even all the suffering faced by the Iraqi people was caused by the Iraqi regime itself. It is astonishing to hear what the Iraqi regime, or the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, had to say when he invited a delegation from the Kuwaiti National Assembly to hold talks without involving the Kuwaiti Government, as if there were a government on one side and a National Assembly on the other. We may have our differences but in the face of these matters we are one side: the government, the National Assembly, and the system of government in Kuwait all stand on the same side. This is what we said then. [applause] [passage omitted] What does he want from such a meeting? His objective -- as he said openly --is to enable a delegation from the Kuwaiti National Assembly, whom they would invite, to acquaint themselves with all the facts that prove that they have no Kuwaiti prisoners. The result is already known, as far as he [as heard] is concerned: There are no prisoners. This is also aimed at helping the Iraqis to achieve their goals in their attempts to mislead the international community when they ask for a lifting of the blockade, arguing that they have responded to all the resolutions of the international community. We challenge -- I personally challenge -- the chairman of the Iraqi National Assembly to present to the international community evidence that Iraq has responded and accepted commitment to all the resolutions of the international community. Perhaps continuous pressure from the international community would make Iraq submit now. As a result of pressure it has indeed submitted to all that concerns the search for weapons. It has responded and carried out articles [words indistinct] and responded and implemented article [word indistinct]. But talk about [words indistinct], who is to blame for this? It is the Iraqi regime itself that is to blame, because, first, the boycott resolutions did not cover food or medicine; second, in addition to all [words indistinct] the international community allowed the Iraqi regime to export some of its oil so long as it does not exceed [words indistinct]. For this reason, Mr. Speaker [as heard], I [word indistinct] for these calls and illusions of the Iraqi regime or the chairman of the so-called Iraqi National Assembly not to continue. We say it here: the Iraqi regime cannot but [words indistinct] the problem of prisoners, and particularly Articles 30 and 31 of Resolution [?687], and especially also the implementation of Resolution [word indistinct]. It cannot but accept, respect, hand over the prisoners, and not just the prisoners, not just the hostages. We are always talking about the prisoners and hostages, but [words indistinct]. The international resolution speaks about handing over the prisoners, the hostages, or the bodies, if any, and also [words indistinct]. The remains of the dead and martyrs are of no less interest to us than the prisoners themselves. The Iraqi regime, if it really wanted to return to the fold of the international community... [pauses] The international community did not impose sanctions for nothing. The international community imposed sanctions on the Iraqi regime for a reason. This reason is the existing aggression, the aggression against Kuwait, Iraq's holding of POW's, and its lack of respect for international resolutions. Accordingly, if the Iraqi regime really wants to lift what it calls the suffering of the Iraqi people, it must abide by these resolutions because it is the Iraqi regime itself that is responsible for the plight of the Iraqi people. Mr. President [as heard], as I said, many statements were issued by officials on various occasions which did not make us respond to them. To remove any false impressions, however, to ensure that such invitations are not repeated, and to make it clear to the so-called speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, we tell him that all the invitations have reached us and we have listened to them. Despite all this, they have been rejected. So that they may not continue misleading the international community by saying that invitations have been concealed from the Kuwaiti Parliament, we tell him that the invitation has been heard and now we want you to hear the Kuwaiti people's rejection of this offer. The Iraqi regime has no choice in the POW issue -- and we challenge the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly to deny that the POW's are there -- but to abide by Resolution 187 [as heard] and to allow international organizations, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross, to have access to the POW's instead of inviting a Kuwaiti National Assembly or joint Arab delegation. [passage omitted] We challenge the Iraqi regime respond to these files. We challenge it to tell us whether each one of these POW's is present or missing. Official Iraqi documents were given to the Iraqi regime during the days of the occupation of Kuwait giving indications on where each prisoner had been taken from, what camp he had been put in in Kuwait, and what camp he had been transferred to in Iraq. Furthermore, the regime were also given documents on where each one of them had been seen for the last time. Therefore, the invitation made by the speaker of the so-called Iraqi National Assembly is rejected. I suggest to the brothers in the national assembly, for things to be clear, to ask the brothers in the Foreign Ministry to prepare a clear statement on the National Assembly stance which ultimately represents that of the Kuwaiti people and everybody in Kuwait: government, people, and system vis-a-vis this issue. Thank you brother president. [end recording]
