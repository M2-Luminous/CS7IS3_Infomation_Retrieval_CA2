FR940802-2-00019 FR940802-2-00017 Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Safe Interim Storage of Hanford Tank Wastes at the Hanford Site, Richland, WA, and Announcement of Public Hearings AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of the Safe Interim Storage of Hanford Tank Wastes Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DOE/EIS&hyph;0212), prepared jointly with the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology). The draft EIS was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, and its implementing regulations and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) guidelines. DOE and Ecology have identified the need to resolve near-term tank safety issues associated with Watchlist tanks identified pursuant to Section 3137 of P.L. 101&hyph;510, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, ``Safety Measures for Waste Tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation,'' while continuing to provide safe storage for other Hanford wastes. This would be an interim action pending other actions that could be taken to convert waste to a more stable form based on decisions resulting from the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The purpose for this action is to resolve safety issues concerning the generation of unacceptable levels of hydrogen in two Watchlist tanks, 101&hyph;SY and 103&hyph;SY. Current planning considers retrieval in dilute form of waste from Tanks 101&hyph;SY and 103&hyph;SY, hydrogen-generating Watchlist double shell tanks (DSTs) in the 200 West area, to be the highest priority action. DATES: The Department invites comments on the Draft Statement from all interested parties. Written comments or suggestions regarding the adequacy, accuracy, and completeness of the Draft Statement will be considered in preparing the Final Environmental Impact Statement (Final Statement) and should be received by September 19, 1994. Written comments received after that date will be considered to the degree practicable. The Department will also hold three public hearings at which agencies, organizations, and the general public are invited to present oral comments or suggestions on the Draft Statement. Locations, dates, and times for the public hearings are provided in the sections of this notice entitled ``PUBLIC HEARINGS.'' Written and oral comments will be given equal weight and will be considered in preparing the Final Statement. Requests for copies of the Draft Statement and/or Final Statement or questions concerning the project, should be sent to: Dr. Don Alexander, U.S. Department of Energy; or Mr. Geoff Tallent, Washington Department of Ecology at the addresses noted below. ADDRESSES: Written comments on the Draft Statement should be received by September 19, 1994, for incorporation into the public hearing record. Oral comments will be accepted at the public hearings. Written comments, requests to speak at the hearings, or questions concerning the Safe Interim Storage of Hanford Tank Wastes EIS, should be directed to: Dr. Donald H. Alexander, U.S. Department of Energy, P.O. Box 550, MSIN S7&hyph;51, Richland, WA 99352, (509) 372&hyph;2453 Mr. Geoff Tallent, Washington Department of Ecology, P.O. Box 47600, Olympia, WA 99352, (206) 407&hyph;7112 If you request to speak, please indicate at which hearing(s). Envelopes should be labeled ``Safe Interim Storage of Hanford Tank Wastes, Draft Environmental Impact Statement.''

Borgstrom, Director, Office of NEPA Oversight (EH&hyph;25), U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, D.C. 20585, Telephone: (202) 586&hyph;4600 or (800) 472&hyph;2756. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background, Purpose and Need for the Proposed Action DOE has instituted numerous actions directed toward resolving safety concerns regarding the Watchlist tanks. In addition to tank-specific safety evaluations, DOE is currently mitigating near-term risk of fire or explosion involving hydrogen gas generation from Tank 101&hyph;SY by operating a mixer pump which modifies the rate and mechanism of hydrogen releases. Mixer pump installations in other hydrogen-generating Watchlist tanks may also mitigate the near-term risks of accidents. However, DOE has identified retrieval and dilution of the wastes in flammable gas-generating Watchlist tanks as the primary mechanism for resolving safety issues which would assure safe storage of these wastes during the interim time frame prior to implementing decisions based on the TWRS EIS that might change the form of the waste. Retrieval of the waste and storage in a dilute form would be considered remediation, the final step in safety issue resolution of the hydrogen under this strategy, while installation and operation of mixer pumps would be considered mitigation. Dilution would eliminate the generation of unacceptable levels of hydrogen by altering the reactions that result in hydrogen build up. Mitigation by mixer pumps would eliminate the mechanisms by which hydrogen gas concentrates to unacceptable levels. Because most of the Watchlist tanks are at or near capacity, dilution can best be accommodated through the use of other tank space rather than dilution in place. Upon review of available tank space and considering the potential for chemical incompatibility if existing DSTs were to be used as receiver tanks for Watchlist wastes, DOE is proposing to construct additional tank space to meet the need in the near term for storage of diluted wastes that would be retrieved from Watchlist Tanks 101&hyph;SY and 103&hyph;SY. Environmental Impact Statement Preparation The Draft Statement has been prepared in accordance with Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as implemented in regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) and by the Department's Implementing Procedures (10 CFR Part 1021). The Draft Statement has been prepared to assess the potential impacts of both the proposed action, and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action, on the human and natural environment.
