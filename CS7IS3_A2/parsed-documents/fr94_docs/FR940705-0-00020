FR940705-0-00020 FR940705-0-00002 One respondent recommended that the maximum tolerance limit for the web width of self-supporting cable be changed from +0.51 millimeters to +1.58 millimeters. Response: The reason that the maximum tolerance limit for the web width of self-supporting cables is specified at +0.51 millimeters is to assure that the web of self-supporting cables can be slit by craftpersons during installation using existing slitting tools. Increasing the maximum web width tolerance to +1.58 millimeters as recommended by the commenter would require the development of special slitting tools to assure satisfactory installation of these thicker webbed self-supporting cables by craftpersons. Since it is not the intent of REA to burden craftpersons with special tools needed to install theses thicker webbed self-supporting cables, REA will not change the maximum tolerance limit for the web width of self-supporting cables specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the maximum tolerance limit recommended by the respondent. One respondent recommended that the sheath slitting cord be made a mandatory component of the cable instead of an optional cable component. Response : The reasons 7 CFR 1755.900 specifies that the sheath slitting cord is an optional component of the cable are because not all cable installers use the sheath slitting cord to open the cable jacket during installation and during extremely cold weather installation. The sheath slitting cord does not aid the installer in opening the cable jacket because of the stiffness of the jacket. Because of the above reasons, REA will not make the sheath slitting cord a mandatory cable component in 7 CFR 1755.900. Two respondents commented that the language in paragraph (n)(2) of 7 CFR 1755.900 should be changed to better reflect the functional needs of fiber optic cables currently being used by REA borrowers and to quantify the sheath slitting cord requirement. Response : REA reviewed the reasons for the proposed change in language submitted by the commentators and as a result of our review will change the present language in paragraph (n)(2) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to better reflect the functional needs of fiber optic cables currently being used by REA borrowers and to quantify the sheath slitting cord requirement. One respondent recommended that the numbering sequence for re-marked cables be changed from 3,000 to 1,000. Response : REA would like to point out that the 3,000 numbering sequence for re-marked cables specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 is the same numbering sequence for re-marked cables as specified in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90. Since manufacturers have been using the 3,000 numbering sequence for re-marked cables as specified in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90 for more than seven years without any reported problems, REA will not change the numbering sequence for re-marked cables specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the numbering sequence for re-marked cables recommended by the commenter. One respondent recommended adding a new identification marking requirement to 7 CFR 1755.900 that requires a telephone handset symbol to be marked on the outer jacket of fiber optic cables intended for direct burial installation in accordance with Rule 350G of the 1993 National Electric Safety Code (NESC). Response : Since the REA Form 515 Construction Contract requires that all types of construction comply with the safety requirements specified in the NESC, REA will change paragraph (o)(2) in 7 CFR 1755.900 to require that all direct buried fiber optic cables be marked with the telephone handset symbol in accordance with Rule 350G of the 1993 NESC. This change will cause existing paragraphs (o)(2) through (o)(11) to be renumbered as paragraphs (o)(3) through (o)(12) in 7 CFR 1755.900. Two respondents commented on the attenuation requirements specified in paragraph (p)(1)(i) of 7 CFR 1755.900. The first respondent recommended deleting the reference to EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;59 because this standard is used to determine point discontinuities and not attenuation. The second respondent recommended changing the attenuation values specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 for dispersion-unshifted and dispersion-shifted single mode optical fibers to 0.4 dB/km and 0.25 dB/km, respectively. Response : With regard to the EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;59 reference, REA agrees with the commenter and will eliminate the reference to EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;59 in paragraph (p)(1)(i) of 7 CFR 1755.900. In regard to the change in attenuation requirements, REA is satisfied that the 0.5 dB/km maximum attenuation requirement for both dispersion-unshifted and dispersion-shifted single mode optical fibers, although considered very loose when compared to other industry standards, will provide REA borrowers with satisfactory optical signal transmission. REA would also like to point out that the REA Form 515 Construction Contract allows REA borrowers the opportunity to specify lower attenuation values than the 0.5 dB/km maximum specification value for these type optical fibers and when such values are specified in the contract they must be met by the cable supplier to execute the contract. Since REA is satisfied that 0.5 dB/km maximum attenuation for both dispersion-unshifted and dispersion-shifted single mode optical fibers will provide satisfactory optical transmission and the knowledge that REA borrowers can specify lower attenuation values than the specification value to successfully execute the REA Form 515 Construction Contract, REA will not change the attenuation values specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to values recommended by the commenter. One respondent recommended deleting the requirement to conduct attenuation measurements at the wavelength specified for the application as stated in paragraphs (p)(1)(iv) and (p)(2)(iii) of 7 CFR 1755.900. The reason for the respondent's recommendation is the possibility of REA borrowers specifying attenuation requirements at nonstandard wavelengths which would require the development of new test equipment. The development of this new equipment would in turn result in added cable costs.
