He said that in view of the present situation in China's securities market, the time is not right for setting up a third exchange. Tong Zengyin, who is a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee and is attending the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee here, said that the securities market in China is still in an experimental stage and the recent situation in the stock market is not quite satisfactory. This shows that securities markets in China are not yet mature. Under such circumstances, it would not be advisable to set up a new securities exchange. Tong Zengyin said that as far as the country as a whole is concerned, all the securities exchanges are located in the south and there is no such market in the hinterland. Their location is irrational. He held that viewed from location, the number of securities exchanges should be increased, and it is necessary to site one in the north. The best way is to have securities exchanges in the north, south, east, and west. He said that at present many localities have applied to set up a securities exchange, and where the new securities should be located depends on timing. When it is the right time to set up a new securities exchange, it will be necessary to look at market developments and find out what locality has the more developed market and needs a securities exchange. Besides, it is also necessary to find out whether or not advanced technology and telecommunications conditions are available for the formation of a market. Tong Zengyin holds that the situation of the two securities exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen is not bad and the two exchanges are growing very fast. The securities exchange in Shanghai in particular has developed to a considerable size and is ready to merge with the international market. It has a very bright future.
