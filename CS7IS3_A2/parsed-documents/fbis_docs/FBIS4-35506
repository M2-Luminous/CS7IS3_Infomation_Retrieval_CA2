The failure of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's new tour heightened their interest further. Christopher obviously leaned toward the Israeli viewpoint, which is based on the following sequence: normalization, security, and withdrawal. Syria insists on a comprehensive solution and on the implementation of the international resolutions in a way that secures the reverse order: withdrawal, security, normalization. In this regard, visitors quoted a senior Syrian official as saying that the peace process is still faltering and that the direct U.S. position is now more biased toward Israel. Some White House circles, added the official, are working to disavow the agreement reached between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton in Geneva early this year, and various types of pressure are increasingly being applied to make Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan give in to demands for separate peace deals in which Israel emerges as the stronger party. The senior Syrian official stressed that Damascus cannot accept the U.S.-Israeli proposals but will not try to obstruct the negotiations. The Arabs should not try to stop this process although it is crippled and running into major trouble, the official said. Syria, he added, is preparing to confront every form of pressure that Israel, together with the United States and some European allies, may apply to force Syria to change its position. The senior official recalled before his Lebanese visitors a conversation he had with a medium-level U.S. official and political delegations. The foreign delegations asked about Syria's strengths that make it reject the Israeli proposals and resist political pressure. The delegations also asked how Syria could face the possibility of war after the collapse of the Soviet Union and China's failure to emerge as a new superpower. They wondered how Syria could face that possibility when the Arabs are walking away from it and the Palestinians are going it alone in normalizing ties with Israel. The American delegations also cited the deteriorating economic situation in the region in general and in the Gulf in particular and the terrible collapse of the political, popular, and official Arab positions that Syria used to support. The Syrian official said he told his American interlocutors that war does not make peace and that Israel's traditional power does not conceal its weakness in other ways. He said he reminded the Americans of the Vietnam war. Although the balances of power were in favor of the United States, the Vietnamese people achieved a victory, one that still represents an inferiority complex for the Americans. A more vital example is formed by events in Lebanon in the past decade. Although U.S., European, and Israeli armies occupied most of Lebanon's territory, the popular resistance scored formidable victories. The senior Syrian official added: With its current economic situation, its reasonable stock of foodstuffs and energy, and its relative self-sufficiency in the area of health, Syria can hold out for years under pressure. The extensive development plans will make Syria even stronger in the next few years--and this is apart from Syria's conventional military power not being as weak as many imagine. The official stressed that Syria can face a great deal of economic, political, and military pressure and does not find itself compelled to offer new concessions on any level. [passage omitted]
