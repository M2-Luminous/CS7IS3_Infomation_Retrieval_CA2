SAIGON GIAI PHONG has the honor of presenting this interview to our readers. [Truong Ba Can] Dear Prime Minister, does the religious issue ever pose any concern to you at all? [Vo Van Kiet] As far as religion is concerned, the recent incidents in Hue and Ho Chi Minh City have caused me great concern. I would like to point out here that our country was dominated and suffered from the consequences of war for quite a long time. Since regaining national independence and unification, we have set a clear direction for advancement and scored initial achievements in the renovation process. Although there are more issues to be discussed and developed, we must strive to maintain stability in our country, especially the politico-social stability so as to develop our economy more rapidly. This is a very important experience we have had in the past period. [Truong Ba Can] What is your assessment of the Ho Chi Minh City Catholic community's role in maintaining stability? [Vo Van Kiet] I have always highly appraised the patriotic spirit of Vietnamese Catholics in Ho Chi Minh City. I still remember, during the most difficult period when fighting erupted at the southwestern border and the city experienced food shortages, that the people had to eat sorghum and sweet potato. Yet, Vietnamese Catholics and people in the city, together with Catholic priests, participated in building water conservation projects and setting up defense lines. Even Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh went to the Thai My state farm to take the lead in building water conservation projects, and to Hoc Mon District to attend a ceremony launching construction of a border defense line. Both the archbishop and I had very small roles in this work, but the presence of the archbishop greatly encouraged Vietnamese Catholics there to work selflessly to overcome the difficulties and stabilize their daily lives, thereby sharing the hardships with the other people in the city. Perhaps it is for this reason that despite the confusion in the Vatican's recent unilateral appointment of an apostolic administrator [giams quanr toongr toaf] in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamese Catholics have firmly maintained their daily lives, carried out their normal activities, and participated actively in various socioeconomic development programs while organizing a solemn, beautiful, and orderly Christmas celebration. I should say that Vietnamese Catholics in the city realized quickly that the Ho Chi Minh City administration's reaction to this case was aimed at protecting national sovereignty, abiding by the state law, and maintaining stability for the daily lives of the people. Thanks to this awareness, the city's Committee for Solidarity among Vietnamese Catholics successfully organized its third congress recently with the participation of all Catholic priests and adherents as in the past. [Truong Ba Can] Dear Prime Minister, the appointments of bishops and apostolic administrators are normally discussed with and jointly approved by the Vatican and the State of Vietnam. What is your opinion on the recent Vatican appointment? [Vo Van Kiet] According to international practice, many countries contend that the appointment of bishops should be done in consultation with and with the approval of the governments of the nations concerned. In the latest agreement between the Vatican and Poland, this point was stipulated. Vietnam has no such agreement with the Vatican because we have no official diplomatic relations with the Holy See. We have, however, reached consensus with the Vatican that the appointments of cardinals, bishops, and apostolic administrators should be discussed with and approved by our government in advance. There were, however, abnormal cases, such as a number of bishops who have been approved jointly by the government and the Vatican, but official appointments from the Holy See have not been made. It is regrettable that the Vatican recently appointed an apostolic administrator for the Ho Chi Minh City diocese without consultation with the Vietnamese Government. I think that the Vatican should consider this issue carefully. [Truong Ba Can] But Catholic bishops are dutybound to take orders from the Vatican. [Vo Van Kiet] I understand this point. We must not forget, however, that these bishops are also Vietnamese citizens, and as such they must abide by the state law as do other Vietnamese citizens. Moreover, I think that, in some cases, the Vatican has not firmly grasped the actual situation in Vietnam. If provided with adequate and accurate information, the Vatican would have arrived at the appropriate decisions. It is firmly believed that Vatican does not want to create tension and drive the local Catholic Church onto an unlawful path. We are aware that since the Vietnamese Government's refusal to accept the appointment of the aspotolic administrator of Ho Chi Minh City Diocese, the Vatican has not made its official attitude known, pending arrival of its delegation in Vietnam. [Truong Ba Can] As far as we know, the appointment of bishops is totally under Vatican jurisdiction. Prior to an appointment, however, according to normal diplomatic practice, the Vatican must consult with the government of the relevant country over this. For its part, the relevant government may or may not accept this appointment, depending on its political considerations. You are therefore kindly requested to speak of the conditions and standards for acceptance. [Vo Van Kiet] As for the issue of appointing bishops in Vietnam, I would like to clarify the following points: 1. At present, certain dioceses still have some bishopric slots left unfilled. I would like to point out here that this has nothing to do with the Vietnamese Government. This is because the Vietnamese Government has, only in certain cases, refused to accept such appointments, leaving the Vatican with many options. 2. As for Ho Chi Minh City, over the past 18 years, thanks to the presence of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh as the head of the church, the Catholic compatriots have been experiencing positive change and growth. Therefore, when the issue of a successor to Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh was raised, the Vietnamese Government made it clear that the new archbishop must be the one who will carry on along those beautiful lines. I believe that every government must have measures to protect its national sovereignty and maintain public order and security in order to guarantee a peaceful and happy life for its people. If the Vatican respects Vietnamese sovereignty and is interested in bringing about a stable life for its faithful, it would not be difficult for it to reach a consensus with our government. I have the feeling that the Vatican has, in certain cases, not been well-informed of the situation in Vietnam. [Truong Ba Can] Could you, the prime minister, cite some specific cases? [Vo Van Kiet] The issue of Catholic fathers and clergymen participating in people's elected organs or in Vietnam Catholics Unity [VCU] committees was a case in point. In 1982, there was a circular from Rome advising Catholic fathers and clergymen not to stand for National Assembly or people's council elections. It also prohibited them from setting up or participating in any associations, as this may cause division in the church. Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh and some other bishops convinced the Vatican that in Vietnam joining the National Assembly or people's councils is just for the purpose of performing one own's duty as a citizen and not for engaging in a power struggle as in other countries. VCU committees are only popular political organizations designed to promote patriotism among Catholic compatriots. The Vatican seems to have been aware of this fact and most of the Vietnamese bishops have let their subordinate Catholic priests and other clergymen join Fatherland Front committees, elected organs, and VCU committees. Nevertheless, I was advised in 1992 that due to unknown reasons, the Vatican issued another circular, urging Vietnamese bishops to prohibit their priests and other clergymen from joining elected organs or VCU committees. It took 10 years, from 1982-92, for Catholic bishops, fathers, and clergymen and all other Catholic compatriots in Vietnam to have become clearly aware that far from doing any harm to Catholicism, those Catholic clergymen serving elected organs or VCU committees have done good services to the region and the country. Fully aware of this fact, why is it that certain bishops have continued to cite the Vatican order as an excuse to prohibit their subordinate clergy from joining elected organs or VCU committees? I think that by taking part in national construction activities, Catholic compatriots are exercising their rights and duties as citizens. [Truong Ba Can] This issue has been raised partly because the religious policy has failed to appease people's worries about various issues such as the seminarian issue, the operations and education of various religious orders, the repair and construction of churches, and so forth. [Vo Van Kiet] The reason why our government continues to remain strict in certain areas is that we want to ensure stability for social and religious activities. If everyone is aware of this, the resolution of various matters would become easier. Therefore, we must give specific consideration to each particular issue. We must listen to public opinion and join hands in resolving it. All for common stability. [Truong Ba Can] You, the prime minister, just stated that the lines to be followed are the ones advocated and practiced by Arbishop Nguyen Van Binh in Ho Chi Minh City over the past 18 years. What did you have in your mind when saying so? [Vo Van Kiet] I was thinking of those lines brought up by various bishops in a joint letter dated 1 May 1980 which advocates "leading a Gospel-directed life in the bounds of the nation in order to serve the happiness of the compatriots." This means that while caring about the religion, one must also concern oneself with secular affairs. More precisely, religion is designed to care for the people. Leading a Gospel-directed life means serving the happiness of compatriots in general, not just Catholic compatriots. This also involves the attitude to be adopted in everyday life. We must support our nation, respect our national interests, national sovereignty and state law, understand difficulties facing it, and put ourselves in the same difficult situation of the country whenever we discuss national issues, including those related to church and state. It is regrettable that all Vietnamese bishops have only deployed and applied these lines within their own dioceses. On the contrary, in Ho Chi Minh City, Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh has constantly adhered to these lines since the liberation of the south. As a high-ranking clergyman, he has been caring and working for his religion and has, at the same time, never allowed himself to forget his duty toward the nation, as he has always cared for the national interest. I have the feeling that the Catholic Church has yet to fully appreciate the meritorious deeds of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh or treat him fairly. As a man who has dedicated his whole life to a cause, he has only one desire, that is to see what he has done continue to be carried out. All of us must show responsibility in this matter. [Truong Ba Can] In 1994, the Ho Chi Minh City Catholic Diocese will celebrate its 150th anniversary. This is an opportunity for us to review our past in preparation for the future. [Vo Van Kiet] Yes, history has left us a very damaging legacy, namely the prejudices between Catholics and non-Catholics and between Catholicism and communism. Today, this situation has changed greatly, though not completely. If there are any points in the relationship that we do not correctly understand, we must continue to resolve them. The reason why there have been changes for the better in Ho Chi Minh City is that we have practiced the policy on religious freedom and satisfactorily achieved the goal of ensuring the benefits of both the region and the people. It must be admitted that the contributions made by Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, the Catholics Motivation Committee, the Catholic Unity Committee, and the journal CONG GIAO VA DAN TAN [CATHOLICS AND THE NATION] are very important. Therefore, we must try to ensure that the heir to the archbishopric of Ho Chi Minh City will not follow a policy which run counters to that of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh and that the Catholic Unity Committee and the journal CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC can play bigger roles in helping the Catholic community achieve progress together with the rest of the nation. Some people often complain about having difficulty seeking permission to build churches. But everywhere I went, I saw many newly built churches, including many large ones whose construction cost billions of dong. Our Catholic compatriots, of course, need comfortable and fine-looking places to meet and worship. But in some localities, there have been expensive churches built in the middle of slum areas. This must be reviewed, taking into account the need to increasingly improve the material and cultural life of the working Catholic people. Although I still have many things to talk about, please allow me to stop here. Through the journal CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC, I wish the readership and the city's Catholic compatriots good health and happiness. As Vietnamese, irrespective of one is Catholic or not, we share the same motherland. Formerly, people thought of setting out in search of a new life in one area or another. But now it has become evident that there is no area for us to live in other than our own motherland. Therefore, we must join hands in a bid to build a prosperous country for the benefit of both the people and the region. [Truong Ba Can] On behalf of the CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC readership and the Catholic compatriots in the city, I wish you, the prime minister, good health so you can continue to lead the country forward.
