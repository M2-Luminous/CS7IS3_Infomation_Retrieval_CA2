SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The subject modification to permit No. 843, issued on June 2, 1993 (58 FR 32520), is requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq .), and the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216). Permit No. 843 authorizes the permit holder to conduct aerial, boat, and ground surveys and scat collections for harbor seals ( Phoca vitulina ) at haulouts and rookeries in Alaska over a 4-year period ending in 1997. The permit holder now seeks authorization to capture and radio tag up to 50 harbor seals in order to determine a correction factor to be applied towards the number of seals at sea or moving between haulout sites, and thus missed by aerial surveys. The permittee estimates that up to 200a dditional seals may be disturbed incidental to the capture/tagging activities. Dated: June 3, 1994. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, National MarineFisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14250 Filed 6&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
