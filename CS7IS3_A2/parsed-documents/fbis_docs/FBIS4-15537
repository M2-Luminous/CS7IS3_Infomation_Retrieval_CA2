Sidorova said Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had met Chairman of the parliament of the United Republic of Yugoslavia, Radoman Bozovic, today in Moscow and had made Moscow's position known. "The sanctions were imposed due to the specific situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the situation changes, the need for sanctions disappears," Sidorova said. Sidorova suggested that this new opportunity must be used to settle the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia. She believes that the Serbs should participate in the agreement recently signed by Bosnian Moslems and Croats. "Russia will agree with any decision acceptable for all Bosnian parties. However, it is obvious that no settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina will work without the participation of the Serbs." She spoke for an urgent agreement on a cease-fire between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems at the talks begun today in Sarajevo. "The sooner it happens, the more chances there will be for the success of the political dialogue," Sidorova stressed. Bozovic emphasized the important role of the Russian diplomacy on Balkans. He said the recent positive changes were due to Russia's activities. Bozovic stressed that he had met many Russian parliamentarians representing different political blocs and factions. Practically all of them spoke for lifting sanctions against Belgrade. These sanctions are counter-productive and can only do harm, Bozovic said.
