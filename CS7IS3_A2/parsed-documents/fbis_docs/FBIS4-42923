It is easy to predict that, in terms of the turnout, Italy will be the most diligent. We will be much praised for this prelacy, which has been ours for some considerable time, and which will be interpreted as evidence of strong European commitment on our part. But, among ourselves, this is not really the issue at stake. Only a very small proportion of Italians who will vote will do so thinking of Europe or in the hope of contributing to its unification. Out of the 80 European deputies who will be elected only a fraction will make their way to the parliament in Strasbourg with the aim of attempting to achieve something there. As for the vast majority of both candidates and voters, Sunday's elections are only a testing ground for national politics, one which will reveal the actual balance of forces, not so much between the majority and the opposition as between the parties within the majority. In other words -- and so much for Europe -- the real issue will be to decide who among [National Alliance leader] Fini, [League Secretary] Bossi, and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi is the strongest. In the continuing and, indeed, increasingly marked absence of effective opposition forces (namely, the center and the Left), accounts are essentially to be settled among the ruling Right's three bosses. Of course, we resort to such labels -- center, Right, and Left --only for the sake of expediency and simplicity. In fact, these terms belong to the language of archaeology. So much so that, in order to give some sort of contents to their arguments, what do they focus on? On the merits and shortcomings of statesman Mussolini, or on the "values of the Resistance." No less than 50 years later. We are not saying all this in order to discourage voters from going to the polls, but rather to prevent any misunderstandings about the significance of the elections. Nobody, or hardly anybody, will cast their vote with the Maastricht Treaty in mind (in fact, nobody or hardly anybody knows anything at all about Maastricht). Everybody, or almost everybody, will vote thinking of Bossi, Fini, or Berlusconi, as apparent from the fact that all three are heading their respective lists, even thought everybody knows that Berlusconi will never be able to go to Strasbourg since this is incompatible with his post as prime minister; that Bossi will never want to go there because the Lombard dialect is not yet one of the official languages in Strasbourg; and that, as far as Fini is concerned, it would be best if he does not go to Strasbourg because too many rumors (of an ideological kind, of course) are circulating about him in Europe. All three, should they be chosen by voters, will delegate their duties to their henchmen. However, they will not be the sole absentees in a European Parliament in which Italian representatives have always held -- with a few rare exceptions -- three not very honorable records, namely those of absenteeism, salaries (the highest in Europe), and incompetence on almost every issue tabled. Indeed, it is equally notorious that, despite the financial rewards and the numerous related benefits, Italian politicians (once again, I repeat, with a few commendable exceptions) consider a seat in Strasbourg as a "consolation prize" which the bosses reserve for their most zealous, albeit dumb, minor vassals. All this turns Sunday's European elections into a sort of public forgery, without however any penal consequences. Yet, there is no choice but to vote. Not for Europe's sake, since nobody is interested in Europe, anyway. Rather, in order to see how much Berlusconi will manage to bleed Bossi, and therefore to what extent he will have to reach an understanding with him or, alternatively, get rid of him. This is not an irrelevant issue. Many things, both good and bad, may result from it. For us, though -- not for Europe.
