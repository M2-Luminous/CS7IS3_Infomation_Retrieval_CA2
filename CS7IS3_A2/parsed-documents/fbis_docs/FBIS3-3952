Last year, the province's gross import-export volume soared to 2.87 billion yuan, up 26 percent over the previous year. Yunnan boasts a border that stretches some 3,000 km, and by the end of 1993, 17 ports opening up to the world had been built. Presently, goods exported through border ports include steel products, building materials, electric machinery, articles of daily use, light industrial products, foodstuffs and beverages, not to mention farm and sideline produce, with the trade volume increasing with each passing year. Some of the items have become backbone products in border trade. The sites for trade have changed from stalls on the streets to large trade cities, shopping malls, and stores. Many ports have built comprehensive border trade markets comprising transportation, telecommunications, storehouses, catering, hotels, and other services.
