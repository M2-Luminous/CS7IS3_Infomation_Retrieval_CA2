Delaying a weapons program is always a costly move. The report compiled by Bouches-du-Rhone deputy Olivier Darrason and presented on behalf of the National Defense Committee in the Assembly offers fresh evidence of the fact. The Bouches-du-Rhone deputy, who is the reporter for the "Air" portion of the budget, calculated the cost of the government's decision to slow down the Rafale program at an additional Fr700 million. Most important, 1,170 to 1,420 highly-skilled jobs will be lost. The official reason for the six-month delay are budget decisions that will hold up the aircraft carrier, thus setting back the start-of-service date of the "Navy" and consequently the "Air" Rafale. The reporter, who considers Rafale primarily a replacement for Crusaders on the Foch, and not the Charles-de-Gaulle, challenges that pretext. The deputy believes the real reason is budget problems. Whatever the true cause, Olivier Darrason believes the financial and industrial costs will be high. He estimates the delay will raise the price tag of the program by Fr700 million--Fr400 million for development and Fr300 million for manufacture. "Thus, although we will save Fr1,535 million on the 1994 budget, final savings will reportedly be only Fr800 million, or about half," he calculates. But it is primarily the industrial consequences that are likely to cut deepest. Indeed, contrary to conventional wisdom, the projected budget delay cannot be absorbed solely by freezing new hiring, since program teams have already been sized to meet the deadlines in effect before the announced holdup. As a consequence, the deputy thinks job losses are unavoidable. To estimate them, he used a pre-study conducted last July by the ACE-International consortium on the consequences of potential lags. Although manufacturers are not committed to these numbers, which should be treated with caution, they do bring the picture into focus. "For Dassault Aviation and its subcontractors," says the report, "a six-month delay could cost 400 jobs, most of them engineer and high-level technician positions." Likewise, another 770 to 1,020 workers would be at risk among all the program's equipment suppliers: 200 at the enginemaker SNECMA, 450 to 700 for the electronics manufacturers (essentially Thomson-CSF and Dassault Electronique), and 120 for "C" equipment suppliers such as Dassault Equipements, ECE, Intertechnique, Labinal, Messier-Bugatti, Sagem, and Sextant. In all, over a thousand jobs, most of them in engineering, are at stake. "This is an unacceptable risk, for it would not only translate into additional delays and thus greater risks to employment, it would also mean an irretrievable loss of technological raw material," comments Olivier Darrason. Finally, the setbacks in the Rafale program clearly could compromise the fighter plane's chances for sales abroad. Between 1996 and 2000 or 2003, Dassault's aircraft will have no serious rival on the market. The F/A-18E/F, Gripen, and Eurofighter 2000 will still be pending. However, competition after that date will be fierce. Considering the combat fleet modernization needs that will then exist, France must make maximum use of the period to capture those markets. "We should be aware, then," concludes the report, "that delaying the Rafale means denying it export markets--a major asset against its rivals."
