Events that occur outside the discussion table influence differently those who are sitting at this table and on those who are abroad. Although we cannot say news has been lacking, it has certainly influenced the mood of the talks. For example, the news on what has been happening in Altamirano has influenced our work. Even if those events would not have occurred and we would not have known of the steps taken to achieve greater peace, it would have been difficult for the parties at the table to continue to progress without feeling there was a disturbing external pressure. Fortunately, after steps were taken, good sense prevailed. Although several incidents occurred again, they did not seriously affect our work, much less the sincerity with which we are all acting. The incidents did not hinder us from making progress on topics of greater complexity, which, as we admitted in the joint communique issued by the mediator, the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army], and the [peace] commissioner yesterday, present certain difficulties. The current difficulties are not, as could be thought, -- characteristically I have always spoken very truthfully -- the contents of the agreements being discussed for later approval or the lack of flexibility on one side or another -- such an attitude has not existed up to now -- but in the inherent complexity of the linguistic and cultural translation. That is, the complicated task of reading the text of the proposals and understanding the terms used in the wording of a text. The mediator has to say that he too has had difficulty in this respect because there are terms in our language that vary in meaning according to the level or field in which they are being used. A word used in computer science has an entirely different meaning in regular usage. Terms can be difficult, especially those that are abstract or have legal implications, which we do not use regularly, but which those who are advising us, at our request, do use regularly. To understand the terms and implications of a proposal, to make an accurate translation and find the corresponding words in the cultural field, and to assimilate all this to explain it to each linguistic group -- they have to go through exactly the same steps to be able to assimilate them and later take them to the groups in the four linguistic regions -- has prompted a complicated situation that computer techniques have not been able to alleviate. We can say, however -- we would have wanted to say it in a more impressive manner and with everyone present for your satisfaction -- that we are currently in the definitive consensus phase. We have discussed almost all of the document, which I will witness the day this ends. We always say it will be soon but there are the differences between the pace of western time and the Mayan culture, which is much slower. We could provide abundant examples of the complexity of this job, but instead of saying what I have already said, citing examples, perhaps we could preview the structure of the agreements themselves, practically all of which have already been discussed. Some 10 or 12 points remain to be discussed; some of them, four or five, are of secondary importance. Others have a certain relevance but there are language problems to be resolved. These points are being discussed but they are not fundamental in the agreement. We could say a significant agreement has been reached. The document will have the following points or subheadings: a preliminary set of articles or statements, which will be called Commitments for a Worthy Peace in Chiapas. There are 34 commitments. Two of these commitments do not include resolutions and have to do with democracy. It was difficult, since we knew from the beginning the commitments were not part of an agreement, strictly speaking, but they are opinions divulged to the national community and we certainly hope they will have an impact on the agreements. The drafting of these two agreements, which are statements and do not include resolutions, is already finished. The agreements containing resolutions have to do with the different problems or demands made by the EZLN, to which an overall response has been given since the first day and to which solutions will be found gradually, step by step. A few days ago, Subcommander Marcos and the commissioner said what percentage of the agreement points had been discussed. Once these commitments are made, naturally, we will reach the peace agreements. These agreements are made up of two parts: Mexican Government agreements and EZLN agreements, and include the military's role in this peace process, the amnesty that must be sought, the specific manner in which it must be implemented, and a final commitment to comply with the peace agreement. These two steps, commitments for a worthy peace, and peace agreements lead us to a third and final point, which is a peace declaration. This peace declaration, already formulated and agreed to in its basic terms by mutual consent, together with all the sets of previous documents and agreements, as well as said commitments, will be presented here when the logistical part is completed, and each copy of that set of agreements that is picked up will be authenticated by me. The necessary copies will be delivered to each party -- EZLN 19 copies -- and the team of the peace commissioner and myself (will be delivered) as many copies as necessary, authenticated, that is signed by me as was the text of the original agreed upon. Both parties will present the accords to the rank and file or grass-roots structures and corresponding levels so that, after the established time, which evidently will not be long, they will return to this city to make peace in what we hope will be a solemn and to some degree magnificent manner, because the signing of these accords pertains to the entire country. What the parties will do is to explain to their corresponding membership the implications and reasons why specific or concrete points were accepted. For the peace commissioner, there is one difficulty that involves convincing each agency that they are part of the execution of the accords, and for the EZLN it involves distributing the document to 19 different groups, communities, in the language of each group. Yesterday, for instance, both sides worked nearly unrelentingly. The EZLN representatives did not get much sleep; they went to bed at 0300 and had to be up and working by 0700. The peace commissioner and also the mediator, with their respective teams, were also working on the preparation of the three agreed fundamental ideas. They are in the process of drafting the final document to make the definitive assimilation [asimilacion definitiva] already agreed upon, with the exception of eight points which, as I said, are the ones that have not been definitively addressed. This will permit them to later get to the final part. It is a matter of explaining what the parties here have agreed to in this lengthy process of drafting documents and receiving the definitive support of all EZLN sectors, after the final signing. That is the process we wished to describe to you. Tomorrow, as opposed to what one might expect, given that today is Sunday, will be a day in which there will not be a news conference. All the infrastructure and logistics will be devoted to producing a document pertaining to issues already approved, and from that moment on, perhaps some of the things that must be considered a regulation of different infrastructures or commissions that have appeared as necessary and that have to be implemented. This is what we intended to convey to you, regretting that the pace of work has not allowed the peace commissioner or EZLN representatives to be present here today. Consequently, as we said earlier, there will be no news conference tomorrow nor Tuesday evening nor Wednesday morning. We hope that the work will be definitely completed. This will be reported in due time. Thank you very much for your kindness and understanding.
