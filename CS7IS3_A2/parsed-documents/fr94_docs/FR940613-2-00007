Scope of Order The product covered by this order is calcium aluminate (CA) flux, other than white, high purity CA flux. This product contains by weight more than 32 percent but less than 65 percent alumina and more than one percent each of iron and silica. CA flux is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheading 2523.10.0000.
