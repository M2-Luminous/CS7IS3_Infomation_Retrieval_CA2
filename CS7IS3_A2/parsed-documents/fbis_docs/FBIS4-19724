The only person with whom contact has not been made is Major Van Baal, who left to take leave 10 days ago in Sarajevo, against UN advice. Development Cooperation Minister Pronk made an appeal on the radio this morning [20 April] for the West to send more ground troops to Bosnia. According to Pronk, the Serbs must be convinced by the reinforcement of the international peacekeeping force that the international community is "serious." Since the UN troops have only a peacekeeping mission, air strikes are only allowed if UN troops are directly endangered. Neither the Air Force nor the ground troops, who are in the UN's service, have a mandate to impose peace. Moreover, they operate only with the consent of the belligerents in Bosnia. Within NATO, there have been hurried consultations to decide whether NATO aircraft can also be put into action if the populations of the "safe areas" are directly endangered, as was the case in Goradze. The Security Council has never given a mandate for ground actions. Ground troops must indeed protect the population of the "safe areas" and provide assistance for the passage of humanitarian transport. Pronk's statements are causing increasing irritation at the Defense Ministry and some high-level military officials fear that the military and political opinions of the development cooperation minister could cause confusion among the Netherlands military regarding Netherlands policy. [Defense] Minister Relus Ter Beek has repeatedly said that the Netherlands could not deliver more ground troops since there are not enough sufficiently trained career military personnel. Ter Beek let it be known to those around him that Pronk was speaking for himself and was not giving the government view. The safety of the Netherlands troops has not been endangered through actions taken in recent days, the Defense Ministry said. At noon Friday, the Second Chamber will talk with the defense and foreign ministers about the new situation in Bosnia. A majority of the Chamber wants the Netherlands to make politically active efforts in order to curb Serbian violence in Bosnia. The parliamentarians initially wanted an emergency debate but now they will settle for a statement.
