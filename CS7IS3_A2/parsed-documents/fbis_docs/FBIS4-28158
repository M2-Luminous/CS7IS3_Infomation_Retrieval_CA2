Also, the dear comrade leader personally looked over the corn rice newly developed at an institute in fall of last year and clearly elucidated the direction and method of producing corn rice through an industrial way. [passage omitted] The new corn rice which is being produced on a large scale at this work site through an industrial method is considerably superior in its shape, color, and quality compared with the previous corn rice. The new corn rice swells two times better than the previous corn rice and swells more than white rice. Therefore, when we cook the corn rice, it swells over three times. When eating, we can combine corn rice with the white rice or we can just eat the corn rice. Also, since the new corn rice melts over 20 percent less than the previous corn rice, it doesn't melt well in water and its degree of white color and stickiness are high. Therefore, when this is cooked, it not only looks and tastes delicious, it is very digestive. The new corn rice hardens over 40 percent less than the previous corn rice. The functionaries, party members, workers, and technicians of the Pyongsong food administration work site who were successful in producing the new corn rice through an industrial method are all the more consolidating the results that have already been achieved, and are also achieving results in carrying out the work to supplement more nutritive elements for the new corn rice.
