Xu Dakun, an official of the Local Railway Association of China, said here today that these projects, distributed over 12 provinces, have already been listed in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) of various localities. Xu said that by the end of 1993, China had 81 operating local railways in 17 provinces and autonomous regions, with a total length of over 4,800 km. At present some 20 local railways are being constructed, with a length of more than 2,000 km. China's local railways experienced a golden development time in the past ten years, with over 2,460 km of track laid. The total investment during this period was nearly 4.6 billion yuan, of which more than 4.1 billion yuan was raised by the local governments, while the Ministry of Railways put in 440 million yuan. China's local railways are differentiated from state-run railways by the characteristics that the construction cost is mainly raised by local governments, and the local governments have partial or complete management rights. Local railways have now become an organic part of China's transport network. To ease the present strained condition of railway transport, the Chinese Government has in recent years drafted a series of significant policies to promote railway development, which include preferential policies encouraging local governments to construct railways with self-raised funds. In addition, the Chinese Government also encourages local governments to construct railways with overseas funds. So far the world bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Japanese Government and Taiwan have provided money for local railway construction. Xu revealed that six new local railways are prepared to introduce overseas construction funds. He said that since the founding of New China in 1949, China's railways have developed from 22,000 km to more than 54,000 km, of which 41 lines, or over 3,100 km, have been constructed by local governments and transferred to the state. Some of them have now become an important part of the national railway network. By the year 2000, China's operating railways will exceed 8,000 km, with a freight transport volume of 100 million tons, Xu added.
