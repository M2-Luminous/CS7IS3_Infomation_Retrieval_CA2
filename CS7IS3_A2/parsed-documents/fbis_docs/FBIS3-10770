This was confirmed by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. Robaina said we have not received official invitations for the Cuban Government and authorities. He disclosed, however, that singer Silvio Rodriguez; the House of the Americas director, poet Roberto Fernandez Retamar; and Latin American Studies Center Director Luis Suarez have received personal invitations to the event. In comments to ANSA, Robaina said: "We hope it (Chile) will continue on that path." The foreign minister said Cuba respects the way the Chileans have handled the presidential inauguration and reiterated that Havana is in no hurry to resume ties with Chile. Chile and Cuba broke diplomatic relations on 11 September 1973 after the bloody military coup against constitutional Chilean President Salvador Allende. The two countries resumed relations at a consular and commercial level in 1991, as a prior step to the definite normalization of their bilateral relations.
