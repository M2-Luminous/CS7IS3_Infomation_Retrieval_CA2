FR941116-0-00004 FR941116-0-00001 5. Time periods for filing charges with the General Counsel or petitions for review with the Board (§§29.8 and 29.10): The current regulations applicable to claims filed by employees of the GAO require such employees to file a charge with the Board's General Counsel within 20 days after receiving the agency's decision on a complaint of discrimination or retaliation. 4 CFR 28.98(b). Similarly, employees have 20 days after service of a Right to Appeal Letter by the Board's General Counsel, in which to file a petition for review with the Board. 4 CFR 28.18(b). The Board was concerned that this 20-day period may not provide sufficient time for employees of the Architect of the Capitol to file their claims with the Board and its General Counsel. The Board is not a part of their agency and it is not located in one of their buildings. It will take some time for employees of the Architect of the Capitol to become familiar with the Board's existence, its procedures, and its location. For this reason the Board has increased the time period for filing charges with the General Counsel and petitions for review with the Board to 30 days. In order to have consistent regulations for the two agencies within the Board's jurisdiction, the Board is also increasing these filing times to 30 days for claims filed by employees of the General Accounting Office. 6. Application of these regulations to pending cases (§29.13): The Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act became effective on July 22, 1994. From that date forward, employees of the Architect of the Capitol have enjoyed the right to bring their claims of discrimination to the Board, once they have exhausted the necessary remedies within their agency. The legislative history of the Act carves out one exception to this rule. Certain employees of the Architect of the Capitol had the right, prior to July 22, 1994, to file a complaint of discrimination with the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices. See, Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, 2 U.S.C. 1201. Any complaint of discrimination that was pending with or on appeal from that office on July 22, 1994, is to continue to be processed by that office, pursuant to the procedures of the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991. See, H. R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;567, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. at 14 (1994). Changes to the Procedures Applicable to Employees of the General Accounting Office The adoption of the new regulations concerning employees of the Architect of the Capitol necessitates certain conforming amendments to 4 CFR Part 28, which sets forth the procedures applicable to employees of the GAO. In addition, the Board is amending the provisions of its regulations concerning judicial review of Board decisions to reflect a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. These changes are described below. 1. Purpose and scope (§28.1): Section 28.1 has been amended to make clear that the procedures in Part 28 implement the Board's authority with respect to GAO employees, while the procedures applicable to Architect of the Capitol employees are set forth in Part 29. 2. Time periods for filing charges with the Board's General Counsel and for filing petitions for review with the Board (§§28.11, 28.18, and 28.98): The Board is expanding the time periods for filing charges with the Board's General Counsel and for filing petitions for review with the Board. GAO employees will now have 30 days following the relevant agency action in which to file charges with the Board's General Counsel. In addition, they will have 30 days following service of a Right to Appeal Letter by the Board's General Counsel in which to file a petition for review with the Board. As discussed above, the Board concluded that expanded filing periods were necessary in order to give employees of the Architect of the Capitol sufficient time in which to exercise their appeal rights. The Board decided that it was desirable to have one consistent set of time frames applicable to all claims that are filed with the Board. It therefore decided to extend these expanded time periods to claims filed by GAO employees. As a result, GAO employees will also have the benefit of additional time in which to make decisions about their appeal options, and to prepare and submit their papers to the Board. See changes below to §§28.11(b), 28.18(b), and 28.98(b) and (c). 3. Judicial review of Board decisions (§28.90): Two changes have been made to the procedures for seeking judicial review of Board decisions. First, the Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act amended the Board's governing statute to make clear that final Board decisions concerning Architect of the Capitol employees may be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. See, Pub. L. 103&hyph;283, sec. 312(e)(4)(C). This statutory change is reflected in the amendment to §28.90(a) below. Several sections of the Board's regulations that concern judicial remedies have also been amended in light of the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Ramey v. Bowsher, 9 F.3d 133 (D.C. Cir. 1993). For many years, the Board's regulations have provided that employees complaining of unlawful discrimination on the basis on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability may file suit in Federal district court even after they have received a final decision from the Board on their claim. See, current 4 CFR 28.100. In Ramey, the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Board's interpretation was erroneous and that an employee's only recourse following a final decision of the Board on a claim of discrimination is to seek appellate review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
