The present staff of the Albanian Embassy in Athens is composed of five diplomats. Strangely enough, this fact runs counter to the statements uttered by the Greek government members themselves on finding a way to dialogue and cooperation. As a result, the message from Athens is difficult to be understood, says a statement of the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Albania regarding this event.
