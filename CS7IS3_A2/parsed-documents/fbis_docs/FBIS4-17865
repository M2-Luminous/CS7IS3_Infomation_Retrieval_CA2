Bouvard pointed out that during his visit to Russia and meetings with Russian lawmakers he realised that the attitude of Russian parliamentarians to the Partnership for Peace Programme was not unequivocal. In his opinion, this can be accounted for by internal, rather than external political reasons. Bouvard pointed out that he was prepared to explain the situation in the NATO Parliament. The speaker of the Federation Council believes that the attitude to this problem in Russia and, in particular, statements made by politicians depend on the availability of information. Shumeyko suggested that the lack of information about developments in Yugoslavia affected the attitude of the Russian people. Shumeyko pointed out that many people find the problem of joining the NATO programme difficult because only yesterday, NATO was Russia's adversary. "However, this problem is in the process of settlement," Shumeyko said.
