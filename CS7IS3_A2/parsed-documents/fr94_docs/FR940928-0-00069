FR940928-0-00069 FR940928-0-00021 A. Pool Heaters 1. Feasibility of Labeling The Commission is required to prescribe a labeling rule for the categories of products listed in EPCA, 21 which now include pool heaters, unless it determines that labeling the product is ``not technologically or economically feasible.'' 22 The NPR asked for comment on this issue, emphasizing that the question was whether labeling pool heaters would be economically or technologically infeasible (as distinct from testing, which manufacturers and importers must do in order to comply with DOE's minimum efficiency standards program). 23 21 42 U.S.C. 6294(a)(1) and (b)(5); 42 U.S.C. 6292(a). 22 42 U.S.C. 6294(a)(1). During the original rulemaking, the Commission determined that clothes dryers, television sets, kitchen ranges and ovens, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, and home heating equipment other than furnaces should be exempted from the requirements of the Rule on this basis and, in some cases, because labeling them would not assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. 44 FR 66466, 66467&hyph;69 (Nov. 19, 1979). This second criterion for exemption provided by EPCA relates only to a few products. Pool heaters are not among them. 42 U.S.C. 6294(a)(2). 23 See 10 CFR 430.62. Three comments addressed this issue. CEC stated that labeling these products is both economically and technologically feasible and that the value to consumers of the label information greatly outweighs the labeling cost to industry. CEC pointed out that manufacturers currently provide energy efficiency information on pool heaters to DOE and CEC, but not to the purchaser. 24 ACEEE and ALG also supported labeling requirements for pool heaters without elaboration. 25 The record does not indicate that labeling of pool heaters would be technologically or economically infeasible. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to amend the Rule to include labeling requirements for the pool heater category. 24 CEC, EE&hyph;2, 2. 25 ACEEE, EE&hyph;3, 1; ALG, EE&hyph;5, 1. 2. Definition for ``Pool Heater'' The NPR explained that the EPCA/DOE definition of pool heaters is not limited to products of any particular fuel type. 26 The DOE test, however, covers only gas- and oil-fired products. 27 Although the majority of pool heaters are currently gas-fired (with some oil-fired), electric resistance and heat pump pool heaters are also being manufactured. Because the DOE test covers only gas- and oil-fired pool heaters, the NPR proposed amending the Rule to cover only these two types of products. The Rule's coverage is necessarily limited by the definitions and test procedures in Subpart B of DOE's rules ( i.e., in the absence of a DOE test procedure for determining energy usage, compliance with the Rule is impossible). The NPR proposed, therefore, adopting the EPCA/DOE definition of ``pool heater'' along with a proviso stating that the Rule's scope is limited to those products within the definition for which there is a DOE-prescribed test for measuring energy usage. 26 See 58 FR 7853. Section 321(a)(25) of EPCA (42 U.S.C. 6291(a)(25)) defines ``pool heater'' as follows: ``The term `pool heater' means an appliance designed for heating nonpotable water contained at atmospheric pressure, including heating water in swimming pools, spas, hot tubs and similar applications.'' 27 Although DOE uses the EPCA definition of pool heater in its regulations at 10 CFR 430.2, and in its test procedure for pool heaters (Appendix P to Part 430 of 10 CFR), the procedure pertains only to gas- and oil-fired heaters. Two comments addressed the proposed definition. ACEEE stated that the Commission's adoption of the definition in section 430.2 of DOE's rule with the proposed proviso would be acceptable. 28 CEC agreed that the Rule should be amended to include the language in section 430.2, but opposed the addition of the proviso, stating that DOE has developed, but not yet published, an all-inclusive test method, and that the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (``ASHRAE'') has appointed a committee to develop a test for gas, oil, electric, and heat pump pool heaters. 29 28 ACEEE, EE&hyph;3, 1. 29 CEC, EE&hyph;2, 2, 4. The Commission has determined to amend the Rule to include the definition of pool heaters as that term is defined in EPCA and by DOE (in section 430.2 of Subpart A). The definition is followed by a proviso stating that the Rule's application is limited to those products for which there is a DOE-prescribed test. See section 305.3(o) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. The Commission recognizes, as CEC pointed out, that there may eventually be a test procedure for all types of these products. However, the Commission's authority here to require labels is limited to products for which DOE has published final test procedures. If DOE amends the test procedure to include electric resistance and/or heat pump pool heaters, the Commission will then initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider whether the Rule should be amended to cover those products.
