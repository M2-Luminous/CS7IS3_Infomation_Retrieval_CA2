We are today starting a basic task to ensure the future of the country. I refer to the proposal for improving the regulations, procedures, and institutions that watch over public morals. I have invited well-known authorities and personalities of our society to become members of the National Commission on Public Morals that is established today. The members of this national commission guarantee to seriously study and achieve good results in the areas in which the commission will work. I thank them all for agreeing to carry out this task. From the beginning of my administration, I stated my commitment and that of my government to an honest public administration and an impersonal use of power. I recently instructed and encouraged public administration employees to carry their duties with creativity and efficiency. I reminded them of ethical obligations and precepts that guide public functions. I am sure we can count on them to honor the exemplary tradition of service of which we are proud. We hereby establish this national commission today to streamline the legal mechanisms established and to ward off and suppress corruption and the trafficking of influence. The factor that prompted me to establish this national commission was to underscore that corruption and its attendant problems are things that concern the whole country, as the effort of a particular government are not enough to prevent and overcome it. All the democratic forces of the country should be united in this endeavor. The sense of initiative that gathers us here today is to serve Chile and to anticipate any isolated case of corruption that may lead to a situation having a harmful effect on the country. We seek to quickly prevent the dissemination of an evil which seriously affects societies nowadays. The crisis of values affecting the modern world tends to weaken the moral roots that sustain political virtues. Societies with different traditions, large and small countries of the first and third world have been hit hard by this scourge. In many parts of the world, bribes, fraud, embezzlement of public funds, and sale of political influence have become a practice that enslaves the lives of people, destroys their institutions, weakens the state, and makes the nation vulnerable. Chile is part of the modern world and does not escape from this problem. Although our country is far from the described situation and corruption is not yet a generalized vice, we must be alert and act quickly to stop this evil at its roots. Our responsibility is to act now and quickly. To do that we have a tradition in our favor which must be strengthened. If Chileans are surprised by actions that violate ethical and legal principles, it is precisely because such actions are alien to our institutions and traditions. Historically, Chile has had honest officials and a dignified political class. Both in the past and now, the slogan of our democracy has been integrity. Acts of corruption draw attention because historically Chilean democracy has been honored by politicians and governments with a dedication to public service, and honest presidents. This tradition must emerge with greater strength in this new stage of our development. It is the duty of the entire Chilean society, not just of the government, to encourage public morals. The strengthening and preservation of moral values related to common well-being requires a great effort by all sectors of society, the family, the education system, the media, and enterprises. Extreme individualism that seeks material gain or power by any means should be considered morally unacceptable in order to unmask selfish interests disguised as higher interests and to question actions that seek to make illegal actions and corruption appear respectable. We must revive among Chilean people a natural reaction of indignation regarding different forms of power abuse. In particular, we need a joint reaction by the public and private sector. We want to make areas of contact between the two sectors sufficiently clear so that the legitimate and necessary cooperation does not become a false relationship. Irresponsible criticism of the state many times forgets that two parties are usually involved in acts of corruption: the public servant and the private enterprise or private individual who illegally tries to obtain an objective. The struggle against corruption mainly concerns the state, but also the private sector. Upholding a corrupt system that increases costs and distorts competition rules, in the medium and long term, affects private interests. The state and private sector's common task in this field is to find the best solutions to maximize the incentives provided by a modern society and also to protect Chile from the vices and threats of a modern society. All democratic forces of the country must become united in the common task of fighting corruption. It must be well known that corruption is democracy's enemy. It discredits the institutions before society, it discourages youths from choosing to serve in the public sector, it jeopardizes the inspiration and the innovative capacity of public servants, and it sows distrust in the international community regarding the integrity of procedures and laws. Undoubtedly, democracy alone does not guarantee morality in the public sector, but it makes it possible to report, it allows the establishment of supervision organizations, and it establishes impersonal judgment and appellation procedures and fair punishments. In sum: Our political system is not free of deficiencies, but it has the tools to correct these deficiencies. Our actions to fight corruption must always be inspired by the desire to safeguard democracy and its institutions. From the executive branch that is in charge of administrating the country, from the opposition exercising the necessary role of criticizing, from Congress fulfilling the role of legislating and supervising, and from any public and private level, our actions in this regard must contribute to safeguarding democracy. With this clear objective we can jointly and with determination progress, quietly and in an unselfish manner. As we undertake the task of assessing and improving the legal and moral duties of the public activity through this commission, we want the existing debate to result in concrete proposals so that the many suggestions may be used productively for the country. The great danger is that the fight against corruption may be nothing but rhetoric: Chilean's rightly want deeds. I want to address a special message to the public servants. Every upright and efficient government official ought not to be worried. Our final goal is to turn public service into a dignified work environment where initiative, the spirit of work, and the disinterested effort to achieve the common good are rewarded. We are not seeking to create a paralyzing and stifling control system. We are interested, rather, in clearly distinguishing illegitimate intentions from mere mistakes. We are pursuing the betterment of the state so as to be able to give citizens competent service rather than the construction of an ineffective and bureaucratic state. We do not want to duplicate the existing supervision institutions and mechanisms, but rather want to permanently activate them, improve them, and adjust them to a phenomenon that has aspects already known in the Chile of the past. On this occasion, in my capacity as president of Chile, I want to reiterate my determination to exercise my authority assuming my inalienable duty to govern the country and make decisions, ultimately, respecting my commitment to do so strictly observing the moral principles of our republican system. Endorsed by tradition, by the modernization of the system that guards legal and ethical duties in the public activity, and by our will to exercise authority and prevent acts of corruption, we will keep our Fatherland free and transparent and will guarantee a government at the service of society and not of itself.
