"I think the whole attempt to put a price tag on the RDP was a mistake. It is too big a programme for anybody to try and quantify," he says, arguing that the RDP should be treated in the same way as the Marshall Plan which Western countries put into place after the Second World War to help Western Europe recover from the war. He is adamant that determining the cost of the RDP does not allay investors' fears either, particularly when there is no consensus on the actual cost. Turok is confident that the programme can be financed through savings in both the national and provincial budgets. There are a number of items that have been included in the previous budgets which can be safely ignored and resources directed elsewhere, he argues. At national level, every single Government department is being scrutinised to identify possible areas where money can be saved to finance the RDP. One saving strategy will be to cut down the bureaucracy and increase efficiency. However, he goes on to say that watering down the bureaucracy will not amount to large-scale dismissals of people as there are already a lot of jobs left vacant by people who quit when South Africa's new era unfolded. "These jobs that I am talking about are in the budget so we do not need additional money to pay people who will fill them, we just need to advertise them, that's all," says Turok. "The problem is not as big as we thought. For instance, I was in a meeting with other government officials a few days ago and we identified R1 million [rands] within minutes," he says. Turok says there is money that could be found within government structures as well; an organisation like the Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] has a budget of R6 billion and that money will be going to the PWV government. It is estimated that the eventual budget for the PWV will about R12 billion. He says the TPA is likely to be charged with new responsibility so that it falls in line with the RDP. Turok says the R2.5 billion which President Nelson Mandela announced as initial funding for RDP came from savings. This long-time Pan-African economist is in favour of duties on luxury goods such as tobacco and liquor, arguing that the money coming from such tariffs could create many more jobs elsewhere. As for tax increases, Turok believes the forthcoming budget will not see any hikes in taxes. "The key lies with the expansion of the economy not in tax increases," he says. While many expect a public works programme to "kickstart" the economy, Turok says the main focus in the PWV will be nonstimulating productive capacity. Many of the projects will be based in and around the townships, and black business will play a key role in ensuring that this programme bears fruit. As for the role of multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Turok says the emphasis of the new government is not on borrowing but on investment. He says he is happy to see a new sense of realism among economic commentators in the country. Prior to the elections the mass media were beating the drums of borrowing, but now everybody is aware of the consequences of such a move. In the 1970s many African countries went on a borrowing spree and the debt-accumulated interest rates steadily climbed to the extent that by the mid-eighties Africa found itself in a deep debt crisis. Today Africa's debt is about a trillion rands. In some countries debt repayments swallow up to 40 percent of the total value of goods and services produced in any given year. However, this country cannot ignore these powerful financial institutions. South Africa could still benefit from the analytical studies that these organisations conduct from time to time, he says. "At times their recommendations make a lot of sense," says Turok, pointing to the fact that in one of its recent studies on this country, the World Bank suggests a redirection of resources to disadvantaged areas. The study, according to Turok, says that the re-allocation of resources from white to black areas will mean that no additional money will be needed to finance the reconstruction of the townships. On foreign money generally, he says: "We are quite happy with grants, but a bit cautious with loans."
