It would be possible to reduce technological dependence only if changes were made to the structure of production, which would require time and funds. Faced with the threat of fuel famine, the government has begun to involve itself in these matters on an empirical level, reacting with great delay to the consequences, but not to the reasons behind it. Whereas in Russia and Ukraine the coefficient of dependence of end product volume on external relations amounts to 0.31 and 0.41, respectively, in Moldova this figure is 0.995. That is, for Moldova a one-percent fluctuation in external relations yields practically the same degree of change in end product volume. In other words, Moldova's technological dependence amounts to almost 100 percent. Among the republics of the former USSR, Moldova has one of the highest shares of interrepublic imports in production (27 percent) and exports (24.1 percent) in output consumption. The index of production share in the heavy industry sectors in interrepublic imports in the republic is quite high (72.8 percent), and in exports it is the lowest (25.5 percent). The indices presented here are averaged. The technological dependence of certain plants of Moldova upon republics of the former USSR and other countries is greater still. We import all television set components from Russia, Belarus, Bulgaria, and Romania. Many enterprises, chiefly those that used to be under Union jurisdiction, have been obtaining absolutely every single component part from other republics. In international practice, the coefficient 0.25 is considered to be the critical level with respect to technological dependence. The following example shows what this means in practice. Germany will never permit Russian oil and gas to constitute more than 20-22 percent of its trade and energy balance. To make up for its energy shortages, it will acquire energy from the Near East and Africa, and will do so in such a manner that no single country supplies more than 20-22 percent of Germany's energy needs. The economy of Moldova today and in the near future will be unable to function normally without relations with the republics of the former USSR. This is objectively conditioned by Moldova's level of specialization and its role in the all-Union division of labor that used to exist. About 82 percent of Moldova's exports and more than 75 percent of its imports are attributable to the CIS countries. For trade turnover with the republics of the former USSR, exports and imports for 1992 amounted to: 55.7 percent with Russia; 22.1 percent with Ukraine; 10.1 percent with Belarus; 2.0 percent with Uzbekistan; and 2.8 percent with Turkmenistan. We see approximately the same picture being maintained for the first half of 1993. The greatest percentage of materials, raw materials, equipment, and other output imported into Moldova comes from Russia. Next in line are Ukraine and Belarus. It must be noted that we have already lost a portion of the CIS market. This is partly our own fault and partly due to the fact that Russia has introduced extremely high excise and other taxes on our traditional export products--champagne, wines, and cognacs. This has resulted in decreased export volumes of these products--by 20, 47, and 64 percent, respectively. The press service of the Ministry of Economics reports that over the first nine months of 1993, wine exports from Moldova to Russia decreased by 47.1 percent, cognac by 64 percent, and champagne by 20 percent. Moldova is losing one of its most important sales markets, its place being occupied by Germany, Poland, Italy, Finland, and other countries that are shipping production output at intentionally understated prices. Moldova may find itself squeezed out of this market precisely at a time when the Western market is not accessible to it. This has already significantly diminished our opportunities to acquire the resources and fuel so necessary for the normal functioning of the economy. It should also be noted that Russia has in no way always observed principles of fairness in its economic relations with republics of the former Union. However, neither has Moldova always adhered to civilized principles in its relations with Russia (we recall the recent incident involving clandestine reexport of oil). Therefore, the question of integrating Moldova into CIS structures and of utilizing the internal market of the Commonwealth acquires not just an economic aspect, but an ethical one as well. The technological dependence of Moldova is intensified by three circumstances: It is impossible in the present stage to resolve the republic's urgent problems without foreign assistance, which must amount to about $500 million. In the opinion of specialists, the state debt of Moldova may reach a level greater than $300 million by the end of this year. And it is felt this assumption is justified, insofar as the republic's production structure is reproducing a hard currency deficit since noncompetitive output is being produced. This debt will constitute a heavy burden on the shoulders of future generations. The press service of the Ministry of Economics asserts that the total amount of credits, without interest, will not exceed $131.3 million, but the balance of assets and liabilities with respect to Moldova's foreign debt is tentatively expected to amount to $191.3 million by the end of this year. At the same time, the leadership of Moldova's trade unions declares that we are already indebted to foreign banks in an amount on the order of $450 million. In addition, on the eve of the introduction of our national currency we will receive rehabilitation credit in the amount of about $300 million to provide support for the national currency rate and cover certain expenses for the purchase of energy, etc. Still one more aspect capable of intensifying Moldova's technological dependence is the incorrect selection of priorities. In the process of privatization, rural residents obtain advantages: In addition to national-wealth certificates, the property and land of kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and sections of processing enterprises are transferred to them for their free use and possession, as well as preferential-term credits, which are not always returned. With such a distortion, Moldova may become a purely agrarian country with a backward economy. Everyone understands the importance of agriculture and the need to provide it assistance. But if we do not become seriously involved in research-intensive, resource-economizing, and labor-conserving technology, the republic will never raise itself to the level of the developed countries. Here it is necessary to accomplish several tasks: First of all, determine priorities in the agro-industrial complex itself and provide it with state support; second, we must attract foreign capital in order to develop agriculture. An example of this is the establishment, based on the Orkhey Pig Farm, of a joint enterprise with the participation of Italian and American livestock output-processing firms. Third, we must effect state stimulation of the development of research-intensive production output on the islands of scientific and technological progress that still remain in Moldova. In the opinion of the trade union leadership, prices for sugar, sausage, and other food products will be two or three times the level of world prices in the very near future due to regular increases in energy costs. This may lead to a situation where agriculture finds itself bankrupt and Moldova gradually turns into a raw material appendage and a supplier of cheap manpower. In other words, we need to resolve a twofold problem: the attraction of foreign capital and entry into the world market, on the one hand, and the protection of our domestic market, on the other. A glut on the market takes place not because society does not need the production output in question, but because production costs are so high that there is no demand for the output. In Moldova, where price increases are significantly out pacing wage increases, such a situation is turning into the norm. Priority is given to intermediary trade activity when the majority of businessmen (about 80 percent) are engaged not in production, but in trade. This affects the state sector of the economy as well. Thus, of the proceeds from every bottle of wine, wine growers get only 7-10 percent, while trade gets 20 percent. One can borrow accordingly, but the debt has to be commensurate with the national income, using hard currency to produce competitive output. Simply put, one must not buy fish, but rather buy a fishing rod and learn how to catch fish. How can we reduce the technological dependence of Moldova and bring it in line with the normal, average level (there is no such thing as absolute independence from other countries or from the world market)? First of all, production relations must be strengthened. The most effective way to reduce the technological dependence of the republic is to effect integration into the CIS production structures through acquisition of a package of shares--of Russian oil-production, oil-refining, and other enterprises, let us say, which will gradually be transformed into transnational corporations. As far as the sale of wine base is concerned, first of all, the export of unprocessed product is a sign of backwardness of the republic; second, the wine base itself is many times less expensive than ready wine; third, in selling base wine to the CIS countries we provide work for the citizens of these states, while unemployment in our own republic is reaching threatening proportions. The penetration of Moldova into Western markets is a matter of no small importance. But by virtue of the existing division of labor, all positions are filled there. Competitive production output is therefore required, which we simply do not have. Thus in order to resolve the problems of technological dependence, we must reorient the economy of Moldova not only towards the markets of countries of the East, but on those of the West as well.
