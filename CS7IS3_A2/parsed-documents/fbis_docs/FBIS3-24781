After several weeks of intense discussions, the future national police issue was finally wrapped up today. Now the issue of national reconciliation will be on the negotiating table, and it is believed to be an equally tough assignment. Pedro Manuel, our special correspondent in the Zambian capital, provides the details: [Begin Pedro recording] This round of the Lusaka peace talks has taken yet another step forward. The negotiators have put an end to discussions concerning the future national police force issue. It is not known how responsibilities were apportioned, but [words indistinct] last weekend, according to rumors the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] had lowered its demands to participate with 40 percent of the Public Order Police force and 50 percent of the Rapid Intervention Police force. It has reduced its demands to a general [figure indistinct] percent. This report has not been confirmed by any source whatever so far. Another as yet unconfirmed report says that UNITA is to have 5,500 men in the future national police force. With the shelving of the future national police dossier, the negotiators began discussing national reconciliation this afternoon. Observers believe this will be one (?of the most difficult) hurdles to overcome at this round of talks. This part of the talks will discuss the possibility that UNITA will also participate in government. In other words, it will focus on what ministerial portfolios the government can award UNITA.

We are talking about its requests for the defense, information, foreign affairs, economy and finance, and territorial administration portfolios. As of this afternoon, the talks will focus on national reconciliation and the negotiators will also have to discuss the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission-2, Unavem-2. That is an issue that [words indistinct] meanwhile, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye is to go to Cote d'Ivoire on 2 February to attend the funeral ceremony honoring the late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. In Lusaka, the talks will continue under the chairmanship of Nigerian General Garuba [words indistinct] of Unavem. [end recording]
