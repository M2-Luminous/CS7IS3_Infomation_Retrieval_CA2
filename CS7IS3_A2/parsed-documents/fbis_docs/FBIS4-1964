Crowds gathered at the large Baboashan cemetery west of the capital to celebrate Qing Ming, the festival of the dead. Hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents went there to honour the memory of the deceased, in turn attracting hoards of flower and wreath sellers and funeral workers, who plied a lucrative trade. There were also a number of police, both uniformed and in plain clothes, armed with still and video cameras, and portable telephones. Access to Babaoshan, as with other major cemeteries in the capital, was banned to foreigners, who were challenged before they could even step foot inside the graveyard by hordes of police demanding to know who they were. Since the bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy movement on June 4, 1989, Qing Ming in Beijing has been a date dreaded by the authorities. Families have been forbidden from the simple act of of burning incense for their dead relatives because of official fears that the accompanying laments might degenerate into slogan chanting against the communist party and the government. This year, five years after students began their protest on April 15 for greater democracy and an end to corruption, the situation is even more tense. Since the start of the year, the authorities have been unsettled by increasingly acute social problems and an uncertain political situation as paramount leader Deng Xiaoping approaches his 90th birthday in August. The authorities have also been confronted by increasingly active dissent, prompting a new wave of repression. As evidence of their worries, Tiananmen Square has been ringed day and night by police since Monday. "I haven't been able to go out for Qing Ming because there are too many police," said the father of one 19-year-old youth killed in 1989, whose urn is in Wanan cemetery at the foot of the Fragrant Hills. "It's not that I'm afraid, just that I don't want trouble, and the mood is too tense," he said, adding that some parents of the Tiananmen dead still went to the graves. The families of those who died on June 4 are close to each other and take turns to go the cemeteries. Over Qing Ming, they meet and telephone each other. Ding Zilin, a philosophy teacher, goes often to Babaoshan and Wanan to tend the urns of the young people massacred by the army. She lost her only son, Jiang Jielian, a 17-year-old high school student. But her child does not rest in the cemetery. Ding, who recently signed an open letter to the authorities demanding democracy and the release of all imprisoned dissidents, keeps his ashes at home. The urn sits on a small altar near photos of the teenager. "For me, Qing Ming is everyday," she said.
