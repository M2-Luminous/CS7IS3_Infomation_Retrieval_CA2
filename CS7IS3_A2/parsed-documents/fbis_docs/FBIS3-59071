This is how the left is describing [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. They stress that, just a few months ago, he was affirming his agreement with the Democratic Alliance [AD], first and foremost by saying "no" to the League. According to [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) lower house floor leader] Massimo D'Alema, however, the agreement signed between the Pact and the League does not pose a problem for the progressive pole but for [Italian People's Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli: "The People's Party is the most to blame in its desire to guarantee the political autonomy of a Catholic-backed force." According to the PDS floor leader, the agreement causes confusion since it groups together "forces that came into the battle as opponents. Just a few months ago, Segni said he was an alternative to the League." Has [League Secretary] Bossi abandoned the idea of splitting Italy? "From Bossi's mouth we have heard every possible and imaginable statement, and the contrary." Nevertheless, continued D'Alema, out of the confusion people could, paradoxically, find clarity "when a power group is formed with the sole aim of repelling the progressive pole." Moreover, the agreement is "contradictory" with respect to the pope's letter on Catholic unity: "In the message there is a reference to the values of solidarity and national unity to which the political agreement of the Catholics can be attached which contradicts the agreement with the League." On this point, the PDS floor leader concluded that it was not important to know whether [Fininvest President] Berlusconi will directly enter the race because "Berlusconi has already entered the race, with his people and his TV channels." Claudio Petruccioli, of the PDS secretariat, was even more explicit in his comments: "To reach this agreement, both the League and Segni have had to `Berlusconize' themselves. Inevitably, the same would happen to anyone who was tempted to join the agreement." The Rete secretariat had fiery words for Segni who had finally revealed his hand "after deceiving the Italian people." This "self-styled" program agreed between the Pact and the League "is seeking to hide an electoral pact for the geographical separation of candidates -- the north for Bossi and the rest for Segni. We do not know whom to award the prize for the best transformist." According to The Rete: "Instead of CAF [previously pact uniting Craxi, Andreotti, and Forlani], for the time being we have the SeBo, and we are waiting agonizingly for the SeBoBo (Segni, Berlusconi, Bossi)." What about Mario Segni's former allies? Professor Pietro Scopola who sat beside Segni on the "referendum committee" and who has now chosen the AD, does not appear surprised: "Yes, I was expecting it. Besides, Segni had no choice: Either make an alliance with the League or go to the electorate on his own, which would be equivalent to committing political suicide. Of course, it is a move that runs completely counter to what he said on 10 October 1992, when he stated in no uncertain terms that he was an alternative to Bossi. The change, however, makes things clear -- this is the birth of a less divided right." For [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco, too, "it was predictable: The right is in earnest, the moderates are in earnest, the conservatives are in earnest. The side that risks taking this situation too lightly is the left, where there is the risk that sectarianism, divisions, and differences will prevail." The Socialist secretary concluded: "A formation headed by the Segni-Bossi pairing is worrying. A formation headed by [Rete leader] Orlando's fundamentalism is not of interest."
