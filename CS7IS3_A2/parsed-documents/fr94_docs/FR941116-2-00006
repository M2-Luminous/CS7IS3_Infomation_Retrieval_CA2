FR941116-2-00006 FR941116-2-00002 Develop S&Gs to protect the integrity of the natural processes and function inherent in old-growth associated stands and other unique habitat areas. Develop S&Gs to ensure vegetation management proposals would be designed to maintain components of late-successional conditions (i.e., snags, downed large woody material, large trees, canopy gaps, multiple tree layers, and diverse species composition). Silvicultural tools available to achieve these desired conditions include: prescribed fire and selection timber harvest methods. Stand density management options would be limited to the application of uneven-aged management principles (single tree and group selection), sanitation, intermediate and salvage prescriptions. Develop S&Gs for vegetation management proposals designed to improve the health and vigor of sapling to pole-sized stands, to eliminate the ``regimented spacing'' concerns and ensure compatibility with the primary objectives of the HGNRA Act. Develop S&Gs for vegetation management proposals to ensure consistency with PACFISH interim strategies for managing anadromous fisheries (anticipated to be finalized during this planning process) and the Wallowa County Salmon Recovery Plan. Develop S&Gs that establish an acceptable range of variability for insects and diseases to ensure sustainability of ecosystem process, function, and health. Refine S&Gs to define compatibility for the biological and social thresholds of domestic livestock and wild ungulate grazing. Develop S&Gs that allow for adjustment of domestic grazing allotment boundaries to incorporate and/or delete current vacant allotments. Develop S&Gs for managing plant resources of cultural significance to the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho within the overall objectives of ecosystem management. Biologically Unique Habitat Goals Within the HCNRA lands ensure the preservation of rare and endemic plant species, rare combinations of aquatic, terrestrial, and atmospheric habitats, and the rare combinations of outstanding and diverse ecosystems and parts of ecosystems. Protect and manage habitat for the perpetuation and recovery of plants which are listed as threatened or endangered, and prevent sensitive species from reaching a point where they will become listed. Objectives Develop an action plan for threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant species. Develop an action plan to identify biologically unique species and habitat. Standards and Guidelines Develop S&Gs to provide for the identification and protection of biologically unique species and habitat. Develop and/or refine S&Gs for threatened and endangered species to meet recovery plan objectives and assist in recovering classified species to a point where they can be delisted. Develop S&Gs for sensitive, rare and endemic species to meet conservation agreement goals and objectives of the HCNRA Act and/or prevent sensitive species from reaching a point where they will become listed. Soil Goals Manage soil resources in a manner compatible with the conservation, preservation, and protection of those values for which the HCNRA was established. Objectives No proposed changes. Standards and Guidelines Modify S&Gs to establish allowable detrimental soil disturbance (now at 20%) and distribution for recreation and vegetation management activities to ensure accordance with HCNRA goals and objectives. Develop S&Gs for the long-term management of down woody material to meet soil productivity objectives. Air Goals Preserve the atmospheric habitats in a manner compatible with the preservation of rare combinations of outstanding and diverse ecosystems and parts of ecosystems associated within the HCNRA. Manage the Hells Canyon Wilderness Class I airshed to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. Objectives No proposed changes. Standards and Guidelines Establish as S&Gs, limits of acceptable change for the following Hells Canyon Wilderness air quality related values (AQRV): scenery, water quality, fauna, flora, and heritage resources.
