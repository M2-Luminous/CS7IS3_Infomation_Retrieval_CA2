FBIS4-27359 "dreas105__a94040" FBIS-EAS-94-105-A Daily Report 23 May 1994 ANNEX Japan CATV Firms, Common Carriers To Link Systems CATV Firms, Common Carriers To Link Systems 942A0266A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 23 May 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0266A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The cable television (CATV) industry and new common carriers will collaborate in experiments to integrate broadcasting and communications, an effort which is considered to be a precursor to multimedia. Twenty-two firms, including CATV firms such as Tokyu Cable Television and new common carriers such as DDI [Dainidenden], electrical equipment makers, and trading companies will organize a consortium this week and conduct experiments over a two-year period to identify potential problems associated with commercialization of the concept. This will be the first case in which CATV and new common carriers interlink to form a combined communication network. Intracity telephone networks are currently controlled by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), but if the new common carriers collaborate with CATV firms with circuits reaching individual households and establish nationwide networks, there is the potential to build a system that rivals that of NTT. It appears that the broadcasting and communications industries are about to reorganize based on deregulation. Aside from major CATV firms and the new common carriers, firms participating in the experiments will be Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), manufacturers such as NEC and trading companies such as Mitsui & Co. and Secom, which has an interest in remote medical services via CATV. The Cable Television Conference, a CATV industry organization, established a "full-service network committee" as part of the conference on the 24th. The committee will serve as the administrative arm of the conference to manage the two-year experiment and will solicit participation by CATV firms on a nationwide basis. The experiments will consider links between CATV networks and communications networks of new common carriers. The results will be used in the development of combined networks for use by fixed telephone instruments, personal handyphone systems (PHS), personal computer communications, and television shopping. Even the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] is promoting the concept. Next-generation CATV that integrates broadcasting and communications is considered one of the infrastructures envisioning implementation of multimedia, and there are scattered moves to commercialize the concept. A CATV firm in Nagano Prefecture is experimenting with telephone services via CATV and in Kansai the MOPT-sponsored conference is planning to start a systems integration experiment using optical fiber networks beginning this summer.
