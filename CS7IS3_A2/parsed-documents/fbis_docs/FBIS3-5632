They said the proposed legislation is expected to be presented to a meeting of the ruling coalition's policy-making officials Thursday and is likely to be approved by the cabinet on March 18 for presentation to the current Diet. The committee is expected to promote the easing of existing economic restrictions, discuss the opening of government-held information to the public and make recommendations to the prime minister on the basis of its surveys and discussions. Under the proposed bill, the five-member committee with a three-year tenure will be created in the prime minister's office and will function like other advisory councils appointed by the prime minister, the officials said. One or two of the members will serve full-time on the committee. Some lawmakers have expressed doubts about the proposal to establish a committee in the government to monitor the government's economic deregulation.
