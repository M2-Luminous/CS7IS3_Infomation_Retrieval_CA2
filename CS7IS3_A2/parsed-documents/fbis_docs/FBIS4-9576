FBIS4-9576 "dreeu082_i_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serbian Withdrawal From Gorazde Confirmed Serbian Withdrawal From Gorazde Confirmed LD2604223794 Belgrade TANJUG in English 2229 GMT 26 Apr 94 LD2604223794 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- Representatives of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said on Tuesday evening that Bosnian Serb forces have withdrawn their heavy weapons to outside a 20km zone from the inner core of Gorazde, as provided for under the NATO ultimatum, and that there is no longer a threat of air strikes against their positions. Gorazde is a Moslem enclave in the east of civil war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina where Serb and Moslem forces clashed heavily for almost a month. The NATO Council threatened it would bomb Bosnian Serb positions unless they withdrew their heavy weapons to a distance of 20km from the center of Gorazde by 00:01 GMT Wednesday. The UNPROFOR representatives in Sarajevo declined to specify if all Serb heavy weapons had been withdrawn from the area, but said that there was no longer a threat of air strikes. Confirming this, U.N. Spokesman Eric Chaperon said that the U.N. force commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose was going to bed. Chaperon also said that Moslems had fired at an UNPROFOR patrol which was checking the Serb positions in the vicinity of Gorazde. There were no casualties, he said, but a protest has been sent to the Moslem authorities.
