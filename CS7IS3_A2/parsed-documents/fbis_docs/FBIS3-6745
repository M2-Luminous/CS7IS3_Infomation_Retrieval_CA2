Published in English by the Foreign Language Publishing House, the book consists of six chapters -- "Institutional Device Used To Infringe Upon Democracy and Human Rights", "Debris of Democracy", "Barren Land Devoid of Human Rights", "`Exhibition Hall' of Intelligence, Surveillance and Stratagem", "The Acme of Infringement on Democratic Human Rights" and "The United States and the Absence of Democracy and Human Rights in South Korea". In the preface, the book says that the problem of human rights in South Korea is of great concern for the international community and deeply worries a great number of people who love justice and truth. The seriousness of the human rights issue in South Korea, the book says, is clearly reflected in the "Report on Human Rights in South Korea" submitted by the "International League for Human Rights" and the "International Group on the Law of Human Rights" (Washington, February 1985), the report "Infringement of Human Rights in South Korea" submitted by "Amnesty International" (London, 1986), and the "White Paper on Human Rights in South Korea" submitted by the "International Association of Democratic Lawyers" (Paris, June 1991). The book points out that all kinds of evil laws in force in South Korea number more than 200. It also fully exposes the craftiness, viciousness and anti-democratic, anti-national and anti-reunification nature of the "Law on Supervision for Public Peace", "Law on National Security Planning Board" and "Law on Assembly and Demonstration" including the most fascist and brutal "National Security Law". The book cites facts to prove that South Korea which has been a target of the U.S. colonial rule for nearly half a century has become a barren land of human rights and an acme of human rights violation. The institute lays bare the human rights situation of South Korea in recent years, denouncing the moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean authorities in deceiving and mocking world public opinion as criminal acts going against the flow of the present times and as challenges to world conscience.
