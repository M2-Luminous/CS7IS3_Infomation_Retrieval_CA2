North Korea did not allow the inspection team to immediately confirm whether some seals, which are the core target of the current inspection, were broken or not. Thus, North Korea restricted the team's inspection activities. The IAEA regards this as an act of breaking the agreement. Accordingly, the IAEA inspection team was going to leave earlier than the originally scheduled period of two weeks. However, the inspection team abandoned the early departure idea in consideration of China's reaction. The IAEA inspection team is going to leave Pyongyang around 15 March after completing its inspection activities.
