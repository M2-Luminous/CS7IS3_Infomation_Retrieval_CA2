FBIS4-52273 "dreas089_d_94030" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 South Korea Ministry of Trade Announces Eased Export Rules Ministry of Trade Announces Eased Export Rules SK0905125794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0804 GMT 9 May 94 SK0905125794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- Short-term credits for exports worth up to 20,000 U.S. dollars will no longer be subject to government approval, regardless of whether they are made on a documents-against-acceptance or payment basis, starting next year. Under the eased trade rules announced by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Monday, exports and imports of goods worth up to 10,000 dollars -- instead of the current 5,000 dollars -- will be exempt from after-export and -import controls on traders regarding whether they meet the conditions set down in the export and import permits. At present, only letter of credit-based exports of goods worth up to 20,000 dollars can be made without the government's approval. Documents-against-acceptance and payment bills are means of receiving payment for export shipments: While the former requires the delivery of shipping documents to importers when they accept the bill of exchange, the latter demands the handing over of documents in exchange for payment of the bill. The new rules also provide that exports on a sight-bill basis, that is, a bill of exchange payable when presented to the importer, shall be made without a government permit, regardless of the exports' amount. Exporters of industrial plants and machinery will be allowed to acquire necessary materials and equipment locally in the importing countries and be exempt from the requirement to contribute to the export promotion fund. Moreover, imports of research and development equipment in relatively small demand can be made from any market. At present, importation of all research and development equipment from certain markets is prohibited.
