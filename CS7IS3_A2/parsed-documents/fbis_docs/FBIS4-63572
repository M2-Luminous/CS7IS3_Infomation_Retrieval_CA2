The Russian foreign minister said that British Prime Minister John Major's meeting with Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin was still quite a recent event, while a new and important event for mutual relations was now on the agenda: the first state visit to Russia by Queen Elizabeth II. Kozyrev mentioned the broad list of issues discussed at the current talks, in particular, preparations for the political meeting of leaders of the G-7 and Russia in Naples, the working out of an agreement on partnership between Russia and the European Union, the prospects of cooperation between Russia and NATO, the Bosnian crisis, and Moscow's relations with the Baltic countries. Significant attention, in his words, was paid to finding ways to step up the activities of the CSCE during preparations for the summit meeting of the member countries of this international forum. There was also a productive exchange of views on ways of developing regional cooperation, including cooperation with Murmansk. The minister said that "Britain was a partner with whom Russia was holding a stable, open and friendly dialogue." The head of the British Foreign Office noted that his country was playing pioneering role in ties with Murmansk. In Hurd's words, this role was clearly manifested in the past wars, and it continues now, as demonstrated by the present visit, the first by a British foreign secretary to the polar regions of Russia. "Agreement has been reached on all the issues we discussed," the head of the Foreign Office said. "There are three major organizations in Europe - NATO, the EC, and the CSCE. In the early stages of their existence they were dealing with the problem of overcoming confrontation, but now a new stage has begun, and work is under way with the aim of reaching accord. Russia is playing a key role in this process. I hope a cooperation agreement between Russia and the European Union will be signed as early as June. We in Britain at any rate will be striving towards this. We also expect Russia to reach accord with NATO on the basis of the Partnership for Peace program, and we expect the CSCE to become a more effective tool in overcoming international crises."
