FBIS4-64874 "drweu090aa_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-090 Daily Report 6 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Japan's Hata Holds News Conference in Brussels Japan's Hata Holds News Conference in Brussels OW0705023794 Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese 1402 GMT 6 May 94 OW0705023794 Tokyo NHK General Television Network Japanese BFN [News conference including statement by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata with foreign and domestic correspondents at the Hilton Hotel in Brussels; questioners identified by caption -- live] [Text] I have toured Italy, France, and Germany, and have met with top leaders of these countries. Just now I had the honor of being received by King Albert. This evening I am due to meet with EC Chairman Delors and Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene. Never in history has there been a time when cooperation between Europe, Japan, and the United States is as necessary as it is now for securing peace and prosperity in the world. Further strengthening of ties between Japan and Europe is an important diplomatic task of the new administration. Seeing as Japan wants to make international contributions, there are now many developments taking place in Middle East, Africa, and East Europe. I have visited this place to talk with European people, who have deep ties and long experiences with these regions. In Italy, the first country I visited, I was able to exchange views on cooperation with respect to the Naples summit. While I myself face the task of reforming politics in Japan, in Italy major reform is currently underway, reform which can be called a quiet revolution. I had the opportunity to meet Prime Minister Ciampi, who initiated political reform, and [Belurusconi], who won in the recent general election. I also had the chance to talk about our experience as well as the tasks awaiting both countries. In France and Germany, which are the two major bulwarks pushing for integration of Europe I was able to meet with President Mitterand, Prime Minister Balladur, and Chancellor Kohl. I greatly benefited from an exchange of views with them on pending international issues from the perspective of thinking about the future policies of our country and of affirming the relationship between Japan and Europe in the international community. We agreed that our nations should make efforts to further strengthen the world's free trade structure. We also agreed that indeed it would be important, with respect to the Naples summit, for our countries to announce their common resolve on tackling unemployment. I would like to express my welcome to EC Chairman Delors, who is an active promoter for establishing the European Union [EU], on the realization of a powerful and stable EU as a step forward toward raising the status of Europe in the international community. On the other hand, I would like to point out that it is important that the EU build an open and constructive atmosphere for Japan and other countries outside the Union as well. Myself, Foreign Minister Kakizawa, and several others for the past 16 to 17 years have promoted relations between Japan and Europe as well as between the Japanese and European parliaments. I would like to exchange views with Delors on what I have learned during these years. Meanwhile, I am looking forward to the meeting with Prime Minister Dehaene, as I hope to hear from him how the Belgian Government intends to seek and pursue further development of the country while pushing for European integration. Besides, Belgium plans to send an economic mission led by Prince Philip to Japan. I hope new relations will develop out of this. In the meetings with the leaders I met on this tour, I explained Japan's political, economic, and administrative reform programs, which can be called historical. Particularly in the area of economics, I explained that domestic demand-oriented economic operations would be continued pursuant to the guidelines on reform of external economy announced on 29 March by the Hosokawa government. Actions to enforce deregulation will also continue, I explained. There can never be any agreements made between Japan and the United States at the expense of the EU. I informed them clearly that all agreements would benefit the EU and other nations. There are now moves in many European countries to invigorate economic relations with Japan. Our country welcomes such moves, and would like to provide cooperation where possible. I think we should seek to find a point of equilibrium in economic relations between Japan and Europe--not at a reduced but on an expanded scale. By coincidence, the opening ceremonies for the tunnel underneath the British Channel were held today. This is a historic and symbolic event which suggests strengthening European ties. For my part, I am hoping to see strengthened relations between a stable and prosperous Europe and Japan, and am sure my visit to Europe will be a new step towards that. In my meeting today with King Albert, he expressed a strong hope to further strengthen and develop relations between Europe and Japan, as well as between Belgium and Japan. I was deeply impressed by his words. Finally, I would like to note that I am very grateful for the warm welcome given by the people of this country, the royal court, and the government, even though my visit was short. I would like to conclude my statement. [Terasaki] I am Terasaki from NHK. Please excuse me for asking a question not directly linked to your Europe trip. Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano has recently stated he believes the so-called Nanjing massacre is a fabrication, and this aroused considerable controversy not only in Japan, but also overseas, even in Europe. In a news conference held later, Justice Minister Nagano stated he wants to completely recant the remark and adhere to the prime minister's decision whether or not he has to resign. I would like to ask, what is your plan to settle the issue. Also, please let me ask your comment about your responsibility for appointing such a justice minister. [Hata] Contrary to the remark by Justice Minister Nagano, both the previous administration and I have been acknowledging Japan's invasion and colonial rule during the war. During that period, Japan inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of many countries. To obtain the international community's understanding of Japan's future posture, Japan must frankly express its regret over the wrongdoing and apologize for it. Japan must not forget its past experience and must not repeat the tragedy, and on that ground we appealed to the international community our intention to contribute to peacemaking efforts. The international community has expressed its understanding of our resolve, and leaders of some nations told us that, apart from past incidents, they welcome Japan's present stance. They said they want future-oriented cooperation with Japan. Justice Minister Nagano's remarks were not appropriate. Frankly speaking, I feel his remark was regrettable. Immediately after I heard about his remark, I called Justice Minister Nagano in Tokyo to discuss the issue. I told him I deeply regretted that his remark spoiled our efforts up to now, and questioned why he made it. In reply to my warning, he acknowledged the inappropriateness of the remark and expressed his intention to withdraw it. He also said he felt really sorry about hurting the sentiments of many people. I appointed Nagano as justice minister because, through long fellowship with him, I knew him as a person with a noble mind and well-balanced political stand. I am not well informed about the actual circumstances surrounding the remark, but I would like to attach importance to his apology. Taking this opportunity, my cabinet will take the initiative in obtaining an understanding from the international community. As I noted earlier, my trip to meet with European leaders was made to strengthen cooperative ties with the people of Europe in pursuing genuine world peace. In this sense, we would like to prove our resolve with our actions, seeking support from the international community. [Charles (Bortzman), in English with superimposed translation in Japanese] I am Charles (Bortzman) from the WALL STREET JOURNAL. The European Union is still anxious about trade deficits with Japan. What is your tangible plan for reducing Japan's trade surplus? What is EC President Jacques Delors supposed to do about removing trade barriers with Japan? [Hata] As regards your first question, Japan will continue to take macro and micro measures to deal with its current account surplus. The trade balance is calculated as a result of various business activities under a free economy; however, if one nation has a huge current account surplus, it would be problematic. The problem results from many nations. To cut Japan's current account surplus, the government will relax or abolish the bureaucratic regulations and take steps to make it easier for foreign firms to gain access to the Japanese market. This was incorporated in my 29 March statement, and the government has already announced its decision to clarify its future direction of economic policies before the end of June. Under such circumstances, I intend to work to significantly cut Japan's current account surplus. Regarding desirable action by the EU or the EC, many European nations are trying to promote exports to Japan by creating a better understanding of the needs of the Japanese consumer market. Japan would like to offer support for market access of products with adequate competitive power, and I hope the EU continue its efforts in offering good export products. [Kurimoto] I am Kurimoto from KYODO. I am very sorry to trouble you, but I would like to return to Nagano's remarks. You stated earlier you would like to accept his withdrawal of the remarks and his serious apology, and would like to show Japan's stance through future actions. Do you mean that, as far as you are concerned, you have no intention to ask the justice minister to resign? [Hata] At the present stage, I would like to refrain from making any comment on his resignation. As I said earlier, Nagano is a man who sees things fairly, and he has candidly apologized for making such remarks. I intend to seek an understanding of concerned nations. My government is now explaining our true intent to the concerned nations through their embassies in Tokyo. Through these efforts, I would like the concerned nations to understand Justice Minister Nagano as well as my cabinet. In any case, we should not talk insincerely. It is important for Japan to work to build peace while engaging in soul-searching on its war of aggression. Presently this is our stance. [Tom Berkeley, in English with superimposed translation in Japanese] I am Tom Berkeley from HERALD TRIBUNE. You mentioned Japan will take measures to open its markets to the United States and the EU. Do You intend to solve the issue of U.S. and European trade deficits with Japan through the fiscal 1994 budget and market-opening measures to be issued in June? If you do not have such an intention, why is it? [Hata] I have received some requests from the EU. I intend to reflect the requests in a package of external economic measures to be mapped out in June. You mentioned the solution of the trade issue among the three parties. However, Japan and the United States have been discussing the issue for a long time, and we are now trying to pave a way for solving the issue. I do not mean we are not taking these matters you mentioned into consideration, but presently we intend to discuss it between Japan and the United States. Any agreement reached between Japan and the United States should be applied to the EU and other nations. We intend to do so based on the principle of the most-favored-nation treatment. However, various measures which we are now taking have reflected EU opinions. Moreover, we are now proceeding with a committee on administrative reform, and representatives from the European private sector will participate in the committee. [Unidentified AP DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE correspondent, in English with superimposed translation in Japanese] I am with the AP DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE. Earlier this week, central banks from Europe jointly intervened in the foreign exchange market to prevent a further decline of the dollar. In connection with this, are you satisfied with the current level of the yen against the dollar? What will you do if the dollar drops to below 100 yen? [Hata] I believe that the exchange rate must reflect economic fundamentals. While mid- and long-term prime rates are increasing in the United States, the recent appreciation of the yen and the mark is too rapid and drastic. It appears the market is excessively dominated with a speculative atmosphere. Japan intends to deal with the recent fluctuation in currency markets while discussing the currency authorities of other industrialized nations. With regard to the strength of specific currencies, I would like to avoid comment since that may stimulate speculative moves in the market. However, I think drastic moves in the foreign exchange market are unfavorable. [Kojima] I am Kojima from SANKEI SHIMBUN. My question is about Japan's desire to obtain a permanent seat in the UN Security Council [UNSC]. In the latest meeting with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, you reportedly said Japan would offer all possible contributions if it is given a permanent UNSC seat. I would like to ask what all possible contributions means exactly. In this connection, I would also like to ask if Japan, as a nation seeking a permanent UNSC seat, is ready to fully participate in UN peacekeeping activities and possible sanctions against North Korea. [Hata] Japan has already played a role that is consistent for a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Japan is offering wide-ranging contributions to international peace efforts. For example, Japan is the second largest contributor to the United Nations, following the United States. To settle regional disputes, Japan took the initiative in peacemaking and reconstruction efforts in Cambodia. Regarding disarmament and arms nonproliferation efforts, Japan is advocating an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and an establishment of a registration system to control ordinary weapons. The primary concern of economic assistance to Russia and developing nations is to stabilize the social situation of these nations. Japan intends to positively contribute to UN peace activities, as it has already offered manpower to UN operations in Cambodia and Mozambique. Many nations have clarified their support for Japan's permanent membership in the UNSC, and I believe this is because they highly rate Japan's efforts so far. Therefore, it is important for Japan to do everything it can, stressing its strong points. Even in UN peace activities, Japan can contribute in various ways, and in some fields Japan may be the only nation which can help the United Nations. We would like to positively support the United Nations. The issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons has been taken up for discussion during a series of meetings with European leaders and I keenly feel that those leaders are concerned about the issue. The UNSC has issued a presidential statement representing the international community's demand for an early settlement of the issue, and I positively support the UNSC message. North Korea should work to dispel suspicions about its development of nuclear weapons to win an international understanding. North Korea needs to take such an action to develop itself. The international community is patiently seeking a consultative settlement of the problem, and I hope the North Korean people understand that. I want to take every opportunity to obtain North Korea's understanding of that. [Unidentified Belgian correspondent, in English with superimposed translation in Japanese] I am with a Belgian newspaper, and want to discuss the nuclear issue. Japan itself has a large amount of plutonium, for commercial use of course. In a sense, it can be said Japan's plutonium program is as important as the North Korean nuclear issue. Do you have any plans to voluntarily abolish your nation's own plutonium recycling program before 1995 when the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] expires? [Hata] To state a conclusion first, there is no possibility of Japan producing nuclear weapons or being armed with nuclear weapons. Japan underwent hardships after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In its Constitution, Japan's Article Nine renounces war. In addition, Japan has the three principle of not producing, possessing, or bringing in nuclear weapons. But since there is a nation [DPRK] that has nuclear weapons, I intend, while firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, to ensure Japan's peace using the potential U.S. deterrent force, including nuclear weapons. As for our plutonium program, in the true sense of the term it is for peaceful purposes. As you know, Japan is short of natural resources while needing to secure stable supplies of energy. It is highly important for the international community to make effective use of natural resources, or in view of protecting the environment we are required to use cleaner energy. This is what we are required to do. In this sense Japan, while making use of plutonium, will proceed with its plutonium recycling program for peaceful purposes. Although there is suspicion about Japan's nuclear program, Japan has extensively concluded safeguard agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time, Japan has committed itself to support an indefinite extension of the NPT. In this sense, Japan has been studying how to use nuclear material for peaceful purposes. However, the openness of such a study should be increased as much as possible. [Yasui] I am Yasui with NHK. My question is about permanent membership in the UNSC. The UN Charter says the Military Staff Committee will be held among the permanent members of the UNSC in order to take strategic leadership when UN forces are organized. Does this run counter to Japan's Constitution? In addition, although it has been reported that Japan and Germany have agreed to keep in constant contact with each other in their bids to win permanent membership, are you planning to promote a Japan-Germany link in dealing with this issue? Please answer these two questions. [Hata] Yes, the UN Charter calls for the opening of the committee. The committee session is an opportunity to discuss how they should respond to various local strife, and is not to endorse the permanent members' participation in military action. As UN Secretary General Ghali has said, the permanent members are not bound to military action. He has said the positions of the permanent members are the same as other UN member nations. It is important for the permanent members to take the initiative in carrying out what they can do, such as peacekeeping operations. Regarding my talks with Kinkel, I have agreed that Japan and Germany will exchange various information in a bid to win permanent membership. In view of Germany's position in Europe and Japan's in Asia, there are some differences in their respective positions. It is important to exchange information. [Unidentified FINANCIAL NEWS correspondent, in English with superimposed translation in Japanese] Prime Minister, I am with FINANCIAL NEWS. Japan plans to carry out economic reform along with other G-7 member nations. For example, Japan claims it intends to continue carrying out income tax reductions even after fiscal 1994. I wonder if the opposition will accept such a plan, and I want to ask how the government will deal with the issue of a consumption tax increase designed to offset tax reductions. [Hata] On this matter, the government will carry out Y [yen] 6 billion-worth of income tax reductions. But if we limit this tax reduction only to 1994, we will have to increase taxes next year. In that case, Japan's economy will be greatly affected. Japan is about to enter an era of an aging society. Administrative and financial reform designed to improve such policies as pension and welfare, as well as the correction of unfair tax systems, are not enough to secure financial resources in preparation for the future. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain financial resources from direct taxes upon workers of the younger generation. In view of this, we have to balance further tax reductions with the securing of direct taxes and consumption taxes in preparation for the impending era. There is no doubt that among the opposition parties there are voices opposing such a plan. But within the largest opposition party, some members have shown an understanding of the plan, and the parties which have recently left the coalition have agreed to exchange frank discussions on this issue. There is also the fact that a resolution has been recently adopted unanimously in the Diet on carrying out drastic reform of taxes--we call them direct taxes in Japan. No, the tax system. In view of this, I am of the opinion it is possible to win national consensus. [Yamada] I am Yamada from TV Asahi. The existing coalition is a minority government. Parties like Sakigake [Harbinger] are cautious about Japan becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Meanwhile, in interviews given by newly appointed cabinet members, we have heard them make statements critical of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. It appears the cabinet will have a hard time in the Diet. Meanwhile, a prevailing view about the Hata government is that it will be hawkish. How do you intend to deal with this? [Hata] First, is this prime minister a hawk or dove? I would like you to look at my past 25 years of political life. People in Japan like to use the expression hawk or dove. But this indeed is nonsense. What is at issue is what to do with Japan, what we should do to bring peace to the world, and what Japan should do to enjoy the world's peace. The tendency to group people into hawks and doves is nonsense. I served as foreign minister for eight months with the Hosokawa government, and worked in that government along with people from the SDPJ. It is good the SDPJ people have come to openly present their positions on security issues and the tax system. A new pattern of governance is taking place. We have come to speak more about the opening of information to the public, consumer interests, and giving more weight to the lives of the people. We also speak about or act against environmental issues more than before. This has been possible because people of different parties can work together. We have come to appreciate varying views of the people as a result. of this. I am aware there have been misunderstandings and differences of opinion between the SDPJ and other coalition groups, but I have emphasized to the chairman and the general secretary of the party that we should make the most of this experience of having worked together. I have told them that our door remains open, and that we sincerely want them to return to the government and work together. If we are serious about beginning a new governance in Japan, it will be necessary that we keep the position of leaving the door open for the party to come back to work together. You referred to the issue of Japan becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council. We are not seeking to become a permanent member of the council in order to do extraordinary things. The United Nations began with 51 countries, and has now grown to an organization of 184 nations. In the present post-Cold War era, there are many things the United Nations needs to do. Japan's role in Cambodia was different from the one played in other countries, and our efforts there were successful because we were able to convince the Cambodians that it is good to have peace and to hold elections. Japan has enjoyed peace for the past 50 years, and has been able to accumulate all kinds of knowledge. Japan is now being asked by the world to do its part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and to make the most of what it has learned. That is how I see the matter. I believe Takemura and others are not objecting to this view. [coverage of the program breaks off although the news conference continues]
