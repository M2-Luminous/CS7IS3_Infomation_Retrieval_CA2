FR940504-1-00065 FR940504-1-00018 Response: The Department believes that poorly designed and administered CV studies can pose reliability problems. Therefore, the Department believes that standards for the use of CV should be included in the rule itself to improve the reliability of CV studies that receive a rebuttable presumption. However, the Department recognizes that CV is an evolving methodology. Therefore, the Department believes that only those standards that are unlikely to change over time should be included in the rule and that trustee officials should be given some flexibility in determining how to meet these standards. Further, as discussed above, the Department intends to work with NOAA and other interested agencies to develop a technical information document on the use of CV. This document will provide additional technical information on possible means of satisfying any standards contained in the rule as well as other issues involved in conducting CV studies. Comment: A few commenters responded to the Department's request for comments on how to ensure that CV studies are cost-effective and can be performed at a reasonable cost. Some commenters thought that the real issue was how to reduce the cost of performing a CV study, rather than how to ensure cost-effectiveness and reasonable cost. These commenters suggested that the Department fund reference CV studies. Response: As discussed above, the Department intends to work with NOAA and other interested agencies to develop a technical information document on use of CV. This document should assist trustee officials in conducting reliable studies at a reasonable cost. The Department may consider the feasibility and utility of funding reference CV studies in the future. However, consideration of such studies is beyond the scope of this rulemaking, which is designed solely to comply with Ohio versus Interior . Comment: Some commenters stated that trustee officials should provide PRPs with the opportunity to conduct an independent review of all data collected in a CV survey. Response: The Department agrees that PRPs should have access to all assessment data collected by trustee officials, including any data collected in a CV study. Section 11.90 of the Department's existing type B rule provides that at the conclusion of an assessment, trustee officials must prepare a Report of Assessment that is presented to the PRP. The Report of Assessment includes all test results. NOAA's proposed rule provides that the report of a CV study must include a discussion of the relevant factors identified in the standards pertaining to survey instrument design and development, survey administration, and nature of results, as well as a copy of the survey instrument. If the same standards were added to the Department's type B rule, the report of the CV study would be included in the Report of Assessment. Also, under ยง11.91(c) of the Department's existing type B rule, everything in the administrative record of the assessment, including all data collected in a CV survey, would be available for review during the judicial discovery process. Comment: A few commenters noted that WTA, not WTP, is the correct theoretical measure of lost resource values. These commenters acknowledged that there are practical problems with using CV studies to calculate WTA. However, the commenters stated that the Department should allow trustee officials to use methods that translate WTP into WTA and provided copies of articles describing such methods. Response: As was stated in the August 1, 1986, preamble to the original rule: The Department maintains that willingness to pay and willingness to accept are both theoretically valid criteria for estimating damages to nonmarketed natural resources. In addition, the Department continues to maintain that willingness to accept may be the criterion most germane to natural resource damages, since the public has the property right to the injured natural resource. However, the Department also agrees with many of the comments that recognize that the application of the willingness-to-accept criterion can lead to more technical difficulties and uncertainties than the willingness-to-pay criterion. 51 FR 27721. The Department believes it is inadvisable at this time to revise the rule to allow for use of methods to translate WTP into WTA. Comment: A few commenters thought that if the Department allows assessment of lost nonuse values, it should not allow assessment of so-called intrinsic values that purport to represent the value of the resource in and of itself rather than the value of the resource to humans. Response: Compensable value includes only those values lost by the public. Therefore, only human values should be considered in a CV study of lost nonuse values. Comment: Some commenters stated that if the Department allows assessment of lost nonuse values, it should also require trustee officials to assess the benefits to society of the activity giving rise to the release or discharge and claim only the net loss. Response: When Congress passed CERCLA and CWA it decided that parties responsible for hazardous substance releases or oil discharges should compensate the public for the resulting natural resource damages, notwithstanding the possible societal benefits of the activities giving rise to the release. CERCLA and CWA were designed to ensure full compensation for natural resource damages resulting from hazardous substance releases or oil discharges. Nothing in the statutes suggests that trustee officials are required to assess the benefits to society of the activity giving rise to the release or discharge and claim only the net loss. Further, many of these benefits are already accounted for in current market activity whereas the costs of the associated release or discharge are not.
