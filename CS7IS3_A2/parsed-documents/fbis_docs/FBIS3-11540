The union said: "We are facing a worrisome situation over the entry of 104 kg of radioactive material under the UN Development Program through the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport." The union added that the situation is worse because the highly dangerous cargo left the airport jurisdiction under a regulation called "cargo to be regularized" which can be considered legalized smuggling. The union commented that approximately 18 months ago two small cans of radioactive material were found at the airport. The case was made public but nobody knew anything about how they appeared. The union stated: "Documents now in our possession open the way to a thorough investigation that could expose a new face in the trafficking of prohibited merchandise through our airport." The union believes several people are responsible for the entry of nuclear material into the country: One is Colonel Ramon Dardo Guerra, head of the DINAC. Another is Colonel Americo Osorio, airport director, who authorized the delivery without even the payment of the airport duties, and Victor Arevalo as the professional who mediated in this shipment. The air cargo ramp chief is also believed to be involved. [passage omitted]
