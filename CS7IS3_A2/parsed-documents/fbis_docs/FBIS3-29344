Australia's major stevedoring company has begun dismissing workers in a move to break the strike action which began in Sydney a week ago when compulsory redundancy notices were issued to 55 employees. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of exports are being held up on the nation's docks. Leader of the opposition coalition National Party, Tim Fischer, said the federal government must intervene to bring an end to the strike. He said the strike is an attempt by unions to block the progress of waterfront industry reforms. The Australian Meat Exporters Council said at least two meat processing companies will also start standing down workers from today as a result of the ongoing waterfront strike. The council said one plant in Victoria will lay off its entire work force of 550, while in Tasmania, a processor with 150 employees will also be forced to halt production. [passage omitted] The federal government is keeping its distance from the escalating waterfront dispute, saying it would prefer the parties to settle the matter through the Industrial Relations Commission. But, the spokesperson for industrial relations minister, Laurie Brereton, said the minister is very concerned about the implications of the dispute for Australia's trade reputation. The spokesperson said that is all the more reason the matter should be settled through the commission although the Australian Chamber of Shipping has faxed a letter to the minister requesting his intervention.
