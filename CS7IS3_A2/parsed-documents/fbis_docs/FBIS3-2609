Based on its functions, there are two different kinds of bond markets: Bond issue markets (primary markets) and bond transfer markets (trading markets). Issuing bonds is the traditional method for raising medium and long-term capital in various countries. Floaters consist mainly of enterprises established by governments, institutions, and stock companies; public utilities such as railways, telegrams, and telephones; and banking institutions and international financial organizations. Through bond markets, a large sum of capital can be raised within a short period. Vouchers for bond markets are mainly government bonds, company bonds, and security vouchers. Like company bonds, government bonds are vouchers which repay capital with interest on terms; however, because government bonds are guaranteed by government creditability, they are fairly safe and entail only a small risk. There are various kinds of company bonds, including a small number of unsecured bonds from credit companies; however, the majority are secured company bonds. Security vouchers are a kind of contract certificate which enables debtors to use certain property as a guaranty to raise long-term capital. In the past, property used as guaranty was mostly real estate; however, negotiable securities have recently become the most common form of guaranty. Bonds can be transferred or traded through two different forms: commission and off-board transactions. The former, also called on-board trading, refers to the selling and buying which investors commission stock companies to engage in at stock exchanges. As all bonds entering transaction at stock exchanges are registered and come in great varieties, investors have the option of investing in bonds with small risks, big profitability, and strong liquidity. Off-board trading refers to bond transactions between banks or enterprises and stock companies. Presently bond transactions are concentrated mainly on off-board trading. Payments for service charges differ according to the forms of trading. Applicants for on-board trading at stock exchanges are required to pay a commission service charge. However, off-board trading does not have to pay the service charge; the differential between the buying and selling price of bonds is the service charge paid to stock companies. Presently bonds are generally transferred through four different methods in China's secondary stock markets: 1) Direct buying and selling by a company: based on listed prices, companies buy discount bonds and transfer them to new buyers, with the buying and selling price of bonds based on bank discount rates, and with the prices fluctuating along with market changes; 2) commission trading: bond holders and buyers commission companies to sell or buy on their behalf, with prices decided by the buyers and sellers, and with companies collecting a fixed service charge; 3) mortgage: a bond holder who urgently needs cash but cannot sell bonds through the aforesaid two methods can mortgage bonds for capital and redeem them within a time limit; otherwise the mortgage company has the right to transfer the bonds; 4) appraisal and certification: after transactions are completed, and in order to protect the rights and interests of the buyers and sellers, companies are responsible for appraising the authenticity of bonds and collecting a certain percentage of their face value as appraisal and certification fees.
