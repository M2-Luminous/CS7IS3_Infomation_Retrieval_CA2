The shelling of residential areas and the defense lines has continued throughout the night and this morning, particularly from the territory of the Republic of Croatia, that is, from the so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina. These areas have been attacked from the back, while the local rebels and traitors have been shelling them sporadically from their strongholds in Golubovici and (?Travnica). During the night they fired at the Cazin outskirts, trying to instigate infantry clashes. Their main target is still the [word indistinct] production facilities. On the Bihac part of the front, in the operative zones of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], and on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, the chetniks have been behaving in their usual manner, which means unselectively shelling the defense lines, firing with antiaircraft weapons and small arms, and infiltrating smaller sabotage groups that keep trying to penetrate well inside our territory. The chetniks have continued to bring in equipment from the occupied Croatian territory, deploying it in the hills surrounding the Bihac commune. They are also carrying out engineering work and digging in.
