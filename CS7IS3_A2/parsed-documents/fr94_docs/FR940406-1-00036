FR940406-1-00036 FR940406-1-00011 The statute does not expressly state whether the concept of feasibility is to be determined on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis or on an industry-wide basis. As discussed in many fuel economy notices, it is clear from the legislative history that Congress did not intend that standards simply be set at the level of the least capable manufacturer. Instead, NHTSA must take industry-wide considerations into account in determining the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. NHTSA has consistently set light truck standards at a level that can be achieved by manufacturers whose vehicles constitute a substantial share of the market. Because of the relatively high volume of production by those manufacturers, their capability bears a strong and close relationship to that of the industry as a whole. III. Issues in Developing a Proposal for MY 1998&hyph;2006 Among the significant issues involved in developing a proposal for the MY 1998&hyph;2006 light truck CAFE standards is the ability of manufacturers to improve their light truck fuel economy during that period. In order to help it analyze that issue, NHTSA requests information or comments on the questions which follow. NHTSA is interested in the technology that will be available for improving fuel economy. It is particularly interested in technological advancements. For example, the development of two-cycle engines may have progressed to the point that their introduction to the light truck fleet would be feasible some time in the MY 1998&hyph;2006 period. Another example is the development of aluminum and nonmetal composites for automotive applications. These high performance materials, which have become less expensive, are providing new opportunities for lightweight, high-performance automotive components. The Miller cycle engine or other variations on the internal combustion engine may offer improvements in fuel economy. 1. What is the technological feasibility and economic practicability of the various fuel efficiency enhancing technologies, including, but not limited to each of the following, which were noted in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study discussed below: Multi-valve and variable valve timing engines; electronic engine controls; port fuel injection; lean burn-fast burn combustion; engine friction reduction; two-stroke engines; turbocharging; improved transmissions, including continuously variable transmissions and electronic controls; redesigning vehicles for weight reduction and aerodynamic enhancement; substitution of lighter-weight materials; lowering rolling resistance; low-friction lubricants; and reducing parasitic losses, for improving manufacturers' CAFE for MY 1998&hyph;2006? In answering this question, please address, for each of these technologies, as well as any other relevant technologies not yet available: (a) The impact on fuel efficiency; (b) Costs and benefits to the consumer; (b) Manufacturer costs; (c) Leadtime; (d) Potential fleet penetration. 2. What is the cost-effectiveness of each technology identified in Question 1, as well as any other relevant technologies, assuming alternative plausible gasoline prices forecast for MY 1998&hyph;2006, and assuming alternative payback periods ranging from 3 years to 10 years? 3. Taking into account the response to Question 1, indicate the ability of each manufacturer to improve its light truck CAFE for each model year during the MY 1998&hyph;2006 timeframe. By what model year would maximum penetration of all current fuel economy enhancing technologies be feasible? Why wouldn't such maximum penetration be feasible earlier than that model year? 4. What analyses of manufacturer light truck fuel economy capabilities for MY 1998&hyph;2006 are available? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each such analysis?
