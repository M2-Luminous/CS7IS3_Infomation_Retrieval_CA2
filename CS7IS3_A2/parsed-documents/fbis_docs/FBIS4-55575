Savovic told a press conference on Tuesday she had written a letter to that effect to U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to refute allegations made in an appeal by `Albanian intellectuals'. The appeal, dated May 6, in which `Albanian intellectuals' accuse Yugoslav authorities of flagrant human rights violations in the Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija, only testifies to the intention of some ethnic Albanian leaders to put an equation mark between the status of the ethnic Albanian minority and that of a constituent nation, and to alter the existing state borders, said Savovic in her letter to Butrus-Ghali. A strong separatist movement has been active for decades in Kosovo-Metohija. Its leaders illegally proclaimed the province a republic in an attempt to take it away from Serbia and its parent country Yugoslavia and subsequently annex it to neighbouring Albania. Savovic said there was no need to engage international organizations and bodies to monitor the implementation of human rights in Yugoslavia. She also said she had invited experts of the U.N. Committee for the Protection of Children's Rights to visit Yugoslavia and gain a first-hand knowledge about the difficult situation in which innocent children are suffering because of anti-Yugoslav sanctions. In late May of 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough sanctions against Yugoslavia over its alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. In her letter to the U.N. committee, Savovic proposed that the experts check on the spot whether the problems the Yugoslav government would list in a report scheduled for release in June were true. Savovic argued that U.N. special human rights rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki did not present a true picture about the rights of children in Yugoslavia because he had covered the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia and drew a parallel between children in Yugoslavia and those in war-torn areas. `We cannot accept such an approach, because the rights of children in Yugoslavia are threatened precisely because of sanctions by which the United Nations violate its own convention on children's rights.' The sanctions have a devastating effect on the health and development of Yugoslavia's 3.2 million children and more than 193,000 refugee children. The infant mortality rate has increased by 10 percent since the sanctions were introduced. The hemoglobin count in some children has been seriously affected because of a poor diet, with the number of children with hemoglobin defficiency increasing to 19.5 percent from the 8.3 percent before the sanctions.
