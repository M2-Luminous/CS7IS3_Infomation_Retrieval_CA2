Intelligence sources here said interrogation of some top militant leaders and foreign nationals nabbed by the security forces revealed that the Pakistan ISI [Interservice Intelligence] had decided to send in trained militants from the coastal borders of Gujarat and the deserts of Rajasthan, instead of the Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab borders. The ISI is trying to send in armed men and weapons through these circuits in view of heavy snow in the high mountain passes of the Kashmir Valley which has made movement virtually impossible, they said. The sources said the Kashmir militants and some Islamic militant organisations in India had established a possible base in Bombay where they were now trying to strike in order to target the country's commercial capital. The recent arrest of a large number of ISI men and other foreign nationals from various part of the country including Bombay, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan were clear indicators of the nexus between some overground and underworld organisations and the armed insurgents, they said. The sources said the interrogation also revealed links between the ISI and Kashmiri militants with the Kerala-based banned Islamic Seva Sangh (ISS) and Islamic Student Sangh (ISS). Various fundamentalist and Islamic organisations have been actively supporting these anti-nationals who have established links with the underworld dons in Bombay and outside India. The sources said there was concentrated [as published] effort by the Pakistan Army to revive the nexus between the Punjab and Kashmiri militants. The militants were now adopting the new route of Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan and the Gujarat coast to smuggle in arms and ammunition, the sources added. Some Kashmiri woollen merchants who visit different parts of the country during winter to sell their goods have been found smuggling weapons, sophisticated wireless sets, books on guerrilla warfare and other subversive material on their way back to Kashmir. The security forces and the State Police on their part have set up inter-border check posts to check such acts. According to the sources the peaceful resolution of the Hazratbal [shrine] crisis had dealt a severe blow to the morale of the militants. It had not intensified inter-gang clashes among them but also made it difficult to re-group and chalk out fresh strategies against the security forces. [sentence as published] Several top leaders of militant groups may have left the Valley to safer hideouts in view of the increased pressure by the security forces, they felt. During the past one month, there has been a decline in militant killings. The sources attributed this to the general resentment against the militants with the local people now readily coming forward with information about the hideouts of militants. The sources said recently a US House Committee report had revealed that the ISI had established countrywide network and was responsible for a series of bomb blasts in Delhi and Bombay in 1992. The sources expressed serious concern over information that Nepal was being used by Kashmir, Islamic and Arab subversives to hold meetings to chalk out strategies. An increasing number of militants had fled to Nepal as the ISI is making a bid to establish a "jehad [holy war] council" in the Valley consisting of top 15 militant organisations. There had also been an increase in drug-trafficking on the Jammu border as the Army in Pakistan had launched a major crackdown on drug lords in the Sindh and Balochistan Provinces. An official report said terrorist outfits involved in drug running have been increasingly using India as a transit point. The report said terrorism and insurgency with all the talk about "self-determination" and struggle for "independence" have been used by the outlawed militants outfits to provide a camouflage for smuggling of narcotics, bound for western destinations through Delhi and Bombay.
