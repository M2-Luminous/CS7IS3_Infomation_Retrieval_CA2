Chief Procurator of the Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate, Mr. Wang Jun, speaking this morning at the provincial people's congress being held here, said that some 4,246 economic cases including those of bribery and corruption were filed in the procuratorial organs at various levels in the province last year with 1,670 of them investigated and 1,249 of these involving sums of RMB 10,000 [renminbi] or more, making up 74 percent of the total and 27.7 percent up over the year before. From August to December last year, there were 905 such economic cases in the province involving 1,036 persons and 677 cases involving sums of RMB 10,000 or more, 20 percent up over that seen in the previous seven months while those involving RMB one million or more were put at 29. Of the cases discovered in the latter five months of last year, 373 were committed by party and government officials working in such departments as legislation, administrative law-enforcement and economic management, involving 394 people of which 19 were cadres of county or division ranks. In a related development, according to the report by the president of the provincial higher people's court, Mr. Mai Chongkai, to the provincial people's congress, the people's courts in the province last year handled 2,400 foreign-related cases involving foreigners, overseas Chinese and people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan with these cases covering civilian, economic, marine and administrative affairs. With the widening of opening to the outside world, the foreign-related cases in the province have been increasing annually with a 4.2 percent growth last year over that seen in the year before. According to Mr. Mai, the province last year handled over 900 cases regarding claims of returning housing property rights by owners of overseas Chinese and compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao with all these cases being properly handled in line with relevant regulations and policies. In order to meet the needs of opening to the outside world, the provincial people's court last year set up an economic court dealing with foreign-related cases while middle-level as well as grass-roots people's courts which face a relatively greater number of such cases also set up their corresponding organs to deal with such cases.
