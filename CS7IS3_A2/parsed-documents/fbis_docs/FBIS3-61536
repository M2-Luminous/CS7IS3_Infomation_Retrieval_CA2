At Least 700 People Are Already Living Under It''] [Text] Last Monday more than 700 associates of the Joint Institute of Earth Physics (OIFZ) of the RAS [Russian Academy of Sciences] voluntarily (!) took two-week leaves without the retention of pay. ``The most skilled personnel: deputy directors, heads of laboratories, lead scientific associates, heads of economic subdivisions--in all 81 people--voluntarily refused to receive wages,'' relates Academician Vladimir Strakhov, director of the OIFZ. ``In their statements they wrote as follows: I wish the days to be considered workdays, but wages not to be credited.'' Another 684 associates of the OIFZ--again voluntarily--took leaves without pay proper. But of them very many are continuing to come to the institute and to perform their official duties. ``The sense of responsibility of the scientist proved to be higher than considerations of an accounting nature. And I am very grateful to them for this,'' Vladimir Strakhov emphasized. ``This action is enabling us to release 40 percent of the month's wage fund, that is, 23 million rubles [R].'' In all at the institute it had been planned to spend a little more than R80 million on the September wages. R62 million were allocated from the state budget. But this money so far has also not come to the accounts of the OIFZ. What the Bolsheviks talked about for so long--``we will arrive at the victory of communist labor''--has come to pass: About 70 percent of the associates of the academic institute have already arrived at this ideal. And voluntarily besides. Incidentally, this occurred on the eve of another significant and long-awaited date for Russian science. ``For the purposes of the preservation of the intellectual potential of the Russian Federation, the further development of basic and applied research, and the increase of state support of the workers of budget-carried organizations of science and higher educational institutions of Russia I decree....'' I have quoted the preamble of Edict No. 1372 of the president of the Russian Federation of 16 September 1993, ``On Measures on the Material Support of Scientists of Russia.'' Several points of this edict should take effect on 1 November of this year. (The salaries for the academic title of academician of the RAS are R150,000 and for a corresponding member, R75,000; for scientists of budget-carried organizations and workers of higher educational institutions the monthly supplementary payments for academic degrees are 50 percent of their official salaries.) According to the information at the disposal of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, neither in the planning and finance administration of the RAS nor in the departments of the RAS does anyone know precisely the technology of implementing this point. Although ``instructions'' have arrived at several scientific organizations: If the financial situation permits, you are allowed to fulfill this edict. The road to hell, as is known, is paved with good intentions. And this hell has quite real, specific financial parameters. As a whole for the section ``Science'' for nine months of 1993 financing was opened in the amount of R500,380,049,100. What is this? This is 49.3 percent of the annual plan and 75.7 percent of the plan of nine months. The total arrears of the budget to science are R160,672,337,900. The institutions of the RAS and its regional departments have been financed at the level of 86-100 percent. The financing of priority directions of science and technology is 70.6 percent of the plan of nine months and 46.5 percent of the annual plan. The financing is broken down by specific directions in the following manner. Programs of operations of state science centers--82.6 percent of the plan of nine months; state scientific and technical programs--60.6 percent; the most important national economic programs and projects--62.8 percent; international programs and projects--40.8 percent; regional centers and programs--24.5 percent; programs of the development of the innovation infrastructure of science--7.5 percent; financing of the Basic Research Fund--58.6 percent. There is another detail. According to the testimony of a high-ranking administrative worker of the RAS, in recent times talk, the goal of which is to prepare the ground, and at the same time the Russian Academy of Sciences itself for the decrease of its budget next year, has been circulating in the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance.
