Deciding whether to invest in Burma "depends on who you are and what you want to do," said Ken Key, resident director of Chillington Tool Co Ltd. The attitude of the delegation, as noted at a Chamber meeting yesterday, seems to have shifted from dismissing Burma as a basket case to looking on it as a venue for good long-term investment with the payoff depending on the political outcome. "We would like to have our foot in the door," said Sandy Flockhart, country manager for Thailand of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp, which has applied for a licence to set up a representative office there. Opinion was almost unanimous that the "way to deal with oppressive regimes is not by head-on confrontation with them but by communication, probably through free trade," said Adrian Topham, managing director of Thai British Security Printing Limited. Countries such as Singapore seem to have adopted this principle. Six Singaporean banks have gone into Burma, and 17 hotel projects involving Singaporean investment are coming up. Singapore is a large source of foreign direct investment in the country and is set to outpace Thailand which is now the largest investor in Burma. The figure for Chinese investment is small but business with that country is large, most of it going unrecorded. "There is a market for basic products. Most of this is now available through the black market or obtained through barter trade," said Mr Key. The military government has monopolies in timber and gems. It also controls telecommunications, mining and logging. "However, it is possible to get into joint ventures with state entities or with Burmese citizens," said Mr Key. Products have to be chosen with care. A problem arises in the case of manufacturing units that base their production on imported raw material. "It is a Catch-22 situation -- there is a need for hard currency to import raw material but there has to be some export first to fund these purchases," explained Mr Key. Investment in power-intensive industries is also best avoided. There are some attractive features -- the low entry cost and the low wage rate, unofficially US$8 per month. But investors have to deal with a two-tier exchange rate: officially there are six kyat to the US dollar but the unofficial rate is 20 times that. Until the dual-rate system is scrapped, Burma will not get assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The prevailing junta does not want to do this and lose face. "Banking is basic," said Mr Flockhart. "In terms of trade, letters of credit are difficult to get, the smaller private banks cannot deal in foreign currency." Lack of reliable data on the country also makes it difficult to make commercial decisions. The regime's figures often are exaggerated. Peter Snell, managing director of Asia Market Intelligence, who derived his own statistics relating to Burma based on available information, put the growth rate at 1.2 percent and not the 5.9 percent the government claims. Inflation, 31.8 percent in 1993, is expected to increase to 45 percent in 1994.
