FR941012-1-00045 FR941012-1-00009 History: Rule on Vision-Reducing Matter Section 393.60(c) of the FMCSRs requires that no motor vehicle be operated with any label, sticker, decalcomania, or other vision-reducing matter covering any portion of its windshield or windows at either side of the driver's compartment, except that stickers required by law may be affixed to the bottom of the windshield, provided that no portion of any label, sticker, decalcomania, or other vision-reducing matter may extend upward more than 4.5 inches from the bottom of the windshield. A regulation dealing with Glazing and Window Construction, issued by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1952 [54 Motor Carrier Cases 337, 7 FR 4422, May 15, 1952], required that glazing in specified openings conform to the requirements contained in the ``American Standard Safety Code for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways, Z26.1 1950'' of the American Standards Association, now called the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). (The Table of Glazing Requirements, contained in §393.60(a)(2) of the FMCSRs, requires CMVs manufactured on and after January 1, 1981, to comply with Z26.1&hyph;1966 as supplemented by Z26.1a-1969.) In December 1958 (23 FR 9608, December 11, 1958), the ICC proposed to amend this rule, then codified at 49 CFR §193.60, by adding paragraphs covering windshield condition (§193.60(b)) and use of vision-reducing matter (§193.60(c)). The latter paragraph prohibited the use of vision-reducing matter covering any portion of a motor vehicle's windshield or windows at either side of the driver's compartment, ``except 1 vehicle-inspection sticker issued by a State or municipal authority, which shall be no larger than 3 inches by 5 inches and shall be located in the lower right-hand corner of the windshield.'' The ICC invited comment, but did not publish a report on this proposal. On December 3, 1959 (24 FR 9674), the ICC adopted a final rule amending §193.60(c) to remove the maximum dimension requirement for the sticker while setting a limit of one sticker indicating compliance with official mechanical inspection requirements of the State in which the title or certificate of ownership is registered. The permissible location was changed to ``a lower corner of the windshield.'' The language of §193.60(c) was amended again on April 19, 1961 (26 FR 3309), based on petitions for reconsideration from the Virginia State Police, the New York State Public Service Commission, and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. The resulting amendment relaxed the rule to permit more than one label, sticker, or decalcomania to be displayed, and added the requirement that no portion of any label, sticker, decalcomania, or other vision-reducing matter may extend upward more than 4.5 inches from the bottom of such windshield. While the ICC did not provide an explanation for the selection of a 4.5 inch dimension, most inspection decals range from 3.5 to 4 inches in size, and the dimension was apparently chosen to allow for variations in the application of stickers and decalcomania. (The water-activated adhesives used for decalcomania prior to the availability of self-stick adhesives in the early 1960's tended to make them somewhat difficult to position.) The requirements of §393.60, particularly the 4.5 inch limit specified §393.60(c), are independent of the physical dimensions of windshields. CMV design has made significant strides since the time the regulation was promulgated, in part because of research leading to a better understanding of driver anthropometry and ergonomics. Improved positioning of driving controls, availability of more effective mirrors, enhanced adjustability of seats, and larger CMV windshields are just a few of the design advances made since the 1950's and 1960's. However, the requirements of §393.60(c) have not kept pace. Advantage I&hyph;75 Alpha Test To evaluate the performance and usability of the transponders, it was necessary to assess various locations for mounting the devices during an initial on-the-road ``alpha test.'' Plans called for the transponders to be mounted near the upper and lower borders of the windshields of CMV cabs. Approximately 200 vehicles, representing six motor carriers' fleets, were to be equipped with electronic transponders to transmit and receive information from CMV weigh stations and ports of entry.
