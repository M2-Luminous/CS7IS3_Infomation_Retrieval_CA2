But he was not convicted in absentia, nor was he on the list of 57 accused alongside Hocine Abderrahim. On 26 August 1992, at 0900, two men in a red Renault 4 left Bouzareah heading for Houari Boumediene airport. They had just been to the domicile of Fenouh Karim, who gave them a sack containing a voluminous package. At the wheels of the vehicle was one Boulesbaa Youcef, a veteran of Mustapha Bouyali's MIA [Armed Islamic Movement] sought by police in the mid-1980's and later amnestied along with Chebouti, Meliani, the Baa brothers, Hattab, Moghni. Accompanying Boulesbaa was a certain Djaafar el Afghani, whose mission was to deposit the sack provided by Fenouh in the airport concourse. A very powerful bomb that was to detonate at 1100. Boulesbaa's job was to telephone airport officials and warn them to have the waiting area evacuated. At the trial of the Abderrahim group, the indictment--prepared from the interrogations conducted by police and intelligence services, the depositions having been turned over to the magistrate handling the case--contained two different versions of the facts. First, the confessions of Said Soussene and Meliani Mansouri, arrested before the 26 August attack; second, those of the group subsequently arrested. The indictment also includes, besides the interrogation reports, two essential documents: a synthesis that includes the organization table of the MIA and names the principal leaders of the terrorist cells; and a concluding section that relates the facts, identifies who was responsible for which crimes in the airport affair, and describes the composition of the armed groups of Chebouti's Islamic movement. In the synthesis, it is noted that in addition to the MIA, four large groups were active in the Algiers area: the crisis unit responsible for "continuing the political activities of the Islamic front," headed by Redjam, Cherrati, and Said; the "ala al ahd bakoune" (faithful to the oath) movement of Selmane Abassi; and finally two very dangerous groups specializing in asassination of prominent personalities and agents of the security forces: one headed by Allal Mohamed, alias "Leveilley", the other led by Djaafar el Afghani. The first document identifies the man who placed the bomb as being Zouaoui Djaafar, alias "El-Afghani," who attended one of the first preparatory meetings for the 26 August attack at the home of Boulesbaa in El-Mohammadia, near El-Harrach. Besides Boulesbaa, there were the two Hocine brothers, Abderrahim and Ahmed. However, Zouaoui was not among those indicted, nor was he called as a witness before the special court, nor did his name appear in the list of accomplices in hiding. To this day, his name does not even appear on the list of 22,000 activists being sought by the security forces.... The second document, the conclusion of the indictment supported by a reconstruction of the facts, identifies this same Djaafar el Afghani who planted the explosive device at Dar El-Beida as being Si-Ahmed Mourad, a friend of airport ground mechanic Mechrouk Mohamed, who advised the Abderrahim group. Mechrouk was not prosecuted either, and doubtless has fled. Hocine Abderrahim has used confusion engendered by the indictment to sow seeds of doubt. The judge made efforts throughout the trial to establish the identity of Zouaoui Djaafar "el Afghan" and his relationship to members of the group. Abderrahim, who knew that Si-Ahmed alias Zouaoui and Djaafar El Afghani had not been properly identified--the pseudonym Zouaoui confused the trail--went so far as to bluff the judge by asserting that Djaafar El Afghani was an imaginary personage whom he had invented while being tortured. Soussene Said, arrested on 18 August, about a week before the attack, testified he had met Si-Ahmed Zikioui Brahim, an important member of the Leveilley group, at the latter's home in Baraki. Soussene admitted to his companions that he was the instigator of the bomb attacks against ENTV and the police security office for the wilaya of Algiers. It was at that meeting that Si-Ahmed proposed planting a bomb in the control tower of Boumediene International Airport. Armed Islamic Group Al Jamaa al islamia al moussalaha, GIA [Armed Islamic Group], born after the uprising of June 1991, was the creation of Mansouri Meliani, a former Bouyali henchman sentenced to death by the state security court, then amnestied by the regime under pressure from Islamists and the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]. Meliani was born in December 1944 in Khemis El Khechna--he would have been 50 this year--into a modest family of the region. He lived--before the era of the first MIA--in a small dwelling in the Bougara development at Sidi-Moussa. On being released, he made contact with FIS militants and officials. In early 1991, he was given lodgings by Zermane Omar at Amroussa, in Mitidja. Omar, a construction materials merchant, is a habitual criminal well-known to the police. He was part of Allal Mohamed's very first group and prepared hide-outs in the region for them. It was he who built Allal's main hide-out at Harraza on land purchased by the latter from proceeds of several hold-ups committed in metropolitan Algiers. Meliani, who had no resources, received gifts from Islamists in Algiers: Islamic Front militants gave him lots of money, as did Nahnah. Salah Assad offered him land at Soumaa. After the June disturbances, Meliani decided to create his own armed group, modeled on the MIA of the 1980s. He called it the GIA, and its governing body was a select Majlis Echoura [advisory council] with himself as emir. The council consisted of six persons: Kaouane Hacene, the "chaabi" singer; Bourahli Saadane, Meliani's brother-in-law; Nacer El Eulmi, brother of the founder of the SIT [Islamic Labor Syndicate]; Lahrani Sid Ahmed, a notorious terrorist with close ties to Allal; the imam of Ouled Yaiche; and a certain Abderrahmane of Benzerga. The group mounted several operations, including the "admiralty" attack, but was rapidly dismantled after Meliani was arrested in July 1992 in El-Achour, Bouyali's old fiefdom. The same month Zermane was arrested, along with El Hani, a funds collector and agent of Allal, and Hamadache, mufti of the Mitidja group. They gave away the entire composition of the band, while Meliani played straight with the authorities and reconstructed his network of contacts for investigators. When Allal was killed in September of the same year, the security services quickly deduced that Layada Abdelhaq would become leader of the band's survivors. In six months, 29 very dangerous members of the network were arrested or killed. Layada was "coordinating" several very different cells, but above all he was quite close to Allal. After several months of total silence, communiques were published in the newspaper EL HAYAT in which Layada, writing under the pseudonym of Abou Adlane, claimed to be leading several armed groups that henceforth would form the GIA. In June 1993 he was arrested in Morocco and extradited to Algiers in greatest secrecy. Actually, investigators wanted to exploit to the maximum the information he provided before publicly announcing his arrival in Algiers. Third Generation The Armed Islamic Group pursued a sanguinary strategy in 1993. After bomb attacks, murders of security officers, and attacks on patrols and barracks, even civilians were targeted, especially after the marches against violence and terrorism. Intellectuals and journalists were targeted. Si Mourad, alias Djaafar El Afghani, once again figured in police reports, and information about him was collected when lesser terrorists were nabbed. Initial conclusions of investigators: He is a very important figure, and cross-checking indicates he instigated the failed attack on Khaled Nezzar. His name keeps popping up in connection with headline-news events such as the attack on Boughzoul barracks; it is linked with a subject named Hammana, arrested and later released in 1992, and with Sayah Attia, 38, the son of a harki [Algerian who served with French forces during the war for liberation] and a cold-blooded killer in his own right; and with Tamesguida, where 12 Croats were slaughtered in cold blood. A new element appears in the modus operandi: GIA terrorists have begun killing with knives: They slit their victims' throats, decapitate them, and mutilate the bodies.... Soon, there were other new targets: foreigners. Si Ahmed masterminded the abduction of three French consular agents, then had aid cooperators and residents of various nationalities "executed." Industrialists and small merchants were victimized with increasing frequency, and there was little the security services could do about it. With the passing of Meliani and Layada from the scene, GIA's leadership has passed to a third "generation." Djaafar El-Afghani's group specializes in kidnapping-murders--as for instance in the case of Cheikh Bouslimani, who was found buried with his throat slit, next to an officer who had been kidnapped and decapitated. And there have been dozens more civilians. On Saturday, the hard core of the GIA was brought down--certainly, too, what the specialists call the "first circle": leaders of cells, very active members. What remains, according to this theory of the counterterrorism struggle, are the second and third circles: the thugs and killers, as well as the support groups that shelter the terrorists, provide information, and collect funds before being promoted and starting a new cell. Djaafar's progress is a case in point. At age 28--he was born in January 1964--he was a small-time operative of the MIA. Eighteen months later, this young musician born in Kouba and raised in Tablat had become the leader of one of Algiers's most murderous gangs.
