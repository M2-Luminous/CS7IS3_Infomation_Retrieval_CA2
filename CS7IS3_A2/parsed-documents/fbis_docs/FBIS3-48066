The rallies, organised by the military government's new Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) were designed to obtain the people's approval for six motions aimed at "the emergence of a peaceful, prosperous and modern nation". They took place at Rangoon, Mandalay, Meikthila, Taunggyi and in other cities. On Thursday at Pegu, 80 kilometres northeast of Rangoon, 120,000 people were reported to have assembled at the district sports stadium for what was the first major political gathering in the city since the demonstrations against military rule in 1988. People congregated at 5.30 a.m., before marching behind banners along four different routes from different quarters of the city. Some 25,000 came from the west of Pegu alone and passed the site of a massacre in August 1988, where seven students were shot dead when they confronted the military in the popular democracy uprising that claimed the lives of thousands of Burmese citizens. The four groups met around the towering Shwemawdaw Pagoda, which overlooks the district stadium. Only a fraction of those who arrived could fit inside the stadium where USDA officials, including the Central Executive Committee Member, U Pan Aung, addressed the rally. People started dispersing from around the Pagoda soon after the meeting had started. State media reported that six motions were "unanimously approved" by over 120,000 at the rally. On the previous day, USDA representatives toured the city in vehicles with loudspeakers announcing that at least three members of each family should attend. A railway worker said that he could not afford to be absent from the meeting or he would be fined 200 kyat (equivalent to US$1.70 on the black market). "For 200 kyat," the man said, "I can feed my wife and three children for two days." The procession to the stadium was marked in part by a carnival atmosphere, with musicians and marching bands. The military presence was low other than at the entrance near the stage, where the USDA officials addressed the rally. A private tutor in the stadium remarked that most Burmese easily forgot the sufferings of the past, but remained sceptical of USDA rhetoric. "They are happy just to exist," he said. He thought they would not have attended without the threat of a fine. [passage omitted]
