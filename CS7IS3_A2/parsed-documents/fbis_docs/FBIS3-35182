Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that graffiti sprayed in the Ramallah area said the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad had perpetrated the attack. [Reporting on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0905 on 19 February, Amir adds that a Hamas leaflet faxed to the radio station and signed by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam also claimed responsibility for the attack.] Our correspondent further reports that after the attack, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] detained several men suspected of participating in the act or possessing knowledge about the perpetrators. Tzipora Sason was shot by two rounds fired from a parked vehicle at the car in which she was traveling with her husband and two children. She was hit in the head and abdomen, and she died of her wounds. Our correspondent notes that Major General Dani Yatom, the Central Command commander, and Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, the IDF regional commander, are overseeing the investigation on the site of the attack. Reacting to the attack, Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said the government should beef up the IDF deployment in the area and launch an offensive on terrorists, rather than preoccupy itself with withdrawal. Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that the IDF should clamp a curfew on all the Arab villages along the trans-Samaria highway and maintain it until the murderers are apprehended. Moledet leader Knesset Member Rehav'am Ze'evi called on the government to provide Jews residing in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza with full protection. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0900 GMT on 19 February adds that reacting to the attack, the YI'UD [Independent and Democratic Israel] faction said all Hamas activists suspected of terrorist activity should be deported, and a closure should be imposed on Arab population centers in the territories."]
