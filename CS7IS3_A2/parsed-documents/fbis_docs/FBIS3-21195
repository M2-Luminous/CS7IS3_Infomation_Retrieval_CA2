Selects Regional S&T Projects 94FE0047D Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Sep 93 p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0047D Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] The Small and Medium Enterprise Organization (Executive Director Harushige Shimada) has determined 36 themes for twelve regions in eight prefectures with the subject being technology development and support operations for specific small and medium enterprise integration in 1993. These operations support individual technology development for areas receiving the approval for activation plans based on the Integration Activation Act (abbreviation). This organization has the form of determining themes based on regional prospects and entrusting their development to enterprises. As the application of the activation planning gets serious in each region, it starts essentially from 1993. The total amount of trust expenses is over Â¥570 million. The names of the regions and development themes determined are the following. Hokkaido-Asahikawa: Pure wood fire door technology, structural furnishings and wall panels as home construction materials Hokkaido-Kushiro: Squid flake commercializing technology, production technology for prepared foods maintaining the flavor of the materials (food products of a combination of agricultural and marine products) Hokkaido-Muroran: POS interlocking value display systems, precision processing technology for stainless steel unified special lightwall vacuum containers, high capacity dehumidifiers using electronic refrigeration elements, high capacity oil burners Hokkaido-Hakodate: New products and development for food preservation technology Niigata-Sanjo, Tsubame: Polishing equipment without using nappy cloth and polishing material, face grinders with composite technology integration, development of thin film molding technology and application to industrial machine blades for zirconia ceramics, flexible sequential molding technology by local heating Gifu-Gifu: Partially esterized PVA coating processing for material for embroidery, bulky adhesive polyester cloth according to the new spinning act, triaxial, three-dimensional, multilayered base material Toyama-Oyabe, Tonami: Technology for producing knit material for highly elastic and high density sportswear, technology for producing inner material by elastic nap raised knit, technology for producing sportswear with a composite of different elastic materials, production technology for highly elastic cloth Fukui-Fukui: Production technology for a three-dimensional structured net, print technology for optical applications, heat generating cloth for thermal flooring, fiber material surface composite film molding technology Kyoto-Maizuru, Miyazu: Shore cleaning vehicles, cleaning automated delivery equipment, refining and reproduction equipment for various processed oils (waste treatment system) Kyoto-Hokutan: Automatic deburring equipment for sprockets, high density work stocker-equipped ceiling running loader, technology for elimination of water solubility in small forged parts Yamaguchi-Shunan: Year round cleaning machine system for closed water areas like dams, lakes and marshes, silicon wafer high precision cutout equipment from improved general saw cutters, industrial hard floor cleaning and polishing intelligent robot applying the new processing method (dry method) Aichi-Imabari: Long and short pile cloth production control system, cotton paper cloth towels, automation and energy saving equipment for towel print processing.
