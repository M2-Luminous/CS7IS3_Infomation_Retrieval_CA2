FBIS4-5705 "dreas071_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 South Korea DPRK: `Sea of Fire' Remarks Distorted by South DPRK: `Sea of Fire' Remarks Distorted by South SK1304133894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0910 GMT 13 Apr 94 SK1304133894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Text] On 12 April, North Korea claimed that the remarks made by Pak Yong-su, the North Korean delegate to the North-South working-level contact, regarding Seoul becoming a sea of fire during the eighth North-South working contact on 19 March, did not mean that North Korea will start a war, and that the South side created an atmosphere of war by disseminating his remarks after distorting the meaning. Appearing on a roundtable talk on a Pyongyang broadcasting [Pyongyang Radio Pyongyang in Korean to South Korea] program, Choe Song-ik, director of a department in the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in North Korea, said that Pak Yong-su's remarks meant that if South Korea advances along the road of sanctions and war, all of the Korean peninsula will become a sea of fire and in this event, Song Yong- tae, the South side delegate, could not survive. Thus, Seoul cannot but be reduced to a sea of fire. He stressed that Pak Yong-su's remarks did not mean that North Korea threatened that Seoul will be a sea of fire by starting a war. A relevant official of the National Unification Board stressed that as the scene was recorded on video through closed circuit cameras, distortion of the remarks regarding Seoul becoming a sea of fire is impossible, and that North Korea's claim is intended to shift the responsibility for the strained situation onto the South. This official pointed out that the North Korean attempt to evade the responsibility for the remarks was prompted by its realistic judgment that the remarks on Seoul becoming a sea of fire, made as part of high-level psychological warfare, failed to disturb our society and only heightened the hard-line international atmosphere. He interpreted that it is highly likely that North Korea, in the wake of resumption of contact with the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency, showed such a change in its position as an advance step for the contact. Meanwhile, some people observed that the appearance of Choe Song- ik, the deputy delegate, on the roundtable talk instead of Pak Yong- su himself to explain the content of his remarks, supports the recent rumor that Pak Yong-su was relegated.
