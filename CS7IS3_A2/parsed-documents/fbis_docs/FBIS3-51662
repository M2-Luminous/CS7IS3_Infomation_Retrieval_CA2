The increase of the income tax on individuals and companies was approved by consensus, as was the restructuring of the ITR [Rural Land Tax] and the creation of a tax on the distribution of dividends. However, the withholding of 15 percent of the taxes of states and municipalities and 10 percent of the IPI [Tax on Manufactured Products] of exporter states were rejected. The income expected to be earned through this source will be compensated for through the Cofins [social security contributions], through combatting tax evasion, and through the sale of the participation of BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social Development] in several companies. The approval of the fiscal adjustment was celebrated as a victory by the finance minister, who made it understood that the URV [Real Value Unit] will be adopted within 15 days.
