The sum total in the last two years was more than 50 terrorist acts. Daring crimes are committed in Dagestan frequently, asserts Colonel of Justice Gamid Dzharlayev, chief of the investigative directorate of the former MB RD [Ministry of Security of the Republic of Dagestan]. But attempts on the lives of prominent figures--Magomed Suleymanov, a doctor; Abdurazak Mirzabekov, the chairman of the Council of Ministers; Said Armirov, his deputy; Gadiz Gadzhiyev, a member of the Constitutional Court; and the murder of Toturbiy Toturbiyev, the chief of Glavdagenstroy, and Arsen Bayramov and Bagautdin Gadzhiyev, candidates for the Federal Assembly--are another matter. I connect these crimes to the contradictions in the upper echelons of authority. Selection of Targets Bagautdin Gadzhiyev was shot with an assault rifle in Makhachkala on the eve of the elections. Toturbiy Toturbiyev was brutally knifed in a room of the Hotel Moscow in the capital. Arsen Bayramov, a Lezgin and a candidate for the Federal Assembly, was also shot on the eve of the elections. The circumstances of the death of his presumed murderer are very questionable. He was arrested quickly, but, according to the official version, he blew himself up with a grenade. What is most curious is that he was able to contrive to do this, if you believe the militia, sitting in a motor vehicle between two employees of the law enforcement organs. In addition, he was the only one to suffer in the motor vehicle. Vasiliy Baronchuk, the deputy chairman of the presidium of the Democratic Dagestan movement, himself a militia worker in the past, thinks that these crimes are doomed to remain unsolved. The KGB was notified of the preparation of the first attempt on Bagautdin Gadzhiyev, then former minister of trade of the republic, but it did nothing to prevent it. Five persons, including Gadzhiyev, sustained injuries in a grenade explosion. These and other terrorist acts were prepared professionally. Their exposure could shed light on corruption in the higher echelons. When the Upper Echelons Cannot Share the Spoils "Even a simple road transport accident under conditions in the Caucasus can be raised to the level of a national conflict," says Valeriy Beyev, the first deputy minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Dagestan. "I am not an advocate of emotional estimates, but in a majority of these cases we also examine the political version of the murders. In the final analysis, just what is authority? It is money, it is positions...." In 1992-1993, Dagestan received federal credits of more than 50 billion rubles [R] for the development of farming and agriculture. They were distributed by the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers. Practically the entire leadership of the republic had a bearing on this. As a result, the money went to commercial structures--for the purchase of wine-vodka articles and imported commodities. The billions in credits that came from Moscow went to firms that did not exist in nature. In the Khasavyurtovskiy branch of the Agricultural Bank alone the negative balance was R30 billion. The secret of secrets in Dagestan is the credit chart. "As for the connection between the recent murders and the distribution of credits, there is a lot that is not clear here," asserts Valeriy Beyev. "What is bad is that even when we know of the improper use of these credits, it is difficult to apply sanctions. After all, there is no case of theft--the credit is returned, and it is practically impossible to prove bribery. Even when someone is caught red-handed, charges of provocation can be made in court, and then the entire foundation of proof breaks down." Witnesses Want To Live, the Victims--To Get Revenge The problem of proof is also aggravated by the fact that witnesses fear for their fate, but a mechanism for their protection is lacking. Today, not one legislative act has been adopted for the protection of a victim, a witness, or a worker in law enforcement organs. As a result of quick and effective measures, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] in 1993 in Dagestan eliminated 22 armed groups that were engaged in plundering and highway robberies. During the arrest of the latest band of this kind, consisting of five persons, two assault rifles, three pistols, and 14 hand grenades were confiscated. Both the local production of arms as well as the transit trade is developing--the proximity of the belligerent territories is having an effect. But with respect to peaceful Chechnya, assault rifles can be bought openly in the market two kilometers from the border. [Begin boxed item] MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI Dossier Statistics on premeditated murders for Dagestan. 1992: Out of 154 murders, 67 were solved; in 1993, out of 229, 140 were solved. According to unofficial data, the number of those murdered in the past year was about 500 persons. [End boxed item] According to data of the Dagestan MVD, some of the armed groups that were disarmed in the Khasavyurtovskiy Rayon were previously in the Avar People's Front imeni Imam Shamil, and later they engaged in robberies. The local courts employed sanctions only in 24 percent of the examined cases concerning incidents of storing or employing arms. The victims themselves frequently do not give true testimony, either out of fear or from a desire to take revenge independently, believes Colonel Dzharlayev. Three Sources of Gunfire More than 30 nations live in Dagestan. All of them are natives, but the Avars and the Dargins are in the majority. This situation was recorded in the past elections: Representation in the new Russian parliament was acquired by the Avars (four seats) and the Dargins (two seats). One seat each, owing to party lists, was acquired by a Lak--the famous musician Murad Kazhlayev (PRES) [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], and a Russian--Semen Reshulskiy (Communist Party of Russia). Besides the problems of representation in the local and federal organs of authority, another question is acute in Dagestan--land. There is not much land in Dagestan, and the fight over it has always been distinguished by its ferocity. The "free," that is, the flat lands that are suitable for settlement are only "Kumyk" in Dagestan--in accordance with an unofficial cadastre. But the more numerous Avar and Dargin populations are counting on them, and also the Laks, who are leaving the lands of the Chechen-Aukhovs [chechentsy-aukhovtsy] that they occupy. And today's calm will not last long--until the spring sowing campaign. What strikes the eye is that the terror has been directed against politicians who represent the small nations of the republic. Gadiz Gadzhiyev is a Lak, Toturbiyev and Bagautdin Gadzhiyev are Kumyks, Said Amirov is a Dargin, and Arsen Bayramov is a Lezgin. Abdurazak Mirzabekov, the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the republic, is a Kumyk. (The last refused to run for the Federation Council. Did he behave reasonably?) In recent years, the "conflict of generations" was added to the traditional contradictions. The key posts in the leadership of the republic are occupied by those who come from the nomenklatura or their successors. Relying on the strength of the state apparatus, they successfully rivaled their competitors, who accommodated themselves to market relations better than they. The "new people," probably bet on Moscow, uniting around Ramazan Abdulatipov. It seems that this party would like to lean on the capital in the fight against local opponents. It is precisely this way that the republic perceived Abdulatipov's statement that the two candidates to the Federal Assembly were shot for criticizing higher Dagestan officials. In recent years, journalists and specialists have not ceased to be amazed: All of the prerequisites for a conflict in Dagestan are present: ethnic diversity, shortage of land, and a low standard of living, but there is no serious bloodshed. The people of the republic, where any conflict will inevitably be transformed into a war of everyone against everyone, it appears, are retaining the instinct for self-preservation. Apparently, nothing can restrain the politicians from "sorting things out." The forthcoming parliamentary elections in Dagestan in June will show whether they are in a condition to stop.
