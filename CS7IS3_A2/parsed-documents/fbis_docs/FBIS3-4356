On display are equipment and technology of nuclear power plants, recycling of nuclear fuel, radioisotope products and nuclear waste treatment equipment. About 80 nuclear companies from China and abroad contributed to the exhibition, including some of the world's leading nuclear companies, such as the Framatome company, the Power Industry Corporation from France and Westinghouse from the U.S. The exhibition is co-sponsored by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Chinese Nuclear Society (CNS) and the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation. The exhibition aims to promote foreign exchanges and cooperation in this industry, and to promote peaceful use of nuclear technology, said a CNS spokesman. He said that as a standing member of the International Atomic Energy Association [as received], China has had relations with more than 40 countries and regions and has trade relations with 100 foreign clients. With China's rapid economic development, the country has made great progress in isotope and radiation technology, radiation processing and nuclear instrumentation, he said. The first Chinese nuclear power plant, Qin Shan nuclear power plant in east China's Zhejiang Province, is now safely and efficiently operating, while the first unit of the Daya Bay nuclear power station bordering Hong Kong in Guangdong Province recently went into commercial operation. Some other provinces and cities, especially coastal areas, are planning to build more new nuclear power plants.
