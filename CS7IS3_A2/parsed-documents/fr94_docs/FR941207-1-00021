FR941207-1-00021 FR941207-1-00006 Although the Forest Service is undergoing a process to change its dominant silvicultural practices to uneven age systems, its current management plans call for harvestable timberland in Arizona and New Mexico to be primarily managed under an even-aged system using shelterwood management. Commercial forests on the Navajo Indian Reservation have also been managed under shelterwood prescriptions (James Carter, BIA, pers. comm., 1990). Other commercial forests on Indian lands in the Southwest are managed primarily as uneven-aged stands by use of selective logging. Under the shelterwood system, a stand is scheduled for a series of harvests culminating in a full rotation cycle in 120 years or less. This cycle length maximizes timber production, but does not provide enough time for stands to reach the mature to old-growth conditions characteristic of forested Mexican spotted owl habitat, and results in forest age distributions unnaturally skewed toward younger stands. The conversion of complexly structured forest stands to evenaged stands was identified by the Service (USFWS 1991, USFWS 1993) as the greatest threat facing the Mexican spotted owl. The Service has determined habitat loss trends from current National Forest plans, which provide the only available projections on timber harvest trends into the future. Half of all shelterwood management on National Forests is occurring in forests not suitable for breeding (primarily pure ponderosa pine), and the other half in suitable forest habitat. The Forest Plans project that an estimated 0.4 percent of Mexican spotted owl habitat will be made unsuitable for breeding each year in the future if timber extraction continues as outlined under current forest plans. Uneven-aged management like that employed by the White Mountain Apache Tribe maintains and promotes development of complex forest structures. Methods include individual tree selection and group selection. Individual tree selection entails the harvest of trees selected from a size-distribution curve appropriate for forest type, site conditions, and desired regeneration levels. Trees of various size and age classes are retained, and multi-storied attributes and vertical diversity are maintained. Group selection creates openings in the forest stand up to a hectare (1 to 2 acres) in size, developing small even-aged clumps of trees and within-stand horizontal diversity. The Service considers the use of uneven-age management the silvicultural method most compatible with maintenance of Mexican spotted owl habitat. Current Management
