FBIS4-58064 "drnes084_j_94020" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Wrapup of Reports on Country's Political `Crisis' Wrapup of Reports on Country's Political `Crisis' YSP: Salih `War Speech' Caused Attack NC3004204094 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1920 GMT 30 Apr 94 NC3004204094 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Aden, 30 Apr (MENA) -- A spokesman for the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has accused the military forces in Sanaa of continuing their buildup to besiege and attack the 3d Armored Brigade in the new positions it assumed after the attack against it in 'Imran. In a statement this evening, the spokesman said the aggression against the 3d Brigade in 'Imran was part of a military and political plan worked out by the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform Grouping. The attack was launched after the "war speech" delivered by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on 27 April, he said. The spokesman said President Salih is issuing instructions to chase and liquidate the 3d Armored Brigade and to send reinforcements from the Republican Guards and the Central Security forces. These forces, the spokesman added, are assisted by battalions from the al-Majd Brigade moved from Babil al-Jadidah [name as received]. The spokesman said in his statement that the military forces in Yemen left the wounded from the 3d Brigade without medical treatment and sent them to jails. They are being treated as prisoners of war from a foreign army, not as the sons of the unified homeland. The spokesman urged Red Cross and Red Crescent societies and human rights organizations to extend the necessary assistance to those soldiers and to save them from torture. The spokesman said the schemes currently being designed are part of a horrible bloody adventure that will deeply hurt Yemen's unity and security. Attacking and chasing the 3d Brigade, the spokesman said, is a crime that will not pass easily because it means declaring an all- out civil war for which the separatists will be responsible. Meanwhile, informed military sources in Aden have stressed that the military forces in Yemen continue to reinforce the Republican Guards, the Central Security, and the forces led by brothers and aides of President Salih in many governorates to escalate the military and political situation. The sources said military reinforcements continued in the Governorate of Ta'izz toward al-Rahidah and Jabal Bani Shu'ayb, and the 3d Brigade was equipped to move toward the former border between the two parts of Yemen. The sources added that the Republican Guards forces and the Central Security units in Dhamar were reinforced by two infantry battalions from al-Majd Brigade to besiege the southern Basuhayb brigade. President Salih and "his military family" are trying to push the biggest force possible toward the oil-rich Governorate of Shabwah, the sources added.
