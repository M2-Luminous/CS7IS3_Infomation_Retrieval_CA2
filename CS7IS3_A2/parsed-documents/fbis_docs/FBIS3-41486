Removal of excess manganese and iron costs 2 billion markkas. It is estimated that the drinking water used by hundreds of thousands of Finns will not be within legal limits at the beginning of next year, when new restriction become effective in connection with the EEA [European Economic Area] treaty. In the near future, 100 to 200 groundwater utility companies and about 30 surface water utility companies will have to take measures concerning excess levels of iron and manganese. Small water intake plants, which are located in groundwater areas with high iron levels, will face the toughest challenge. The water cleaning bill will, relatively speaking, be the highest for them. At the same time, pressure to increase water rates will grow. Majority Does Not Fulfill Manganese Requirements A work group appointed by the National Board of Waters and Environment estimated that, by the year 2000, Finland must invest 2 billion markkas in order to bring all of the country's drinking water up to EC standards. The new drinking water regulations apply to all water supplies with over 50 users. The most urgent repairs must be performed at water companies servicing over 5,000 people, as they must immediately file reports with the EU [European Union]. Today, almost half of the large water utility companies exceed the accepted limits. The current target manganese level is 0.1 mg per liter, while the EU directive specifies less than .05 mg per liter. Water quality requirements, thus, become much more stringent. Based on information from 1987, there are 60 water utility companies in Finland that currently are unable to reach the figures required by the directive, not even by considering annual averages. If we use as a frame of reference, as stipulated in the directive, the highest measured concentrations, most water utility companies in Finland are unable to satisfy the requirements. The current iron target concentration of 0.2 mg per liter will become a requirement. Based on 1987 information, the average iron concentration of water treated and sent out for distribution exceeds the target value at approximately 50 water companies. When tap water is tested, 140 companies exceed the limit. The majority of these water utility companies are located in the provinces of Turku, Pori, Vaasa, and Oulu. The iron problem is not felt that much by water utility companies in larger cities, which use surface water. Based on the latest information, the only ones not affected by the more stringent water policies of health authorities are households using well water. It would be a significant problem in Finland to monitor every well, as there are about a million wells that are used by individual households. According to a study that was completed in the summer, of these, about 750,000 yield water of poor quality. Directive Also To Apply to Dairies However, the new regulations would apply to all water that is used in the industrial production of foodstuffs. A conservative interpretation of these rules would suggest that dairy farms, at least, would have to bring up their water supply to EC levels. In reality, it is not possible to take care of all problems immediately, even if required by law. According to Senior Engineer Leena Hiisvirta of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health there will be no transfer periods; the new regulations will become effective immediately. However, the ministry can grant special dispensation to water intake plants whose water values exceed the permissible limits, on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the design of the necessary cleaning facility, the dispensation may be granted for anywhere from a few months to a few years. But the authorities are still not intending to get too rough on the water utilities. Hiisvirta, who participated in the negotiations in Brussels last September, said that the new regulations will not be printed and distributed to district health and water authorities until February. Same Problems in All Countries Hiisvirta pacifies those who fear disciplinary measures by the EU Commission. ``All European nations have experienced the same kind of problems. The problems with the Commission are ironed out. The citizens' worrying is the largest problem. We do not follow the letter of the law anymore as we are used to, and the Finnish water supply is not as good as we had thought, after all,'' she said. ``If a water intake plant has not been granted dispensation, it is obligated to pay compensatory damages for, for example, damages caused by too high concentrations of iron,'' added Hiisivirta. The current quality requirements for water used by households in Finland were issued in 1990. According to Environmental Director Pekka Jalkanen with the Finnish Federation of Municipalities, even at that time, close attention was paid to permissible concentrations according to the current EC directive. ``The most significant change is that earlier quality targets or recommendations are now changing to quality requirements or regulations,'' he said. The EU Commission does not differentiate between water health hazards and other quality requirements that, until now, have been the policy in Finland.
