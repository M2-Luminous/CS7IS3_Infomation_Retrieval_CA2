The reasons the police chief cited are quite simple. During 1992 the Economic Crimes Brigade received 3,000 investigation orders and, with great efficiency, recovered 818 million pesos. In 1993 the number of investigation orders issued by the courts did not change much, reaching 3,100. But over 2.66 billion pesos were recovered. This means that the huge amounts stolen through fraud had multipled by a factor of at least three. Not only did the numbers grow, but so did specialization and the use of advanced technology to falsify public documents and instruments, not to mention the new and infrequently reported cases of computer fraud. In Mery's report on Tuesday, he said that Bridec [Economic Crimes Brigade] "is a unit that has shown a great increase in efficiency during this period. Crimes like robberies with intimidation or crimes involving bloodshed generally have a much greater impact on public opinion. But white-collar criminals cause considerable damages to the state, to development projects that the state has to finance, and to workers who are victims of fraud and swindling." [passage omitted] A few years ago, Bridec operated only in Santiago. Today it has units in all regional headquarters, the result, a high-ranking police official said, of "the difficult changes in the Chilean economy." Money laundering is always directly related to drugs, but it is an eminently economic crime, for this "black" money comes not only from drugs, but also from tax evasion, arms trafficking, and hundreds of lesser crimes that produce dirty money that needs to be laundered. To counter this new scourge while waiting for Parliament to enact legislation, the Investigations Police began to work on it a year ago. Police experts from the Antidrug Brigade and from Bridec who will be working under the coordination of a team of attorneys from the State Defense Council have taken courses to upgrade their skills in England, the United States, Germany, and Italy. Six officers, including police officers with accounting degrees, are also in contact with foreign police agents who are experts in money laundering. They will also have the direct support of the FBI office that is to be set up in Chile, as well as of the U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration]. Chile's prospects for preventing economic crimes seem favorable. This is no place for people who want to pursue their base designs of swindling their fellow citizens. As Nelson Mery said, "No matter who they may be, they will end up in jail." [passage omitted]
