FR940114-1-00032 FR940114-1-00008 E. Transportation Alternatives States should promote alternative transportation programs that enable impaired drinkers to reach their destinations without driving. Alternative transportation programs include: Designated drivers; and Safe rides. II. Deterrence Each State should have a deterrence program to reduce impaired driving through activities to create the maximum possible perception of detection, arrest and punishment among persons who might be tempted to drive under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, including CMV drivers. Close coordination with law enforcement agencies on the municipal, county, and State levels is needed to create and sustain the perceived risk of being detected and arrested. Specialized traffic enforcement efforts, such as MCSAP, also serve as a core element in the detection of impaired drivers. Equally close coordination with courts and the motor vehicle licensing and registration agency is needed to enhance the fear of punishment. Effective use of all available media is essential to create and maintain a strong public awareness of impaired driving enforcement and sanctions. Each State should implement a system of activities to deter impaired driving. The deterrence system should include legislation, public information and education, enforcement, prosecution, adjudication, criminal sanctions, driver licensing, and vehicle registration activities. The goal should be to increase the perception and probability of arrest for violators and the imposition of swift and sure sanctions. A. Laws To Deter Impaired Driving States should enact laws that define and prohibit impaired driving in broad and readily enforceable terms, facilitates the acquisition of evidence against impaired drivers, and permit a broad range of administrative and judicial penalties and actions. These laws should: Define impaired driving offenses_ Establish .08 Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) as the blood alcohol level at or above which it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle (``illegal per se''); Establish .04 BAC as the illegal per se blood alcohol level for commercial truck and bus operators, as provided by commercial driver license regulations; Establish that it is illegal per se for persons under the age of 21 (the legal drinking age) to drive with any measurable amount of alcohol in their blood, breath, or urine; Establish that driving under the influence of other drugs (whether illegal, prescription, or over-the-counter) is unlawful and is treated similarly to driving under the influence of alcohol; Establish vehicular homicide or causing personal injury while under the influence of alcohol as a separate offense; and Prohibit open alcohol containers and consumption of alcohol in motor vehicles. Provide for effective enforcement of these laws_ Authorize police to conduct checkpoints, in which vehicles are stopped on a nondiscriminatory basis to determine whether or not the operators are driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs; Authorize police to use a preliminary breath test for a vehicle operator stopped for a suspected impaired driving offense; Authorize police to test for impairing drugs other than alcohol; Include implied consent provisions that permit the use of chemical tests and that allow the arresting officer to require more than one test of a vehicle operator stopped for a suspected impaired driving offense; Require prompt and certain license revocation or suspension for persons who refuse to take a chemical test to determine whether they were driving while intoxicated (``implied consent''); and Require mandatory blood alcohol concentration testing whenever a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a driver has committed an alcohol-related offense. Provide effective penalties for these offenses_ Require prompt and certain administrative license revocation or suspension of at least 90 days for persons determined by chemical test to violate the State's BAC limit; Provide for increasingly more severe penalties for repeat offenders, including lengthy license revocation, substantial criminal fines, jail, and/or impoundment or confiscation of license plates or vehicles registered by the offender; Provide for more stringent criminal penalties for those convicted of more serious offenses, such as vehicular homicide; Contain special provisions for youth under the age of 21 that mandate driver's license suspension for any violations of laws regarding the use or possession of alcohol or other drugs; and
