The chairman of the council of directors Marabayev briefed them on the situation in the region and the problems that cannot be tackled on their own. In particular, he said that with all this oil and gas condensate, and other minerals that the region is extracting and making an essential contribution to the republican economy with, Mangistay still cannot create appropriate social and housing conditions for its citizens. Nazarbayev promised his support in tackling these issues and at the same time he said that this depends mainly on the efforts and efficiency of the works. Mangistau is a sort of a nature monument with monuments from the paleolithic age up to the present day. No other region of the Republic can be compared to it. There are more than 20,000 archeological and architectural monuments. Each of them is extremely valuable. Some of them were visited by the leaders of the Republic. Nazarabyev noted that what has been created by our ancestors and by nature is irreplaceable. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is we should find resources to protect them and pass them over to the next generations.
