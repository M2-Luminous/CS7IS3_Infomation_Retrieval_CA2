By the summer of this year, the Federal Government will present the framework of its concept for tax policy for the next electoral term, the minister said at the annual meeting of the Association of Self-Employed Professionals in Berlin. According to the FDP official, the following points have to be included in the tax concept: -- The elimination of the split top income tax rate. Rexrodt emphasized that it was necessary to return to a single income tax rate at a low level, "that is to say clearly beneath 50 percent." -- The splitting of the top income tax rate should only temporarily offset the extra burden on the trade tax until it is reformed. Within the framework of the trade tax reform the trade capital tax has to be abolished and the trade income tax to be reduced. -- The solidarity surcharge, which, according to the plans of the coalition, will be introduced on 1 January 1995, has to be eliminated again at the earliest possible time. Rexrodt conceded that as long as it existed, no comprehensive reduction of the income and corporate tax were possible under the constitutional law. Therefore, he was in favor of putting a clear time limit on the surcharge even today. Otherwise this surcharge threatens to become a permanent instrument for refinancing the state without people remembering in the future what its original purpose was. Yet, "this cannot be had with the FDP," Rexrodt said. -- Additional tax revenues in the wake of economic growth must not serve as extra room for new state spending, but must be used for continuing the policy of cutting taxes. The economics minister drew up an optimistic picture of economic developments in Germany. From the current point of view a growth rate of 1.5 percent is possible for all of Germany. "This development might even turn out slightly better," the federal economics minister said, the reason for it lying in increasing orders from abroad and in a rise in orders for the producing industries in eastern Germany.
