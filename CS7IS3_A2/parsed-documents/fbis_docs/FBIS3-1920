The decision will serve as the government's policy in positioning itself in relation to Hong Kong and Macao after they become special administrative zones of mainland China in 1997 and 1999, respectively. The MAC made the decision when screening the draft statute governing Taipei's future ties with Hong Kong and Macao. The statute was newly worked out by domestic scholars. Under the statute, the MAC will authorize relevant government units to work out concrete and detailed measures for countering whatever possible changes in the political and economic climates of the two colonies after 1997 and 1999, MAC officials said. Basically, the officials said, the statute for governing people-to-people ties across the Taiwan Strait can't be applied to regulate ties between Taiwan and Hong Kong or Macao. Informed sources said that the government here hopes to maintain direct trade and aviation ties with Hong Kong after 1997 on a reciprocal basis. But there exist some variables that might cause the hope to evaporate. These include whether the National Unification Guidelines are still at their initial implementation stage, and whether direct trade, transportation and mail are allowed. The statute for governing ties with Hong Kong and Macao is expected to be fully enacted by the end of 1996.
