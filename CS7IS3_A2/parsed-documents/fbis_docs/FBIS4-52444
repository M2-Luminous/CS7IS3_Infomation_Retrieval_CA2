FBIS4-52444 "dreas090_c_94041" FBIS-EAS-94-090 Daily Report 7 May 1994 North Korea Country's `Independent National Economy' Lauded Country's `Independent National Economy' Lauded SK0705113694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1046 GMT 7 May 94 SK0705113694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The Korean people have effected a new upsurge in socialist construction upholding the reovolutionary banner of self-reliance. Workers and other labouring masses in different parts of the country have registered palpable successes in production and construction by displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance even under the circumstances where the imperialists and reactionaries were trying hard to isolate and stifle Korea. On the occasion of the April fete, many construction projects, including the May 18 mine in Songchon, the Undok garment factory in Pyongsong, the South Pyongan provincial dental preventive hospital and the Kaechon-Sunchon railway electrification project, have been completed and put into operation. The workers of the Kim Chong-tae general electric locomotive works manufactured new-type tram cars and subway cars in February last. The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is the traditional fighting spirit of the Korean people. The history of the Korean people building a powerful socialist country of independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in defence on this land is a history of brilliant application of the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. In the first six months of 1954, less than one year after the ceasefire, the Korean people built and rehabilitated more than one hundred factories and enterprises, including the Nampo smelting complex, the Pyongyang textile combine and the Huichon general machine tool works, and built dwelling houses with a total floor space of 620,000 square meters in towns and workers' residential quarters and schools with a total floor space of 300,000 square meters, under the difficult circumstances where everything was destroyed by the war. In the latter half of the 50s when the raw and other materials and funds were in short supply and technical force was weak the Korean people made by their own efforts such machines as trucks, tractors, bulldozers and water pumps, and the workers of Kangson produced 120,000 tons of steel with a blooming mill with a rated capacity of 60,000 tons. The machine industrial sector witnessed such an amazing success as producing more than 13,000 machine tools a year outside the state plan. The builders of the Haeju-Hasong (80 kilometers) railway section completed in only 75 days the gigantic project involving a 880,000 cubic meters earthwork, the construction of a 5,600 square meters retaining wall, 38 bridges, 19 station buildings, a railway section and section gangs and dwelling houses for 200 families. The Korean people who carried out the historical task of socialist industrialization in a matter of 14 years (1957- 1970) built many factories and enterprises, including the Sunchon vinalon complex, the Namhung youth chemical complex and the Taechon general hydro-power station, and produced such modern machines as a 10,000 ton press, an extra-large oxygen plant and numerical control machine tools in the 70s and 80s, too, by their own efforts by displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. More than 11,000 projects were completed in the industrial sector during the 3rd seven-year plan (1987-1993). Korea now has a solid independent national economy not affected by any economic fluctuation.
