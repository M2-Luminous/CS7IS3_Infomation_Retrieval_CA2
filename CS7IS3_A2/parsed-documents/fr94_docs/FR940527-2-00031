FR940527-2-00031 FR940527-2-00027 Financial Assistance Award: Microdin Design, Inc. AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) under Grant Number DE-FG01&hyph;94CE15596 to Microdin Design, Inc. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $91,811 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through development of an energy-efficient device and system for drying green veneer sheets. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, Attn: Rose Mason, HR&hyph;531.23, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the unsolicited application for financial assistance submitted by Michael E. Christian is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The market potential for this invention amounts to approximately 150 softwood veneer mills plus hundreds of small companies producing hardwood veneer. Lay-up mills, which manufacture veneer into plywood, represent an additional market. The invention conserves energy by using lower temperatures, desiccated air, and through the absence of pollution control equipment, such as electrostatic precipitators. The energy saving potential of this technology exceeds 50 percent. The principal investigator and inventor Michael Christian, currently the President of Microdin Designs, Inc., has experience as legislative consultant and college instructor and training in psychology, for which his B.S. was given, with graduate work in environmental psychology. In addition he is a skilled programmer. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation because the funding program, the Energy Related Invention Program (ERIP), has been structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation. The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 24 months from the date of award. Issued in Washington, DC on May 19, 1994. Scott Sheffield, Director, Headquarters Operations Division ``B'', Office of Placement and Administration.
