Four-hour limit--`Ceiling' or `Floor'?"] [Text] Recently our, shall we say, swimming in luxury, that is, in electric energy, which has begun to remain in our apartments not only for the four "scheduled" hours but also longer, has given people hope for a brighter energy future. In fact, since in practice the delivery of electricity to the homes of the population lasts from 0600 to 1600, is it not possible to increase the schedule for the delivery of electric energy to the population until at least, say, 1800. Some people say: Why do we need a schedule now, let them give us more light without any schedules--and that is all there is to it. But the aspect of a schedule is important in that only these hours are guaranteed by the state: Beyond that there might be light and there might not--and nobody who has received his four hours can complain about the lack of additional energy supply. The president of the state concern Armenergo, Mels Akopyan, for example, does not rule out the possibility that the surpluses of electric energy that appear will be distributed unequally among the various localities. For instance, in places where operational conditions are created for uniform provision of electric energy to all the buildings for eight hours, some will receive it for 16 hours, some for 10 hours, and others will receive only the four hours that are guaranteed anyway. Thus raising the "ceiling" of the guaranteed quota of electric energy will probably be disadvantageous for those who have become good at selling these surpluses. It is clear that the greater the scheduled supply, the lesser the surpluses and, correspondingly, the possibilities of various manipulations and machinations. But there is also the opposite side of the coin. Actually our current relative well-being with respect to energy is in fact extremely tenuous. For example, excessive usage in the gas line could put an end to this immediately--and we would all be sitting as we were during the winter with a zero schedule. So far there are only two scales of differentiated provision of electric energy to the population: the border regions and the republic disaster zone receive 25 percent more electric energy than the quota for the rest, which, incidentally, even here does not preclude abuses in the localities. Because the quota is determined centrally and handed down from Yerevan but the functions of uniform and fair distribution of it are still up to the local energy departments. For example, in Vanadzor, according to the local schedule, the people's homes have light for two out of every five hours (not counting the night hours, when the electric energy might be turned off altogether). After we eliminate the six night hours from the 24 hours of the day, through simple calculations we reach the point where the people of Vanadzor today have light only four to five hours during the day time. Even worse, according to operational information, the state of affairs in Gyumri, whose population so far can have light for only two hours a day, it sometimes happens, for example, that it is from 12 midnight until 0200.... "We are running into another danger today," says Mels Akopyan, "--insolvency or deliberate refusal to pay for electric energy, on the part of both the enterprises and the population. According to our predictions, this problem will be aggravated even more in a month or two, and its peak will come during the middle of the summer, when it would seem that there should be no special problems with the provision of electric energy. Based on this, the following decision has been adopted: for the appropriate prepayment we can increase the quota of electric energy released to any rayon of the republic or rayon of the city of Yerevan. That is, if you show me a receipt saying that Araratskiy Rayon of the republic has paid for electric energy for 12, 16, or all 24 hours a day during next month, then its quota for energy released will be increased correspondingly. And, conversely, if it continues to underpay, the rayon will be given the minimum according to the schedule, at best...." Today changes are taking place in the proportions of the sources of electric energy as well. While during the winter, as we recall, the gas ran out a good--or not good--dozen times, and then all the electric energy produced in the republic came from organic fuel (mazut) and it placed a heavy burden basically on the hydraulic resources, now the fact that the republic is receiving an acceptable amount of the blue fuel has removed some of the load from the exhausted rivers, and mainly from the literally exhausted Sevan, although the proportion of hydroelectric energy in the overall volume of energy produced in the republic is still fairly large. Now a couple of words about nuclear energy. Today one can say quite simply that the population is faced with one more winter without a nuclear power plant. Deputy Prime Minister V. Chitechyan at his recent news conference stated that even when it is on line the nuclear energy will be used in areas where the turnover and return on capital are high--so as to recoup costs of starting up the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant as quickly as possible, and after that the nuclear energy can help to ease the energy crisis of the actual population. Which areas are these? One can make the assumption, say, that the following scenario will occur: Gas freed up because of the availability of energy from the "atom" could be transferred to Nairit in order to step up the production of products that are in great demand abroad. It would also be possible to give nuclear energy to the complex of copper-molybdenum mining-enriching combines of the republic in order at least to increase the extraction of raw material and then sell it abroad. In a word, there are various possibilities here. One thing is clear: In this breakdown of things the immediate energy needs of the population are in one of the last if not the very last place. Moreover, let us not forget that nuclear energy can create conditions for saving on water of the Sevan. In a word, so far the nuclear power plant is clearly not about us. With the same or greater success we could link our hopes to a partial solution to the energy crisis with the startup of the fifth power block of the Razdanskaya GRES [state hydroelectric power plant], where the problem of financing has already been solved ($57 million) and at which construction work is now in full swing. So next year the republic, including the energy-producing facilities, will have a fifth block of the hydroelectric power plant with a capacity almost as great as that of the block of the nuclear power plant--300 megawatts. Now, in particular, at the second International Energy Conference in Yerevan, they are working extra hard on the possibilities of financing the construction of a sixth block of the Razdanskaya GRES with the same capacity--300 megawatts. So in any case there are prospects of, if not completely then at least partially, overcoming the energy crisis in the republic, but, alas, not until next year. In conclusion, a couple of words about the organizational side of the matter. Recently the special-purpose state enterprise Armenergo was transformed into a state concern. What brought this about? Mels Akopyan explains this by the need to improve it and bring it into line with modern requirements for the structure of the department. In particular, the head of the enterprise has now been assigned purely management functions, and the lower levels--greater independence. But here is another fact that is even more difficult to explain. During the winter a good share of the property of Armenergo was arbitrarily placed at the disposal of the Yerevan City Council and, corresponding, the Yergorelektronet [Yerevan city electric energy network]. Not only was such a decision not written into any laws, it reinforces people's impression that it is now possible to do anything you want to with state property--a circumstance that does not contribute to good feelings.
