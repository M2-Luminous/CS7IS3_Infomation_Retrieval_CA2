Vlcek, director general of the RDP Group arms consortium, told us. He responded this way to the government draft law on trade in military material, which was discussed by the parliament committees yesterday. According to Vlcek, however, even this law will not be able to protect the Czech arms factories from being besmirched by foreign competitors, which have recently described Prague as a dealer in death. "The regular challenge to the trustworthiness of the Czech Republic in dealing with military material is partly caused by the effort on the part of the competition to suppress Czech arms exports. At times, however, it is also due to our inability to convince the world that our exports are controlled by clear laws," Bretislav Gregr, director of the license administration section at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said. According to him, the law defines limits for dealers in military material, which correspond to international standards. It even refers to state administration employees who have access to information on arms trade. After their departure from these bodies, for three years they are not permitted to work for firms involved in the production or sale of arms.
