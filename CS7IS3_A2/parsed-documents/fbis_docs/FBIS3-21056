As reported by Dr. Andreas Hoerdt at the Institute for Geophysics of Cologne University (Albert-Magnus-Platz, Cologne), the Lotem method is cheaper, and in some cases also more precise, than conventional prospecting methods. When a region is to be studied for potential deposits of hydrocarbons, a cable approximately one kilometer in length is first stretched over the search area. The cable is grounded by two electrode plates at the ends. If a current of between 20 and 100 amperes is now sent through the cable, it becomes a transmitter of electromagnetic waves. The waves penetrate into the ground to be studied. The direction of the current is reversed at certain intervals, which produces induction currents in the ground. These currents now persist longer the better the electrical conductibility of the layer in question. The induction currents produce an electrical and magnetic field, which can be measured at the surface. The measurement instruments are induction coils or copper sulfate electrodes, which function as receivers. When measuring the terrain the transmitting cable remains in the same place; only the receiving equipment is moved. This way a cutaway view of the geological formation of the underground can be obtained. In the context of oil exploration, the profile can then be used for, among other things, determining the most suitable site for test drilling. Financially, this is a big help, since test drilling is expensive. At present, a five-kilometer-deep bore hole costs about 20 million German marks [DM]. Lotem has already been successfully tested by Cologne University both in Germany and within the framework of a BMFT [Federal Ministry for Research and Technology] project in China and India. The display of the geological profile was recently made even more graphic by using the current-image interpretation method. With this method the specific electrical resistance of a layer is visualized directly in the form of various colors or gray levels. Although Lotem is relatively inexpensive compared to conventional methods of prospecting, such as seismic prospecting, its application is still limited. This is due to the low resolution of the procedure. Complicated faults cannot yet be measured. On the other hand, Lotem can very well distinguish between water and oil-bearing strata, which is not possible with seismic methods. Furthermore, Lotem is not hindered by volcanic rock covers, which transmit electromagnetic but not sound waves.
