It has been learned that Yang Shangkun earlier came to Xijiaoshan from Zhuhai for the summer and recently has been staying in Guangdong. Zhao Ziyang went to Sichuan "to set his mind at ease [san xin 2414 1800]," but he did not return directly to Beijing and went to Guangdong instead. According to the source, Zhao Ziyang was accompanied by an entourage of a dozen or so attendants, but Guangdong's major officials did not show up to welcome him or see him off, they only arranged some security measures. Yang Shangkun also politely declined the company of local officials because he wanted to ensure a good rest. Nobody knows what these two political figures, who at one time were the men of the day but subsequently lost power, discussed during their meeting. Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun have a very special relationship in the mainland China political arena. Both of them were pushed to the top of the power ladder by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970's and rendered meritorious service in consolidating Deng Xiaoping's power base and promoting reform and opening up. As power was redistributed, however, they were both consigned to a state of limbo. Both Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun had at one time been in charge of Guangdong and were appointed to the office of Guangdong Provincial Party Committee secretary, one succeeding the other. When they were promoted to the central authorities, they often returned to Guangdong for brief stays. Following the 4 June incident, Zhao Ziyang has been basically held under house arrest, but he has gradually been given a certain degree of freedom since 1993 and has secretly visited Hunan, Heilongjiang, and Sichuan to "set his mind at ease." It is believed that Zhao Ziyang's recent trip to Guangdong was his first since 4 June 1989. Yang Shangkun and Zhao Ziyang have consistently maintained a good relationship. Deng Xiaoping, however, stripped military power from Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun's blood brother, with a view to protecting and promoting Jiang Zemin in 1992, without dropping any hints to the elder beforehand, which made Yang Shangkun very unhappy. Consequently, the two families of Deng Xiaoping and Yang Shangkun broke off a tradition of close ties which had lasted dozens of years. When Yang Shangkun broke his leg last summer, Deng Xiaoping sent his wife Zhuo Lin to pay him a visit and extend his regards, but that did not result in the reconciliation of the two families. Since the 1994 spring festival, Yang Shangkun has had more occasions to make public appearances, has publicly made a speech in Shenzhen, has summoned responsible persons from the Guangdong party committee to hold a meeting, and has aired his views on reform in a speech for internal circulation. On the eve of the opening of the National People's Congress this year, the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY quite extraordinarily reported the speech Yang Shangkun had given two weeks earlier. It is generally believed that, because Yang Shangkun tactfully turned down Zhao Ziyang's request to mediate between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao himself in the days prior to the 4 June incident, and due to the role Yang Shangkun played in the 4 June incident itself, there must be still some ill feeling between the two men. Some scholars, however, believe that Yang Shangkun and Zhao Ziyang have each maintained their influence in the military, economic and political circles, and the power they would have behind the scenes in the post-Deng era should not be underestimated. Judged against this background, the recent Xijiaoshan meeting between Yang Shangkun and Zhao Ziyang has profound significance, particularly when one considers the rumors that are circulating regarding Deng Xiaoping's poor health and the extreme instability of Mainland China's political and economic situation on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident.
