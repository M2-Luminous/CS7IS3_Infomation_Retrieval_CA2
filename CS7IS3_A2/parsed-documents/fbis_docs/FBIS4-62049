For all that we are now growing used to reports of contract killings, the crime committed in Khimki looks like a cynical challenge to the state. A number of politicians assess what has happened as an act of political terrorism. We asked several deputies to comment on the story that the parliamentarian's murder was political. Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman of the Russian Federation Republican Party, "Yabloko" bloc faction: First of all we must proceed from the fact that it was a man, not a deputy, who was killed. Unfortunately some parliamentarians are using the incident for political purposes. That is hardly sensible. Especially as it is not yet completely clear what lies behind this: a political act or a settling of scores as a result of the dead man's extensive business activity over the past three years... Aleksandr Osovtsov, "Russia's Choice" faction: I am sure that the murder is not political. If some forces wanted to destabilize the situation in society by killing one of the deputies, then, bringing to mind only the deceased's good side, I can say that they could have found more important figures.... Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], LDPR faction: Of course it is a political assassination. It is notable that it was committed on the eve of May Day. When another 10-20 deputies have been put in their graves we will all understand and agree. Father Gleb Yakunin, "Russia's Choice" faction: The murder is hardly political. Nonetheless the answer may be learned when the criminal is caught. You say Aleksandr Men was killed and the killer has not yet been found? But it is not only in our country but also in the developed countries, where the law enforcement organs' system works brilliantly, that there are unsolved crimes. It is a pity that Zhirinovskiy is using the incident to build up more hysteria for his own benefit. Sergey Baburin, leader of the Russian All-National Union: The question of the state of the struggle against crime and the defense of human rights is serious. In addition to the tragic incident involving Andrey Ayzderdzis there have been many incidents of attacks on deputies and arson at their apartments. Now it is a case of expanding political terror and in addition to ordinary murders there are targeted political crimes. Today we have found ourselves in a qualitatively new situation -- we have crossed the threshold of political terrorism. And that is natural since the entire economic activity of the present executive power presupposes the formation of a mafioso-criminal society. Georgiy Zadonskiy, "Russia's Choice" faction: The murder of the State Duma deputy is the first tragic case in the present parliament. Several stories are being worked up involving personal, professional, domestic, or commercial motives on the basis of the figure of the victim himself. So far one thing is clear: It was a premeditated murder. The incident should serve as grounds for a tough hearing on questions of crime. There are various levels of crime. And where organized crime arises there is a threat to the entire country's national security. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" bloc and parliamentary faction: In our view the problems of crime lie in the economic situation in which we find ourselves. Judge for yourselves: We have a production decline of 25 percent and unemployment is just 1 percent. That means that an enormous number of people are involved in business about which the country has only an approximate idea. Some people are working in their private plots but probably most are engaged in illegal or semilegal, criminal, or semicriminal business. And there is also street crime, crime by children, with which the country is not concerned at all. What should we do? The government must earmark a federal program in the budget and show what it intends to do in this direction. Our government has still not set out its economic program in general.
