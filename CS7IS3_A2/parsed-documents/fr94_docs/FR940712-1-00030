FR940712-1-00030 FR940712-1-00010 Bureau of Indian Affairs 25 CFR Part 165 RIN: 1076&hyph;AC75 Sale of Forest Products, Red Lake Indian Reservation, Minnesota AGENCY: Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is proposing to delete regulations which govern the terms and conditions under which forest products produced by the Red Lake Indian Mills may be sold. The BIA is proposing to delete these regulations because the Red Lake Indian Mills no longer exists and the revision of the ``General Forest Regulations,'' prescribes policy for the sale of forest products produced by other Indian forest product enterprises on the Red Lake Indian Reservation. Therefore, this proposed deletion is necessary to eliminate redundancy and potential confusion in forestry program regulations. DATES: Comments must be received on or before September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Mail or hand deliver comments to: Mr. Jim Stires, Billings Area Office, BIA, Branch of Forestry, 316 North 26th Street, Billings, Montana; or Mr. Bill Downes, Division of Forestry, 1849 C Street NW., Mail Stop 4545 MIB, Washington DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jim Stires, Billings Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Branch of Forestry, telephone (406) 657&hyph;6358. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Deletion of 25 CFR part 165 will eliminate potential confusion because the Red Lake Indian Mills, which are the subject of the regulation, no longer exist. This deletion also will eliminate a perceived redundancy because provisions in ยง163.13 of the revision of 25 CFR part 163, ``General Forest Regulations,'' are adequate to govern the sale of Indian forest products by Indian forest enterprises on the Red Lake Indian Reservation. The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed rule to the locations identified in the addresses section of this document. This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under the criteria of Executive Order 12866. Therefore, review by the Office of Management and Budget is not required prior to publication in the Federal Register . This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) because the sale of lumber and forest products produced by Indian enterprises will be conducted as in the past. The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these proposed regulations meet the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant takings implications. The Department has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects. The deletion of 25 CFR part 165, ``Sale of Forest Products, Red Lake Indian Reservation Minnesota,'' will not create information collection or record keeping requirements which require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The primary author of this document is Mr. Jim Stires, Forester, in the Billings Area Office, BIA, Branch of Forestry, Billings, Montana.
