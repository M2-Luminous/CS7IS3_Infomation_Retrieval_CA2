Jean-Louis denounced occupation of the Senate seats by the 18 January parliamentarians, protesting that their presence in the Upper Chamber is prejudicial to its proper functioning. The following is a report by Daly Valet. [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] Whereas everybody would like to see the national institutions become strong so they can work to resolve all the problems caused the country by the 30 hurricane [as heard]. The Senate of the Republic finds itself in a garden full of bears without the prospect of a solution. Before that, there was the phenomenon of abnormality. Then there was the August 1993 normalization that allowed the election of Firmin Jean-Louis as Senate President and the ratification of Robert Malval as prime minister. Today, what is being observed is denormalization. All the changes in the Senate office have failed. The cause of all these problems is the 18 January parliamentarians who many legitimate parliamentarians consider a blight bequeathed to the country by the de facto Marc Bazin government. According to some senators, Bazin, who was in charge of resolving the country's crisis, further complicated it with the 18 January elections. The crisis has recently reached a new turning point with the ad hoc office set up by Ebrane Cadet, which parallels the office of Firmin Jean-Louis. This office includes some 18 January parliamentarians. What is being done in the Senate is illegal; there are no sessions; the 18 January parliamentarians have occupied the Senate. This is a statement by Firmin Jean-Louis, who added that Sen. Ebrane Cadet has assured him that there is no second office in the Senate. [Jean-Louis] The places have been occupied by the controversial 18 January parliamentarians. The seats have been filled by Sen. Cadet who pretends to be conducting sessions. But he has told me in letters he has written me and in all his contacts with me that there is only one office, the one presided over by us. The senator himself said so. [passage omitted] [Valet] What is being said and what is being done are two different things. Everybody can see that the ad hoc office of Ebrane Cadet, which is occupied by the 18 January parliamentarians, is gaining ground in the Senate. They voted resolutions, are preparing other resolution projects, are making statement after statement, and are holding meetings after meetings. Firmin Jean-Louis protested and stated that this de facto situation has blocked the Senate in its constitutional work. [passage omitted] As for the question of parliament's dissolution, the Senate president said he does not take this matter seriously. The senator said the parliament could be dissolved only by another coup d'etat or if the men, the powerful men, decided to kill all parliamentarians. [passage omitted] We must inform you that while the 18 January parliamentarians occupy the session room of the Senate with Ebrane Cadet and other Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion parliamentarians, Firmin Jean-Louis holds formal meetings in his office. located at the former premises of the National Office of Tourism from time to time with the other senators who remain faithful to him.
