The survey also found more than half of production technologies, machinery and raw materials needed by those firms have come from Taiwan and their product distribution channels are still controlled by their Taiwan parent companies. The survey was conducted by several local industry associations at the request of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The questionnaires were distributed to 2,800 Mainland China-based Taiwan companies which have legally registered with the ministry's investment commission. About 410 valid replies were collected. Thirty-one percent of the respondents publicly admitted that they have earned money from their mainland ventures; 26 percent said their mainland ventures have managed to make ends meet; 39.1 percent said their mainland ventures have lost money. The industry associations responsible for taking the survey said local businessmen are usually reserved in recorting their profitability in Mainland China. Many of those who said their mainland ventures can just break even have admitted in private that they have made small profits from their mainland subsidiaries. The associations have thus concluded that nearly 60 percent of Taiwan investors have made profits from their mainland ventures. As high as 70 percent of the respondents said they believe the Mainland Chinese market will be further liberalized following Beijing's economic reforms; 15 percent said they expect the mainland market situation will remain almost the same in the next few years; less than 10 percent said the mainland market will be further tightened. The survey found most respondents are optimistic about their business prospects on the mainland, with 58 percent believing their mainland ventures will make profits in the coming year, 25 percent saying they will be able to break even, and only 15 percent saying they may lose money. The survey also showed 33 percent plan to expand their mainland operations in the coming year. Only 5.81 percent said they have shipped back to Taiwan products manufactured by their mainland plants, but they stressed that most of those items are semi-finished goods. About 58.4 percent said their mainland-produced goods are mainly for exports to other countries, and 35.79 percent said their products are sold in mainland markets. Major export markets for mainland-based Taiwan firms include the United States (30 percent), Japan (20 percent), Europe (17 percent) and southeast Asia (16 percent), according to the survey. More than 50 percent said they have remitted their earnings back to Taiwan while 28 percent said they have used such earnings for expanding their mainland operations. The survey was completed in early April. The government did not immediately make public the results because of the Qiandao Lake travel disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists were robbed and murdered. With cross-strait exchanges gradually resuming, the survey results will be released in the near future, government sources said.
