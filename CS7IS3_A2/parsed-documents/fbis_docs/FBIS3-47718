Evangelista and Joe Macabalang] [Text] The on-going peace talks between the secessionist Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the government may be stalled further as the latter stood pat on its stand not to allow MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari to move around Mindanao with 500 armed bodyguards. The problem could be compounded by the military's claim that it has uncovered an alleged plot by the MNLF to mount terrorist attacks in the region aimed at expanding the granting of autonomy to 13 provinces envisioned in the 1976 Tripoli Agreement. Armed Forces Intelligence reports claimed that during a meeting in Maimbung, Sulu last December, MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari allegedly issued "secret orders" to his top lieutenants directing them to resume hostilities against the government. The instructions were allegedly to spare the provinces under the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao composed of Basilan, Sulu, Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur. Ambassador Manuel Yan, the government chief peace negotiator said they had not received such reports. In yesterday's press conference at Camp Aguinaldo, Yan said the government will not allow Misuari with a brigade of armed MNLF men. In Cotabato City, meanwhile, a top MNLF leader said Misuari "will definitely come" to pursue the stalled signing of his front's formal cease fire agreement with the government. "Ang pagdating dito ni Chairman Misuari ay medyo naantala... lang dahil hindi nagkasundo ang MNLF at gobyerno sa proposal namin tungkol sa security escorts niya [The arrival of Chairman Misuari here is slightly delayed because of the disagreement between the MNLF and the government with regards our proposal on the size of the chairman's security escorts]," Al Fattah Abubakar, chairman of the MNLF cease fire committee said. Abubakar was referring to the MNLF proposal for Misuari to bring a 500-man armed escort to the city for the duration of the scheduled signing of the truce in time with the three day meeting here of the RP [Republic of the Philippines]-MNLF joint defense and security committee. The military rejected the proposal and instead endorsed 40 Marines and 40 rebel armed escorts for the government and MNLF panels, respectively. This amended an alleged standing rule that allows only 15 armed escorts for each camp. Sources said such rejection prompted Misuari not to show up at the compound of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), meeting venue, and forced the RP-MNLF joint defense committee members to shorten their three day meeting (from Monday to Wednesday) to two hours last Tuesday, they said. But Abubakar expressed optimism that "higher authorities" will reconsider the MNLF original proposal because, he said, it was verbally agreed in Zamboanga City last week by him and DND [Department of National Defense] Undersecretary Feliciano Gacis, GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] defense committee chairman. On the basis of such optimism, Abubakar said "Chairman Nur Misuari will definitely come" for the signing of the truce, which contains detailed provisions of the cease fire pact agreed by the peace panels in Indonesia last November.
