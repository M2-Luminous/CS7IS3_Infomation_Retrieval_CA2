This was disclosed this evening to AFP by a top NADECO official. "Civil disobedience is part of NADECO's stipulated lines of action. The CD is helping to organize it," added the official, who was speaking by telephone from his hideout. "For the moment, NADECO will not appear much in the forefront of the political scene, and will operate through several organizations, including the CD," the same source said, while refusing to disclose his identity. The CD, which comprises nearly 40 human rights defense committees and associations for democracy "is affiliated to NADECO and closely collaborates with it," the official stated. The CD had on 8 June called on Nigerians to stage a one-week mass protest effective 13 June to press for the rapid departure of the ruling military regime and the formation of a government by Moshood Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of the 12 June 1993 presidential election.
