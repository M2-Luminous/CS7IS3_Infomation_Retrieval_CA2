SACOB says in a discussion document that South Africa's changed international status, and a need to create a more favorable climate for foreign investment, make it necessary for the government to review its position on exchange control. It says the government should commit itself as soon as possible to the phasing out of the exchange control system when the country's foreign reserves return to satisfactory levels.
