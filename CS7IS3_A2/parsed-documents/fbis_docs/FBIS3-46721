At the meeting on the 12th, the U.S. side demanded correction of "keiretsu" trading which impedes entry by foreign companies into Japan. The Japan side also demanded a reexamination of the regulations in the United States that vary according to states. However, the two views appeared to run along divergent lines. At the meeting on the 13th, the U.S. side indicated the shares held by foreign companies in the seven advanced nations. It pointed out that, compared to the share of 2 percent in Japan, the shares in the other G-7 nations is on a double-digit level, and that the reason was the closed nature of the Japan market. The discussions were concluded without reaching any conclusion and were carried over into the third meeting scheduled in November. Later, a senior U.S. Government official held a press conference at the U.S. Embassy and explained the basic U.S. posture of unilaterally setting numerical targets, unless agreement is reached on share expansion. Following the two-day discussion, a senior U.S. Government official held a press conference at the U.S. Embassy and clarified the intentions of the U.S. Government. According to the official, the items requested of Japan by the United States indicate the basic U.S. attitude of seeking share expansion for U.S. insurers in the Japan market, and the U.S. Government proposal is in line with the report by the Insurance Council, but is more concrete in its content. The official also indicated the key points of the U.S. demands and negotiations by item as follows: 1) Clarification of the conditions for insurance businesses to receive licenses. 2) Participation by foreign companies in the Insurance Council and industry organizations. 3) While a certain amount of regulation is necessary for the protection of the insurers, easing of measures is requested. 4) A change from the licensing procedures to a registration system. 5) Induction of a broker system. 6) A step-by-step easing of controls concerning the third sector. 7) Investigation of the "keiretsu" problem by the Fair Trade Commission. 8) Deciding quantitatively measureable shares for U.S. insurance companies. 9) The United States will not apply sanctions despite an inability to achieve share expansion within the prescribed time period. 10) The share of foreign companies in Japan is 2 percent, but the share of foreign companies in the other G-7 nations is at a double-digit level. 11) The reason for the failure of Japan's insurance businesses in foreign nations is their lack of competence. Later, a reporter asked: "You stated that you do not intend to present figures indicating what the proper shares are for foreign companies, and that no sanctions would be applied in the event of a failure to achieve the numerical targets. What will you do if the Japan market fails to change? The official replied in a flexible tone: "The United States intends to reserve evoking Article 301 of the trade act (punitive measures against unfair trade practices). The reason is that a new insurance market will probably be created in line with the Insurance Council's report, and such a situation will probably not arise in view of the Hosokawa cabinet's priority emphasis on easing controls." However, questions were asked repeatedly by the reporters as to whether the United States was optimistic about achieving a double-digit share, and how many years it expected it would require. In reply, the U.S. senior official said that "it would probably require a medium to long term." Subsequently, however, he revealed that he expected it to take three to four years. In addition, despite his statement at the outset that sanctions would not be applied against Japan, the nuance of his later reply changed to suggest that, "if agreement on shares cannot be reached, the U.S. side would unilaterally decide on numerical targets, and evocation of the trade act is also possible." At the meeting, the items directly related to policy were limited to the induction of a broker system and "keiretsu" trading.
