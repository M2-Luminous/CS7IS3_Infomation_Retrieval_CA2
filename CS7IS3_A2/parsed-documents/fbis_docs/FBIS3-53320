The spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry, in referring to the final statement of the Damascus session, described as a repetition of UAE's baseless claims, what has been set forth in the statement. At the same time he reiterated Iran's readiness to continue dialogue with the UAE for resolving the dispute. Indisputably in the opinion of political observers, the dispute between Iran and the UAE over the Iranian islands, due to the assertion of baseless claims by the UAE, has drawn attention of some Arab states of the Persian Gulf region and participants in the Damascus session. Hence before being based on realities, it is an issue that has been asserted in line with the regional developments and for the sake of holding of sessions by the Arab states. Obviously such a trend cannot be construed as indicative of the real stand of the UAE. This very point has again been refuted by the spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry. The spokesman expressed regret over the fact that the UAE's Government, while stressing bilateral talks to remove misunderstanding between the two states, has not taken any practical steps in this regard. At any rate, as explained in the comments of Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, the officials of Iran's Islamic Republic system have constantly stressed the principle of good neighborliness and removal of differences through negotiations. At present too, they, similar to the past, have announced their readiness for holding talks with the UAE authorities. But these efforts can attain the desired result only when the UAE officials reciprocate this good intention with a positive response. Hence UAE authorities, to bolster friendship, good neighborliness, and regional stability must show a positive response in practice based on realism and devoid of any impacts arising from passive stance adopted by such sessions as the Damascus meeting.
