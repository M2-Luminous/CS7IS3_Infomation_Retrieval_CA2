"Under the capable leadership of President Berisha, during the past two years Albania became a country with a positive influence in the Balkans." Regarding the possible expansion of the conflict in Kosova, Mr. Demirel said: "I think such a thing will not happen." As regards the stand of Turkey in case of a spillover of the conflict in Kosova, Mr. Demirel said that "we shall give our support for Kosova and Albania." Questioned about the Greek embargo against Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Mr. Demirel said that it causes a definitive damage to the stability in the Balkans. According to the Turkish president, the creation of the Moslem-Croatian federal state is a step towards peace, while he described as meaningless the Serbian stand against the creation of such a state. With regard to the opposition by Greece, Bulgaria or some other country to the dispatch of Turkish troops in Bosnia as part of the UN peace-keeping forces, President Demirel pointed out that "it is quite difficult to understand the stand by our neighbours. In fact we have not sent Turkish troops in the Balkans. United Nations are asking for Turkish soldiers, because there is a need there for soldiers to establish peace, and Turkish soldiers will go there to defend peace. I do not understand why does this matter become a subject of opposition," Mr. Demirel stressed. In his interview, Mr. Demirel described as "excellent" the level of Albanian-Turkish relations, adding that they will also continue to be excellent in the future. "I wish the fraternal Albanian people good fortune, prosperity, happiness and peace. May God be with us!," Turkish president said at the end of his interview.
