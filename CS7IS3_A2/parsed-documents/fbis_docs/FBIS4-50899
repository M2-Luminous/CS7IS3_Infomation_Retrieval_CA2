Accompanied by minister Wu Yi of foreign trade and economic cooperation and Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin, Li Lanqing inspected the trade fair on the eve of its closing. He visited trading pavilions, viewed transactions, met with various trade delegation heads, and attended a discussion with officials in charge of foreign trade and economic cooperation in various provinces and municipalities. He also made an important speech. Li Lanqing said: The latest Guangzhou export commodity trade fair is quite refreshing with its display of a great variety of commodities, which is a direct result of the introduction of competitive mechanisms and enhancement of competitive awareness by reforms in recent years. The trial implementation, since the beginning of this year, of compensated bidding on the 13 kinds of export commodities has yielded fruitful results at the trade fair. This major reform program, which is aimed at promoting fairness, has solved, to some extent, problems related to panic buying of high-priced goods and dumping, and should be boldly introduced to other commodities. In introduing more competitive mechanisms for the next trade fair, we should implement the system of "organizing trade delegations by provinces and municipalities, setting up pavilions by chambers of commerce, combining delegations with pavilions, and assigning exhibit arrangements to various associations of trade." In this way, we can bring into play the roles and advantages of provinces and municipalities, chambers of commerce, and associations of trade -- chambers of commerce in particular -- and can ensure a good job in setting up pavilions. This will be an effective way of managing the trade fair and of making things convenient for visiting businessmen. He pointed out: This year is a crucial one for deepening reforms in China. We have introduced a series of major reform programs, and the operation of new systems has in general proceeded smoothly. Departments in charge of foreign trade and economic cooperation should make ample use of the positive results achieved through reform programs and should, needless to say, pay attention to improving any imperfections whenever found. They should coordinate with the relevant departments in taking effective measures to prevent foreign businessmen from using the trade fair to force China's export commodity prices down and domestic exporters from driving up prices unreasonably, thereby causing serious consequences of rising costs caused by foreign exchange conversion. He said: We should reform foreign trade enterprises and should develop internationalized, industrialized, and comprehensive trading companies. In developing internationalized companies, attention must be paid to standardizing operations. We should continue to promote the reform aimed at introducing a modern system to foreign trade companies and should allow workers and staff of selected enterprises to hold a limited amount of company shares strictly according to the State Council's relevant regulations. Enterprises experimenting with this pilot project must follow standards and must have the approval for the pilot project. It is necessary to pay attention to summarizing experiences and correcting mistakes in good time so as to further harness the initiative of foreign trade enterprise workers and staff, to increase their cohesive power, to prevent losses of state-owned assets, and to maintain and increase their values, thereby bringing into further play the leading role and advantages of state-owned foreign trade enterprises. Li Lanqing also discussed issues related to improvement of the investment environment and training of multi-purpose economic and trade personnel. Yu Xiaosong, vice minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and Qian Guanlin, director of the General Administration of Customs, inspected the trade fair together with the state commission.
