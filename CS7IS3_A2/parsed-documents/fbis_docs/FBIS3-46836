FBIS3-46836 "dreas004__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Defense Agency Decides on New Defense Concept OW0501214894 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 31 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0501214894 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Defense Agency has decided on a new defense concept which will replace the "Outline of the Defense Program" as the basic defense policy for Japan. The key point of the concept is that Japan will seek to strengthen its missile defense system, looking toward the theater missile defense (TMD) system being developed by the United States to deal with ballistic missiles. The concept also looks at the question of Japan's international contributions, such as participation in UN peacekeeping operations (PK0). With respect to the organization of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF], it proposes reducing the number of ground personnel to less than 150,000. Thus, the agency wants to depart from its past strategy of attaching importance to the northern areas and of assuming Russia to be a hostile nation. It also proposes putting the three services of the SDF -- ground, naval, and air force -- under a combined operations system. In the spring, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to activate a private advisory panel charged with studying the new defense concept. For its part, the Defense Agency is studying the concept of maintaining "basic defense capabilities" wherein the defense capabilities in peacetime are contained at a minimum, but can be reinforced in case of emergency. In other words, Japan's defense capabilities should be lowered when disarmament makes progress throughout the world and when the factors of instability diminish in surrounding countries. Specifically in reference to the defense system, the key point of the concept lies in its measures against missiles. When the current "Outline" was adopted in 1976, there was no threat to Japan from medium-range ballistic missiles; hence, the air-defense measures were drawn up assuming an invasion by aircraft only. However, since then the DPRK (North Korea) has successfully test-fired its "Nodong-1" missile, which Japan has no capabilities to counter. As such, Japan now wants to state its needs in the new defense concept, and improve its interception system. It is not yet certain whether Japan will provide technological cooperation to the U.S. TMD project. In the future, it wants to adopt an interceptor missile system like the "THAAD" [Theater High Altitude Area Defense"] system which is far, far superior to the Patriot missile. Provisions on the SDF's participation in PKO activities are currently presented in a clause under the heading of miscellaneous rules within Article 100 of the SDF Law. There have been complaints saying "the troops' morale cannot be high when they are employed under miscellaneous rules." Hence, the agency wants to upgrade PKO missions in the law to the level of primary missions by removing the provisions in Article 3 which set forth the missions of the SDF. That being the case, the agency also finds it necessary to make a clear statement on this point in the new defense concept.
