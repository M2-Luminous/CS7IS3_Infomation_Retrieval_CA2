The prime minister was addressing a seminar on Central Asia as part of deliberations of the World Economic Forum. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan is ideally situated in the region to promote economic cooperation in the area. [Begin Bhutto recording] Pakistan is placed at an exciting geographical location, and Pakistan had always enjoyed its own sense of strategic importance. Previously, it enjoyed its importance because of the Cold War and the fact that it was bordering the communist state -- the Soviet Union. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union a new world emerged, new opportunities emerged for us in Pakistan. Because it paved the way for us to reestablish our links which had historically existed with the Central Asian republics. So, we are seeking to build our regional links with the Central Asian republics not only in diplomatic terms or commercial terms, but we are also seeking to build these links in communication terms. Pakistan is an important country because Pakistan is the gateway to different regional groupings. One, Pakistan is a gateway to South Asia, and in fact, Pakistan is also a member of the South Asian association of regional countries. Pakistan is situated right in the center, where to one side we have South Asia, to another side we have the Persian Gulf, and yet to another side we have Central Asia. And that is why we feel that in today's world, Pakistan is an important center for potential investors because any investment in Pakistan can be rerouted in three different directions. So, Pakistan is a gateway to three very important trading areas and potential market. [end recording] Economic policies of the government offer better opportunities for foreign investors which will in turn help promote economic stability in the region. The president of Turkey, Mr. Suleyman Demirel; president of Turkmenistan; president of Kazakhstan; and president of Uzbekistan also addressed the seminar.
