The new organization will consist of cabinet ministers instead of vice administrative ministers, as was formerly the case with the OTO. The prime minister will serve as chief of the new body. The upgrading of the OTO is in line with a proposal made last December by a government advisory panel that the OTO be expanded to deal more efficiently with trade complaints.
