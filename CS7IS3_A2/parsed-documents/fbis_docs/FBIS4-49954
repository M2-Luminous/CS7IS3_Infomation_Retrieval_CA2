The total value of our province's import and export trade in this quarter amounted to about $16.2 billion. Both imports and exports increased by more than 20 percent over the same period last year, with a favorable import balance of $150 million, thus putting an end to last year's export deficit situation. In export-volume terms, Shenzhen ranked first among other cities in the province, with an export volume of $3.1 billion; Guangzhou ranked second, with an export volume of close to $1.1 billion, and Dongguan City ranked third, with an export volume of $1 billion. Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Guangzhou were the three top importing cities in our province. In Guangdong's foreign trade, exports exceeded imports in the first quarter of this year, indicating that after the state unified exchange rates this year, import demand, which has remained high for many years, had been initially alleviated. Meanwhile, as state export encouragement measures, such as duty refunds, were further implemented, general export trade began to bottom out and gained upward momentum.
