According to President Martti Ahtisaari it is important that the EU develops in the interests of its citizens. Speaking a little while ago in Corfu at the signing ceremony of the new members of the EU, President Ahtisaari thought that the greatest challenge is for the EU to develop in line with the citizens' wishes. This is Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari's speech in its entirety: [Begin Ahtisaari recording] Honored chairman of the Council of Europe, honored chairman of the Commission, honored chairman of the European Parliament, honored ladies and gentlemen. I have great pleasure in witnessing this historic signing ceremony. This is an important day, not only for Finland and the other countries seeking membership but also for the history of the whole of Europe. We have today taken a considerable step in strengthening the economic and political integration of our continent. I want to express a warm thank you on behalf of the Finnish Government to you, Mr. Prime Minister, on the resolute work the EU under the presidency of Greece has carried out in bringing the Finnish membership negotiations to a positive conclusion. I also want to thank other member countries of the Union, the Commission, and the secretariat of the Union for the respect shown toward Finland during the negotiations. We greatly appreciate that the European Parliament, with a great majority, approved our membership. The negotiations result reached will offer a good basis for Finland's membership in the EU. In order to take care -- without big problems -- of the changes the membership will bring, especially in the countryside and in the outlying regions in Finland, the Finnish Government has made a decision on national measures that will soften the current changes and make the long-term adaptation easier. Debate among citizens on membership in the EU has been lively in Finland. The debate has brought up, among other things, the citizens' concerns about the right to take part, about the preservation of the Nordic way of life, and about environmental protection. The EU is a central factor in strengthening the security of our continent. The security will be enhanced by social responsibility, interaction between people, respect of human rights and economic well being. This kind of Europe does not have economic or social divisions but all states have equal rights to take part in the integration development. The expansion of the Union supports the positive development of the stability of the whole continent. Finland supports the Union's economic and political aims. Finland's membership would strengthen the northern dimension of the Union, I am convinced that this would give the Union extra strength both economically and politically. It is very important that the Union will develop to benefit its citizens, according to their conditions. This is the great challenge in developing the EU in the future. [passage omitted] As a member of the EU, Finland wants to give its contribution toward its' development. We see the future of the Union as a tolerant and secure community bringing together the nations and citizens of the whole continent, where every citizen of the Union feels that the Union is his or her own. [end recording] [Announcer] This was President Martti Ahtisaari. [passage omitted] The EU membership documents were signed on Finland's behalf by Prime Minister Esko Aho, Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, and Secretary of State Veli Sundbaeck. The signing means that Finland will become an active partner in the EU's work, however, without the authority to make decisions so far. The change will show in the fact that in the first session of the Corfu summit in the early afternoon, President Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Aho will sit at the summit table with the leaders of the EU countries. It seems so far that President Ahtisaari will have one bilateral meeting at the Corfu summit. He will have talks in the afternoon with Austrian President Thomas Klestil. [passage omitted]
