Today I want to tell you how we plan to move towards that objective. Improving air quality is not an abstract, theoretical matter. It is a concern for large numbers of our citizens and an important commitment of the government. Much has already been achieved. On new cars, for example, stringent exhaust emission standards now mean that catalysts are a standard feature. And new diesel vehicles emit substantially less smoke than we have become used to seeing in the past. All existing vehicles are now checked for emissions in the annual test to make sure that they are kept in a good state of tune. We also have a comprehensive system for control of industrial air pollution which the establishment of the Environment Agency will further strengthen. These measures mean that we have seen a progressive improvement in the quality of our air which should continue over the next decade. But new concerns are emerging. As increasing evidence becomes available of possible links between air pollution and respiratory disease, we need to continue to question whether enough is being done and then to identify areas where further improvements can be made. To set out the way forward I shall shortly publish a consultation paper as the basis for a strategy to be published in the Autumn. But Let Me Outline Now What I Believe Should Be the Key Elements. First, Air Quality Standards We must move quickly to get a comprehensive set of health-related air quality standards in place. In some areas, it may be some years before ambitious targets can be achieved. But what is important is that we must know where sustainability lies. We must know what acceptable air quality is so that we can plan accordingly. There are some standards already in place and we should build upon those. I recognise also that the European Community is likely to bring forward proposals over the next year or two. But I do not believe we can wait. We must move ahead and link with our European partners in due course. We have already made some progress, notably with work on benzene and ozone this year. More will follow rapidly over the coming months. Second, Local Air Quality Management In our paper we shall review the national policies, particularly emission controls and economic instruments, which should help us move progressively toward national targets. But air is inevitably also a local matter, on which there must be local action. In areas where air quality is particularly at risk, we need to be able to coordinate our controls over domestic, industrial and vehicle emissions to secure the most cost effective improvements. Local authorities, the new Environment Agency and other bodies will have a part to play here. We need to draw on the strengths of our local planning system. When air pollution episodes arise we need to be sure people can be informed, not only so that they can take defensive action where necessary, but also so that they can act in a sensible way in their use of vehicles and other sources of pollution. In short, we must get to grips with the need locally to manage our air quality. Third, The Role of the Car is Critical Exhaust emissions are the source of most air pollution in our urban areas. John MacGregor and I are at one in the pursuit of a sustainable future for transport which takes account of people's aspirations for access, the crucial economic significance of transport, and its wide impact on all aspects of the environment. Important among these is air quality. Long term planning and transport policies will make a contribution here. But we recognise that in the shorter term, over the next few years, transport may also need to play a greater part. We are looking urgently at the scope for further tightening of vehicle emission limits from around the year 2000, to build on the measures already taken and the stringent limits to be introduced after l996. We also recognise the need for further action on smoky vehicles, where there may be scope for better targeting of resources to deal with this particularly visible problem. These can all play a part in developing the effective management of air quality. We believe that it is also time to get a better understanding of the effect that local traffic measures have on air quality so that those effects can be better taken into account, and the potential role of such schemes in improving air quality can be explored. I know that some local authorities are already beginning to explore these issues themselves. With progress on these fronts, I do not see a need for substantial traffic bans in our urban areas. We do not face problems on the scale of Athens and Rome. Nor is it clear that there is a need here to take the powers, taken for example in Germany, to restrict movement by vehicles without catalysts during pollution episodes, although that is something we should keep under review. What is clear is that we must take sensible and practical steps in relation to vehicle regulation and management to protect air quality, so that we can avoid the need for more draconian measures which could significantly inhibit personal mobility and economic activity in our urban areas.
