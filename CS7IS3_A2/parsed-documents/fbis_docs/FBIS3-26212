Present at the party were Peng Chong, vice chairman of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee; Yuan Qitong, Su Changpei, Liu Yongye, Zhang Mingjun, and Song Jun, vice chairmen of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee; leading comrades of the fifth, sixth, and seventh provincial people's congress standing committees; and retired cadres at and above the departmental level from subordinate organs of the provincial people's congress. They happily gathered together to usher in the Spring Festival. You Dexin, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference provincial committee, attended the tea party. Yuan Qitong presided over the party and, on behalf of the provincial people's congress standing committee, extended New Year's greetings to old comrades present at the party. Amid warm applause, Comrade Peng Chong aired his view on the issue of the development of democracy and the legal system. He said: Developing a high degree of socialist democracy and a sound socialist legal system is our long-termn strategic task. To be sure, democracy is important, but it must be regulated by law and be put on a systematic basis. Without a legal system there will be no democracy. In particular, without a legal system, we will not be able to achieve our goal of establishing a socialist market economy. Peng Chong said: The Fujian Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee has done a great deal of work in local legislation, playing an important role in promoting and defending reform, opening up, and economic construction, as well as social stability. It is necessary to heighten the sense of the legal system, adhere to the principle of acting according to the law, strictly enforce laws, intensify supervision over implementation of laws, and take effective measures to eliminate corruption and other ugly phenomena in the community. Old comrades, including Cheng Xu, Zan Fumin, Wen Xiushan, Wang Zhe, and Zhang Yumin, also addressed the tea party.
