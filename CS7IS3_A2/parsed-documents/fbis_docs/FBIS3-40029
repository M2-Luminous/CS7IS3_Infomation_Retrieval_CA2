It is up to The Voters to Decide'" -- first three paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] [Text] Rome -- [League Secretary] Bossi wants to eat up Forza Italia and restore the League's supremacy, as long as he still has time. [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is being snobbish. He joined forces with the Bandwagon [League nickname], but is keen to explain that the only thing he and the Senator [Bossi nickname] have in common is the purity of their Lombard origins, which amounts to very little, not to say practically nothing. A prudent Knight [Berlusconi nickname] would like to use the National Alliance [AN] as an "external" prop for a possible government formed jointly with the Bandwagon -- a fairly close prop, but not too close. Fini, for his part, is keeping Bossi at a distance, thus cordially returning the latter's feelings. He defined Bossi as being "unreliable," in addition to geographically limited. Is strife not excessive within the liberty-inspired alignment? Gianfranco Fini, as one of its members, asserted that the exchange of poisons was "physiological" in nature. Will the AN actually be excluded from the government in the event of a victory, as Berlusconi predicts? The MSI [Italian Social Movement] secretary dodged the provocation, but his reply was also a warning of a sort: "It is the voters who are dealing the cards." Voters, not Bossi or Berlusconi. [LA REPUBBLICA] Deputy Fini, you are saying that the center is crumbling to pieces, and that the right is the only "national and winning" alternative to the left. Would you agree that there is a bit too much tension among you? What sort of impression are you giving the voters? [Fini] Disagreements are typical of electoral campaigns. There has been a tough exchange of rhetoric between Bossi and Berlusconi, but not everything is going smoothly for [PDS Secretary] Occhetto and [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti either. [LA REPUBBLICA] Is the exchange of pleasantries nbetween you and Bossi also part of the preelection ritual dance? [Fini] No, the situation is different between us. It is not just by chance that we decided to run in all the northern constituencies. Bossi has ignored two problems that we initially posed to him: national identity and the need for solidarity within the country. By doing so, he has taken on a very serious responsibility. [LA REPUBBLICA] How can such a troubled alliance lead to any positive results? [Fini] It is up to the voters to decide. Strong support for the AN will enable us to uphold the principles we believe in. [LA REPUBBLICA] [Northern League lower house floor leader] Roberto Maroni was already complacently commenting on the Berlusconian scenario whereby you would be propping up the government from the outside. [Fini] I am totally indifferent to what Maroni thinks or says. I see no difficulty. We have not entered into any agreement with the League. [LA REPUBBLICA] However, it is Berlusconi who envisages you outside. [Fini] There are no issues capable of causing tough rhetoric. [LA REPUBBLICA] The Knight, however, seems to be a bit embarrassed by certain candidates such as Bontempo, known as the federalist. [Fini] Berlusconi knows very well that giving birth to an electoral alliance means joining forces. I believe that Berlusconi's possible comments or reservations simply stem from the current competitive mood. The proportional voting system automatically pushes parties to safeguard their own identity in relation to their allies. [LA REPUBBLICA] When push comes to shove, will you be inside or outside the government? [Fini] I do not think anyone can now afford to rush ahead of events.
