In an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency, Koleshikov stressed, "all kinds of the Russian armed forces without exception will be reorganized in the near future for the purpose of the reduction of the Army." However, he continued, so far the Defense Ministry is not prepared "to switch over to a different structural system," he believed that any reorganization inevitably entails the destruction of the command system which cannot be allowed. The colonel-general also said Russia plans to have about thirty military bases in other former Soviet republics, some of the bases would be created from the existing Russian divisions deployed in some of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) republics, such as the 201th Division in Tajikistan. In other places, as for instance in Azerbaijan, the base would be created around anti-missile warning systems, Koleshikov said. He said Russia plans no military bases in Ukraine, where the Black Sea Fleet will have its special status, he did not exclude that Russia's 14th Army in Moldova's breakaway Dniester region will also be reorganized into a military base, but added that it well could be pulled out. According to the chief of General Staff, almost all the republics of the former Soviet Union have themselves expressed willingness to have Russian military bases on their territory. The three Baltic states are an exception, the colonel-general pointed out.
