He stressed several times that the Partnership is an open formula and its content "depends on our activity." If there are certain limitations "they are in the sphere of our possibilities and not expectations or willingness." He pointed out to the significance of the participation of Russia in this programme. According to Pawlak, "these two days (Tuesday and Wednesday) are of utmost importance for Poland. Yesterday, the association treaty between Poland and the European Union came into force. Today I had the opportunity and the pleasure to sign at the NATO headquarters a document that starts the Partnership for Peace procedure. Poland's contacts with the West are acquairing new dymanic," he added. Addressing the participants in the ceremony, as earlier while he was speaking to parliamentarians, Waldemar Pawlak appealed for "the partnership for development" suggesting that the scheme will add closer cooperation to the NATO programme. Earlier in the day, the prime minister met with leader of the European Parliament Egon Klepsch, and replied to questions asked by members of the European Parliament concerning the Phare programme and Poland's relations with her Eastern neighbours. The prime minister declared that Poland is striving to have the best possible relations with them but her efforts are hampered by the unstable situation in Russia and Ukraine. Between the meeting with parliamentarians and the signing of the Partnership for Peace programme, Waldemar Pawlak was received by Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. In the evening he met with representatives of Polish community at the Polish Consulate General in Brussels. Later on, he was the dinner guest of organizers of the Thursday international conference on Polish affairs.
