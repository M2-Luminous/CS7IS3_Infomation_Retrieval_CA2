The nation now has over 100,000 commodity markets of all descriptions, and the ubiquitous spot markets and specialized markets in urban and rural areas are playing an important role in the national economic development. According to statistics, the nation has now 53 national commodity trade centers and large wholesale markets; over 76,000 urban and rural trade markets, including 1,600 wholesale markets of agricultural and sideline products; and over 3,000 small industrial goods trade markets, including 400 wholesale markets. These markets have created a primary network of all kinds of markets at all levels. While a main framework comprising primary, regional, and national markets has been formed for grain trade, a structure made up of large, medium, and small markets around wholesale markets has been created for vegetable and fruit distribution. Under this structure, markets in areas of production, transshipment, and consumption are coordinated. For industrial consumer goods, in addition to all kinds of wholesale markets, there are also meetings for trade negotiations, commodity trade fairs, and markets which also provide storage services and engage in wholesale and retail businesses. Chain stores have appeared in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other large and medium cities. The traditional integrated and spot markets of capital goods are gradually developing into specialized markets engaging in intermediate and long-range contract trade, and they are gradually becoming major avenues of resource distribution. As most of China's capital goods and means of livelihood are being distributed through nationwide networks of commodity markets, market regulation is gradually expanding both in scope and proportion. Currently 90 percent of industrial consumer goods and 85 percent of capital goods are sold at prices determined by market supply and demand. Meanwhile, collective and independent enterprises have joined supply and marketing organs and networks of state-owned distributors and producers in demonstrating their abilities in the sphere of distribution. This has created a distribution pattern characterized by the distribution of all types of commodities and services through all kinds of channels. While state-owned distributors are fully market-oriented, enterprises in charge of supplies have geared over 90 percent of their operations to market forces. Commodity markets' trading and management are beginning to be standardized and institutionalized. The management of the large trade centers and large wholesale markets by administrative committees, boards of directors, and boards of supervisors has expedited the commodity markets' healthy development.
