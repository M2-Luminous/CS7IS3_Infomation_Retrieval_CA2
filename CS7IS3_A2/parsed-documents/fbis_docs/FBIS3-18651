The aim is to develop the language, culture, and minority rights of the old and new Russians. The reform of civic rights that is being discussed in parliament mentions small minority groups such as Jews and Tatars. During the preparation of the language rights paragraph that is to be included in the constitution, the Somalis were discussed, but there was no talk of the Russians in Finland. According to a researcher of minority rights, a mention of the Russians would have been appropriate. Tapani Leisti reports: [Leisti] According to the Central Statistical Office, a few years ago, there were just over 9,000 Russian speakers in Finland. The number is rising; the highest unofficial figure is about 20,000. It is estimated that some 3,000 of those are descendants of Russians who settled in Finland in the last century and at the turn of the century, i.e., old Russians. The old Russians have integrated well into the majority. Those who have arrived from the territory of the former Soviet Union since the 1950's are new Russians. The old Russians, who have remained quiet, seem to be waking up as a result of the changes in Russia and the new Russians. A report by a working group of Russians in Finland was completed last spring. The aim is, among other things, to bring about the official recognition of the Russian-speaking minority and to set up a representative body like the consultative committees on Lapp and Romany affairs. The report has been sent to many ministries. Minority languages are gaining recognition in the reform of civil rights in the Constitution that is currently being discussed in parliament. In addition to the national languages of Finnish and Swedish, under the government's proposal, the paragraph on language rights will also include the indigenous Lapp people and the Romanies, who have lived in Finland for hundreds of years. The explanatory memorandum on the paragraph mentions the Jews and Tatars as other minority groups that have been resident in Finland for a long time. During the course of drafting the law, Somali refugees came up, but there was no talk of the Russian speakers. [passage omitted] Eugen Novitsky, member of the working group of Russians in Finland, says this about the explanations for the language rights paragraph. [Begin Novitsky recording] Naturally, this matter has its own historic background. We must note today that, if and when we regard the Swedish language as a national language, then the first foreign language today is the Russian language -- if we count the population that uses or would like to use and preserve that language. For this reason, the working group thinks that, after studies, official and stronger recognition, as well as a position, should be accorded to the Russian language in our country. [end recording] [Leisti] Novitsky says that a meeting will be convened next month to set up a representative body to champion the rights of the Russian-speakers as a citizens' organization. There is no internationally binding definition of minorities. There is an agreement between Finland and Russia under which Finland must protect languages of the Russian language group and Russia must protect Finno-Ugric languages on their territories.
