Lewandowski said that the strikes were taking place in a variety of forms. The protest action is to draw attention to the financial problems of employees and their families. The teams from the raw material departments have not discontinued the technological processes so as not to make the financial situation of their steelworks even worse. The strike action has been joined by the workers of the Bankowa, Zawiercie, Baildon, Batory, Bobrek, and 1 Maja steelworks, among others. At the Katowice steelworks, the protest action had been limited to collecting money for the strike fund, Renata Bytomska, the steelworks press spokeswoman, told PAP.
