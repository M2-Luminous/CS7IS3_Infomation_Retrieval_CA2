This is something even a kindergartener understands. However, if I tell you that someone beat up a popsicle seller because he was refused a popsicle for paying only 40 fen, what will you think? Not long ago something similar to this happened. Although it was not a quarrel about a popsicle, it is similar. According to a Beijing newspaper report, on the night of 20 October, three people allegedly having nothing wrong with their nerves took a taxi to Changcheng Hotel. They should pay 74 yuan as the meter read, but they paid only 50 yuan in foreign exchange certificates. The driver, of course, refused the money, but they threw the money on the ground and began to beat up the driver. A hotel security guard stepped forward to mediate, but was beaten and kicked too. In the end, five people were wounded. Throughout the incident, they shouted abuse and kept yelling: "We are Americans!" I was astonished to hear that two of the three were women. The report said that the two women "fiercely kicked the driver," "turned around and slapped someone else on the face" and "rudely grabbed his private parts." This reminds people of Detective Hunter's partner McCall, the difference being only that those who were beaten were not drug addicts or murderers, but law-abiding Chinese civilians. I have not conducted a special study of the United States or Americans, but I studied some history when I was at school and know that in the past some foreigners, both military and nonmilitary, had been to China; now there are also foreigners coming to China for visits, sightseeing, business purposes, sports competitions, and putting on shows. However, one cannot ride roughshod over others because he or she is an "American." If this had happened in the past, it would not have been surprising; but if someone still behaves in such an overbearing or hegemonist way, this probably is something incomprehensible. I suspect that these three Americans have the same organs in their bodies as others. Otherwise, why are they so widely different from others? People around the world should be like brothers and respect each other, but there are some people who like to show their arrogance. They say they take much account of civilization, equality, and human rights, but what they have done is inglorious. According to reports, Chinese being humiliated, abused, and beaten frequently happens. This makes me ask another question: Is it that some of us have doted on these foreigners too much? In the Changcheng Hotel incident, there was a 2.07-meter-tall security guard whose "chest was beaten" and "private parts kicked," but he did not return a blow, showing utmost endurance. Did this awaken those people who dare not stand upright in the presence of foreigners or think that the moon in a foreign country is rounder than that in China? I cannot answer this question. The last part of the report on the Changcheng Hotel incident said that the public security department had handled the matter. The three Americans "expressed their regret" and said that they would "abide by Chinese law" in the future and "were willing to accept punishment." However, I would like to know this: What were the details of the punishment? How much compensation did those who were beaten receive for their "medical expenses," as well as "material and spiritual losses"? Were they satisfied with the way the incident was handled? Some people may say that because the Americans admitted their mistakes, there was no need to bring up these "details," but I think the reporter who filed the report should not have skirted around this point. Will our readers think that I am making a fuss over a trifle?
