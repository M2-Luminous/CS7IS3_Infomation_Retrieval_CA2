The first sphere includes a reply to the question of whether the HZDS prefers early elections or a referendum: [Meciar] "Basically, there are various circumstances. It is possible that we will agree with some of the parliamentary parties so that we will have 90 votes in the parliament to adopt a constitutional law on early elections--and, in that case, there is no need to have a referendum on this question. "Another alternative may arise, which is basically being prepared by the opposition, who were for immediately calling early elections, but now, when it seems to them that they could have a majority in the National Council, they postpone this immediately by one year. [words indistinct] in this case, there are 350,000 citizens going for the referendum, who I assume will support such initiative. "The referendum is connected with yet another question--with the right of the deputies to preserve an absolute mandate even after they denounced the program with which they went into the elections, even after they denounced the right that ensues for them from the election law. And that is also the question that the citizens should decide in a referendum. "As to the period up to the early elections, I think they should take place soon. Personally, I think that the election period of the parliament should be shortened to one-half. The bridging of this time is necessary and suitable. Naturally, this will not lead to instability. In fact, it aids stability because only those who really want to work in the government will be in it, and not those who spend half of their working hours trying to work out how to discredit them." [Bazlikova] Asked whether Vladimir Meciar wants to go to the elections as prime minister or as the head of the opposition party, the HZDS chairman said: [Meciar] "It is up to the parliament, not up to me. In no circumstances do I intend to resign." [Bazlikova] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar characterized the possible early elections as follows: [Meciar] "As to the early elections, I think that this time the elections will include three large groupings: The HZDS will be in the center of one group, the Party of Democratic Left [SDL] will be in the center of another, and the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] will be in the center of the third. The decision about the results of the elections will be made between the three. The SDL assumes that, if a party of similar leanings wins the elections in Poland and probably will win them in Hungary, it is its duty to win in Slovakia. We are doing all we can not to fulfill this party's hopes." [Bazlikova] The journalists also wondered whether the prime minister assumed that the Slovak Parliament will dismiss his Cabinet as early as at the meeting that will continue next week: [Meciar] "As to the possibility of expressing no confidence in the government--that always exists. In any case, whoever attempts to do so must count on our reaction." [Bazlikova] Asked whether he could indicate what this reaction would be, the prime minister said unequivocally: [Meciar] "No." [Bulakova] The second part of the news conference, after the extraordinary meeting of the republican leadership of the HZDS in Modra yesterday, concerned the next moves against those who initiated the Alternative of Political Realism, especially against two members of the government--Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. This is how Vladimir Meciar responded to the possibility of their dismissal. [Meciar] "It is a test of character. Both Dolgos [former privatization minister] and Kucera [former education minister] themselves asked to be recalled and resigned after the vote of no-confidence in them was passed. They knew what their moral duty was. For Moravcik and Kovac, it is a character test, a test of their realization of what is their moral duty. They should be given a chance to express themselves." [Bulakova] In connection with the dismissal of these two government members, the issue of who will replace them came about. Commenting on this problem, Vladimir Meciar said, among other things: [Meciar] "The issue of their replacement is a matter for a coalition agreement. To be honest, until the [republican] leadership passed its decision [on Moravcik and Kovac], I discussed with nobody whether this replacement could be dealt with in some other way." [passage omitted] [Bulakova] General questions were also voiced at the meeting between the prime minister and journalists yesterday. One of them concerned the assessment of the balance of political forces in the Slovak Parliament. Speaking about this issue, Vladimir Meciar said, among other things: [Meciar] "Everyone has an axe to grind. For example, Hungarian parties and Cernak [chairman of Slovak National Party], or the Christian Democratic Party and the Party of the Democratic Left. The parliament cannot carry out its work. It is incapable of agreeing on anything other than issues directed against the government and on the division of assets. "A very dangerous precedent could arise as a result of the structure [government of broad coalition] they want to set up in this way. Everyone must have thought that the HZDS response would be that the HZDS would split up and that it would be the Hungarian political parties that would tip the balance of power with regard to the stability of the government. Their policy is widely known nowadays. Although the government, whose intention is to work against us, would have votes, it would be incapable of action. But if this government did not have these votes, it would fall because the opposition, including the HZDS, would have a clear majority. Unless, of course, they accept the Hungarians into the government coalition. [passage omitted] "But if they accept them into the coalition, they will have to meet their demands. And you know what these demands are directed at! From this you can judge what Slovakia's future development would be like!" [Bulakova] At the conclusion of the news conference, there was a question whether--in quotation marks--the dropping out of people from the HZDS was not a consequence of the fact that the movement had delayed turning itself into a political party with a clear political structure and ideological objectives. Answering this question, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said, among other things: [Meciar] "This is not a dropping out; this is a cleansing process. Because only that which is diseased, which does not believe in itself, drops out. And that is good. The path of honesty is the best path. The path of intrigues, of decomposition, of social structures is a path leading nowhere. One can only score one victory this way. But, at the same time, such a victory amounts to a political defeat. The movement's structures have been cleansed, and all of its components are capable of carrying out normal political work."
