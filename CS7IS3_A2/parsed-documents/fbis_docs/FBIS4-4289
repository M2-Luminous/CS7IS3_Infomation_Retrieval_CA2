At the invitation of the governments of Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark and the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate of Belgium, Li will pay official goodwill visits to the five countries from May 2 to 21. During the meeting, Li and the diplomats exchanged views on the furthering of China's ties with these five countries. Li expressed thanks to these countries for their careful arrangements of the visits. "This will be the first trip to Europe by a CPPCC chairman," Li told the four ambassadors and one minister-counsellor, saying he is looking forward to the visit and the contacts with leaders of the five governments and parliaments as well as peoples of these countries. The visit is aimed at enhancing mutual understanding, expanding exchanges and strengthening cooperation between China and the five countries, he noted. China and these countries maintain good ties, which have been furthered in the past few years. High-level contacts have been on the rise and the economic, trade, scientific and technological cooperation and cultural exchanges have borne new fruit, he said. The two-way trade volume between China and the five countries has increased by a big margin, he added, voicing the hope that potentials be tapped to further expand trade and economic cooperation. The five countries have plenty of advanced science and technology and management expertise that China should draw from, he said. China and the five countries have no conflicts of fundamental interests and share much common ground on the maintenance of peace and promoting common development, he noted. China is ready to further develop its ties with the five countries on the principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit. "The CPPCC is willing to make new efforts for the promotion of the existing friendly ties between China and the five European countries," he said. Denmark Ambassador to China William Friis-Moller expressed his welcome to Li's visit on behalf of the five countries' diplomats. The visit has drawn attention from the governments and peoples of the five countries, he said. He expressed the hope that the visit will deepen mutual understanding, promote the development of bilateral ties and provide a chance for the five governments and parliaments to know more about China.
