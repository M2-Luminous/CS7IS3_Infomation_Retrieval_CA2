At the same time, however, we have no choice but to act within the scope of the Constitution." However, he avoided to comment on the issue of the Self-Defense Forces' support activities, such as providing supplies to the U.S. military's naval blockade, saying: "Since I am a member of the government, I have to be careful about this issue." On the government's policy that use of the right of collective self-defense is contrary to the Constitution, Kumagai said that "there is no need to change the interpretation of previous administrations." Moreover, on the coalition's policy to do its best to enact a rezoning bill for the single-seat and proportionate representation system by having discussions during the current Diet session, Kumagai said: "We quite agree with this idea." He stressed that the bill should be approved even if the government has to extend the Diet session.
