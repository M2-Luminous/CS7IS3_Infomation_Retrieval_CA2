These proposals include a host of general principles, but they do not address the depth of the withdrawal from the Golan or its timetable. The draft proposals speak about peaceful relations, security arrangements, and normalization of ties. However, these proposals do not include a pledge of full withdrawal. They call for open borders, economic relations, a search for water resources in the Golan, the demilitarization of areas, the disarming of military forces, the creation of warning stations, and the deployment of international forces. Information was also leaked that the Israeli Foreign Ministry has, in turn, prepared a working paper on a settlement with Syria. This working paper is independent from that of the Army. Yitzhaq Rabin announced that Syria should hold secret contacts with Israel because it is impossible to reach peace without such contacts. Any observer who follows these drafts and proposals can only wonder if Israel is really serious about making peace. Syria presented a document of principles during the sixth round of the Washington talks, which was hailed by the international community as an objective and balanced paper that lays the foundations of firm peace in the region. However, Israel refused to discuss the sixth item of the document of principles on the exchange of land for peace and the return of the Golan. Israel inundated the Washington talks with an endless series of security conditions and pretexts, as if the Washington talks were held to provide security for Israel alone. The Syrian negotiating team did not succeed--despite the many rounds and exhaustive efforts--in drawing the Israeli delegation to discuss withdrawal from the Golan, although the occupied territories are central to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Israeli settlement paper did not include anything that refers to Israel's readiness to withdraw fully from the Golan. The Israeli paper revolves around the achievement of great gains for Israel -- such as relations, normalization, and security arrangements. This confirms that there is no change in the Israeli position and that their approach of procrastination and maneuvering remains the same. Syria is concerned with a just and comprehensive peace, which means the restoration of Arab territories and rights and providing a chance for stability in the Middle East. Syria is not at all concerned with being drawn into Israel's trap or its security claims. Israel is only raising these problems and security complications in order to announce at the end that occupation of part of the Golan is important for its security, although occupation did not, and will not, provide security for Israel. Just, entrenched, and honorable peace is the only thing that will provide security and stability for the region. Obviously, the game of the Israeli working papers -- one from the Army and the other from the Foreign Ministry -- is merely another pretext to escape the obligations of the peace process, primarily withdrawal from the Golan and all occupied territories. The Washington talks have extensively addressed all items related to peace, particularly security arrangements. However, the Israeli side has consistently refused to discuss the question of withdrawal. Had Israel truly wanted peace, the question would not have taken all these discussions, deliberations, and working papers. The Security Council resolutions, the Madrid conference foundations, and the U.S. initiative all stem from the exchange of land for peace. Is Israel ready to return the land, the whole land? This is the question that requires a frank answer. Without a frank and decisive answer, there is no possibility for realizing peace in the region. Syria is not willing to relinquish an inch of its territory or any Arab right. Syria is also not willing to exchange facts for illusions and to replace the Washington talks and the foundations of the Madrid conference with secret talks whose only objective is to circumvent the Security Council resolutions.
