The Piranhas will be fitted onto patrol fighter planes by mid-1996 after being built by the Mectron Engenharia and receiving approval from the Navy institutes. This is a priority project for the Aeronautics Ministry, which wishes to replace the 150 U.S. missiles purchased 20 years ago that still equip Brazilian combat planes. Brigadier Nelson Taveira, director of the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA), said that there is the possibility of exporting these missiles. The initial production capability will be 10 missiles per month. With a fund of $8.8 million, the Piranha is being developed by engineers from the Aeronautical Technology Institute (ITA). Mectron will review the electronic parts and the missile guide control. As this is a teleguided weapon, parts of its plans will be modernized with the help of the CTA experts.
