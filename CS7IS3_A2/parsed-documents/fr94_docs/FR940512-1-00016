FR940512-1-00016 FR940512-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;42&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A series airplanes, that currently requires replacing the quick release coupling halves on each end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic engine driven pump (EDP) on the number 2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves. This action would revise the applicability of the existing AD. This proposal is prompted by the identification of additional airplanes that are subject to the addressed unsafe condition. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent hydraulic fluid leakage from the pump case drain line quick release coupling, which could fuel the flames in the event of an engine fire. DATES: Comments must be received by June 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;42&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
