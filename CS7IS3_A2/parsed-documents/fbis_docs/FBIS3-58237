[Hurd] We said in August, and we are going to repeat again tomorrow, that if our forces are attacked or if the strangulation of Sarajevo were resumed, then NATO would be willing to use air power in support of the United Nations, and that is absolutely right, and I can conceive and you can conceive the circumstances in which it would be useful to do that. But you do it if it is going to help, you plan ahead, not just the one strike but what happens after that, who is going to lose their lives, who is going to be at risk, what purpose is going to be served. I can conceive of circumstances in which the alliance decides to go ahead, and that is what Mr. Clinton was saying we must be prepared to do. [Gowing] Is the talk of withdrawal -- even the consideration itself becoming a new dynamic as you try pursue peace, in other words the warring factions now working for the moment when they expect your forces to leave? [Hurd] No decisions have been taken and no decisions will be taken by us unilaterally without consulting those who are in the same position as we are, this is a joint effort and we need to consider its future jointly. The question is not yet answered but it is a perfectly reasonably one to put, we have to look at after this winter is over, for the winter we are committed and would be quite wrong to withdraw during the winter. But when the spring comes are we going to say in effect: We are willing to continue this commitment for ever? Well the answer to that question will depend on what the situation looks like then. [Gowing] Could I ask very briefly on the enlargement of NATO or the possibility of enlargement, what about the -- what some people are saying that you are simply appeasing the Russians, particularly because Yeltsin, when you were here two years ago, wrote a request saying he would like Russia to join NATO eventually. [Hurd] It is not a question of appeasing Russia. We are saying to countries like Poland, Hungary, and the Czechs: You want to join NATO, first of all let us have a partnership. What does that mean? It means working out with them, cooperation in things like training, joint exercises, joint planning, let us get to work on that, see how we work together, and then maybe at the end of the day there will be full membership, and each country will respond to these limitations that have been signed today in a different way, and we will be able, as time passes, to assess progress with them, and to work out full membership, timing, terms when that is right. [Gowing] How happy do you believe the Russians will be about your offer, your invitation which President Clinton will take, do you expect them to accept this? [Hurd] Yes, I do expect them to accept it. I think it would be shortsighted of them not to; it is a big opportunity for them, too. This is not aimed against them; it is an invitation issued to them along with others, and I very much hope they will take it up. [Gowing] Even after all the bluster of complaint and concern? [Hurd] Well I would not use the word bluster. Russia is rethinking its role in Europe as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is not surprising that should take time, it is not indeed surprising that there should be something of a backlash in Russian elections with Mr. Zhirinovskiy, but he does not make policy he is not the government, it is the government with which we have to deal, they are rethinking policy, we have to take some account of that, it does not mean giving him a veto, and I think the Partnership for Peace strikes the right balance.
