With the end of the current ordinary Diet session only two days away, major political parties in Japan have yet to decide on who should head the next government, let alone which parties should fashion a new administration. So far, the coalition parties that constitute Hata's fragile minority government are adopting a wait-and-see tactic toward the formation of the next government as major opposition parties are vigorously trying to launch an administration that includes them. The country's two largest parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ], both in the opposition camp, are playing a pivotal role in livening up the intensifying power game triggered by Hata's announcement of his resignation with the two-month-old cabinet. The LDP, a party that governed the nation unchallenged for nearly four decades until last August, is anxious to seize this occasion to wrest back power. The problem is the party needs a partner -- or partners -- to launch a new government as it lacks a majority force in the Diet. The once-dominant party is thus wooing the SDP, the LDP's archrival under the LDP's 38-year rule and the largest contingent in the administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government, into its fold to create a grand coalition government. But the move has already sparked resistance from within the LDP because it is taken to be tantamount to the revival of the old political setup in which the LDP and the SDP were ostensibly locking horns with each other but in reality having a cozy relationship. The tie-up with the LDP is also not easy for the SDP. While the left-wingers within the SDP, led by SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, show great interest in joining forces with the LDP, the right- wingers headed by SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo favor the party's realliance with the present coalition. The LDP and the SDP have also too wide a gap over key policy issues such as foreign policies and national security to govern together. It is uncertain whether New Party Sakigake, a tiny LDP splinter party headed by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and having close ties with the SDP, can play cupid for the two parties. As of Monday [27 June] night, the SDP leadership has yet to decide on which the party should choose, forming a partnership with the LDP or mending fences with the coalition parties, due to the schism between the right-wing and left-wing members of the party. Whichever the party leadership chooses, the SDP could face a moment of breakup and accelerate moves toward a full-scale reconfiguration of political parties in Japan. The ruling coalition parties are closely watching dialogue for the formation of a new government among the LDP, the SDP and Sakigake and have given the silent treatment to the SDP's call for the reopening of realliance talks. It is widely believed that behind the coalition's attitude lies its conviction that the LDP and the SDP will never be able to get married and that the ruling alliance can certainly break a political impasse in its favor.
