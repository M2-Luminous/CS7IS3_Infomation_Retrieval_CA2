FR940705-2-00160 FR940705-2-00090 The efficacy of the chemical treatment process shall be validated with an indicator organism. Chemical disinfectants shall be neutralized or diluted before release into general effluent waste systems. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-j. A ducted exhaust air ventilation system shall be provided that creates directional airflow that draws air into the laboratory through the entry area. The exhaust air, which is not recirculated to any other area of the building, shall be discharged to the outside and dispersed away from the occupied areas and air intakes. Personnel shall verify that the direction of the airflow (into the animal room) is proper. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-k. Exhaust air from BL4&hyph;N containment area shall be double high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filtered or treated by passing through a certified HEPA filter and an air incinerator before release to the atmosphere. Double HEPA filters shall be required for the supply air system in a BL4&hyph;N containment area. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-l. All high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters' frames and housings shall be certified to have no detectable smoke [dioctylphthalate] leaks when the exit face (direction of flow) of the filter is scanned above 0.01 percent when measured by a linear or logarithmic photometer. The instrument must demonstrate a threshold sensitivity of at least 1×10 ^3 micrograms per liter for 0.3 micrometer diameter dioctylphthalate particles and a challenge concentration of 80&hyph;120 micrograms per liter. The air sampling rate should be at least 1 cfm (28.3 liters per minute). Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-m. If an air incinerator is used in lieu of the second high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filter, it shall be biologically challenged to prove all viable test agents are sterilized. The biological challenge must be minimally 1×10 8 organisms per cubic foot of airflow through the incinerator. It is universally accepted if bacterial spores are used to challenge and verify that the equipment is capable of killing spores, then assurance is provided that all other known agents are inactivated by the parameters established to operate the equipment. Test spores meeting this criterion are Bacillus subtilis var. niger or Bacillus stearothermophilis. The operating temperature of the incinerator shall be continuously monitored and recorded during use. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-n. All equipment and floor drains shall be equipped with deep traps (minimally 5 inches). Floor drains shall be fitted with isolation plugs or fitted with automatic water fill devices. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-o. Each animal area shall contain a foot, elbow, or automatically operated sink for hand washing. The sink shall be located near the exit door.
