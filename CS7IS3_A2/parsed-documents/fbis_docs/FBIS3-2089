The new tax system has been implemented for nearly two months to date; judged by situations in various localities, the new tax system has smoothly entered a course of normal operation and has basically undergone a stable transition. Following the passage of the new individual income tax law by the National People's Congress Standing Committee on 30 October 1993, the State Council successively promulgated six sets of interim regulations on the collection of value-added tax, consumption tax, business tax, institutional income tax, incremental tax on land value, and resource tax. Until now, except for incremental tax on land value, regulations or rules for the implementation of the interim regulations governing six other taxes have been promulgated and enacted. The State Council recently issued a circular deciding to cancel market transaction tax, livestock transaction tax, special tax on fuel oil, bonus tax, and regulatory tax on wages, and delegating the rights of collecting taxes on slaughtering animals and banquet taxes to local authorities. This indicates that the major parts of China's general tax reform package, particular the reform measures for main categories of tax, have all been released. The reform of financial and taxation system is the focus of China's current reform package as a whole, and tax reform is the most important part in the reform of the financial and taxation system. The smooth implementation of the new tax system has laid a firm foundation for stepping up the establishment of a socialist market economic structure in China. The present tax reform is an overall, comprehensive, and structural reform. It involves the readjustment of interests for every enterprise and individual; therefore, it is more difficult, has more contradictions, and may involve great risks if it is not handled properly. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance to tax reform. Leaders from the State Council have personally taken charge of this task and have given many important directions. To ensure a smooth implementation of tax reform, cadres, staff, and workers of taxation departments at all levels have done a great deal of work. Since the beginning of October 1993, taxation organs at all levels have launched various forms of training for the broad masses of taxation cadres and factory directors, as well as enterprise managers, finance and accounting personnel, tax-handling persons, and even persons in charge of marketing and purchasing, so that the overwhelming majority of taxation cadres and enterprises will understand the importance of current tax reform and fundamentally grasp its major contents and operating points. Except for the great concern from the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, leaders of all localities and departments have also shown full concern over and support for tax reform. Principal leaders of many provinces, municipalities, regions, and departments have made statements to publicize the new tax system and demanded that their subordinate departments coordinate the implementation of the new tax system. In a "national taxation propaganda day" campaign organized by the State Administration of Taxation on 23 January, tens of thousands of taxation cadres and enterprise finance officers and accountants around the country, led by local party and government leaders, went to the streets to publicize the tax law and offer consultation services to the public. Meanwhile, to successfully carry out the new tax system and resolve all kinds of problems in a timely manner, the State Administration of Taxation has given more directions and strengthened the management -- in nearly the past two months since the beginning of the year, it has issued some 60 documents and fax messages of various sorts and held two national telephone conferences with the participation of taxation directors at and above the county level to directly convey relevant guidelines and requirements to grassroots taxation bureaus, thus making sure government decrees go down to all parts of the country without obstruction. There are several important indicators to tell if the tax reform is a success: Whether the reform causes fluctuations in commodity prices and significant price hikes; whether revenue grows steadily or slides; whether a great quantity of forged special vouchers for value-added tax and the chaos of tax evasion through issuing vouchers is revealed; and whether the reform produces positive or negative influences on production. -- Reviewing the situation of implementation over the past two months, commodity prices, the most troublesome problem, did not fluctuate or rise greatly because of the tax reform. The irrational sales of electrical appliances and other commodities, caused by a misunderstanding that consumption tax is an additional tax added to current commodity prices, soon passed after an explanation given through propaganda. After the introduction of the value-added tax, some people misunderstood the 17-percent tax, which was excluded from the commodity price, as an additional tax added to the price already including tax. After repeated explanation by taxation organs and intensive checks by departments concerned, this problem has been basically cleared and corrected. -- The revenue still maintains a trend of higher growth. By 20 February, the state's revenue from industry and business taxes amounted to 40.7 billion yuan, up 27.3 percent over the same period last year. -- Generally, the institution of new tax system did not adversely influence production and circulation; industrial production still grows rapidly. According to statistics of the State Administration of Taxation, the country's industries at and above township levels achieved 290.3 billion yuan in total output value in January, up 33.2 percent over the same month last year. After the extensive launch of value-added tax, many small-scale taxpayers have encountered some problems in their production and operations during a certain period of time, but taxation departments swiftly took effective measures to correct and resolve the problems. -- The special vouchers for value-added tax were all in place before 1 January. No big problems occurred in the process of printing, delivery, distribution, and application. Moreover, improvement has been made to the vouchers' columns, size, and anti- forgery mark in line with actual conditions; at the request of enterprises, septuplicate vouchers are now available in addition to the quadruplicate ones. The State Administration of Taxation also decided that anti-forgery vouchers unitedly printed by the banknote printer be used across the country beginning 1 May to forestall the emergence of counterfeit vouchers. It can be said that all walks of life and most enterprises have greeted the new tax system quite comfortably; foreign investors in China have dismissed their apprehensions because their tax burden did not become heavier following the implementation of the new tax system. However, we should also be aware that despite the fact that new tax system has been launched for nearly two months, some unavoidable frictions still exist in the course of transferring from the old tax system to the new one. Therefore, in a recent interview with this reporter, Jin Xin, deputy director of the State Administration of Taxation said: The achievements we scored so far are merely preliminary ones, which are not enough to demonstrate that the new tax system is a complete success. Many new problems and conditions have yet to fully emerge; therefore, we should remain sober-minded and study and handle all kinds of problems in time. It is noteworthy that China's current tax reform is aimed at establishing a taxation system that is suitable to a socialist market economic structure, conforms to international practice, and tallies with China's actual situation. The guiding ideology of the reform is: unifying tax laws, imposing taxes fairly, streamlining the tax system, dividing power rationally, rationalizing distribution relations, and standardizing distribution methods. The design of the reform package has upheld the basic principle of keeping the general level of the tax burden unchanged. However, because of the uneven levels of tax burden under the original tax system, it is impossible to keep every taxpayer's vested interests unaffected after extensively adopting the value-added tax system. We demand that all sectors concerned keep the overall situation in mind, support the implementation of a new tax system from the perspective of overall and long-term interest, and never encourage price hikes just because some enterprises have a heavier tax burden. We should be aware that tax reform is the foundation for establishing a socialist market economic structure; once the tax reform is put in place and reaches the expected results, it will greatly step up the pace of establishing a socialist market economic structure. Thus the reform is in the interests of us all from a long-term view.
