FBIS4-33662 "drlat111_g_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-111 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 Guatemala Government, URNG Fail To Reach Accord Government, URNG Fail To Reach Accord PA0806174494 Guatemala City LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 4 Jun 94 p 7 PA0806174494 Guatemala City LA REPUBLICA Spanish BFN [Article by Elder Interiano] [Text] Hector Rosada, coordinator of the Guatemalan Government peace commission, said yesterday the government and the guerrillas for the second time have failed to reach agreement on the issue of uprooted Guatemalans, although the foundation of a subsequent agreement was laid. This is why a third meeting will be held next week in Mexico, he added. The government official was in Puebla, Mexico, on 1 and 2 June heading the official delegation that held a "small meeting" with the commanders of the insurgent Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG), because during the first round of talks they failed to reach a consensus. On that occasion, Rosada maintained the negotiations were not broken. A CERIGUA news agency report points out the differences of opinions and the difficulties in reaching a consensus after the government delegation rejected the proposal by the Civilian Society Assembly (ASC) were the reasons why the negotiations failed. The Ramiro De Leon Carpio government rejected the report and accused CERIGUA of attributing statements to the URNG commanders, thus justifying its position that the URNG is "politicizing" the human rights issue. Rosada said yesterday there were positive results on a possible agreement in the meeting with the URNG, but they agreed to meet next week in Mexico to sign a document on the uprooted people, a controversial issue at the negotiations. He pointed out that during the meeting there was an exchange of opinions within a framework of mutual "respect and resolve," which the insurgent commanders recognized. Although Rosada refused to give details of the issues discussed during these conversations, he stressed that the cease-fire in the area of Ixcan, Quiche Department, was indeed discussed. This step constitutes a preliminary action in light of the complete disarmament in December 1994, the rejoining of political life by the guerrillas as a peace agreement is being signed, and the ASC human rights proposal. The official recalled that any decision made during the meeting does not mean the irrefutable signing of an agreement, because this signing will take place in Oslo, Norway, as the discussions to find out the truth begin. Rosada added that should we fail to reach an agreement on the uprooted people, "the government commission would be unwilling to recognize other proposals."
