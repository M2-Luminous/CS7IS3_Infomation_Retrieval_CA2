The three-day issuance, from March 27 to 29, raised 1.786 billion yuan ($205.29 million). Investors had to deposit cash for receipts that will be used in a lottery to determine who can buy the shares. The money is being held in Beijing financial institutions. However, the capital's first public offering did not meet the expectations of securities firms and the four companies floating the shares. The four companies are Beijing Department Store (Group) Co Ltd, Beiren Printing Machinery Co Ltd, Beijing Light Bus Co Ltd and Beijing Town County Trade Centre Co Ltd. Although stock offerings are the subject of much street talk these days, masses of investors did not queue in Beijing as they have in many other cities. According to underwriters of the flotation, the lottery rates for the four companies all surpassed 2.7 per cent. This means that the chances of a subscriber being able to buy shares are 27 in 1,000. Beiren had the highest lottery rate, 10.5679 per cent. In comparison, the rate for Tsingtao Beer was 0.06 per cent when it publicly floated shares last year. Experts say the months-long contraction in the country's stock market dampened people's enthusiasm for the new issues. In addition, the public has learned that new issues may not promise the easy fortunes they did several years ago when demand for stocks far out paced the supply. Observers also point out that Beijing people are conservative investors. They prefer the lower risks of financial instruments such as treasury bonds to the higher risks of stocks. The major challenger to the new stock issues is this year's treasury bonds, whose yields have lured many investors. Of the four companies, investors preferred the two retail companies over the two industrial firms, although the former carry higher issuing prices. The lottery rate for Beijing Department Store is 2.9384 per cent and for Beijing Town and County Trade Centre, 2.7721 per cent. For Beiren it is 10.5679 percent and for Beijing Light Bus, 6.3549 per cent.
