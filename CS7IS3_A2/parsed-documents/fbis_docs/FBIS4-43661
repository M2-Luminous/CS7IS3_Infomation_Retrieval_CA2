Martino pointed out that a joint committee is already at work on resolving outstanding issues, after which "we will support, with sincere enthusiasm, an association deal between Slovenia and the European Union [EU]." Martino was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of EU diplomatic chiefs to lay the groundwork for the June 24-25 EU summit in Corfu. Slovenia was one of the items on the agenda for today's talks. Geography has "condemned Italy and Slovenia to being neighbours" and "history has condemned them to being friends" said Martino in a press conference, "I am convinced that these two countries will remain friends." At the centre of the friction has been Italy's reluctance to back a Slovenian EU membership bid until the former Yugoslav state has fulfilled all the conditions of the Osimo Treaty which fixed borders between Italy and Yugoslavia. Italy is demanding that Italians be allowed to regain land in Istria confiscated by Yugoslav authorities.
