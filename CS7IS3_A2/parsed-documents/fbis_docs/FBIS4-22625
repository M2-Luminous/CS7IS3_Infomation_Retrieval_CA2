Kurbanov: "The New Railroads of Turkmenia"] [Text] In connection with the plans to develop Turkmenia, the railroad workers of this state have been faced with the task of further rebuilding existing lines and constructing new ones. The interests, let us say, of the Balkan Velayat -- a region with tremendous reserves of oil, salt, iodine, bromine and hard coal --require an exit, not only to the center of the country, but also to the north. It is planned to run new branch lines from Gazandzhyk (Kazandzhyk) to the open-pit mines of Gyzylgaya (Kyzylkaya) (about 150 kilometers) and from Krasnovodsk (now the city of Turkmenbashi) to the salt developments. A mainline track to the Turkmen subtropics has already been laid from the Gazandzhyk Station to the south. This is needed for development of Turkmenistan's agriculture. Several harvests a year may be obtained here with an approach to the subtropic area of the Amu-Darya waters along the Karakum Canal (this project is already being carried out successfully). On the other hand, the branch line from Gazandzhyk to the border settlement of Gyzylatrek (Kyzylatrek), over 300 kilometers long, will be an alternative, a second link of the Trans-Asian mainline, with an exit to Iran and Turkey. In this case, about 80 kilometers of rails remain to be laid from the Turkmen border to the closest station in Iran. To the northeast of Turkmenistan, the Dashkhovuz (Gashauz) Station will be further developed and will become the country's major new railroad junction. The Dashkhovuz Velayat is a major producer of agricultural goods: grain, rice, cotton, sesame, raw silk and karakul sheep. Last year alone the supply of fresh vegetables from Dashkhovuz by the inhabitants of Ashgabat made it possible to reduce the urgency of the "vitamin" problem several-fold. Motor vehicle transport between the north and the capital of the republic, however, is expensive. The prices for Dashkhovuz tomatoes and cabbage are very high. A branch line is now being constructed in Dashkhovuz from the Koneurgench Station to the small town of Kerney. It is possible that a mainline by-passing the Uzbek territory will soon have to be built from the Dashkhovuz Station, since this section, up to the junction station of Gazochag (Gazochak), for the time being has strained relations with the Central Asian section -- primarily because of disputes about the engineering shoulders for locomotive traffic and about safeguarding freight. It is planned to run another branch along the left bank of the Amu-Darya from Chardzhev (Chardzhou) to Kerki, along the motor-railroad bridge to the Amu-Darya Station. The communicating road is now cut off from the area of medium flow of the Amu-Darya. Thanks to the new branch line, it will become faster and more reasonable to transport sulfur, potassium salt, marble, cotton and grain from the southeastern raw materials "corner" to the center of the country. Large reserves of valuable raw material have been discovered in the eastern, Lebap Velayat. The future mainline from Chardzhev to Kerki must therefore be linked up with the presently operating branch line from Mary to Gushga (Kushka). This "ring" will make it possible for Turkmenistan to exit through Afghanistan and Pakistan to ports on the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. To a certain extent, all these plans are being implemented today. Dozens of kilometers have already been laid in all directions. Work on laying a road to the border town of Sarakhs is particularly intensive: almost the entire 120-kilometer roadbed and 50 kilometers of mainline tracks have been constructed. The road is, of course, experiencing a shortage of rails and ties, and does not have enough construction equipment, but things are moving. The outlines of a developed transport structure for Turkmenia are gradually appearing.
