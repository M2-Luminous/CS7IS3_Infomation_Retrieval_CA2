FR940504-0-00021 FR940504-0-00009 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [OH&hyph;10&hyph;1&hyph;5677; FRL&hyph;48764] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Ohio AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: USEPA is approving and disapproving specific portions of a revision to the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. On April 9, 1986, the State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), submitted amendments to the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3745&hyph;21 to USEPA as proposed revisions to the SIP for Ozone. OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21 consists of emission limitations and control requirements for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The amendments to OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21 involve certain compliance deadlines and source specific exemptions from otherwise applicable emission limitations. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule becomes effective on June 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for inspection at (It is recommended that you telephone Maggie Greene, at (312) 886&hyph;6088, before visiting the Region 5 Office.) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air Enforcement Branch, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. A copy of this revision to the Ohio SIP is available for inspection at: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Air Docket, 6102, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne E. Tenner, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 353&hyph;3849. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 9, 1986, the OEPA submitted amendments to OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21 and supporting data to USEPA as a proposed revision to the ozone portion of its SIP. OEPA adopted these rules in final form on March 21, 1986. OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21, entitled, ``Carbon Monoxide, Photochemically Reactive Materials, Hydrocarbons, and Related Materials Standards,'' includes Ohio's VOC Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT I and II) regulations. Ohio's submittal included new VOC regulations for additional source categories not specifically covered by Ohio's existing rules and a site-specific revision for the Huffy Corporation. These other elements of the April 9, 1986, submittal are not covered in this document. Today's Federal Register document also does not address those amendments to the ozone SIP that were previously submitted on March 28, 1983, to USEPA, and were addressed in a March 6, 1985 Federal Register notice of proposed rulemaking (50 FR 9052) and in a January 18, 1989, Federal Register final rulemaking (54 FR 1934). The regulations subject to this rulemaking are embodied in OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;01, Definitions; OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;04, Attainment dates and compliance time schedules; OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09, Control of emissions of volatile organic compounds from stationary sources; and OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;10, Compliance test methods and procedures. USEPA is taking final action to approve these revisions, with the following exceptions: 1. USEPA is disapproving the proposed relaxation for food can end sealing compounds in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (D)(1)(e) and (D)(2)(e) from 3.7 to 4.4 lbs VOC/gal. 2. USEPA is disapproving the proposed revision to the exemption, as well as the entire exemption in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)(e) for the application by hand of any cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt for patching or crack sealing. Ohio's high ratio of emulsified to cutback asphalt used in 1987 is not a valid basis for exempting the hand application of cutback asphalt. This exemption is inconsistent with USEPA guidance, and Ohio has provided no data on the amount of additional cutback asphalt that would be used in the ozone season as a result of the exemption. In addition, USEPA is disapproving the recordkeeping requirements in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (N)(4) because they are inadequate with respect to the time period during which records are required because paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (N)(4) only deals with recordkeeping requirements and not when cutback asphalt is allowed to be used. Ohio's SIP does not allow cutback asphalt to be used from April 15 through October 15. Unless and until the exemption period is changed (in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (N)(3)), the recordkeeping requirements must reflect the SIP requirements. 3. USEPA is disapproving the relaxation from 3.5 to 6.2 lbs. VOC/gal for high performance architectural aluminum coatings in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(viii) because Ohio did not document the infeasibility of add-on controls and powder coatings in support of its proposed relaxation. USEPA will evaluate the merits of a compliance date extension if submitted and supported by OEPA. In addition, USEPA will repropose rulemaking on the relaxation for miscellaneous metal parts, in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(vii), and USEPA will propose rulemaking on the exemption for new sources, in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(2)(f), in separate Federal Register documents. Comments on the proposed SIP revisions contained in the May 30, 1989, rulemaking notice (54 FR 22915) are discussed below:
