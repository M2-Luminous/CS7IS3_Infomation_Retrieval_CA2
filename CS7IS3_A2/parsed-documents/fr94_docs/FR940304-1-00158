FR940304-1-00158 FR940304-1-00014 Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO 2 reduction would be 67,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants during that time in the United States is 0.04 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 130,000 tons; 249,000 tons; 287,000 tons; and 451,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.24 percent. Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO 2 reduction would be 46 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.05 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 93 million tons; 165 million tons; 187 million tons; and 280 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.29 percent. Conventional cooking tops . Conventional cooking tops use electricity and gas directly. In 1987, 3.7 percent of source electricity (or 0.39 quad) and 5.0 percent of natural gas consumption (or 0.26 quad) were accounted for on a national basis by conventional cooking tops. In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D. 42 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO 2 ). For all classes of conventional cooking tops at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO 2 reduction would be less than 500 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 30,000 tons; 17,000 tons; 156,000 tons; and 92,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.07 percent. 42 See, footnote 37. Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO 2 reduction would be 1,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 151,000 tons; 151,000 tons; 255,000 tons; and 206,000 tons, respectively The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.13 percent. Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO 2 reduction would be 1 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 144 million tons; 150 million tons; 193 million tons; and 172 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.20 percent. Microwave ovens . Microwave ovens use electricity directly. In 1987, 1.5 percent of source electricity (or 0.16 quad) were accounted for on a national basis by microwave ovens. In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D. 43 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO 2 ). For microwave ovens at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO 2 reduction would be over 118,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.09 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 138,000 tons; 156,000 tons; 178,000 tons; and 190,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.12 percent. 43 See, footnote 37. Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO 2 reduction would be 94,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.09 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 112,000 tons; 128,000 tons; 147,000 tons; and 158,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.12 percent.
