General Michael Rose, commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who presided over the negotiations between the representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the aggressor, Serbian side, this afternoon said that this was a very small step in solving a very great problem. According to his words, the agreement has three basic points. [Begin Rose recording in English] ....that there should be an immediate cease-fire in and around the city.... [end Rose recording] [Words indistinct] and that there will no more attacks on the city or from within the city; second, that the UN peace forces would be posted at all key and sensitive locations outside of the city; third, that all heavy weaponry would be placed under UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] control; and fourth, that a joint commission would be formed to oversee this task. The joint commission would be headed by French General Andre (Subirou), commander of the UNPROFOR sector in Sarajevo. A series of details, and the establishment of locations for posting the Blue Helmets, will still have to be agreed, said General Rose. According to him, this might be the beginning of a normalization of life for Sarajevo citizens. The British general said that the cease-fire would go into effect at 1200 [1100 GMT] tomorrow [10 February], and that Brigadier General (Subirou) would deploy his troops as soon as possible. Asked to state the difference between today's and earlier agreements that were violated practically at the moment they were signed, General Rose said that the difference was that this time Karadzic's Serb army was ready to withdraw its heavy weaponry and to place it under the efficient control of the peace forces. This can be a result of the changed strategic circumstances in which they have found themselves, added the British general. There were no conflicts regarding the definition of heavy weaponry, and Sir Michael Rose maintains that all weapons whose caliber exceeds 12.7-mm will be placed under control. The other question that could prove to be controversial, and that the aggressor's side will try to manipulate, is the distance to which the heavy weaponry should be withdrawn. General Rose believes that this issue is not of paramount importance, and that if a distance of some 30 km around Sarajevo is agreed upon, there are bound to be areas that are not appropriate for placing heavy artillery. UNPROFOR will work on placing this weaponry under as tight control as possible. This, of course, also includes the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's heavy artillery. There is no minimal distance from the city if the heavy artillery is under our control, said General Rose. No signatures were put on the agreement reached at Sarajevo airport, yet the Brit does not deem this to be a particularly significant detail. He said that the negotiations between the representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Serbian side continued and that they concerned a series of details connected to the agreement. The Brit said that he had met with President Izetbegovic today around noon, and that the president of the Presidency of our country asked for clarifications on three or four points, after which he authorized the military representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to come to the airport and agree to the agreement. In response to a question pertaining to the possibility of air strikes against the Serb artillery if the agreement is not observed, General Rose said: I will keep my thoughts to myself, and leave the decision to General Jean Cot and Mr. Yasushi Akashi. He was optimistic when he added that everyone was now facing a complete change, but we have heard these words, in one form or another, from other commanders of the peace forces in Bosnia.
