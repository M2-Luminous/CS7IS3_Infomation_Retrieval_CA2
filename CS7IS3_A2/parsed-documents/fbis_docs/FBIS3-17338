"In this connection I felt that the talk I had in Brussels with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner was very useful. His conceptual clarifications convinced me that it would be appropriate for us to cooperate with the Atlantic Alliance," he indicated. According to the Armenian minister, a NATO expert group will visit Armenia shortly to study the details of his country's possible membership in the Partnership for Peace program. The Armenian foreign minister, who feels that, generally speaking, the initiative is positive, would nevertheless like it to lead to the creation of precise mechanisms capable of ensuring stability in the CSCE's geopolitical area of responsibility, including of course the area of the former USSR. Mr. Papazyan said that Armenia's position on this issue was quite close to Russia's. He also said that he has recently been holding a permanent dialogue with his Russian counterpart, Mr. Kozyrev, so that they can "coordinate" their respective positions on this matter. According to the Armenian minister, Armenia feels that the question of concrete security mechanisms within the framework of the CSCE is crucially important in so far as the efforts of the "Minsk Group" to resolve the problem of Karabakh have so far failed to bear fruit, precisely because of the absence of an instrument likely to achieve these efforts on the ground. The Armenian foreign minister, who deplored the international community's detachment from the problems in the trans-Caucasus region, noted that the Russian Army represented the only potential guarantor of stability in that region, in so far as the West is clearly not prepared to send its intervention forces into the trans- Caucasus. At the same time he also made it clearly understood that the presence of international observers in this region would be essential to ensure not only stability but also to supervise Russian troops activity. Speaking about the situation in Karabakh, Mr. Papazyan said that the negotiations currently continuing in Moscow between the representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Karabakh -- with the mediation of Russia and the CSCE -- have encouraged the truce that has recently emerged in the field. Nevertheless, he said he was rather pessimistic as to the possibility of seeing these negotiations lead to a feasible political solution to the conflict, "because it is highly probable that Azerbaijan once again views them [the negotiations] as an opportunity to regroup its forces in order to relaunch the offensive against the Armenians in Karabakh." According to Mr. Papazyan, "this war has already gone too far." The Armenian minister thinks that this tragic evolution of the conflict, which he feels, by the way, to be strictly Azerbaijan's internal problem, is primarily due to the fact that the Azeri leaders have never truly renounced their attempts to resolve the problem by military means. However, according to the Armenian foreign minister, any persistence by Baku in this direction is likely to force Armenia to intervene "for good" in this conflict, which risks taking on an especially dangerous international dimension.
