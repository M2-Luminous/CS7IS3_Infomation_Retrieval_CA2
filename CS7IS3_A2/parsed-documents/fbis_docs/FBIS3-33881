Mr. S.B. Chavan was talking to newsmen in Jammu at the end of a three-day tour of Jammu, Doda and Kishtwar. Asked about holding elections in the state, he said the possibility of the state going to the polls in the near future cannot be ruled out, but there is no timeframe for it, he added. In a reply to another question, the home minister said the Center has no package for initiating the political process in the state. Mr. Chavan said Kashmir is a national issue and no party should take advantage of it. The monthly cash relief for the Kashmiri migrants has been increased by 50 percent. The relief per family will now be 1,500 rupees instead of 1,000 rupees. This was announced by the home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, in Jammu. Agency reports from Jammu say militants opened fire when the helicopter of the home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, was landing at Doda yesterday. The reports quoting official sources say the militants fired from a hilltop at (Deoli) about 3 km from Doda. The security forces returned the fire silencing the guns of the militants. The militants could not cause any damage as they fired the shots from quite a distance. The union minister of state for home, Mr. Rajesh Pilot, says the government will not allow agencies like the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan to succeed in their evil designs. Addressing a rally in Gandhinagar yesterday, he said Pakistan is interfering in our internal affairs and it does not want the law and order situation to improve in the Kashmir valley. The minister made it clear that tough action will be taken against the forces which are bent upon breaking the unity of the country.
