[passage omitted] These rules do not apply to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, nor to carrier technologies. These will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Rexrodt said that the new rule imposes greater accountability on enterprises, but does not represent a departure from the government's existing policy concerning the granting of permits.
