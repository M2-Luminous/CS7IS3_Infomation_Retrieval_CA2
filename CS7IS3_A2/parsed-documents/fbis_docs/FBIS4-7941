FBIS4-7941 "dreeu068__a94029" FBIS-EEU-94-068-A Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia New Government Outlines Policy Statement New Government Outlines Policy Statement AU0704151594 Prague CTK in English 1235 GMT 7 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0704151594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, April 7 (CTK) -- The need of a strong private sector as a source of prosperity of Slovakia's economy is emphasised in the program of the new Slovak government of Premier Jozef Moravcik which he will present to Parliament on April 12. The government intends to speed up the privatization process with equal use of all its forms so that after the second privatization wave is completed more than half state-owned property is transferred into private possession, says the statement obtained by CTK today. Moravcik's cabinet will seek to facilitate the entrance of foreign capital in the country's economy and is also willing to offer companies put up for privatization to foreign buyers who offer the most "interesting" business projects. The new government, during its six-month term of office, will seek to bring to zero the growth of Slovakia's gross domestic product, to maintain the growth of prices between 10 to 13 percent and privatization under 17 percent. It will seek to achieve such a growth of Slovakia's foreign currency reserves as to ensure the internal convertibility of the Slovak currency and a positive payments balance. To preserve macro-economic stability the government will seek a standby loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the statement says. "The interconnection of the processes of economic and social transformation remains the basic approach," the statement says in the part dedicated to the social sphere. In order to solve the problems of almost 15-percent unemployment rate which in some regions rises up to 26.7 percent, the growth in long-term unemployment and a situation in which almost half of Slovak households live on the border of the sustenance level (15.2 percent of families live under this border) the government intends to reassess the policy of providing material allowances, extend job possibilities and protect the labor market. Moravcik's cabinet considers integration into European political, economic and security structures to be a strategic priority for Slovakia's foreign policy orientation. "The government confirms Slovakia's interest in full membership of the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) and of the European Union (EU)," the statement says. It will also seek to smoothly complete the process of the ratification of an agreement on Slovakia's association with the EU. "We would like to achieve a consensus in society which would secure stability and calm cooperation of all Slovak citizens regardless of their nationality and the color of their skin," the document says.
