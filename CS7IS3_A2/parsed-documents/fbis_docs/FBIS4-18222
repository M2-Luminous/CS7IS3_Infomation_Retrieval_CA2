This was stressed by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to journalists in Nuremburg today. Other goals were the enlargement of the EU with the admission of the Scandinavian countries and Austria by the deadline on 1 January 1995, and employment policy at European level. Kinkel strongly criticized the policy on Europe pursued by Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber. EU "defeatism" in Germany was particularly uncalled for in that there was no other country that was as dependent on Europe as the Federal Republic. The FDP [Free Democratic Party] would set itself up as a "party for Europe" in the forthcoming election campaigns. Kinkel described the outcome of the elections in Italy as "worrying." However, developments concerning the formation of the government were still awaited. Germany and France have to have very great interest in a rapid emergence of a stable government in Italy.
