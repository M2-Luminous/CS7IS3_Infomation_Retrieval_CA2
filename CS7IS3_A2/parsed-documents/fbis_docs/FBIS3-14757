The situation in the country is catastrophic, and he understands that if nothing changes it will even deteriorate. Additionally, his ratings have been declining recently. He would most probably lose the elections. To resign means to at least save face. I believe that his decision is serious. [Mykhaylo Horyn] Leonid Kravchuk understands that a new stage of the building of the Ukrainian state has begun, which requires that definitely new tactics be worked out. A new president is needed for new tactics. [Oleksandr Moroz] Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] has not yet officially announced that he will not run for president. If he decides to do so, this will be a politically correct act. The popularity of Leonid Kravchuk is decreasing. He and [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Ivan Plyushch are responsible for the failures of the Supreme Council. The refusal to participate in the elections is a political defeat, but participation in the elections would be an even bigger one for him, because he does not have any chances.
