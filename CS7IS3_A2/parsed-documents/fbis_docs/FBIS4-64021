The chamber set up a special commission to prepare the discussion. The move came from a woman deputy from the city of Tver, who complained that Omon policemen were "committing outrage" in her city, although she adduced no specific facts to confirm the statement. The woman said that Omon units "ran riot" in the city last October and that she saw no point in "appealing to Minister Viktor Yerin" in this context.
