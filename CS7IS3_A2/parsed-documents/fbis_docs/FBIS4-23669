Abiola. On Saturday [11 June], the anniversary of last year's abortive presidential election, the chief's aides announced that he had declared himself president and been sworn in before a crowd of thousands of supporters and that he had escaped from house arrest and was now in hiding. The Nigerian police say he is a wanted man and are offering a reward for his arrest. But now, the police are expressing doubts about whether the chief really did appear in public on Saturday. Nigerian journalist Eddy Iro has just flown in from Lagos. Robin White asked him if he shared those doubts: [Begin recording] [Iro] I think the swearing in never happened. I have met nobody, spoken to nobody who witnessed the swearing in. No newspaper in Nigeria carried it and Nigerian papers are very independent. Nobody could have stopped them from carrying a report of that swearing in if it took place. Even Abiola's own newspaper, the SUNDAY CONCORD -- a copy of which I had -- didn't carry the story. [White] So, did anything happen at all, do you think? [Iro] I have had reports that a recorded message was sent out from Chief Abiola, from wherever, I don't know. But I believe that this whole thing was targeted not at the Nigerian public, but at Western public opinion and Western media fell for it. [White] What would be the point of lying about something like this? [Iro] Well, this has been at this stage now more a propaganda war. He wrote to Vice President Al Gore to help him persuade the Nigerian military government to assume power and the question would be why would he be talking to Vice President Al Gore? [White] Do you have any idea where Abiola is? [Iro] I have absolutely no idea. The police have declared him wanted. He is presumably...[pauses] he is within Nigeria. I have also learned reliably that there has been a ban on private air flights because the last time he left Nigeria, he left in his private jet and I gather than the military government has banned all private flights within and outside Nigeria. [White] There has been a rumor, I think, that he might be in the American Embassy. Do you think that might be true? [Iro] It could be true because there was a statement issued by the police which covertly warned about foreign embassy involvement, foreign countries' involvement in this matter. There has been that suggestion that he might be in the American Embassy. But if he is declared wanted, one would expect the American Embassy officials to own up to his presence on their premises. At the time I left Lagos, they had not responded to any indication that he might be within their custody. [White] Do you think Abiola has won a trick or lost a trick over this weekend? [Iro] I think he has reduced his quest to something of a farce. If this was his idea of a swearing in, of assuming the presidency, I do not consider it a serious political challenge to the military government. I am by no means a supporter of this or any military government, I want to make that very clear, but I believe that the process of this entangling the military should continue through the National Constitutional Conference, the elections of which have been held and which should be getting to motion within the next week or two.
