The interview took place at his office in an elegant old house in a quiet, residential quarter of this city. Dr. Habash, well recovered from three serious strokes and sporting a cheerful burgundy red cardigan, spoke in both Arabic and English. The Cairo accord, which gives Israel full control of the border crossings from Jordan and Egypt into the West Bank and Gaza and full control of access roads to Jewish settlements with the right to pursuit of Palestinian militants continuing their resistance to the occupation, amounts to a "retreat for the PLO", Dr. Habash stated, a "retreat" from its own longterm policy of striving to secure "national rights, self-determination, independence and the right of return" for the Palestinian people. "The majority of Palestinians now oppose" Mr. 'Arafat's policies, "including members of Fatah closest to" him. Dr. Habash's assessment of the Cairo agreement would seem to be correct because on Feb. 10, the morning after it was signed, a commentator on Israeli Radio said that Israel's main reason for retaining control of the border crossings was to prevent Palestinian expelees from exercising their right to return to their homeland. Mr. 'Arafat, he stated, "was being pushed by all the major blocs and powers--Europe, the U.S., Japan--to offer more and more concessions to achieve implementation" of the Oslo accord, the signing of which led to the resignation of the PFLP from the PLO Executive Committee. He was particularly critical of Egyptian President, Husni Mubarak, who has been pressing the PLO to make these harmful concessions, and the U.S. which, he said, were acting "in their own interests" and not those of the Palestinian people. "'Arafat," Dr. Habash asserted, "had no chance to make gains (for the Palestinian people) but could only make concessions... all the world accepts Israel and all the world, except Israel, accepts the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination" but the pressure for concessions is on the Palestinians not on Israel. The Oslo accord, he went on, was seriously flawed because "all the substantive issues--Jerusalem, fixing borders, the Palestinian right of return, Israeli settlements--have been postponed until the last minute. How long will it take to reach agreement on these major issues when it takes so long to agree on trivial issues." "Even if (the Oslo accord) were to be implemented easily, it would never solve our Palestinian problem" because it "will never bring a just and comprehensive peace... We used to tell 'Arafat before he signed that agreement that he had to take certain steps before signing. First, adopt a policy based on implementation of the international legitimacy, by this I mean the U.N. resolutions" on Palestine calling for "Israeli withdrawal, recognition of Palestinian rights to repatriation and compensation and so on. Second, work for Arab unity and coordination, especially with Syria. Third, forge Palestinianian unity and fourth, escalate the intifadah... to force Israel to settle." These steps, particularly his insistance on Arab unity, have been part and parcel of Dr. Habash's strategy since he was head of the arab nationalist movement more than 30 years ago. Dr. Habash believed the Oslo accord would be undermined in three ways; "the intrasigence of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin; the Likud taking power (latest polls show that it would win an election) and development of the rejectionist camp," now comprising ten groups based in Damascus and the occupied territories. The main aim of this alliance is to "revitalise the intifadah," restoring it to the high intensity of 1988-89, concentrating on the Israeli economy when Israel suffered losses of $3 billion. I regret to say, and I mean this, without the armed struggle harming the Israeli economy, causing the Israeli army physical losses, Israel will never respond to our demands." He concluded by saying that no member of the alliance would take part in elections to the self-governing authority scheduled in July. At the PFLP's office in the al-Yarmuk quarter which was once a Palestinian refugee camp, Talal Ahmad, the official in charge of information, stated that the rejection front, the "Alliance of Palestinian Forces," was doing its "best to isolate 'Arafat" and promote "democratic decision-making." Mr. Ahmad said that the alliance had established an executive committee made up of one member from each group and had decided to "reestalish a unified national command" for the intifadah and set up a 100-member central council, comparable to that of the PLO, consisting of two representatives from each group and independents. Although each group would "act on its own" in the resistance, this was "the first time we have been able to establish such a broad coalition... previously Hamas and Islamic Jihad refused" to cooperate with the secularists, he stated. As long as the present confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis continues, the rejectionist forces would be able to operate as usual in the territories, but, Mr. Ahmad asserted, implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord would "complicate" the struggle because the Palestinian police would be a barrier between the intifadah and the Israelis." This would require a "new strategy" which was being developed. He was not worried about the possibility that the Syrians would curb the activities of the "alliance." "They will keep us until the last moment" to maintain pressure on Israel. "In any case," he went on, "we're transferring our operational bases to the territories. We have only our political and information offices here... our effectiveness is not dependent on Syria,"--a point made forcefully by the killing of two Israelis on 10 February by Islamic Jihad and the killing of a member of an Israeli undercover death squad by Hamas on Sunday.
