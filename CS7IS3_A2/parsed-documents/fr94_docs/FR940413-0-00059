FR940413-0-00059 FR940413-0-00023 The Council recommended that the first 60 percent of the annual whiting harvest guideline be available to all vessels in open competition with the remaining 40 percent reserved initially for shore-based activities. The Council recommended that after 60 percent has been harvested, no further at-sea processing be allowed for the remainder of the year or until August 15, when an additional portion of the harvest guideline would be made available pursuant to a NMFS assessment of how much of the harvest guideline will be utilized by shore-based processors during the remainder of the year. Any surplus to shore-based needs would be made available to all permitted vessels on or as soon as practicable after August 15. The Council recommended that the allocation scheme remain in effect for 3 years, 1994&hyph;1996. Any Pacific whiting harvested or processed in state ocean waters (0&hyph;3 nautical miles offshore) will be counted toward the EEZ limits. Additional Releases In the preamble to the proposed rule, comments were requested regarding the advisability of a second release of whiting after August 15 if necessary to ensure full utilization of the resource. The only comments relevant to the release date preferred a single release on October 15 rather than August 15 (see comment 6 below). A single release has been preferred by the industry in the past because of the confusion and logistical difficulties associated with multiple openings. NMFS agrees with the industry in preferring a single release, but recognizes that making accurate projections of shore-based needs is difficult. If it becomes obvious, after August 15, that shore-based needs have been substantially over-estimated, NMFS may release whiting at a later date, but only after consultation with the Council and only to ensure full utilization of the resource. The regulatory text at ยง663.23(b)(4)(ii), which authorizes the release of whiting as soon as practicable after August 15, has been revised to authorize additional reserve releases. Comments and Responses The comments in 11 letters received during the public comment period ending March 21, 1994, are summarized below. Three letters opposed all or part of the proposed rule, and eight supported it. Comments Opposing the Proposed Rule Comment 1: The allocation is not equitable_the benefits and burdens must be shared fairly. The shoreside reserve of 40 percent (104,000 mt in 1994) is too high, particularly since the shore-based industry has processed only about half this amount in its highest year. One commenter preferred a shoreside reserve of 35 percent. Another preferred allocations to be based on actual, demonstrated performance. Response: The Council's recommendation is a negotiated compromise that enables two sectors with differing operating needs to co-exist. The Council's industry subcommittee agreed to the use of a percentage allocation that benefits each sector when the harvest guideline is high and burdens each sector when it is low. In the preamble to the proposed rule, NMFS agreed that the benefit of an increased harvest guideline, as occurs in 1994, should be equitably shared between the at-sea and shore-based sectors, particularly since it is not expected to result in increased capitalization of either sector. The relatively high harvest guideline in 1994 results in the shore-based reserve for that year being higher than previous catch levels. If the entire reserve is not needed by the shoreside sector, the surplus will be released, increasing the amount available for processing at sea. The percentage level of the shoreside reserve was debated at great length within the industry subcommittee. A 35-percent level was considered, but was not supported by the subcommittee. NMFS believes the 40-percent level recommended by the Council is reasonable. Comment 2: The proposed rule fails to consider that, in the past, shoreside performance has fallen short of its preseason processing estimates. Response: This final rule sets the shore-based reserve at 40 percent, and is not dependent on an annual preseason processing estimate. Whiting surplus to shoreside needs will be made available for at-sea processing to assure that the resource is fully utilized. If the harvest guideline declines, the shoreside reserve may be more in line with past performance levels.
