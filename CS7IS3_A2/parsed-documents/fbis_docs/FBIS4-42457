At a news conference in parliament, Ecevit charged that instead of reconciling the two sides, the UN secretary general is trying to prevent that from happening. In this way, Ecevit said, the process of making the Greek Cypriot Republic a member of the European Union will be started. Ecevit pointed out that in this process, the Turkish Cypriot sector will be considered a part of the Greek Cypriot Republic. In the end, he warned, the Turkish Cypriots will be handed over to the Greek Cypriots and Cyprus will be attached to Greece de facto. This plot must be undone, he stressed. [Begin Ecevit recording] On the condition that the Turkish Cypriots agree, the TRNC must be an autonomous state completely independent in its domestic affairs, and attached to Turkey only in foreign security and international relations. There are two island states that are attached to Britain with such autonomous relations. [end recording]
