Hata told a plenary session of the House of Representatives that Japan's Constitution prohibits the country's involvement in collective security and that he has no intention of changing the conventional interpretation of the constitution on this issue. This was in response to a question from Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. The prime minister's remarks were apparently designed to ease apprehension among opposition legislators that his administration is moving toward more active involvement by Japan's Self-Defense Forces in international conflicts. Hata also denied that Japan had secretly agreed with the United States in 1969 to allow Washington to deploy nuclear arms on Okinawa island to defend Japan and America's other Asian allies. He was referring to a recent allegation in a book written by Kei Wakaizumi, former special emissary of then Prime Minister Cisaku Sato, that Sato and Nixon signed a top-secret memorandum at the White House on November 21, 1969, saying that Japan is aware of U.S. expectations for a favorable response to possible U.S. requests to deploy nuclear weapons on Okinawa in times of crisis.
