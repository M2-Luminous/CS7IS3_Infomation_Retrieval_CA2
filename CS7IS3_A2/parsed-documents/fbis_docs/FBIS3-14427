In Gaza, six residents were wounded by soldiers' fire, including an eight-year-old child who was wounded in the head and is being treated at al-Shifa' Hospital. [passage omitted] Serious clashes took place in other parts of Hebron too. Ten residents were wounded by fire and blows during these clashes. Yoram Binur reports: The incidents in Hebron today were particularly grave. Fatah's youths arrived at the central town square, erected roadblocks, and threw stones at the soldiers. Palestinian sources reported that 10 wounded people reached the town's hospitals. The debris of the Razzaq family's house in Hebron, where the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] wanted members were killed, became a site of pilgrimage today. The visitors were presented with the remnants of the missiles the Army fired at the building, as well as the live ammunition left there. In leaflets disseminated in Hebron today the Hamas takes pride in the fact that its members do not surrender. In Nabulus, clashes between residents and the Army continued today too. Tension in the territories is mounting, and among other things, the IDF is again sealing off alleys and doorways which were opened as a goodwill gesture in the framework of the peace agreement.
