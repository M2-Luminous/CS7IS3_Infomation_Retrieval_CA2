FR940228-2-00049 FR940228-2-00026 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [ATSDR&hyph;78] Revised Priority List of Hazardous Substances That Will Be the Subject of Toxicological Profiles AGENCY: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Public Health Service (PHS), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), requires that ATSDR and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annually revise the Priority List of Hazardous Substances to include additional substances most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). This announcement provides notice that the agencies have developed and are making available a revised CERCLA Priority List of 275 Hazardous Substances, based on the most recent information available to ATSDR and EPA. This revised priority list includes newly listed substances which have been determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health at or around NPL hazardous waste sites. Each substance on the priority list is a candidate to become the subject of a toxicological profile prepared by ATSDR and subsequent identification of priority data needs. ADDRESSES: Requests for a copy of the revised Priority List of Hazardous Substances, a copy of the ``Supplemental Document for the 1993 Revised Priority List of Hazardous Substances'', or comments on this notice should bear the docket control number ATSDR&hyph;78, and should be submitted to: ATSDR, Division of Toxicology, Quality Assurance Branch, Mail Stop E&hyph;29, 1600 Clifton Rd., NE., Atlanta, GA 30333. This is an informational notice only, and comments are not being solicited at this time. However, comments will be placed in a publicly accessible docket; therefore, please do not submit confidential business information. Electronic Availability: The 1993 Revised Priority List is available as an electronic file on The Federal Bulletin Board the day of publication in the Federal Register . By modem dial 202&hyph;512&hyph;1387 or call 202&hyph;512&hyph;1530 for disks or paper copies. This file is available in Wordperfect 5.1, Dbase III, and ASCII. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Quality Assurance Branch, Division of Toxicology, ATSDR, Atlanta, GA 30333, telephone (404) 639&hyph;6308. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: CERCLA establishes certain requirements for ATSDR and EPA with regard to hazardous substances which are most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA NPL. Section 104(i)(2) of CERCLA, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(2)), requires that the two agencies prepare a list, in order of priority, of at least 100 hazardous substances that are most commonly found at facilities on the NPL and which, in their sole discretion, are determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health (see 52 FR 12866, April 17, 1987). CERCLA also requires the agencies to revise the priority list to include 100 or more additional hazardous substances (see 53 FR 41280, October 20, 1988), and to include at least 25 additional hazardous substances in each of the three successive years following the 1988 revision (see 54 FR 43619, October 26, 1989; 55 FR 42067, October 17, 1990; 56 FR 52166, October 17, 1991). CERCLA also requires that ATSDR and EPA shall, not less often than once every year thereafter, revise the list to include additional hazardous substances which are determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health. Each substance on the CERCLA priority list of hazardous substances is a candidate to become the subject of a toxicological profile prepared by ATSDR and the subsequent identification of priority data needs.
