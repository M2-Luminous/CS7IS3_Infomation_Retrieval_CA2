Denny] [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- The African National Congress [ANC] on Thursday [14 April] demanded the immediate withdrawal of the visa of visiting American David Duke, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan and avowed right-winger. Mr Duke, a former U.S. congressional candidate, arrived in South Africa on Tuesday on a private visit. "His purpose here seems to be to stoke up the war psychosis which has already been ignited by a broad coalition of black and white right-wing extremists," the ANC said in a statement in Johannesburg. "He said on his arrival there had not been 300 years of oppression (in South Africa), but years of opportunity. "This country would be better off without this sort of malicious meddling in our affairs," the ANC said. South Africans did not need Mr Duke, the ANC said, adding that he should not be given time on radio or television to air his "noxious" views. "The ANC demands the immediate withdrawal of his visit permit to South Africa."
