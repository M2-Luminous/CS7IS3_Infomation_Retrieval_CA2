That is the vein in which the government's recently announced drug law proposal was received. Three ministers labored months to produce an initiative that had been expected to supersede the present failed drug policy. But: "It is hardly a revolution, closer to an expansion of the previous approach," said Per Kalund, chairman of the County Council Association. Even so, he is willing to go along with it because the counties will play a central role in the new structure. Among other things, they will supervise the whole methadone treatment program. In contrast, the Physicians' Association was very critical of the plan. Chairman Torben Pedersen pointed out the plan's inadequate economic basis: "It is clear from the proposal that the government does not have any intention of allocating the necessary funding for an approach that could improve the lot of drug addicts." Instead, the government has tossed the ball to the counties and local government. The most concrete item in the proposal is a change in the law that guarantees that the district in which a drug addict resides will pay a portion of the treatment when the county deems treatment is necessary. "All things being equal, a change in the law could facilitate an expansion of treatment programs and ensure more uniform treatment throughout the country," said Kalund. He stressed, however, that an expansion of this kind would necessarily require additional financing, either through an increased general appropriation or higher county and local taxes. But the government intends for the improvements to be made without an increase in public expenditure. [passage omitted] According to the proposal, the problems drug addicts experience will be solved by expanding overnight shelter facilities. These have been drastically cut in recent years, but now they will be tried again. At the same time, it is suggested that local authorities set up cooperative-type living arrangements along with various types of day centers that would offer addicts support on a daily basis. Otherwise, both the goals and the methods for combating the ongoing battle against drugs is virtually identical to the present policy. The government would like to step up prevention through new informational campaigns. The proposal also stresses the necessity for more intensive research in this field. It is the government's basic intention to aim at prevention and treatment at the expense of law enforcement. Nevertheless it is clear from the proposal that police activity will be maintained at its present level. This means that the police will continue to rake in the major share of the resources available to drug abatement programs. The numerous objections to police crackdown policy verbalized by prominent Danish experts such as High Court Judge Hans Henrik Brydsensholt, Public Prosecutor Erik Merlung, as well as by a number of other thoughtful people, did not in the end make the slightest dent in the politicians' mind-set. The proposal backed off from any consideration of liberalization. The proposal states this very clearly: "No spokesman for legalization has been able to present a cohesive and viable alternative to the present law enforcement policy. To the contrary, there are solid arguments for rejecting this alternative." [passage omitted]
