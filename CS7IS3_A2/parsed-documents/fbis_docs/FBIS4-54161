At the summit with former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in February, U.S. President Bill Clinton had to be tough toward Japan. Because his administration had criticized the former Bush government as being weak-kneed toward Japan, Clinton had to adopt a result-oriented policy in talks with Hosokawa on macroeconomic measures to rescue the Japanese economy and on such trade sectors as automobiles, auto parts, and insurance, which symbolize the trade ties between the two countries. Moreover, at the time, he was severely criticized at home for the Whitewater land deal. To ease the criticism and win in an off-year election scheduled for September, Clinton had to disprove the evaluation of him that "although the President makes courageous remarks, he does nothing." Thus, he could not say "yes" to Japan's macroeconomic measures, including a single-year tax cut plan. I believe Washington's attitude began to change in mid-March. When I visited the United States in early April with other Fuji Xerox executives, I met with a top manager of a U.S. company. This influential businessman criticized the whole span of the Clinton administration's trade policies toward Japan and other countries, saying: "Its policies are too hard to bring a solution." In the background of his criticism, there is the fact that the Japanese bureaucrats' repeated assertion that "the United States is demanding the setting of numerical targets, which would lead to managed trade" has gradually been accepted in Europe and other countries, and this tendency is also seen in the United States. I am sure Washington feels resentment against this trend, but.... [as published] Circumstances surrounding the U.S. economy have also changed. Washington now has to check inflation. It has changed its exchange policy to prevent the dollar from further depreciating. The policy is different from that adopted in February, when high-ranking U.S. Government officials repeatedly made remarks in favor of the appreciation of the yen and the depreciation of the dollar. Japan Should Not Presume on a Soft U.S. Stance Even some U.S. Government officials have begun to question the Clinton administration's excessive emphasis on economic issues in its diplomacy. Thus, it would be no surprise if the United States tries to seek cooperation from Japan in dealing with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), which was a little too tough in the trade talks, is also criticized for its hard-line policy. How should Japan respond to the change in the U.S. attitude? I think when the government makes a decision on tax reform during June, it should decide to implement income tax cuts next year and the year after as well. Also, it should indicate as many specific measures as possible to open wider Japanese markets in its external economic policy outline. In view of the fact that the Hata Cabinet is a minority government, Washington will not make urgent demands. But Japan should not give the impression that it is presuming on a soft U.S. stance. It also should not think that "we win because we are right, and because we are right the United States has begun to show the white flag." Such things are necessary because if Japan-U.S. relations worsen, it will have an adverse impact on the economies of not only the two nations but also Asia and the world. "The Japan-U.S. relationship is the most important in the world." This famous phrase is what former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mike Mansfield said when he plainly described the gravity of Japan-U.S. relations. President Clinton has also made similar remarks. Historically, Japan has followed the same path as the United States for half a century, since WWII ended in 1945. There are numerous things in Japan that have been influenced by the United States. They include the Constitution, the education system, and the market control system, which has formed the Japanese economy's foundation. Economically, Japan-U.S. trade occupies a overwhelmingly large portion of world trade. The relationship of interdependence, or what can be called the unification of the two countries, has rapidly progressed since the eighties. Now, without Japanese-made parts, U.S. industries cannot flourish. Conversely, U.S.-made software is holding up the Japanese high-tech industry. As such, a firm mutual aid system has been erected. When the world economy's growth is slowing down, what should Japan and the United States do to maintain their mature, huge economies' growth while respecting each other's position? This is an important question of the day. What is important to the future is the Japan-U.S.relationship in Asia. The economies of China and other Asian countries are rapidly growing. Naturally, Japan has an interest in these areas. The United States also tries to make inroads into Asian markets, and it is considering preventing Japan from monopolizing the markets. Meanwhile, Asian countries strongly hope that Japan and the United States maintain their close relationship because they want to seek cooperation from the United States in security and big technology arenas, and cooperation from Japan in technology for civilian products and economic fields. Japan Needs To Make Known Its Efforts to Other Countries Some people argue that the United States, which always seeks a target for its hostility, will target Japan, instead of the Soviet Union, now that the Soviet Union no longer exists in the post-Cold War era. This is not a lie, but we should not attach exaggerated importance to it. The major cause for the worsening of bilateral relations is Japan's trade surplus. It is inevitable that other countries call the current situation abnormal, in which Japan continuously registers a huge surplus in trade with not only the United States but also the European Union (EU) and Asian countries. We also have to think it abnormal. However, some economic experts point out that figures about Japan's trade surplus are inaccurate because services trade is belittled in calculating them. Even so, the problem is that there is actually a widely accepted view that because of Japan's trade surplus, many Americans have lost their jobs. It is said that although the United States imports many Japanese-made goods, Japan has closed its markets to U.S. products by exercising unfair trade practices. This assertion has spread with exaggeration and has deepened U.S. distrust of Japan. This cannot be ignored. Japan needs to take actions to reduce its trade surplus, and make known its efforts to other countries. We should think that objective criteria and numerical targets discussed in the Japan-U.S. trade talks are aimed at reducing Japan's trade surplus. They are not fundamental, grave issues between Japan and the United States. There are arguments that although the United States has a 20- percent share in the world market, its market share in Japan is a mere 2-3 percent, and this is unusual; and that the United States lacks efforts to increase its market share in Japan. The issue of setting objective criteria is different in nature from such unproductive arguments. The purpose of setting objective criteria is to have some mutually agreeable, qualitative, and quantitative yardsticks to gauge the effectiveness of trade surplus-cutting and market-opening measures. If it is difficult for the Japanese and U.S. Governments to set up objective criteria, the private sector should take over the task. And with the agreed criteria, the two nations should equally promote the opening up of their markets. Ozawa Should Play a Role as Coordinator Once the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks reopen, we have to make sure that they function properly this time. To that end, we need able men on both sides who are capable of easing the trade friction. On the Japanese side, (Shinseito Chief Secretary) Ichiro Ozawa should come to the front to become a major cabinet minister so he can play a role as coordinator in a dignified manner. Acting as coordinator in his present position would be questioned at home and in the United States. On the U.S. side, Vice President Al Gore should be prepared to come to the front. I also would like to propose establishing a consultative body comprising not only politicians and bureaucrats but also private sector representatives. Because the Hata Cabinet is a minority government, it is uncertain what will happen after the 1994 budget bill clears the Diet. This may be the reason that politicians are reluctant to make clear-cut remarks. The politicians' evasive attitude will make it inevitable to put a lot of weight on bureaucrats, but excessive weight on the administration is undesirable. I think if private sector representatives participate in the trade talks and raise questions, this will help cut back dominance by bureaucrats. The important thing is for Japan to actually reduce its trade surplus. Opening up of the Japanese autos, auto parts, and insurance markets is a main topic in the Japan-U.S. trade talks. Japan should actively correct Japanese companies' management and traditional business practices because they are major obstacles to opening these markets. Japan also needs to reduce the number of government regulations. Deregulation will help increase Japan's imports and give an opportunity to people in the monetary, communications, broadcasting, and other sectors to create new businesses. A system should be established under which workers, who become jobless because of deregulation, can find new jobs in other sectors. Moreover, Japan needs to increase its public works investment, especially in new social infrastructure. It is important for the nation to improve social infrastructure to better the quality of lives, and to set up information and communications networks, an area in which Japan lags behind the United States. Also, the government should reduce its expenditures without complaining about the severe financial condition. Japan must carry out these things on its behalf, although it will bring pain to the nation. It should stop producing everything. It should entrust some industries to other nations. I believe this is the duty Japan should fulfill as an advanced nation.
