Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro signed the joint statement this afternoon at the end of Cristiani's official visit to Nicaragua, which started on Thursday. Chamorro and Cristiani reaffirmed their support for a proposal to create the Central American Social Investment Fund Against Poverty. It was agreed to create this fund in the Central American Bank for Economic Integration to alleviate poverty. In addition, Chamorro and Cristiani encouraged the international community to support this proposal both technically and financially to carry out programs and projects aimed at stimulating human development. The presidents agreed that perfecting the integration process requires joining forces with the social and human development aspects to overcome poverty. The two presidents expressed satisfaction over the recent signing of an agreement creating a Permanent Central American Commission for the Eradication of Production, Trafficking, Consumption, and Illegal Use of Narcotics and Psycotropic Substances, and Related Crimes. They agreed to create bilateral cooperation mechanisms for the "timely" treatment of matters that, because of their importance, deserve the area governments' joint attention. They also expressed interest in developing a means of communication that can improve relations between the two countries. In this regard, they agreed to update a study to eventually resume the ferry service between El Salvador and Nicaragua on the Gulf of Fonseca. They also agreed to keep conducting studies to modernize the ports of Potosi in Nicaragua and La Union in El Salvador on this same gulf. The presidents also admitted the need to keep in force the strategies and policies adopted within the framework of the International Association of Coffee-Producing Countries and the International Coffee Withholding Plan, strategies and policies which make it possible to get a realistic price of coffee. Chamorro and Cristiani, upon considering the effects of NAFTA, reaffirmed their desire to temporarily receive benefits similar to those in the agreement until Central America definitively joins this instrument.
