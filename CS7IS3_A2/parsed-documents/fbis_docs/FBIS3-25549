The third convention of the MPD, which has been in power since January 1991 following the first free legislative elections in Cape Verde, took place 19-20 February in the Cape Verdian capital and solidified the divisions within the party, resulting in the departure of the former labor and justice minister, Eurico Monteiro, and several other leaders. Monteiro had contested the way the chairman of the MPD was designated and announced that he would create a new party. Among the new leaders of the MPD are Communication Minister Ondina Ferreira, Territorial Administration Minister Mario Silva, Fisheries and Agriculture Minister Helena Semedo, and National Assembly Speaker Amilcar Spencer Lopes. The divisions within the MPD began several months ago with the resignation of the ministers of foreign affairs, justice and labor, and health. The first two blamed the prime minister for having kept in place the Cape Verdian ambassador to Portugal, who was accused of using government funds for personal use. The former single party, the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde [PAICV], in power for 17 years, demanded the holding of early elections due to the crisis within the MPD. The PAICV has 22 deputies at the National Assembly compared with 56 for the MPD.
