What Political Baggage the U.S. President Is Bringing With Him to Russia"] [Text] For some time now summits, as these top-level meetings are traditionally called, have been an inexhaustible source of inspiration for caricaturists. In fact cartoonists started mining this vein of gold well before the era of Gorbachevian perestroyka, back in the days when the Soviet Union still existed as one of the two superpowers. Our editorial files contain a copy of the American magazine NEWSWEEK which carried items about two interlinked events. The magazine announced the election of RSFSR Supreme Soviet Chairman B.N. Yeltsin, calling him a "talented demagogue." Alongside this report, a column of humorous remarks opens with a comment from Gorbachev which he let drop in a conversation with some Americans on a Washington street: "I really feel at home here!" Alas, they were already openly mocking us, enjoying the joke to the full and rubbing their tummies with glee. But what can we say now about these so-called summits?! On the eve of the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting scheduled for 12-15 January, the British newspaper THE TIMES took the liberty of giving the U.S. President a few practical recommendations. THE TIMES believes that it is pointless for the West to be soft on Russia and try to "placate" Yeltsin since "Russia is no longer a superpower or an equal partner, and Yeltsin," THE TIMES claims, "is a caricature rather than a politician." Therefore, it says, Clinton, who is well known for wanting to please everybody, might not on this occasion demonstrate this trait in his character because "he should not refuse to be confrontational toward Russia." Needless to say, THE TIMES reasons, Russia will not like the U.S. position, particularly on such a sore point as the enlargement of NATO through the addition of Russia's former Warsaw Pact partners, the East and Central European countries, but "in the final analysis that is Russia's business." We do not know whether Clinton will heed this advice, but this is what Vice President Al Gore stated the other day on his behalf: "The United States resolutely supports plans to bring NATO and East Europe closer together." The traditional list of questions on the agenda of the Gorbachev era -- "bread, milk, flour, etc." -- will naturally still receive emphasis, but the topic of using Western loans to support reform has long set teeth on edge, and it is now totally clear that America is at best prepared only to make gestures involving charitable aid, and even this is limited to gestures that will yield greater dividends on the purely propaganda level. House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, the U.S. Moscow Embassy information bulletin reported, has delivered a very emotional report entitled "New Partnership: Relations Between the United States, Russia, and the New Independent States." The report contains a passage about the congressman's personal impressions of Moscow, which are capable of wringing tears even from people with hearts of stone: "...The price of bread has risen from 10 kopeks to 40 rubles [R], i.e. by 4,000 percent. Even though shelves in stores are full, by no means everybody can afford these goods.... On one of the central streets of Moscow three wretched children with sad faces sat begging -- their dirty, skinny hands in torn gloves stretched toward me brought to mind the era of Charles Dickens." We must suppose that attempts will be made to shield Bill Clinton from this sort of distressing encounter on the Moscow streets. Moreover, the Missouri Democrat's news about the price of Russian bread is already relatively stale -- these days, alas, Russians can only dream about loaves costing R40; they now cost approximately R300. But if such an encounter were to take place, how could the U.S. President comfort the child beggars? THE WASHINGTON POST has reported that Clinton intends not to increase, but on the contrary to cut aid to foreign states. Nevertheless we may assume that Clinton will not leave B.N. Yeltsin without any support whatsoever; Yeltsin is the man whom the U.S. President once enthusiastically called "our guy!" Many things have bound Clinton and Yeltsin together closely, particularly during the past year, marked by bloody events. On the eve of the U.S. President's visit to Moscow it is appropriate to remind readers that this trip could have taken place last year -- immediately after the declaration of special rule in Russia. At the time the U.S. Government circulated the transcript of a Clinton news conference held 23 March 1993. Let us cite some excerpts from this document: Question. Don't you think your visit to Moscow could drag the United States too deeply into the power struggle in the (Russian) capital? Answer. I would like to go to the meeting with an "aggressive" and very specific U.S. aid plan.... Question. What policy will the United States opt for if the Soviet legislators vote to impeach President Yeltsin, which looks extremely likely? Will you continue to regard Yeltsin as the legitimately elected leader of Russia? Answer. Today that is precisely how I see him. He is the only (nationally) elected figure. The rest take their cue from a Constitution adopted in the Communist era. Right now I do not wish to consider other possible responses.... However, additional information about these "other possible responses" was then supplied on the pages of THE NEW YORK TIMES by a ranking White House Administration spokesman who wished to remain anonymous. He implied that the United States would resolutely support Yeltsin if he assumed emergency powers: "If Yeltsin suspends the activity of the undemocratic parliament, this will not necessarily be an undemocratic act." And so in October the U.S. Administration unconditionally approved of Yeltsin's order to open fire. At the same time it is still not entirely clear: Was the administration merely an indirect party to this command, whereupon the whole world looked on, stunned, as tanks opened fire on the Russian parliament?! One thing cannot be doubted: The Russian president is not the only person whom the events of September-October 1993 will come back to haunt. On the eve of Clinton's arrival in Moscow, the British newspaper THE DAILY TELEGRAPH quoted some spiteful words by Zhirinovskiy. In response to the U.S. President's refusal to meet with him in Moscow, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party called Clinton a coward and advised him to "stay at home and play his saxophone." It is, incidentally, entirely possible that Clinton will bring his saxophone with him, but the question of what else he will be carrying in his Moscow baggage remains open at the present time....
