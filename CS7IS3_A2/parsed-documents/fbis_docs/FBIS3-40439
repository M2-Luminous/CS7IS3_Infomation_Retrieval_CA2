The outline project for the rocket, that has been named ESL (European Small Launcher), is already ready and the definitive study, which should be finished by the end of June 1994, is about to start. The French company SEP [European Propulsion Company] and the Italian company BPD (Fiat group) will participate in the study. The determining factor for the new carrier will be the very contained launching cost: $20 million to put one tonne into orbit at a height of 700 kilometers. This cost is analogous with that planned by Lockheed for its new LLV mini launcher that should make its debut sometime this year. A market comprising "numerous launches" each year can be foreseen for the ESL to meet European requirements alone. The small carrier could be used for telecommunications satellites to be put into low orbits ("constellations" of the Iridium type, Globalstar, Odyssey, Ellipso, Aries, Taos and other commercial satellites), for remote sensing in polar orbits, scientific research, and military applications (electronic monitoring, surveillance, and telecommunications). The payload (also for multiple launches) can vary from 100 kilograms to be put into any type of orbit, to 1000 kilograms in orbit at a height of 700 kilometers. The launcher should be extremely reliable (0.99) and have an acceleration that can be sustained without damaging the equipment (7G) that can be put into orbit with good precision. The payloads will be able to have a cylindrical volume 4.8 meters high and 2.2 meters wide. Initially it is planned that there will be two launches a year, and these will increase later to between five and 10. The ESL will be a solid-fuel, three-stage rocket (the same as the boosters of the Ariane-5) plus a final liquid fuel propulsor. The rocket will be 25 meters high, have a diameter of 2.6 meters, and weigh 121 tonnes. The thrust at take-off will be 173 tonnes. It is planned to use the same platform as for the Ariane-5 for the launch. The first two stages are identical, each one requiring 51.2 tonnes of fuel and built of a composite material (carbon fiber) which gives a six percent reduction in weight with respect to metal. The same material is used for the third stage that will require 7.2 tonnes of fuel. The fourth stage, which gives the final trajectory to put the satellite into circular orbit, will account for 260 kilograms of hydrazine that will feed six burners. It is estimated that the investment for the development will be about 500 billion lire over four and a half years. If the realization of the project is approved at the beginning of 1995, it will be possible to make the first launch in 1999.
