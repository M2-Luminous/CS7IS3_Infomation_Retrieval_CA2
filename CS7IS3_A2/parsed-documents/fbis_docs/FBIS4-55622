Klaus made his remarks at a meeting with Austrian Vice-Chancellor Erhard Busek. Busek had stressed the sensitivity of the question for Austrian citizens, Klaus told journalists. "On the other hand the vice-chancellor is also aware that the Czech power situation is not easy, no easy solutions exist and that the issue cannot be allowed to complicate and hamper future Czech-Austrian relations," Klaus said. He said he discussed with Busek measures aimed at the revival of mutual relations, including those on an official level. He pointed to his planned visit to the Salzburg festival in August at which he could meet several Austrian politicians. Klaus stressed that Czech and Austrian views on many European problems were "very close."
