This is accepting a reality; it is also an indirect way of reaffirming Europe's role in an issue in which it seemed increasingly marginalized by the American initiatives in favor of a Croatian-Muslim federation and by the diplomatic activities of the Russian deputy foreign minister. Finally, it is the expression of a deep conviction, namely that there can be no lasting political solution to the war in the former Yugoslavia without the involvement of Washington and Moscow alongside the Europeans. With regard to the United States, this stance is not new; with regard to Russia, it may seem paradoxical to the extent that it is accompanied by a "change," not to say a "hardening," of French statements with regard to Boris Yeltsin's government and especially its behavior in what [Foreign Minister] Andrey Kozyrev likes to call "the near abroad." Is it possible both to remind the Russians of the need to respect international rules when they intervene in the former Soviet republics, in the Caucasus or Tajikistan, and hail as "very positive" the role played by the Kremlin in the former Yugoslavia, including the unexpected arrival of Russian soldiers in Bosnia? It probably is in the short term. Even if they arrived without warning, the Russians came to Sarajevo to support the implementation of UN decisions and supported the NATO ultimatum to the Serbian forces, willingly or unwillingly. In Krajina, Deputy Minister Churkin helped bring about a cease-fire between the Croatians and Serbs. He also seemed to be in the best position to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to seek an arrangement with the Croatian-Muslim federation, despite his apparent failure in Gorazde, or perhaps because of that failure, to the extent that Radovan Karadzic can come to the negotiating table with new trump cards. It is therefore understandable that the French foreign minister should welcome Moscow's action. In the medium and long terms, however, the situation is less clear. Nothing proves that the Russians have the same concept of the Balkans' future as the Western countries. It would probably even be tempted to think the opposite, if there was any certainty that a clear concept existed Europe and the United States. Whatever the facts, Russia has returned to the shores of the Adriatic for the first time in decades; to think that its Yugoslav policy is part of a broader concern about regaining a position as a superpower is not to insult it. Their well-cut suits and their impeccable English does not alter the fact that the current leaders of Russian diplomacy were trained in the Soviet school, brutal but effective. Hence the safeguards which Alain Juppe publicly defined in his recent statements with regard to Russia and those which are being whispered in diplomatic circles. The foreign minister pointed out "a resurgence in nationalist spirit" and an "undoubted hardening of foreign policy" following the December elections. During its interventions in the former USSR, the Russian Army must respect the international rules, and those of the United Nations and the CSCE; it should not receive restrospective clearance for actions decided without consultation, nor should it obtain financial support, as Moscow is demanding. Russia is no doubt legitimately interested in maintaing the stability of its borders, and the Western countries, which do not want to send troops to the Caucasus or to Central Asia, would show bad grace in systematically criticizing the presence of Russian soldiers. Nevertheless, Russia should still respect the international community's procedures. The Baltic states are a special case; Alain Juppe reaffirmed that their territorial integrity should be respected and that the Russian Army should pull out of Latvia and Estonia according to the timetable set by the agreements, without "conditioning" the withdrawal of troops to the status of Russian-speakers living in these countries. France quietly regrets the fact that its EU partners are not making themselves clear enough on this point; when Moscow showed the intention of maintaining military bases in Latvia (before attributing this announcement by Boris Yeltsin to a "technical error"), Paris suggested that the Twelve should protest, but this was not followed. The Europeans, like the Americans, do not really know how to react to Russia; they are still afraid of encouraging the nationalist tendencies of people like Zhirinovskiy with an excessively hard stance, while knowing that the Kremlin is taking advantage of this to move its pawns forward. By rash statements (relations with the Baltic countries are an "internal matter," the Russian defense minister said, for instance) and decisions which are annulled if resistance is stronger than expected, Russia is destabilizing its neighbors, testing the Western countries, and creating faits accomplis. Each advance does not deserve a response in itself, but their accumulation changes certain situations; this is the technique of erosion, which is reminiscent of the "salami tactics" -- one slice after another -- used after World War II. In Paris' opinion, this new attitude by Russian diplomacy, which Minister Kozyrev described in a fictional political scenario back in December 1992, should lead Western countries to be more vigilant. This does not rule out cooperation with Moscow, quite the reverse, nor the continuation of aid given to the political reforms and the transition to the market economy. The policy toward Eastern Europe should be twofold: association with the EU and the WEU [Western European Union], its defense organization, for the states of Central Europe and the Baltic Republics which want to become full members of the EU; cooperation with Russia, within the scope of the Partnership for Peace proposed by NATO and the economic partnership agreement currently being negotiated in Brussels. This is on the understanding that Moscow cannot be given a right of veto on the entry of Central European states into the EU or WEU or a special status in all-European organizations (Partnership for Peace, CSCE, or Council of Europe), which would amount to creating a kind of condominium by the Western countries and Russia over the former countries of the Warsaw Pact. Russia wants to be present everywhere but is invoking its superpower status to bypass common rules; it is acting in the same way with regard to Balladur's stability pact, which was accepted by the Twelve: It wants to participate in the Paris conference at the end of May, but it would like special treatment so as not to be put on the same level as the small European states with vulgar quarrels among neighbors. "The problems of security and stability in Europe will not be solved without Russia's participation," Alain Juppe rightly maintains. But great progress is still needed to define clear rules of common life, and especially to ensure that they are respected.
