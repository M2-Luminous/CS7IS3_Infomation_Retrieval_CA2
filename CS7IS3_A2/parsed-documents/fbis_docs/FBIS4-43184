Today, Mikhailidhis will have successive talks with the representatives of the 15 UN Security Council member states and Alternate UN Secretary General Marrack Goulding. In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in New York, the foreign minister said that a new report by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is unjustified and will set a bad precedence. He added that the recent talks between Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas do not justify the issuing of a new report. Referring to the telephone conversation between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and President Glavkos Kliridhis, Mikhailidhis said that the call was designed to encourage efforts on the confidence-building measures procedure to continue. Discussing the U.S. position, Mikhailidhis rejected claims that Cyprus-U.S. relations are being disturbed, describing them as relations of continuous and close communication. Mikhailidhis will meet the UN secretary general on Thursday [16 June]. It has not yet been decided whether he will go to Washington for talks with U.S. State Department officials.
