The old system's foundations have already been demolished. Transformations are now irreversible. We have also demolished the old system of management and production, the centralized distribution of resources, material benefits, and labor. On the whole, we have introduced a change from guided price formation to a free pricing practice that reflects sales opportunities. The state will regulate only a small list of the socially important goods and services. The state has eliminated restrictions with regard to wages in the production sphere and services. The "Iron Curtain" in foreign trade has been eliminated and demonopolization has been carried out. The influx of foreign investments to the country's economy has considerably increased. The radical reform of the budget and banking system is continuing, with a view of adapting them to civilized norms. The loan capital and currency markets are being created, labor and housing markets are expanding. We are changing our view on property. At present, the process of dismantling of state ownership is quite active and conditions are created for further privatization of state enterprises. The institution of private property is being granted the same kind of rights as the state in terms of economic relations and public attitude. [passage omitted] At present, Kazakhstan is living through an extremely difficult social and economic crisis, which is unique in a sense. First, crisis is something that accompanies any market economy. All the developed countries, at one stage or another, had to face it. The main thing is to minimize its consequences, speed up the rate of lifting the country's economy out of this crisis. Nobody ever succeeded in escaping it. Unfortunately, we had to start with a crisis stage. Second, Kazakhstan has gained its sovereignty at a time of obvious crisis manifestations, caused by deficiencies in the administrative methods of economy management, which have exhausted themselves. Third, the crisis that we are living through has been caused by the disintegration of the old economic system and the need to establish a new one. [passage omitted] The main reason for the deepening crisis is the disintegration of the USSR. Kazakhstan's economy, on the day of it gained independence was a part of the powerful and monolithic economy of the USSR, which used to fulfill its own local tasks. [passage omitted] We also inherited an unbalanced trade balance, especially with Russia. In 1990 we imported produce worth 18 billion rubles (in prices of that time) and exported goods worth half of this sum. This negative balance is now being treated as the state debt of the country, which affects the state budget. Under the worsening financial situation, under the conditions of the open market and with prices for fuel approaching the world level, Kazakhstan has overproduced such commodities as meat, phosphorus, fertilizers, tractors, cement, and others. The market for Kazakhstan's goods is restricted mainly by the CIS space. Consumers, both domestic and internal, have become more choosy in selecting goods, taking into account both quality, quantity, and price. The volumes of production of the once strategically important types of goods exceed the domestic needs of the country. Due to their quality and absence of experience in foreign market's trading they do not have a reliable and stable market outside Kazakhstan. [passage omitted] Animal husbandry in agriculture is inefficient with its high prices for forage and absence of selectivity [sentence as received]. We have extremely high volumes of grain production that exceed the needs of the country. The areas under crops are extremely large and, at the same time, we have low crop capacity. [passage omitted]. Third [as received], [words indistinct] market forces have encouraged the creation and development of new sectors of economy, new economic businesses, and operations. They have filled the void and begun to bring the country's economy in compliance with new demands. At the preliminary stage, entrepreneurs channeled their efforts to the circulation sphere, as the most efficient for private business. Trade and the service sphere, which used to occupy a small place before, is being developed rapidly. [Word indistinct] an active process of redistribution of the capital and work force, a more flexible movement of commodity resources in accordance with the demands of the market economy have started as a result of appearance of [words indistinct] in some other spheres of the economy. [passage omitted] We have compatible enterprises in all the spheres of economy, in order for them to survive and develop we need large investments, both external and internal. But all the long-term spendings are possible under one condition that the inflation rate will remain at a level not higher than 10 percent. The issue is to improve the economy financially. That will make internal investments possible. The population will have a stimulus for accumulating capital [words indistinct] and modernizing production. We need a tough financial policy by the National Bank, no matter how difficult this may be. There is no other alternative. The efficiency of the market economy's policy and practical activity, which is being conducted by the government, apart from objective factors, is being impeded by certain unthoughtful steps and decisions, mistakes. [passage omitted] The old parliament was too slow to follow the dynamics of the socio-economic and political processes. [Word indistinct] elaboration of laws, there were around 300 of them, have been too quick and done without approbation. Quite often deputies were used as machines for voting. At the same time, drafts of the certain legal acts on the most urgent problems of state and economic life have been left unexamined. Among them is the draft program of the legal reform that was submitted for consideration by the parliament two years ago. Its adoption would have helped to make considerable changes in this sphere and would not have made possible the acuteness of the constitutional reform problem. [passage omitted] The banking system has not been prepared to work under new conditions. Wide-scale and nonregulated liberalization of banking activity, unrestricted freedom of activity of commercial banks, imperfect legislation, and unprepared financial and credit policies of the state for the market economy's principles and conditions have resulted in the situation where negative tendencies became domineering. The fact that we are lagging behind with the reform in the banking system, slows down the adaptation of production to market conditions, its diversification, and the development of market forces. [passage omitted] The government is too slow in tackling the topical issues, it has not elaborated the procedure and mechanism of bankruptcy. Its tax policy and practice, as well as its policy in many other issues is not up to the mark. The government has been slow in creating the market of securities, insurance policy, creating a civilized market infrastructure. There are a lot of serious problems in dismantling, managing state property and state owned enterprises. [passage indistinct]. Society focuses its attention on Legislative and Executive Branches of power, ignoring judicial. At the same time, the court is the most important element in the defending rights and freedoms of people. The Judicial Branch of power in Kazakhstan has not yet found its place. [passage omitted] Recognizing the mistakes that have been made, we at the same time, should understand that Kazakhstan, its political and state leadership along with society, are in the process of learning, mastering the new, and implementing large-scale transformations. The situation in the country could have been worse. [passage indistinct]. At the same time, political stability depends on the economic situation. Therefore, furthering the economic reform also becomes a political problem. [passage omitted] The moment that we are living through is illustrative in the sense that the old economic system has stopped being an integral system, and the roots of the new one are not yet strong enough. The only way of supporting them and stabilizing the economy is to facilitate rates of transformations. We should not waste our time. This will not make the situation easier, it will just elongate and over complicate things. Last year and the beginning of the present year have shown this vividly. We will still have to travel a long and difficult journey. The main thing is to draw our lessons from accumulated experience and make amends to the program of reforms. [passage indistinct] In general we know what to do next: These are the dismantling and privatization of state ownership, anti-inflationary policy, minimization of budget deficits and the positive balance of payments, introduction of a tough mechanism of bankruptcy, liberalization of prices, trade, and the creation of a competitive environment. The problem that the political leadership of the country is facing today is: A) Either to conduct the policy of reforms, as before and at the same rate, with due consideration taken of the available resources. It essentially means counting on our own resources and the introduction of maximum restrictions in the social sphere; or B) Taking into consideration the general situation, to choose something new and make amends to the current policy so as to ensure higher dynamism and efficiency of reforms. Until now we conducted the policy of minimizing the budget deficit, suppressing inflation, increasing taxes, and restricting spendings. Such a financial policy has contributed to a much quicker formation of market relation and, at the same time, has resulted in a crisis in the social sphere. The beginning of the current year has shown that reduction of spendings in this particular sphere has reached its limit, which is unacceptable by the population. Behind it is the degradation and disintegration of a number of branches of industry. [passage indistinct]
