During a meeting with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, the state of economic and trade relations between both countries was discussed, while possibilities for investing in Poland were the topic of a conversation with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy. It was agreed during the meeting with Pawlak that both countries' ministers responsible for commerce would prepare a list of goods for mutual trade. The establishment of mutual banking contacts was also considered important. The balance of foreign trade was also discussed. The balance is unfavorable to Poland. In 1992, there was a negative balance of approximately $280 million. The deficit is due, among other things, to large imports of Thai consumer goods, mostly textile products (clothing and underwear), by private companies. Thailand is ready to invest capital in Polish markets, Sejm Speaker Oleksy said after the meeting with Thailand's deputy prime minister. On Thursday [17 March], on the third and last day of the visit, the Thai politician will be received by President Lech Walesa and will meet journalists.
