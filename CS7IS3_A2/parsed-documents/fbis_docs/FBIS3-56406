This opinion was expressed in an interview on BBC radio by UK Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, commenting on the decisions of the session of the North Atlantic bloc council which has ended in Brussels. He stressed that London feels no special enthusiasm for the policy of intimidation by air strikes because British servicemen form part of the NATO forces on the ground engaged in delivering humanitarian aid to the population. Ending the war in former Yugoslavia is not the task of the United Nations: It cannot be achieved by military measures from outside, the head of the military department pointed out. The international contingent's objective is to ensure the normal delivery of humanitarian aid to tens of thousands of innocent people.
