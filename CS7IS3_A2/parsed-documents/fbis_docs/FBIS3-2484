The revised version of the draft law is ready to be promulgated, said members of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) at its Sixth Session, which started on Tuesday. They suggested that it be passed during this session, which ends this Saturday [5 March]. To safeguard the interests of investors from Taiwan by law will be conducive to encourage more companies, enterprises, organizations or individuals there to invest in China's mainland, said Li Yining, vice-chairman of the NPC Law Committee. "It has been aimed to further promote the economic exchanges across the Taiwan Straits," said Li, who is a renowned economist in China. The draft law stipulates that the state will not nationalize or requisition the investments; but under special circumstances and for the need of the public good, the state could purchase the investments through legal procedures, with the investors being reimbursed. Two vice-chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee, Ni Zhifu and Li Peiyao, said the draft law should make it clear that the Taiwan investors should observe China's laws just as they will be protected by the law. The draft law on the protection of investments of Taiwan compatriots was submitted to the legislature for deliberation for the first time on December 10 last year. It was submitted to the lawmakers for another review yesterday after being revised according to opinions both from the members of the NPC Standing Committee and feedback from the NPC Finance Committee, localities and departments.
