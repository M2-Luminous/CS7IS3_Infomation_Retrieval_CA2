The proposals include nullifying the rate of 7 percent set by Hosokawa for the tax to be imposed on sales of most goods and services, they said. Instead, the Hosokawa administration should set up a consultative body to enable the coalition partners to debate a new rate for the tax, the sources said. The compromise calls for part of the revenues from the new tax to be put into a special account, instead of the general account, they said. The new proposals emerged after the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] threatened to withdraw its six ministers from the cabinet unless the coalition upheld the demand to legislate a provision that would funnel all the revenue from the new tax to finance welfare policy measures. Hosokawa had earlier rejected the SDP's demand to insert into the new tax legislation wording that would obligate the government to spend all the revenue form the tax on welfare. On Wednesday, the SDP responded sharply to Hosokawa's plan to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax with the "national welfare tax." Prior to the meeting, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and his Democratic Socialist Party Counterpart Takashi Yonezawa agreed that it is the best way to nullify the new 7 percent tax, coalition officials said. Yonezawa conveyed the accord to Hosokawa by telephone and urged renewed talks on the tax.
