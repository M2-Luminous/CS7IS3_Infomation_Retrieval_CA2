SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. The Applicant was originally established by Southwestern Life Insurance Company as a separate account pursuant to the insurance laws of the State of Texas on February 14, 1986. 2. On February 28, 1986, the Applicant registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. On that same date, the Applicant filed a registration statement on Form S&hyph;6 under the Securities Act of 1933 (File No. 33&hyph;3662). The registration statement was declared effective on October 7, 1987. The Applicant never made an initial public offering of its securities. 3. The Applicant has not transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are securityholders of the Applicant. 4. The Applicant has not made any distributions to securityholders. 5. The Applicant has no assets, debts, or other liabilities outstanding. 6. The Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings (other than this deregistration proceeding). 7. The Applicant has no securityholders. 8. The Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it intend to engage, in any business activity other than that necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. Applicant's Conclusion Based on the facts set out above, Applicant represents that it has never made a public offering of its securities, has not more than 100 securityholders for purposes of Section 3(c)(1) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, and does not propose to make a public offering or engage in business of any kind. Applicant therefore requests an order pursuant to Section 8(f) of the 1940 Act declaring that it has ceased to be an investment company. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
