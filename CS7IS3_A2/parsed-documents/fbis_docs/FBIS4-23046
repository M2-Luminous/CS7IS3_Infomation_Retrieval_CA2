Development of the theory of fritting, successes in powder technology, new technological solutions to the selection of modifying additives enhanced the development of theoretical foundations for directed synthesis of new ceramic materials having specific properties, improvements in existing technology and qualities of materials thereby significantly expanding the range of applications of ceramics. However, the problem of obtaining new high quality ceramic materials in domestic industry has not yet been fully solved, notwithstanding the need for developing a new generation of components. This situation results from the fact that oxide powders used for production of ceramics fail to meet modern requirements, since they are not uniform in particle size or shape and are aggregated and not evenly dispersed. Even with prolonged milling it is not possible to obtain powders with less than 1-2 microns particle size. Without special additives, it is not possible to make ceramics having controlled structures and optimal properties. Especially pressing is research on methods of preparing powders having a given degree of dispersion and the subsequent development of new types of ceramics from oxides having high service qualities, possible only through utilization of chemical methods of controlled preparation of powders and the use of special modifying additives. There is practically not a single type of high temperature oxide ceramic produced in our country that is directly suitable for fabricating high quality components. Research on the effect of powder structure on fritting, micro-structure, and ceramic properties made it possible to formulate a so-called ``ideal'' powder for making ceramics having optimal properties: aggregate size must not exceed one tenth of a micron, and they must have a spherical shape, not stick together and increase in size with time, and the distribution of components must be uniform throughout the bulk and surface of the particles. Some small enterprises have emerged in recent years which have initiated production of dispersed powders of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], ZrO[.sub]2[/], and mixtures of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] with ZrO[.sub]2[/]. As a rule, these powders require additional milling, calcining, additives, and compacting. The technology of ceramics made from these powders is still at the research stage, costly, and not widely used. However, they are undoubtedly promising. A stable technology has been developed for making ceramics from partially stabilized zirconium dioxide from very pure powders using chemical precipitation, hydrostatic compression, and fritting in air at 1450-1550ï¿½ C. Durability of these ceramics is 750-900 MPa. They are monolithic in structure, less than one micron crystal size, and near-theoretical density. These ceramics consist of grains of a tetragonal solid solution, with the surfaces containing continuous thin-layered coatings of cubic solid solution. This inhibits crystal growth during fritting and enhances stability at high temperatures. The use of these unique ceramics could significantly improve the quality of components made from them.
