The U.S. Trade Representative Office delivered a sharp appraisal of Japan in an annual review on U.S. trade policy priorities, vowing to put the task of opening Japanese markets and securing Tokyo's compliance of past trade agreements high on this year's U.S. trade agenda. The trade report, compiled annually under congressional requirement, placed Japan on top of a list of bilateral trade policy actions that Washington plans to take this year. In addition, the U.S. Government promised to seek congressional approval of a new global trade pact concluded last December under auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Washington also vowed to expand regional trade through the newly created three-nation free-trade zone in North America and to foster U.S. trade and investment opportunities in Asia-Pacific region. Trade representative Mickey Kantor said the United States is determined to make global trade a "two-way" street. There can be "no something for nothing," Kantor said in releasing this year's review of the U.S. trade agenda. The U.S. Trade Representative Office (USTR) report took issue with Japan's market-opening efforts, saying Japan lags behind other major industrial economies in terms of openness to imports and to foreign direct investment. Japan's trade policy, the report warned, will be held accountable for economic ills in the world. Japan's "enormous global current account surplus, combined with its continuing resistance to both imports and new competitors in key sectors, retards global recovery and undermines political support for trade," the report said. In another sharp rebuke on Japan's trade practice, the USTR report literally accused the Japanese Government of not keeping its word after signing a trade agreement. "We presently have 33 trade agreements in effect with Japan, unfortunately, very few are being implemented in the way that we had envisioned," the report said. The report said the U.S. Government cited Japan last month for allegedly violating a 1989 trade agreement on cellular phone service in Japan and vowed that Washington will put Japan's observance of other trade agreements under close scrutiny. "We are reviewing our other agreements with Japan, and will not hesitate to act if they are not being implemented effectively," the report said. The report gives the first detailed account of the U.S. trade agenda on Japan following the breakdown of trade talks between the two countries that marred the February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. Washington has since revived a 1988 trade law provision, known as the "Super 301," giving Clinton broad authority to impose unilateral sanctions on Japan over trade disputes. The Clinton administration is also poised next week to publish a list of Japanese goods -- worth several hundred million dollars -- that will be subject to U.S. sanctions if there is no negotiated settlement over the cellular phone dispute. In testimony at Congress on Tuesday, Kantor raised the possibility that up to eight Japanese industries would be subject to retaliatory action under the Super 301 trade weapon. Kantor identified wood, paper, flat glass, computers, supercomputers, telecommunications, medical equipment and insurance as business areas where he said U.S. firms face barriers in penetrating the Japanese market. The USTR report, however, indicated that the U.S. is still hopeful of settling its trade disputes with Japan at the negotiating table, particularly through the "framework" trade process agreed to last July. "We stand by the framework for a new economic partnership to address these problems in a spirit of partnership," the report said.
