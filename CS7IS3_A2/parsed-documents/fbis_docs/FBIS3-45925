Peng Peiyun, State Councillor and minister in charge of the State Family Planning Commission, made the remark at a seminar on China's population closed here on Sunday [23 January] in Beijing. Peng said that it is prerequisite to continue to carry out the policy of birth control in order to achieve China's strategic goal in the future. The family planning work must be handled in a climate of social and economic development, Peng said, adding it must also be done well to create a good environment of population for the country's socialist modernization drive. Due to a large population base, China is still facing a grim situation in birth control, she said, adding that it is urgent to build a family planning structure in line with China's socialist market economic structure. Peng continued that close attention should be paid to the following aspects in dealing with national family planning: -- what is most important is to redouble efforts to keep the birth rate down, which still remains high in some areas in the country. The development of family planning is uneven across the country and outdated beliefs regarding birth still exist among sectors of the Chinese population, Peng said. In addition, new problems concerning the birth control may also occur in the course of establishing a socialist market economy. As a result, China's family planning will take long-term and hard work and should not be neglected at any time. -- forceful measures should be taken to provide for better births and better education, in a bid to improve the quality of the population, Peng urged. Of the more than 50 million disabled in the country, more than 10 million were born with deformities, and there are now 4.17 million disabled children under 14 with birth defects, accounting for more than half of all disabled children, Peng said. Of every one thousand newborns, 13 suffer from birth defects. Also, over 400 million people are living in iodine-deficient areas, which could cause the birth of hundreds of thousands of mentally retarded children by the year 2000 if the problem was not solved. She added that there are also 180 million illiterates or semi- literates in the country presently. -- efforts should be made to promote the establishment of pensions and life insurance. Peng warned that China is also facing the problem of aging due to a decline in the birth rate and a rise in average life expectancy of the population. -- equality between men and women should also be advocated and measures taken to protect women's rights and interests and lift their social status. Peng added that this is crucial because females have fallen behind males in China's current sex proportion. -- last but not least, Peng said, urbanization must also be advanced in a planned way. She added that the surplus rural labor force should be encouraged to flow in an orderly manner between regions and to transfer to job vacancies in non-farm sectors, as the country's urbanization has been quickened since the policy of reform and opening was instituted in the late 1970s. Peng concluded that this is also an important issue that has close bearing on China's economic development and social stability.
