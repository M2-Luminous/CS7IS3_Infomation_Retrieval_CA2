It said the indigenously developed surface-to-surface intermediate-range missile, which was launched from Chandipur in Orissa yesterday evening, met all the test objectives. A report issued on the flight today said the third flight of the Agni validated the innovative indigenous design feature aimed at testing the longer range and advanced maneuverability during the reentry phase. The flight tested the high thermal and structural capability of the vehicle which undergoes great stress at the reentry stage while moving at a hypersonic speed. The reentry stage takes place at about 30 km above the earth surface and the outside of the vehicle gets heated to about 3,000 degree Celsius. However, the inside temperature of the vehicle is maintained at 40 degree Celsius. The Defense Ministry release said that the Agni payload performed to the design specifications with great accuracy. It was a fiery spectacle as it hit the target. The successful test reaffirmed the country's capability in advanced technology.
