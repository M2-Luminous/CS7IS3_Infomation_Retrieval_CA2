The Jordanian side was led by Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of higher education, while the Palestinian side was led by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department. Following the end of the talks, the two sides issued a press statement reviewing the subjects the committee discussed. Details are in the following report from our correspondent Khalil al-Qaryuti: [Begin recording] [Al-Qaryuti] The two sides expressed their satisfaction with the atmosphere of understanding that prevailed in the meetings -- an atmosphere that will enhance coordination between the two sides, as well as efforts to improve it in various areas, because such coordination represents a realistic response to the special historic and fated relationship of the two peoples. Following the meetings, a press statement was read by Yasir 'Abd- Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive Committee and head of the PLO's Information Department. ['Abd-Rabbuh] The committee reviewed the points listed on its agenda. These covered issues of bilateral and Arab concern in order to promote overall cooperation and coordination between the Jordanian and Palestinian sides to the required level in all areas. The committee reviewed recent overall developments pertaining to the peace process, including the agreement signed by the PLO and Israel in Cairo on 9 February, which is a basic step toward implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement that represents the first part of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. The committee discussed future prospects and the concept of joint action in light of expected developments in order to formulate a unified Arab vision and to take the initiative in the service of the Arab nation's goals and its aspirations for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace. This should guarantee Israel's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and secure the Palestinian people's legitimate national rights on their national soil. The committee attached special importance to the status of Jerusalem. It stressed the need to carry out programs to reinforce the Arabic and Islamic character of the city, to confront Israel's attempts to Judaize and devour it, and to protect its sanctities. The committee studied the recommendations of its working teams on economic, security, and administrative issues. It stressed the need to draw up specific mechanisms to enable cooperation and coordination in the peace process by making preparations, exchanging information, and continuing consultations on all tracks of the bilateral and multilateral negotiations, within the framework of the directives of the Jordanian and Palestinian political leaders in order to serve the interests of the Jordanian and Palestinian peoples and their distinguished relationship. The committee adopted an agenda for the meetings of its subcommittees, including the Jerusalem committee, the economic committee, the security and borders committee, the committee on refugees and displaced people, and the legal committee, and also for the meetings of some specialized technical committees, which were stipulated in the economic agreement signed by the Jordanian Government and the PLO Executive Committee on 7 January 1994. The two sides decided to form an administrative affairs committee. They stressed the need to coordinate Arab positions, particularly those between the cordon states, regarding bilateral negotiations. [Al-Qaryuti] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and information minister, then responded to questions from a number of journalists: [Al-'Anani] We have agreed to coordinate our positions. We stressed the need for each side to respect what is taking place on any other fraternal Arab track of negotiations because we, in the final analysis, are seeking a comprehensive peace solution. What takes place on one negotiating track will certainly affect the other negotiating tracks. [Al-Qaryuti] Responding to a question on the economic agreement, the Jordanian-Palestinian economic committee, and the issue of reopening Jordanian banks in Gaza Strip and Jericho, Dr. al-'Anani said: [Al-'Anani] You know that the economic agreement stipulates the formation of a technical economic committee and a joint banking committee, which we also call a joint monetary banking committee. The Jordanian side named the committee members. We expect the brothers to name their members, too. We expect the committee to begin its meetings next week. We, in Jordan, are ready for the process. I believe the Palestinian side is also ready to reopen the Jordanian banks' branches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. [end recording]
