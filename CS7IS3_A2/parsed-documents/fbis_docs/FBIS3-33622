[Zapatist Subcommander Marcos] "So far, we have received satisfactory replies to our demands on the following points: health, education, true and timely information, housing, and respect for culture, traditions, rights, and the dignity of the Indian groups in Mexico." Other, more complex demands which were not mentioned will be submitted to advisory groups for study, and, even Marcos has admitted, there are other proposals that go beyond the possibilities of these negotiations. [Subcommander Marcos] "Let it be understood that what the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] wants is that just like the war was decided in a democratic manner, peace must necessarily follow the same democratic procedure." The rebel subcommander and EZLN delegates are not rushing to reach definite agreements. [Subcommander Marcos] "You must return to your areas; you must return to your committees and explain to your companions the proposals you have received regarding the points which started our movement on 1 January 1994. The communities will then decide yes or no." [Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis] "We are making much faster progress in discussing these problems than I expected at the beginning of these meetings." Camacho Solis announced he will follow a similar process. [Camacho Solis] "I will report to the president of the republic on each one of the points we have agreed on. I will also report to the mixed commission of senators and deputies, and I will seek to report to the main political forces [pauses]... to all the political forces of the country so there will be a broad consensus." New faces were seen during the third day of negotiations in San Cristobal de las Casas. These included Monterrey Archbishop Adolfo Suarez; Oaxaca Archbishop Hector Gonzalez; and Bishops Carlos Talavera from (Cuatzacualcos), Felipe Aguirre from Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Felipe Arismendi from Tapachula. They are all members of a special commission of the Mexican Bishops Conference, which is following the peace process. They will meet with political parties representatives and leaders of nongovernmental organizations. (Arturo Warman), ombudsman for agrarian affairs, was also seen here. He is studying the possible juridical modifications that will result from agreements over the land problems.
