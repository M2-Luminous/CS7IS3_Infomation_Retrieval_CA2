Take notice that on January 28, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets with a proposed effective date of March 1, 1994: Second Revised Sheet No. 282 Third Revised Sheet No. 283 Northwest states that the purpose of this filing is to amend the Transition Cost Reservation (TCR) Surcharge Provision in Section 27 of the General Terms and Conditions of Third Revised Volume No. 1 of Northwest's FERC Gas Tariff. Northwest requests postponement of the Collection Period and asks that such period commence June 1, 1994, rather than March 1, 1994, as stated in the currently effective tariff provisions. The reason for the delay is to allow time for costs associated with further development of Northwest's Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) to be properly included in the surcharge calculation. Northwest states that a copy of this filing has been served upon all parties on the official service list as compiled by the secretary in this proceeding and upon Northwest's jurisdictional customers and affected state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before February 9, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
