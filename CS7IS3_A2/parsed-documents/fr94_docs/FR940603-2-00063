L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed project requirements and review criteria. Approximately $730,000 will be available in FY 1994 for this program. It is anticipated that $730,000 will be available to support 3 to 4 competing awards averaging $182,500 to 243,333. Purpose Section 782 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to carry out demonstration projects in which chiropractors and physicians collaborate to identify and provide effective treatment for spinal and lower-back conditions. The period of Federal support will not exceed 3 years. Eligibility Entities eligible to apply for these grants are public or private nonprofit schools, colleges, and universities of chiropractic. Each applicant must enter into a formal agreement as necessary to ensure that a school of allopathic or osteopathic medicine will participate in the project. Proposed Project Requirements The following project requirements are proposed: 1. The project must address the identification and treatment of spinal and/or lower-back conditions. 2. The project must represent collaborative efforts between schools of chiropractic and schools of allopathic or osteopathic medicine. 3. Each project must include a strong research protocol which will result in a significant expansion of documented research in the area addressed and which is suitable for publication in refereed health professions journals, including research-oriented publications. 4. The project must include an explicit strategy for case-finding and a strategy for making direct comparisons to other forms of treatment. The results must be generalizable to patients cared for in clinical practices addressing spinal and/or lower-back conditions. 5. Whenever feasible, minorities and women should be included in study populations so that research findings can be of benefit to all persons at risk of the disease, disorder, or condition under study.
