Since the deployment of peacekeeping forces a year ago, none of the parties have taken a step to begin a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. He has expressed the mission's concern over the trends of ethnic confrontation that have aroused lately as well as an administrative and political isolation. The head of the mission named the return of refugees to the places of their permanent residence as one of the most complicated problems. According to the data possessed by the CSCE, these include 11,000 ethnic Ossetian refugees staying in the territory of North Ossetia and 7,000 ethnic Georgians accommodated mainly in the territory of Gori Rayon. Commenting on the issue of elections to the State Nikhas [supreme soviet] held in Tskhinvali recently, the head of the mission has said that their results have a significance for the determination of internal political arrangement of forces in the region. According to him, until the newly elected body starts to work, it will be difficult to form an opinion whether a policy carried out by Tskhinvali authorities toward the Georgian leadership since the beginning of the conflict is undergoing any changes. We expect both sides to take actions directed toward the settlement of the conflict, said the head of the CSCE mission. For our part, we can assist in inviting experts of international standards on handling ethnic conflicts and national problems.
