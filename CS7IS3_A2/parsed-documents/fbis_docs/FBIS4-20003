Helmut Schaefer (Free Democratic Party of Germany), state minister in the Foreign Ministry, stressed the importance of fastest possible ratification, since the agreement can come into force on 1 January 1995 only if at least 65 states have deposited the documents of ratification by summer this year. The Bundestag paid particular tribute to the work of the German diplomats, who had essentially contributed to the conclusion of the agreement in the Geneva Disarmament Committee. Olaf Feldman (Free Democratic Party of Germany) and Gernot Erler (Social Democratic Party of Germany) stressed the clause that permits international, unannounced controls also in civilian, private chemical companies, a clause that is unique and considered sensational. So far, only the United States and Russia have admitted to possessing chemical weapons. The destruction of the enormous stockpiles will require at least $20 billion, according to estimates. Citing U.S. documents, Erler mentioned the following countries which are likely to have chemical weapons: South Africa, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Israel, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia. The FRG will contribute 235 million German marks per year as of 1995 to the implementation of the agreement. In the debate the Bundestag also adopted the law on establishing CSCE arbitration courts, which is based on the principles of international law but cannot impose any binding ruling for quarreling parties.
