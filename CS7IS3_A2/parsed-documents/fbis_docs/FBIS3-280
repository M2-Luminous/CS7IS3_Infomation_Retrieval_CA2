During his visit, Mr. Musyoka held talks with Dr. Pascoal Mocumbi on bilateral cooperation between Mozambique and Kenya. The two countries cooperate in the fields of health, culture, agriculture, trade, and education. An agreement for the purpose was signed between the two countries in 1991 when Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano paid a visit to Kenya. During the talks in Maputo, the two sides decided to create a joint commission aimed at boosting their cooperation. Kenya has offered to host the first meeting of the commission in Nairobi on a date to be announced. The Kenyan foreign minister abruptly canceled a news conference he was scheduled to give in Maputo this morning on the last day of his visit, claiming that he had other businesses at the same time, which could not be postponed.
