The president said that he must meet with every powerful political faction, assessing the balance of power and determining which could be part of a coalition that is capable of governing. Arpad Goncz said that the results of Hungary's elections must be respected. The president said that the parties have already said every conceivable bad thing about each other and everything conceivable good thing about themselves; a kind of flirtation dance is going on to determine who could form alliances with whom. These attempts must be accepted at face value, said Goncz, who thinks that, contrary to 1990, today we are familiar with the parties. The president's recommendation to the voters is that everyone start from the present situation. Senseless slander will come back to haunt those who engage in it, the president stated. What the president sees throughout the country is that people would like to live a life without fear and to see unblemished public service. It is the citizens' responsibility not to vote for those who are to be feared or those who fail to serve the community well. The advancement of unblemished public service will most likely be the responsibility of the next parliament. There are two models in Europe. Despite its economic accomplishments, the Italian model is dangerous; on the other hand, the Austrian or Finnish model is a splendid example of reconciliation of interests, Arpad Goncz said. The latter is slower but leads to more stable results. No permanent party system will develop before 1998 in Hungary, the president continued, although people subscribe to three value systems: They want national-Christian traditions, freedom, and equality. There will only be a change of administrations, not a change of regimes. Goncz said that opinions of Hungary abroad have deteriorated during the past year; the West has become frightened of the conditions in the region, and has also become frightened of certain statements and anti-Semitic voices. Everyone should vote and follow his or her conscience, Arpad Goncz said. He hopes that none of the parties will try at the last moment to forcibly influence voters--not even by merely stirring emotions. But he could not promise that such occurrences would not happen.
