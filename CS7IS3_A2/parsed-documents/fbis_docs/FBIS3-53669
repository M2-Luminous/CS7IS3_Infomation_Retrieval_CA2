Male and female citizens, I have the honor to address you today while the country is about to encounter a decisive stage in its history. The roots of the political crisis that is storming our country go back to the last few years. The crisis grew under the overall weakness of the state and its institutions, and it started to grow further and expand with the passing of time until it reached its peak in October 1988 when an explosion occurred. This exposed other sides of the crisis in the economic, social, and security spheres, and every opportunity became available to internal and external destructive elements to achieve dubious objectives based on the distortion of facts as a means of consolidating a feeling of failure and waste among deprived citizens. The spread of selfishness, egocentricity, and the dominance of narrow partisan perceptions over wider national interests contributed to the further complication of the crisis. After this brief review of the nature of the crisis, it may be useful to recall its major causes: Political causes: 1. The weakness of the political system that provided the opportunity for parasitic [tufayli] political tendencies and groups with vested interests to reach many positions of responsibility in the economy, administration, and other sensitive state bodies; 2. Blatant contradictions between the programs and ideas of some parties, and their noncompliance with the terms of the Constitution, which clearly define the nation's ideals and its firmly-established values; 3. The prevalence of party over national affiliation in many parties and their narrow understanding of pluralism and democratic practice in their effort to attain power; 4. The wavering of public opinion and its lack of concern due to loss of confidence in the authorities as a result of the contradiction between the authorities' public declarations and actual practices, and as a result of dissatisfaction with the programs of many parties. Economic causes: 1. The mismanagement of the economy; 2. The disruption in the manufacturing sectors in general as a result of the repeated restructuring that has become the main characteristic of management for many years; 3. The destructive squandering of the country's hard currency reserves and other financial resources through the use of demagogic slogans; 4. The use of short-term loans to cover the state's deficit caused by spending and consumption, a matter that has led to an increase in the servicing of foreign debts that were eating into three-quarters of the country's financial resources at the end of 1993; 5. The encouragement of the smuggling phenomenon through the opening of borders without providing the necessary measures for the protection of the national economy. Social causes: 1. The rise in unemployment as a result of putting a brake on investment, development, and as a result of the continual shedding of manpower in organizations; 2. The state's abandonment of its social role, particularly in the field of housing and jobs to which attention had been paid in the last few years; 3. Infractions by some of the institutions of the administration in the form of widespread bureaucratic abuses: Graft, nepotism, and breaking the law in many cases; 4. The unequal sharing of national income. All these causes have led to the aggravation and deterioration of the crisis and although matters have become more complex, it is quite possible to contain them and find suitable and gradual solutions to tackling them. This requires, first of all, goodwill from all the sides and the concerted efforts of all the sincere patriots and upright citizens in all social strata, parties, societies, vocational groupings, factories, farms, schools, and universities in order to arrive at a political solution that responds to the aspirations of our people and that would match the greatness of Algeria and its historical revolution and its contemporary values. At the same time, they should show wisdom and a spirit of true patriotism and place the interest of the country above all considerations and adhere to the unchanging historic and spiritual values of the Algerian people, and discard for good all aspects of violence in political action. Within this framework, the National People's Army has repeatedly given proof of its good intentions. Thus, its' full readiness to contribute in an effective manner to the search for a solution that might take the country out of the current political crisis and its' withdrawal from the political scene for the past five years are clear proof of its respect for the people's will following the adoption of the 1989 Constitution. The National People's Army's withdrawal from political life does not, however, mean that it will remain with its' hands tied when there are mistakes and serious abuses that have threatened and are still threatening the people's fate and the future of the nation as a whole. I would also like to point out here that the Army's withdrawal from the political scene means, furthermore, that the military will not henceforth accept being an instrument of political struggle or anyone's ambitions. This is a principled stance by the Army; there will be no moving away from it and nor should it be subjected to any trickery or manipulation. On the other hand, the agreement of the Army to the request of the political class to be present at the National Dialogue Commission does not in any way mean going back on this principle, rather the opposite. The National People's Army, as a patriotic melting pot, should always be alongside the patriots who want to get the country out of the crisis that it has been enduring as a result of the methods of previous management. The matter here concerns patriotic action, which should be an example followed by all the political and social partners as it would lead them to shoulder their responsibilities before history and carry out their tasks before the nation. The National People's Army adheres to its well-known principles that derive from the ideals of the patriotic movement and the declaration of the glorious November revolution, in which Islam remains a reference point for civilized development and the natural framework for social enlightenment as practiced by our nation throughout the ages. In these difficult circumstances, the Army considers participation in overcoming the crisis as a patriotic matter that is binding on all. Anyone who retreats, or acts according to their own whims or personal or partisan ambitions will, in actual fact, be expressing their own failure and not the failure of society or of the political formations as a whole. This is because the country is approaching the national concord conference and also an interim period that will open up a new era for the Algerian people through which it can regain confidence in it's ability, and choose it's leaders and it's political institutions quite freely and away from any pressures or misrepresentations. We would like to assert very strongly here that any solution to the crisis lies in the ability of the political classes to surmount narrow-mindlessness and partisan interests and to be up to the real tasks. Fortunately, our political class does include many men and women who are very patriotic and sincere and who are determined to face up to the challenges, surmount short-term interests and give momentum to the real changes for which our people have been calling. We see this change in the form of a clean break with past practices and the methods of management at all political, economic, and social levels. The break, in which we believe and for which we are calling, should make a radical change in state institutions and functions by creating new criteria for them. Given the colossal nature of the crisis and its complications, and given the radical nature of the changes that must be brought about, the National People's Army believes that such a break, to which our people aspire, will be achieved through the creation of a new national political system. This new national system will consolidate true democracy, guarantee all individual and collective liberties, put a final end to political, economic, cultural and ideological monopolies, and help with the emergence of new men capable of bringing about these changes, the reification of the nation's aspirations for peace, fraternity, advancement, and the restoration of Algeria's standing and its position among nations. In order to achieve all that, the National People's Army addresses a call to all male and female Algerians who are loyal to their homeland, and assures them that it will do its utmost to prepare the right circumstances to enable them to offer their contributions in order to save the country and return it to safe grounds. May God help us all to succeed in doing what is good for the country. Glory and eternal life to our honorable martyrs. Peace and God's blessings be upon you.
