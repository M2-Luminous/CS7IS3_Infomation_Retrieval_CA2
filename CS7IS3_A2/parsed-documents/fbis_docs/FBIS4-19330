While the country's likely future government -- made up of Forza Italia, National Alliance, the Northern League and smaller allies linked together in the Freedom Front -- has reached a deal to field economist Carlo Scognamiglio for the post, the right-wing line-up does not have an absolute majority in the upper house, and may have to bow to opposition pressure for an `institutional' nomination. Both the Senate and Lower House gather tomorrow for the first session of the 12th legislature, with electing speakers at the top of the agenda. Gianfranco Fini, secretary of National Alliance, the renamed neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, was confident, however, that Scognamiglio would pull through: "I haven't done any counting but others have, and they have assured me that Scognamiglio will be elected. I know that we will get a majority." The economics professor himself, a member of Forza Italia, was resigned to facing competition, and said "but in the end the Senate is sovereign and it will have to decide on the basis of the voting. It comes as no surprise to me that there will be other candidates." Northern League leader Umberto Bossi seemed unconcerned about the fact that the Freedom Front candidate may lose his bid for the speaker's chair: "what the hell do I care," he told curious journalists. Less brusque was League member Marcello Staglieno who confirmed that Scognamiglio was the candidate of the whole right-wing alliance, but who said that, given the lack of an absolute majority in the Senate "the League is ready to weigh up an institutional candidate, should one arise." On the opposition benches, the Left Democrat Secretary Achille Occhetto promised that his party would be fielding a counter-bidder for the post, which is the second highest in the land, after that of president. Mario Segni, leader of the centrist Segni Pact, voiced disappointment that the Freedom Front had not opted for an institutional candidate: "they have missed a great opportunity for electing, in at least one house, a candidate with wide-based support." From the People's Party, the renamed Christian Democrats, Pierluigi Castagnetti said he was certain that the names of Scognamiglio for the Senate and 31-year-old Irene Pivetti for the Lower House were a smokescreen for the real candidates. "But anyway, we will not be voting for them," he said. The name of Pivetti drew fire from the Pannella Ticket, nominally supporters of the Freedom Front, with Marco Pannella accusing her of anti-Semitic leanings. Pivetti replied this evening, saying "I have total respect for diversity."
