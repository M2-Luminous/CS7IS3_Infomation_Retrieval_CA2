FBIS4-14028 "drnes080_c_94013" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 ARAB AFRICA Egypt U.S. `Double Standards' for Iraq, Bosnia Denounced U.S. `Double Standards' for Iraq, Bosnia Denounced NC2404114494 Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic 17 Apr 94 p 8 NC2404114494 Cairo AL-AHRAM Arabic BFN ["Closeup" column by Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "Outside International Legitimacy"] [Text] The U.S. F-15 military aircraft's downing of two UN helicopters over the no-fly zone in north Iraq is raising many questions about the legality of the measures the United States is taking in monitoring the situation there and the congruity with the UN resolutions that specified the nature of the international measures imposed on Iraq as a result of its aggression against Kuwait. It is well known that a Western agreement imposing the no-fly zone over Iraq was reached among the United States, Britain, and France outside the framework of the United Nations and the Security Council resolutions to protect the Kurds in north Iraq from the atrocities and persecution of Saddam Husayn's regime. Despite the fact that the Shiites in south Iraq are exposed to the same atrocities and persecution, they have not enjoyed the same degree of protection as the Kurds. It seems illogical that the West should volunteer to protect the Kurds in Iraq while it ignores the raging battles between the Turkish Army and the Kurds in the Turkish-Iraqi border area. The Turkish forces have for several months been bombarding and burning Kurdish villages on a large scale, and even chasing them inside Iraqi territory. This indicates that the no-fly zone in north Iraq and the U.S. military aircraft sorties in its airspace are not meant to protect the Kurds as much as to put the Iraqi people under a stiffer international blockade than the Security Council resolutions stipulate in a way that threatens to separate the Kurdish areas in the north from the Iraqi state. This would definitely lead to partition or to creating new political situation allowing the establishment of an independent state for the Kurds. The U.S. State Department spokesman's statement blaming Iraq for causing the downing of the two helicopters and the death of more than 20 senior commanders and UN figures is ridiculous. It is the U.S. military aircraft that mistook the UN helicopters. When the use of double standards becomes a well-established method in international dealings, the stance of the United States and NATO on the Serb aggression against Bosnia and the continuing bombardment of Gorazde and of the UN forces seem extremely strange. The Serb forces' defiance of the UN resolutions and NATO ultimatums are being met with a great deal of patience, pampering, and caution. Air strikes are calculated while contacts, negotiations, and attempts to reach a peaceful solution go on. Moreover, numerous acts of aggression against safe zones in Bosnia are ignored. This totally contradicts what is happening in Iraq. Why? This is the question.
