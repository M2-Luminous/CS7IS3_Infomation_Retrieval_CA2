In contradiction with the authorization granted to the organizers, they localized their protest actions and blocked a part of the Victoria Square. For about two days, approximately 300-400 people from Bucharest and the provinces have been participating in this action and they asked the government for negotiations on a list of four claims. Although the demonstration and the obstruction of the square are illegal, the government agreed to hold discussions with the representatives of trade unions and, in this respect, it established a team of negotiators that includes: Mircea Dan Popescu, minister of state and minister of labor and social protection; Florin Georgescu, minister of state and minister of finance; Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the government; and Octavian Partenie, secretary of state and the representative of the government in relations with trade unions and the employers' association. We wish to mention that a first round of talks was held on Tuesday, 14 June 1994, between 2215-0100, and all four claims of the Cartel Alfa were approached. These claims, through their content, demonstrate that the union representatives are not aware of the executive's duties. The claims are mainly attempts to destabilize the current situation in Romania and to attract a large group of participants in this action, which obviously has a populist nature. The government believes that the recent demonstrations have a clearly political hidden motive as political leaders who belong to the opposition have been noticed among the demonstrators. A new round of talks was held between the government team and the representatives of trade unions this afternoon. One of the claims refers to the minimum 50-percent increase in salaries throughout the economy and the cancellation of the current legal levers, with which our government is working, just like governments in other countries that undergo a process of transition, to reduce the negative effects of the salary increase that could turn into the major source of inflation. We note that the increase in salaries can be achieved solely through direct dialogue and negotiations between trade union organizations and the employers' association. The result of these negotiations, which can take concrete shape in an increase in salaries, depends exclusively on the financial potential available to each trade company or private corporation at a certain moment, financial potential that can result from the increase of production and economic performance. In accordance with the current laws, the government has no authority to get involved in such a process. We wish to note once again that the involvement of the government to force companies and private companies to carry out a standard increase of salaries is not possible, and that such a measure in no way would lead to the restoration of the population's purchase power, as the Alfa Cartel leaders claim, but it would lead instead to the escalation of inflation and to the rapid deterioration of the standard of living. In connection with the request forwarded to the government to supplement by 500 billion lei the budget allotted to education and, in correlation with it, to allot additional sums for the other budgetary sectors, we note the following: As is known, the state budget for 1994, which also includes provisions regarding the funds allotted to various budgetary sectors, including education, within the limit of the existing resources, was approved by Romania's parliament, and the government, through the legal duties incumbent on it, is called upon to implement it. Thus, the government cannot respond to such a claim, which would be against the law. Apart from the fact that there are no such resources, the budget, as is known, registers a 1.8 trillion lei deficit, to which solutions are still being sought. On the other hand, complying with the same budgetary provisions, the executive decided that in accordance with the financial potential that remains to be identified through the rectification of the budget, maximum priority will be granted to the chapter on material expenditure and investment in education, and then to the other budgetary sectors. We remind the public that on the bases of the parliament's examination and approval, we proceeded to the reestablishment of the correlation between the salary of the personnel in this sector and the other employees' salaries, by increasing, as of September 1994, the basic salaries in the budgetary sector by 23-30 percent. We gave particular attention to granting a higher percent of salary increase to the group of employees whose work belongs to the category of top social services. The second claim advanced by the Alfa Confederation does not have the necessary legal foundation either. It refers to actions of speeding up the act of concluding collective labor contracts at all levels and offering guarantees that they will be respected. We remind the public that, also in accordance with the legal provisions currently in force, the conclusion of these contracts is the sole duty of the two sides; that is the trade unions and the employers' association. However, the government again expresses its willingness to support the proper unfolding of this action. In order to better inform the public, we mention that there is only one controversial point that stopped the signing of the collective labor contracts. The trade unions ask that those who are not trade union members should also be compelled to pay a certain fee. The argument for this request is the idea that they also enjoy the benefits of the provisions of the collective labor contract. The government cannot interfere in this case through administrative measures either. A final decision has to be taken through negotiations between the two sides that are, as we have already mentioned, the trade unions and employers' association. To force employees to pay a fee through an administrative decision would be at variance with democratic principles, including the trade union democracy, and nobody can be permitted to take such a decision. The third claim referring to the recognition of labor groups created after the revolution and the pensioning according to these groups is absolutely useless. Romania's government has never had the intention of modifying the practice of placing employees in labor groups and granting pensions according to them, created after the revolution or before that event. Likewise, the government does not intend to carry out any modification in the act of pensioning in accordance with the labor groups and, in this respect, it presented a written viewpoint to the trade union organizations. Thus, this is a claim without substance. The fourth and last claim refers to the compulsory indexation of salaries, including the minimum salary per economy. We wish to remind the public that the government can decide on the indexation of salaries in accordance with its prerogatives solely in the budgetary sector and in the sector of social protection, and can do it solely in direct correlation with the foreseeable evolution of prices for each quarter. For the other groups of employees, the government can only recommend indexation, but the decision undoubtedly rests with each trade company and private corporation, in accordance with the financial potential of each of them. The viewpoint of the government is that the increase in salaries can be achieved only in two ways: by increasing production and labor productivity or by restructuring commercial companies. The four claims of the Alfa Cartel bring us back to a period that we thought belongs to the past, which is the command, planned, and centralized economy and the implementation of those claims would mean the administrative involvement of the government in economy, on the basis of some prerogatives that it does not possess and does not even wish to have, because this it would mean the reinstallation of practices of the totalitarian regime, from which, through joint efforts, we barely succeeded in departing four years ago. Romania's government is determined to support the establishment of a society based on genuine democratic principles, to build a competitive market economy that excludes any interference through administrative levers in the economic and social development of society. Such demonstrations and protest actions that flagrantly violate the legal provisions do nothing else but lead to the destabilization of society, with very serious effects on the whole reform process, and to the danger of losing everything that has been obtained so far through the joint efforts of all citizens: the economic increase, the reduction of inflation, macro-economic stability, and international trust. Just as has been done so far, the government expresses openness for dialogue, but on a principled position, with the realist approach to all issues that the trade union confederations raise, and only if they are the subject of the activity of the executive, as has been established by the law.
