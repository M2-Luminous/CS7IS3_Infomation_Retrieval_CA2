FBIS4-52977 "dreas095_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 15 May 1994 North Korea Daily Calls for Punishment of Kwangju `Culprits' Daily Calls for Punishment of Kwangju `Culprits' SK1505091694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0847 GMT 15 May 94 SK1505091694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- If the South Korean people want to punish the chief culprits in the Kwangju bloodbath, they must overthrow the "civilian regime" of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, too, urges NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. The analyst says: On the threshold of the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising, the federation of the May 18 Kwangju popular resistance of South Korea came out with the demand for the punishment of the traitor Chon Tu-hwan and other chief culprits of the Kwangju massacre. The Kwangju bloodbath which was unprecedented in barbarity, atrocity and ferocity, left in the hearts of the people unquenchable grievances. But the demand of the people for a probe into the truth of the incident and the punishment of the chief murderers has not yet been met. No Tae-u the puppet, the dictator of the "Sixth Republic," had "committed" himself to the solution of this problem before he took office. But, he himself being a mastermind of the Kwangju massacre, he hushed it up. The traitor Kim Yong-sam who made "a fair solution of the Kwangju problem" one of his "commitments" when taking power, connived at and defended the criminals and bloodily cracked down on the massive struggle of students and people demanding a probe into the truth and punishment of the chief murderers by letting loose hundreds of thousands of police. Kim Yong-sam the traitor says quite often that he was "a victim of the military dictatorship." But he is a turncoat and political prostitute who made a strategic marriage with the military dictatorial forces and clawed his way to power with their backing. The punishment of the chief culprits in the Kwangju massacre is impossible with the Kim Yong-sam group, the "civilian fascists" defending the Kwangju murderers, left alone.
