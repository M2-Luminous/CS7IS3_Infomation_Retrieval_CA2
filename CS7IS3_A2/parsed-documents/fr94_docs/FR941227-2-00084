FR941227-2-00084 FR941227-2-00059 Social Security Administration Privacy Act of 1974; Report of Altered Systems of Records_Revised Routine Use AGENCY: Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ACTION: Revised routine use. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11); 552a(r)), we are notifying the public of our intent to alter an existing routine use of information maintained in four systems of records: The Claims Folder System, HHS/SSA/OP, 09&hyph;60&hyph;0089 (routine use number 24); the Earnings Recording and Self-Employment Income System, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09&hyph;60&hyph;0059 (routine use number 15); the Master Beneficiary Record, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09&hyph;60&hyph;0090 (routine use number 12); and the Master Files of Social Security Number (SSN) Holders and SSN Applications, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09&hyph;60&hyph;0058 (routine use number 19). The routine use in question presently contains identical text in all four systems of records and the proposed modification is also identical in all four systems. A notice pertaining to the Earnings Recording and Self-Employment Income System was last published in the Federal Register at 59 FR 62407, December 5, 1994. A notice pertaining to the other three systems identified above was last published in the Federal Register at 54 FR 52308, 52309 on October 17, 1994. We invite public comments on this publication. DATES: We filed a report of an altered system of records with the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the House Committee on Government Operations, and the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, on December 5, 1994. The proposed routine use will become effective as proposed, without further notice, on January 20, 1995, unless we receive comments on or before that date which would warrant withholding the alteration from taking effect. ADDRESSES: Interested individuals may comment on this proposal by writing to the SSA Privacy Officer. The mailing address is 3&hyph;D&hyph;1 Operations Building, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21235. Comments may be faxed to (410) 966&hyph;0869. All comments received will be available for public inspection at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Peter J. Benson, Office of Disclosure Policy, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21235; telephone (410) 965&hyph;1736. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: . I. Discussion A. Background of the Proposed Routine Use Over the past 15 years, the United States (U.S.) has established a network of bilateral Social Security agreements that coordinate the U.S. retirement, survivors and disability insurance (RSDI) program with the comparable programs of other countries. The agreements, commonly known in the U.S. as ``totalization'' agreements, are authorized by section 233 of the Social Security Act. Currently, the U.S. has totalization agreements in force with 17 countries, including Canada and virtually all of Western Europe. One of the main purposes of the agreements is to help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the U.S. and another country. Such workers may fail to qualify for Social Security benefits from one or both countries because they have not worked long enough to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Under an agreement, these workers may qualify for partial U.S. or foreign benefits based on ``totalized'' (i.e., combined) credits from both countries. Implementing the totalization agreements has required SSA to share certain personal information in its files with counterpart social security agencies in the other countries. Generally, this sharing has been limited to personal information needed to adjudicate claims for benefits under the agreements. The present wording of the four routine uses permits disclosure of personal Social Security records for totalization purposes, which, as discussed above, involves adjudication of claims. Consistent with section 233 of the Social Security Act, the contemplated revision would expand the field of allowable disclosures by permitting disclosure of personal information in SSA's files to a foreign Social Security agency essentially for all SSA and foreign program-related activities in the U.S. or abroad. This will, in addition to the adjudication of claims, include those instances in which SSA and a foreign country have entered into mutual assistance arrangements under a totalization agreement. Under a mutual assistance arrangement, the foreign country would assist SSA generally in the administration of its programs and SSA would provide reciprocal services for the foreign country. This would include post-entitlement reviews and redeterminations, applications for Social Security numbers, program and operational studies, integrity reviews and evaluations, research and statistical studies, and the like. It will also include situations where information from SSA's records is needed by a foreign Social Security agency to implement a provision of an agreement other than adjudicating a claim for benefits. For example, a foreign agency may need information from SSA's records to determine if, under the provisions of an agreement, a person has the right to make voluntary contributions to its Social Security system. The proposed revised routine use provides for disclosure: ``To the Social Security agency of a foreign country, to carry out the purpose of an international Social Security agreement entered into between the United States and the other country, pursuant to section 233 of the Social Security Act.''
