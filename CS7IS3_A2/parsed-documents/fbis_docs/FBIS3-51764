Light Industry Minister Eduardo Fernandez Boada was present at the inauguration and was interviewed by reporter Guillermo Bernal: [Begin recording] [Bernal] The pavilion we have just inaugurated contains an extensive exhibit of Cuban products. However, I am concerned about the people's perception that, although the exhibit stresses production capabilities, what is displayed here is not available in stores nationwide. [Fernandez] The goal of the exhibit is to show what Cuba is capable of producing, not what is produced to fill store shelves. To produce these items for nationwide public consumption, we would need not to be in a special period: We would have to have hundreds of millions of dollars we do not have. However, it is important for everyone to know that the Revolution has created these capabilities in Cuba. In the future, the preservation and even the development of this production capability -- I am convinced of this, whenever we have the possibility -- will allow us to supply these items to the people. We should not be depressed that we cannot have these things in the stores today. It would be sad to have lost our capability to do this, to have to import even chairs or pants. [Bernal] Light industry is close to the Cuban family with such products as soaps, detergents, and tooth paste. What is the situation with these products? [Fernandez] The goal is to try to allocate more to these than last year to ameliorate the problem somewhat. Personally, I believe that the problem of systematically and adequately providing these items cannot be solved in the short term, because tens of millions of dollars are needed and they are just not there. Now, there is a will, a commitment. We have preserved the production capabilities to try to alleviate the highly distressing shortage of these products. We are aware of this. We may experience a slight improvement in comparison with 1993. [end recording]
