She stressed that it is out of the question for Turkey to make any concessions on such a vital issue. Ciller said: I did not make any promises about Cyprus to anyone behind closed doors in the United States or anywhere else. Addressing a meeting of the True Path Party National Assembly group, Ciller pointed out that Turkey's foreign policy follows a line that was drawn up by Ataturk and which has not changed since the republic was founded. She explained that Turkish foreign policy is based on national consensus and is above the party. She stressed that exploiting this issue by making unfounded speculations about it will only weaken the country. Ciller charged that certain circles have been making unfounded allegations recently to the effect that concessions will be made in Cyprus as a result of Turkey's economic difficulties. Ciller said: [Begin recording] Let me say it clearly: Neither I nor any prime minister of the Turkish Republic can make concessions on the Cyprus issue -- one of Turkey's most vital issues -- because of economic or other reasons. [applause] No prime minister can do that. It is inconceivable. Such unfortunate rumors and allegations hurt our country first and foremost. [applause] I am again saying clearly that I did not make any promises about Cyprus to anyone behind closed doors in the United States or anywhere else. [end recording] The prime minister pointed out that Turkey's views on Cyprus were conveyed to the U.S. Administration in written form. [Begin Ciller recording] This is what President Clinton said to me regarding this issue: The Cyprus issue is at an impasse. Can you help? Almost every U.S. President has spoken to almost all our prime ministers along these lines at various platforms. This is not a new development. Whenever a Turkish prime minister went to the United States, he heard these remarks from the U.S. Administration. There is nothing new in that. My reply to President Clinton's remarks was as follows, in brief: The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus had agreed to the original confidence-building measures [CBM's]. The package was later changed to satisfy the Greek Cypriots. The frequent changes in the package are causing difficulties. Nonetheless, let us look at the latest situation once again. Let us look for the common ground between the two sides. In fact, that is the aim of the CBM's. That is the essence of what we said. [end recording]
