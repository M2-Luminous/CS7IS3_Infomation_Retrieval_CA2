They agreed that initial successes have been achieved in the anti-corruption campaign throughout the country. However, eradication of corruption remains an arduous task for a long time to come because corruption has infiltrated into almost all aspects of social life. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning provincial party committee, said that the anti-corruption campaign is crucial for China's economic growth and long-term stability. "Therefore, we must do everything within our power to make the campaign a success," he said during a group discussion. Both NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members emphasized the importance of viewing the anti-corruption campaign from the height of correctly handling relations between reform, development and stability. Feng Tiyun, a CPPCC National Committee member and vice-minister of supervision, said that some officials abuse their power for personal gains through loopholes in legal, supervisory and managerial systems. He called these officials "borers of reforms and opening up," noting that they must be punished according to law. With regard to anti-corruption measures to be taken in the future, the deputies and members called for efforts to perfect China's legal system and establish an effective supervisory and restraint system. Gu Jinchi made a three-point proposal in that regard: -- It is necessary to clearly define the duties and functions of CPC committees and governments at all levels and establish a supervisory system; -- It is imperative to establish and perfect an open and standardized system regarding the use and management of personnel, public money and materials, and subject administrative power holders to supervision by the people; and -- It is necessary to institute a system under which leading officials will declare their incomes. Han Peixin, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress, said that many corruptive phenomena have resulted from disciplinary problems in the style of work of officials. For this reason, it does not suffice to crack down on corrupt officials only in the economic area, he noted. The eradication of corruption requires the solution of deep- rooted problems in political life, with the key lying in perfecting the personnel system, he added. Li Jinpei, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National Committee, proposed promoting the anti-corruption campaign by tightening legal restraints, improving supervisory measures, increasing civil servants' salary and stepping up ideological education.
