Background On February 14, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Floral Trade Council, Haslett, MI, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of LTFV imports of fresh cut roses from Colombia and Ecuador. Accordingly, effective February 14, 1994, the Commission instituted antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;684 and 685 (Preliminary). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the Federal Register of February 24, 1994 (59 FR 9000). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on March 8, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on March 31, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2766 (March 1994), entitled ``Fresh Cut Roses from Colombia and Ecuador: Investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;684 and 685 (Preliminary).''
