Written Comments In the Notice of Proposed Exemption (the Notice), the Department invited all interested persons to submit written comments and any requests for a hearing on the proposed exemption. The applicant represents that interested persons were provided with a copy of the Notice, plus a copy of the supplemental statement (the Supplemental Statement), as required pursuant to 29 CFR 2570.43(b)(2), either through first class mailing of such documents or through publication of such documents in the bi-monthly Union newsletter, ``News-Record.'' The newsletter was also distributed to various Union offices and hiring halls. All written comments and requests for a hearing were to have been received by the Department by February 1, 1994, based on an anticipated publication date of December 17, 1994, for the newsletter containing the Notice and the Supplemental Statement. Subsequently, the applicant notified the Department that the publication of the newsletter had been delayed and that the newsletter was not actually mailed to interested persons until January 5, 1994. In light of this fact, the Department determined to extend the comment period on the proposed exemption until February 28, 1994, to ensure that all interested persons had sufficient time to comment on the proposed exemption. In this regard, the Department required the applicant to notify interested persons of the extended comment period by enclosing a notice of extension of time to comment (the Notice of Extension of Time) with each monthly report form mailed to contributing employers, by asking employers to post the Notice of Extension of Time or distribute it to employees, and by posting the Notice of Extension of Time together with a copy of proposed exemption in all Union offices and hiring halls. In a letter dated January 31, 1994, the applicant notified the Department that it had completed notification to all interested persons as required by the Department.
