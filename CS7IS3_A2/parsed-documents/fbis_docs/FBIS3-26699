According to statistics from the technology markets in 34 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities listed separately for development in the country (excluding Tibet and Shenzhen), the technology transaction volume in 25 localities exceeded 100 million yuan; Beijing Municipality, with its 3.5 billion yuan volume of technology transactions, ranked first, followed by Liaoning and Shanghai, each with 2 billion yuan. They were followed by Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, Hunan, Henan, and Hubei, arranged according to transaction volume. The statistics show that the overall standard of trade in the technology markets across the country has greatly improved, and that the transaction volume of technological achievements involved a wide range of areas. This shows that the sense of technological progress among various quarters in society is ceaselessly becoming stronger. The statistics also show that at the same time as the volume of technology transactions has increased rapidly, the scale of technology transactions has also expanded continuously. In 1993, on average, each contract involved a transaction volume of 84,380 yuan, whereas in 1992 it was only some 60,000 yuan, and this indicates that in terms of degree of industrialized development, grade, and quality, the technological goods entering the market have improved to varying degrees, and some technologies and technological products have already left the country for the outside world.
