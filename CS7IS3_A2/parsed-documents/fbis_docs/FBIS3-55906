Major General Vodopyanov, aide to the commander for work with personnel; Major General Taylokov, first deputy commander of the NEGF; and Major General Yakushev, chief of the combat training directorate, arrived at 1030 at the site of the incident to investigate. They declared to the head of the city's administration who was present there that the actions by the Latvian servicemen were unlawful, and demanded that the captured installations be vacated. Negotiations were fruitless, however, and around 1400 Generals Vodopyanov and Taylokov were handcuffed, put into a minibus and taken away to an unknown destination. General Yakushev immediately reported the incident to the commander of the Northeastern Group of Forces who reported the incident to the president of Latvia. The president stated that the actions of the country defense forces were unlawful and that measures would be taken for an immediate release of the Russian generals. POSTFACTUM has come to learn that Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev gave orders to put on combat alert units of the Pskov Airborne Division, and should the hostages not be released, to take adequate measures to free them. Normond Beltskis of Latvia's Foreign Ministry press service advised, as this NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA issue went to print, that an urgent conference to resolve the situation was under way at the office of republic President Guntis Ulmanis.
