Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio and Jose Raul Mulino, her Panamanian counterpart, gave speeches noting the "historic" opportunity of this meeting. In view of the change of governments in their respective countries, this will be the ministers' last joint effort within the framework of the Contadora Group, an organization named after the island and founded in the eighties by Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico as part of the peace-keeping efforts on the isthmus. Agreements are expected to be signed on cultural issues, procedures for common border delimitation, the desolate Darien Gap, and a revision of terms for a ferry service to cross the Caribbean Sea and link the two countries. Sanin praised Contadora saying Panama wrote "some of the most important pages of its integration and sovereignty" here. Mulino said: "We have now redeemed" its name because "the Panamanian dictatorship once spoke here of taking democracy to other nations." According to the Colombian foreign minister, the Colombian-Panamanian Neighborhood Commission has gone beyond mere words and has contributed to a positive change in bilateral relations. She said Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares has guaranteed the continuity of the bilateral integration process and commercial opening. Sanin hopes Panama will "quickly" join the Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela) through the integration clause after its members sign the commercial agreement on 13 June. The meeting will also serve to review regulations on the status of illegal immigrants in each country and the expansion of national parks for the protection of the environment. Representatives of the banking and financial sectors also attended the meeting, a move that was greeted with enthusiasm by Sanin and Mulino, who head the commission. The meeting participants will study the bilateral "open skies" policy and a proposal to recognize the dual nationality of Indians in border areas. Sanin stated: "We cannot deny it to them. They have always lived it and exercised it." For his part, Mulino said the common border delimitation will become a reality before his term ends on 1 September. The ferry that will link Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) and Colon (Panama) on the Caribbean Sea will begin operating on 4 December, it was explained today during the bilateral meeting in which private business delegations participated. During its 16-hour transit, the ferry will be able to transport 400 passengers in 150 comfortable cabins, 20 trucks or buses, and 100 private vehicles. The ferry tickets will cost $85 to $150 per person per day, including all expenses, and $200 to $1000 per vehicle, according to its size. Sanin was accompanied by Jorge Bendeck, public works and transportation minister; Communications Minister William Jaramillo; and Gustavo Gaviria, Colombian private sector representative. Mulino was accompanied by Panamanian Vice President Guillermo Ford and business leader Ricardo Aleman.
