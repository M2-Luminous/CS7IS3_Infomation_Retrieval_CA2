He then emphasized that $2.5 million would be given as credit without interest for the provision of 20,000 metric tons of corn for cattle, and the remaining $1.5 million were a gift for the transport costs of the corn to Skopje. Mr. Soros announced that in the first 15 days of April this year he would finance the air bridge, that is he would cover half of the expenditures for air transport of early vegetables from Macedonia to Europe, since the air costs were twice as high as the land ones, too high to accept. The goal of this gesture of Soros was, as he himself pointed out, to help the Macedonian Government in the difficulties it is having since the Greek blockade, but first of all -- to turn the attention of the European and the world public, which must not let the country collapse or fall into the hands of extremists, neglecting the lessons of Bosnia and thus creating here a new hotbed of crisis with unpredictable consequences. Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, who attended the beginning of the news conference with Soros, emphasized that Mr. Soros was ready to help Macedonia throughout the difficult times. "Even now," Gligorov said, "he immediately responded to my invitation and we had very fruitful discussions about the embargo and about what could be done to help Macedonia." "I came to Macedonia because I am very much concerned about the fate of this country," Mr. Soros said, "because I think that whatever will happen with Macedonia is of great interest for Europe and the world." "In this case," he said, "it is very easy to make a distinction -- who is the aggressor and who is the victim. If this government breaks down because of an economic collapse, and if the extremists come, who, we know, are present on both sides, there will be a conflict in which many neighboring countries will undoubtedly be involved." Mr. Soros also said that everything he pledges for in Macedonia in this situation is in danger. Therefore, he conveys an appeal to the European countries, to the United States, and to the other international factors to undertake concrete actions for assisting our country. Answering journalists' questions, Soros said that the meetings he held yesterday with representatives of VMRO-DPMNE were carried out in a more moderate way than he had expected, taking into account the previous criticisms he had been exposed to by this party. Soros also said that he had not had any contacts with the Greek Government in relation to the loan to Macedonia, but he pointed out that he would give an interview to Greek Television, in which he would expose his stances. Concerning the question that NOVA MAKEDONIJA informed that he had conveyed a letter to Clinton in which he stated that the survival of Macedonia depended on how much rights the Government would give to the minorities, he said that his opinion was that the Macedonian Government was sincerely committed and dedicated to solving the rights of the minorities, but more should be done in that respect. [Box, p 2] "Inexperienced Diplomacy" I hope President Gligorov will not be angry at me, but I have to say that he and his government were not successful enough in persuading the world about the dangers Macedonia is faced with, as well as about the dangers that will come if the situation is not changed. Of course, Macedonia does not have great experience in diplomacy and in foreign relations. However, I say there is a lack of information about the situation in Macedonia and the attention of the world's mass media has not been sufficiently turned to this side.
