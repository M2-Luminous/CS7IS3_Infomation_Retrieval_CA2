FR940803-2-00088 FR940803-2-00069 Finally, the petitioner argued, granting the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act because the vehicles ``are non polluting *␣*␣* and therefore can be a major means of improving the quality of the air we breathe.'' One comment was received on the petition, from William Bohn of Marysville, Washington. Mr. Bohn is the owner of a 1989 Geo Metro and a 1970 BMW 2002 EV conversion. He questions ``whether the safety of the vehicle has been compromised by the addition of the battery pack in regards to braking, steering, and suspension'' as he fears ``that the added weight of the battery pack is beyond the capacity that the car was originally tested.'' However, he concedes that the converter ``may have reduced the total weight load by using 12V batteries in series vice the more common 6V series pack'', and that the converter may also ``have increased the suspension's capacity, and improved the brakes to better accommodate the increased weight.'' The agency has reviewed Mr. Bohn's comment. It notes that neither B.A.T. nor another petitioner who converts Geo Metro vehicles (e.g., Solectria) has asked for a temporary exemption from the braking standard, Standard No. 105. NHTSA interprets this as indicating that these converters of Geo Metros have assured themselves that the conversions continue to meet Standard No. 105. As for its effect upon ``steering'', NHTSA is unsure of the exact nature of Mr. Bohn's concern, whether it goes to the steerability of the vehicle or something else. Solectria has requested an exemption from Standard No. 204 Steering Control Rearward Displacement whereas B.A.T. appears to believe that its alterer's certification will cover compliance with this standard after conversion. The suspension of a vehicle is not the subject of a safety standard. If the increased weight should result in a safety related defect, the converter will be subject to the notification and remedy provisions of the Vehicle Safety Act. As NHTSA noted in granting B.A.T.'s previous petition: ``* * * it is manifestly in the public interest for small manufacturers to engage in the converting of internal combustion engines to electric power, and for this agency to take appropriate steps to encourage these endeavors, provided that they are consistent with motor vehicle safety. Exemptions for conversions allow field evaluations by their purchasers and modifications by the converters that respond to the evaluations.'' (58 FR at 45550). Those reasons, of course, still exist, and once again support a finding by the Administrator that an exemption from S5.1 of Standard No. 208 will facilitate the development and field evaluation of a low emission motor vehicle, and that the exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The exemption provided will allow the petitioner to broaden its product range from trucks to passenger cans, and contribute to the development of its expertise in vehicle conversion. Petitioner was not specific as to the extent that its conversion may not conform with Standard No. 208, although NHTSA assumes that the converted Metro will continue to be equipped with its original restraints. In this sense, an exemption would not, in the words of the statute, ``unreasonably degrade'' the safety of the Geo conversion. B.A.T. did not request a specific time period for its exemption, and in its absence, NHTSA is providing one that will expire on August 1, 1995. First, this is the termination date of Exemption No. 93&hyph;3 granted B.A.T. for its Ford Ranger conversions, and if the company finds it necessary to petition for renewals of both exemptions, they may be made under the cover of one petition. Secondly, an exemption for this time period will allow B.A.T. to schedule and complete its compliance verification testifying with the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories. Finally, NHTSA notes that General Motors will introduce a substantially revised Geo Metro for the 1995 model year, and because of this, B.A.T. will have to decide whether to terminate its program of Metro conversions after the 1994 model year, or, if it decides to continue with the Metro, to reevaluate its conversion compliance status. In consideration of the foregoing, B.A.T. Inc. is hereby granted NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 94&hyph;4, expiring August 1, 1995, from S5.1 of 49 CFR 571.208 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 Occupant Crash Protection. Authority: 49 U.S.C. 30113; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. Issued on: July 27, 1994. Christopher A. Hart, Deputy Administrator.
