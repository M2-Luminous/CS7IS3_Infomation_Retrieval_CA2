Whereas: 1. All Mexicans, above any legitimate aspiration and objective of each sector, give priority to social peace and are unwilling to allow it to be altered. We have much to do for the Mexico we want for ourselves and for our children within the pluralism and mutual respect that has always prevailed in this forum for concerted effort. The signatories of the PECE will forcefully defend the results we have achieved as peasants, workers, businessmen, and government representatives. With the strength of unity, we are going to redouble our efforts to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. 2. The unity within the framework of the law in a climate of harmony and full respect for the freedoms established by our country's political Constitution is a fundamental and indispensable element for moving toward the consolidation of our economy, the strengthening of our national sovereignty, and the improvement of the quality of life of all Mexicans. 3. One of the most important achievements of these agreements is the Mexican people's increased confidence in the future of the nation's economy. Thanks to this increased level of confidence, the difficulties that inevitably arise from time to time and that could affect our economic activity have been overcome without any major disruption of the country's economy. Yesterday's tragic events, therefore, did not trigger any crises in Mexican financial instruments today. On the contrary, the exchange rate at banks and currency exchanges abroad, as well as at unregulated currency exchange agencies operating in the country, showed considerable stability throughout the day. Such was the case for stocks, bonds, and other instruments issued by Mexican agencies and offered on many markets abroad, especially in New York. 4. Mexico's economic policies over the last few years, of which this pact is an essential element, have warranted not only the confidence of the domestic public and praise from international financial market players, but they have also elicited support from international organizations and the authorities of friendly nations. One outstanding example of this is that the U.S. Government has stated today that it is willing to allow U.S. financial authorities to assist our country's economic leaders in controlling currency exchange markets. To this end, they have offered a substantial increase in reciprocal lines of credit from $1 billion to $6 billion. The U.S. Government has kept these lines in effect for many years to promote the good performance of currency markets in each country. 5. The consolidation of the means of production, economic stability, and the promotion of competitiveness and job creation continue to be the main purpose of the sectors that signed this agreement. In light of this, the labor, peasant and business organizations -- which represent the overwhelming majority of the country's productive force -- and the Federal Government have agreed: 1. To uphold all commitments signed on 3 October 1993 as ratified on 12 January 1994 and ensure full compliance with each and every agreement therein. 2. To express our strongest condemnation of violence and attempts to destabilize the institutions we have managed to build over several generations, thanks to the efforts of all Mexicans. This agreement is signed at Los Pinos Presidential Residence on 24 March 1994 in the presence of the president of the United States of Mexico. Thank you. [Valasquez] The labor movement, which the Labor Congress represents, has approved without further discussion the statements made by Arsenio Farell, labor and social welfare secretary. We [words indistinct] needed to ratify this pact because it guarantees us social peace among productive sectors. We also agree with the [word indistinct] condemnation made by the [word indistinct] assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, our presidential candidate and the presidential candidate of the PRI. At times like these, it is impossible to say much, but we must condemn this crime and ask the government to work from now on against those who use violence as a method to solve their problems with other sectors. In cases like this, the labor movement wants no more tolerance for these criminals. They must be treated as they deserve to be treated: harshly. We must condemn their actions, and they must be punished as the law stipulates. Thank you. [Luis German Carcova Garcia, president of the Business Coordinating Council] Mr. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mr. Fidel Valasquez Sanchez, Labor Congress president [as heard]; Deputy Hugo Andres Araujo, secretary general of the National Peasant Confederation; Messrs. Secretaries of State; Ladies and Gentlemen: The national business sector is deeply concerned and firmly condemns the tragic event of 23 March, which ended the life of a brilliant Mexican who was committed to his country. This event also symbolizes an attack against Mexico and its institutions. Violence, in all its forms, is always objectionable and will never be the path to solve problems and to meet the legitimate demands of the Mexican people. The breach of peace and social order, which are necessary conditions for guaranteeing the welfare of our people, is unacceptable under any circumstances. Throughout the last few years, Mexicans have proven that through dialogue and consensus, we can overcome problems and difficult situations by reconciling different opinions and by always seeking the welfare of the nation as a whole. We have added and multiplied [as heard]. We cannot let events such as this, which has submerged Mexico in mourning, divide and diminish us. We Mexicans are committed to a plan that, with the strong leadership of President Salinas, has helped us overcome the deep macroeconomic imbalances that darkened our future. By overcoming them, we have been placed at the threshold of healthy and sustainable growth that will reverberate in a higher standard of living for all our compatriots. We must not change the original plan. Our goal is very close. The latest events seem to indicate that there are forces interested in steering away from the course and making us turn back. This goes against all Mexicans. We will not be defeated. We Mexicans, united within the framework of consensus, will always be able to find answers peacefully and objectively, as we have in the last few years. The path we have traveled is already longer that the one we have yet to climb. We reiterate that together we will be able to move on. We Mexican businessmen reiterate our commitment to the country, our belief that we chose the right path, and our commitment to work harmoniously with all sectors of society. We express our full support for the government and institutions headed by President Salinas. We emphatically reject the path of violence, the breach of peace, and lawlessness. We demand justice and strict law enforcement. Society demands it. The future of Mexico and of our children lies in the institutions, laws, unity, and intense and productive efforts of all Mexicans. Each of us, especially we businessmen, must be clear about what we are doing for Mexico. We must assume our responsibilities tactfully. Let us behave with perseverance and affection for our country. Let us defend those accomplishments that cost us so much work with the law on our side and with unity, equanimity, determination, energy, and intelligence. Thank you. [Araujo] Mr. President: The country is going through a difficult time. The unfortunate incidents that occurred yesterday in Tijuana, where our friend and companion Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta was slain, attempt to sow discord and disunity among Mexicans. Our response must serve to strengthen the institutions of the country, to unite the productive sectors, as has been manifested here, and to reject provocation and violence. To ratify the pact is also a manifestation of agreement among producers, workers, businessmen, and the government. It clearly establishes before the country that the key sectors of our economy are disposed to persevering in our work to build a strong, growing economy, more equitably distributed and capable of facing the international market. The diverse interests that are permanently expressed in this body are part of the intense reality that exists in our country. Through a concerted effort, we have shown that it is possible to harmonize different viewpoints so long as the general interest prevails over private interests. We see that calm and reason prevail in the face of difficulties. Let us maintain this trend. Let us strengthen calm and reason to prevent situations that hurt everyone but which have more of an impact on those with lower incomes because of their diminished capacity to fight in the face of crisis and instability. As producers of the countryside -- cattlemen, rural property owners, farm owners -- let us assume fully the continuation of the pact, Mr. President. Our expectation is to build a more productive, profitable sector in keeping with national priorities. We flatly reject violence and its consequences of instability. We are not disposed to leaving to the forces of instability the future of our economy and, within it, of the Mexican countryside. In this overall concerted effort formula, the diverse sectors that come together in the course of our activities in the Mexican countryside reiterate our commitment to continue the necessary efforts to strengthen our relations and our productive association and to defend the rural sector in a climate of tolerance and mutual respect. Mr. President, you have the total support of the country's agricultural and livestock sector, as well as of the rest of the members of this vast table of concerted action, without distinction. Today we understand that strengthening the instruments of economic concerted effort is indispensable, as is closing ranks around you. Your policy of national modernization, your proposal of democratic advancement, and your commitment to the poor people of Mexico demonstrates this. Let no one be deceived. We maintain a great capability to move forward as a nation within a framework of differences but with unity on fundamental aspects. Thank you very much. [Salinas] Ladies and gentlemen: In view of the unacceptable violent act that led to the sad and outrageous death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the representatives of laborers, peasants, businessmen, and the government are here today to ratify the main terms of the pact. This reflects our full commitment to implement its terms on time and shows serenity, a vision of the future, and unity of the nation. This unity is based on giving priority to those things we value most: sovereignty, liberty, democracy, and justice in an atmosphere of legality and harmony. When developments that are incompatible with our values and goals occur in the nation's life, Mexicans unite, strengthen the ties that bring us closer, and reject with a single voice any attempt to make us lose direction and divert our efforts and any idea that violence can discourage Mexico. Unity is the most powerful of our virtues, and legality represents the full validity of our Constitution, our single guiding principle for social life. Today, you are ratifying the 3 October commitments to reduce inflation, to improve productivity and salaries, and to clearly speak out against violence in favor of law and national unity. The dedicated work of Mexicans is recognized abroad today. This work has allowed us to face the unexpected circumstances of life at home and abroad. This recognition is reflected in the support mentioned today in the financial area. Also, and this is important, today Mexico joined one of the world's most important economic organizations, the OECD. Through it, our country will have a much greater presence in industrialized countries, especially in Europe. [applause] [five-second break in reception] that we will defend the efforts made and the opportunities created [three-second break in reception] legality that we will not allow impunity to take away our serenity. We must continue to advance. Ladies and gentlemen, we will enforce the country's Constitution and law because that is the civil thing to do. We will comply with peace agreements, because peace and harmony are our strongest convictions. We will honor the pact because it is an instrument of our solidarity to progress with more justice. We will remain true to ourselves despite the painful circumstances, because that is what is demanded by the justified indignation of Mexicans in the face of insults. Unity, consensus, and unrestricted respect for the law have helped us advance and achieve all our goals. Unity will continue to guarantee us a better future. That is why we must maintain and reaffirm our pride as Mexicans. Thank you very much.
