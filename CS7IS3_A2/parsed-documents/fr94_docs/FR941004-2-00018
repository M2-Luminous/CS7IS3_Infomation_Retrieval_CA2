FR941004-2-00018 FR941004-2-00008 [A&hyph;549&hyph;809] Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From Thailand AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vincent Kane or Julie Anne Osgood, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;2815 or 482&hyph;0167, respectively. Preliminary Determination: We have preliminary determined that certain carbon steel butt-Weld pipe fittings from Thailand are being sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the ``Act''). The estimated margin is shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994 (59 FR 14148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred: On April 11, 1994, the United States International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination ( see, ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;689, 59 FR 18825 (April 20, 1994)). The Department issued its antidumping duty questionnaire to Asahi Sangyo (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (AST), on April 29, 1994. AST was the only Thai producer and exporter to be excluded from the antidumping duty order on butt-weld pipe fittings from Thailand published on July 6, 1992 (57 FR 29702). All other producers and exporters of the subject merchandise to the United States are subject to the antidumping duty order currently in effect. AST was excluded from the original order because we found its margin of sales at less than fair value at that time to be de minimis . On June 18, 1994, petitioner alleged that AST was selling the subject merchandise in Thailand at less than its cost of production. On August 12, 1994, we found, in accordance with section 773(b), that reasonable grounds exist to believe or suspect that sales in the home market were being made at less than the cost of production based on information contained in the record, including petitioner's allegation. On August 15, 1994, we issued a cost of production and constructed value questionnaire to AST. We received a response from AST on September 9, 1994. Scope of the Investigation The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening (e.g., threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS''). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (``POI'') is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994. Such or Similar Comparisons In making our fair value comparisons, in accordance with the Department's standard methodology, we first compared sales of merchandise identical in all respects. If no identical merchandise was sold, we compared sales of the most similar merchandise, as determined by the model-matching criteria contained in Appendix V of the questionnaire (``Appendix V'') (on file in room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce (``Public File'')). Regarding level of trade, AST reported that it sells to an importer/distributor in the United States and directly to distributors, end users, and a commissionaire agent in Thailand. AST negotiates prices on a sale-by-sale basis and states that it is unable to discern any correlation between selling prices and customer categories. Further, AST states that its selling expenses do not vary by customer category. Therefore, in keeping with past practice ( see, e.g., Final Results of Administrative Review: Antifriction Bearings and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, et al. (56 FR 31692, 31709&hyph;11; July 11, 1991) and Import Administration Policy Bulletin 92/1, Matching at Levels of Trade, issued on July 29, 1992)), and in accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we have compared AST's U.S. sales to its home market sales to all customers. Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether AST's sales for export to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.
