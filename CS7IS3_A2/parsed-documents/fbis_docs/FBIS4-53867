These figures will be included in a report recommending adoption of the summer time system to be submitted by June by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Natural Resources and Energy Agency director's private-sector advisory organ, the Summer Time System Forum (chaired by professor Hiroaki Fukami of Keio University). At the request of the forum, the nonprofit organization, "Leisure Time Development Center," compiled a report based on a questionnaire survey covering changes in lifestyles. The survey was premised on the assumption that clocks would be advanced for one hour during the April through September summer period. As a result, the effect on domestic demand would be an increase of 10 percent over fiscal year 1992 to include 330 million yen spent on the use of sports facilities such as golf shooting ranges and 64 million yen spent on sporting goods. Spending on movies, theaters, and concerts would reach a level of 145 million yen, reflecting a 30-percent increase, while spending on recreational travel would reach 344 million yen. On the other hand, the effect on annual energy conservation converted into petroleum equivalents would be 310,000 kiloliters for domestic use and 240,000 kiloliters for commercial use. The agency plans to use these estimates as a basis for appealing for implementation of the system as being beneficial in promoting changes to lifestyles that emphasize leisure pursuits.
