After the increase on January 15, the amount of subsidy the producing companies received for nine different kinds of fertilizer was increased by 17-80 percent. After the rescission of the price hike for fertilizer in December the second subsidy increase was adopted for fertilizer producers so that the increase in foreign currency exchange would not be reflected in prices. The subsidy increase, which was implemented so that farmers could buy affordable fertilizer, will be applied in the spring to the nine most commonly used kinds of fertilizer. The decision of the Council of Ministers regarding the subsidy increase, which is applied to nine different kinds of fertilizers, and the increase, which fluctuates from 17 to 80 percent, was published in yesterday's RESMI GAZETE [OFFICIAL JOURNAL]. According to the publication, the subsidies of the ammonia sulfate went from 475 to 855 lira and triple super phosphate went from 700 to 2000 lira. In addition to this, the subsidies of ammonium sulfate rose from 270 to 770 lira, ammonium nitrate from 620 to 1060 lira, urea from 500 to 950 lira, diammonium phosphate from 1250 to 2000 lira, "20.20.20" composition fertilizer from 1000 to 1350 lira, and the "15.15.15" composition fertilizer to 1390 lira.
