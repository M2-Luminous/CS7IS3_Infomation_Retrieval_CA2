A high-ranking official from the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy pointed out that the difficulties China is facing in reforms are unprecedented and wide-ranging. In his view, the greatest pressure right now is inflation, which however was not caused by reforms, but by people's expectations. Reforms in China's macroeconomic system are themselves the greatest inflation-curbing factor. Feng Bing, State Commission for Restructuring the Economy spokesman, pointed out a few days ago that reforms in macroeconomic systems such as taxation, financial, and investment systems and reforms in the microeconomy consisting of creating a modern corporate system are the two main programs for this year's economic reforms, both of which display the five characteristics of clearness, standardization, matching supports, increasing speed, and unexampled novelty. How to handle the relationship between reforms and development? Vow to prevent as much as possible the unveiling of reformist measures from touching off relatively big social turmoil? Will inflation slow down the pace of reform? These have become the focus of attention from all circles. Feng Bing pointed out that speeding up reforms is brought up under the historical demand of speeding up development, while speeding up development is achieved within the framework of speeding up reform. As the objective of creating a socialist market economic system becomes clear, there is now a more harmonious, mutually reinforcing and supporting relationship between reforms and development. Although new problems and contradictions appear, the focus now is on initiating parallel reforms in different subsystems within the reform system to solve new problems that appear in development, and not an all-inclusive and sweeping generalization on the kind of environment development will provide for reforms. This official believes that future fluctuation cycles produced by contradictions between reforms and development will shorten. On balance, reforms have been responsible for promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in a way that is much more powerful than the impact of the economic environment on reforms. The beginning of new year saw the implementation of a new tax system and the smooth integration of renminbi rates, giving the "reform year" a good start, though there are still many points of difficulty. Mainly these are: One, will the pursuit of reforms in the financial system before the establishment of a new framework affect financing? Two, will reforms in the investment system that closely follow the financial reforms trigger another round of investment craze? Three, the promulgation of the "company law" signals the beginning of a modern corporate system. But many state- owned enterprises are heavily in debt, draining away huge state- owned assets, and there is not yet a social security system. Where to begin with all these problems? Four, how can rural reform be deepeneds? How can the problem of the slow growth of peasant income be solved? Five, how can speculative behavior be curbed and inflation pressure eased during the process creating a capital goods market? Feng Bing believes that price rises might delay the promulgation of some specific reformist measures, but will not affect overall reform of the macro-system. At this stage, where the old overlaps with the new, essential administrative measures should be kept. The urgent thing right now is to start reforms in the financial system. Feng Bing pointed out that now more than ever China needs stability and understanding of reforms. It must create an environment of "stability, legal system, and consensus" for reforms. In specific operations, Feng Bing draw attention to the following points: One, the unveiling of reformist measures should be well timed, go through a certain procedure, and conducted scientifically to avoid "clashes between projects." Two, make the best use of circumstances and channel reform thought to popular actions. Three, increase the pace of legislation; 54 of this year's 152 legislative measures concern economic matters. Four, speed up progress toward "reentry into GATT," which will introduce external dynamics into domestic reforms. This official of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy stated that overall, he is optimistic about the reform situation in China this year.
