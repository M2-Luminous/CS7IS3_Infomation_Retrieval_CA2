Yesterday is the first day in which all state-owned grain stores began providing an unlimited supply of grains and cooking oil by lowering prices and hanging a prices plate. Early in the morning that day, Secretary of the provincial party committee Jiang Chunyun, and Deputy Secretary of the provincial party committee and Vice Governor of the province Li Chunting were accompanied by responsible comrades of the provincial level departments concerned, on a trip to the provincial grains and cereal oil group corporation listen to a briefing, discuss measures, and make work arrangements for maintaining low prices for grains and cooking oil. The entourage then went to the grain and cereal oil foodstuffs center on Shengli Street to inspect the sale and supply of grains and to extend cordial regards to staff members and workers at the center. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Rapid efforts need to be made to keep down the prices of grains and cooking oil and ensure market stability. He said: Localities in the east and west of the province incurred an overly large scale of price hikes in grains and cooking oil since the last 10 days of November. Attaching great importance to this, the provincial party committee and the provincial people's government stabilized grain prices by adopting effective measures in line with the spirit of directives of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Thus, grain prices in some localities have begun to recede. He said: Grain prices affect the whole situation and should be lowered as soon as possible so that the price of grains and other nonstaple foodstuffs are brought to a rational level by resolutely implementing the important policy decisions made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, enhancing leadership, adopting measures, and by successfully conducting work. Jiang Chunyun stressed: In order to enable the mass to clear their minds of doubt and misgiving, we should enhance propaganda and education to stabilize people's feelings and clearly tell the masses that the grain supply is ensured by sufficient storage of grain from this year's bumper harvests of grains and oil-bearing seeds. Allocation of the supply of grains and cooking oil, processing of grains, and promotion of sales in grains and cooking oil should be done well. State-owned grain centers should bring their major distributing role into play. All of them should conduct their sales with the plate of unified prices and at the lowered prices and provide unlimited supply. Efforts should be made to ensure the grain supply for large and medium-sized cities and disaster-plagued areas. The grain supply for higher and secondary educational institutions should be ensured along wholesale prices. Various departments as well as industries and trades should actively make contributions to stabilizing the grain prices and markets. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: A good job should be realistically done to provide markets with a grain supply during the Spring Festival. Commodity distributing departments and enterprises on the commercial front should extensively open more channels, organize the sources of goods to enter markets, upgrade their service quality, and saturate the festive demands of the people. They should render delivery services for remote areas; the old, weak, sick, and disabled; households enjoying the five guarantees; and the family members of martyrs and servicemen. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: An especially good job should be done in managing the livelihood of the masses in the disaster-plagued areas and the staff members and workers of enterprises suffering losses. Party committees and governments at all levels should immediately conduct examination over their living conditions and adopt every possible means to successfully deal with their practical difficulties. Meanwhile, we should launch a campaign of having rich households help. Wealthy areas and money-making enterprises should give a helping hand to disaster-plagued areas and fully express the superiority of socialist systems under the leadership of Communist party. Jiang Chunyun stressed: A good job should be done in consolidating public security in a comprehensive way and maintaining production safety so as to ensure the absence of serious incidents concerning public security and production safety during the Spring Festival and to ensure that the masses feel safe. Efforts should be made to enrich the masses' festive cultural life and a good job should be continuously done in combating corruption and encouraging administrative honesty. We should resolutely block various malpractices, such as hosting banquets and presenting gifts with public funds as well as indulging in extravagant eating and drinking. We should saturate the demands set by the party in this regard with our qualified work achievements. On behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial people's government, Jiang Chunyun extended festive greetings to the cadres, staff members, and workers on the province's grain front as well as to the people throughout the province in handling the official work on the spot. He wished the people across the province a happy new year and even greater achievements in the new year.
