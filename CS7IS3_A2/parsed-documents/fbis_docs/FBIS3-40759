Correspondents from Reuter, Agence France-Presse, the XINHUA Chinese news agency, Reuter [sic], the Spanish press agency, the WTN television network, and periodicals such as SAWT AL-SHA'B [VOICE OF THE PEOPLE], AL-DUSTUR, AL-SHAYHAN of Jordan, a representative of the Iraqi Press Agency, and an Associated Press photographer, came to view the conditions of citizens residing in the al-Huwayzah marshes in the governorates. The marsh inhabitants expressed, in chants and songs, their love and loyalty to the wise leadership of President Saddam Husayn, and their gratitude for his glorious guidance, in order to achieve the finest free and honorable way of life. They asserted their absolute readiness to defend great Iraq and the unity of his citizens, and to thwart all the imperialist and Zionist plots aimed at harming the unity of the citizens of Iraq, their present and their future. They condemned the criminal sanctions imposed by the forces of evil and hostility on the heroic citizens of Iraq, which violated all divine and human standards and laws. The representative of the Iraqi Press Agency said that the marsh inhabitants made clear to the reporters their opposition to the continued acts of provocation committed by certain infiltrators from Iran to commit acts of aggression and interference against them. They asked that their voices be heard by world public opinion when they sought a halt to the course pursued by the rulers of Iran, their violation of good neighborly relations, and their infringement on the freedom of others. They called upon the Iranians to cease these practices, which are blatant aggression against defenseless citizens. They also demanded the exposure of the fraud and false claims of the hostile media, which are aimed at fracturing the unity of the Iraqis and creating dissension among them. They reaffirmed that their living conditions are normal, stable, and safe.
