While examining a government work report with army deputies to the National People's Congress, he called on officers and men of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to make new contributions to China's reform, development and stability. Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that new reform measures taken earlier this year in taxation, banking, investment, planning, foreign trade and enterprise reform are a "decisive battle" for the country's reform program and open policy implementation. He said: "victory of this battle and establishment of a framework for a socialist market economic structure will provide a powerful guarantee for a sustained, rapid and sound growth of China's economy. "We must have a secure and stable social and political environment to achieve this victory. "Officers and men must be fully aware of their historical responsibilities and strengthen army building so as to better carry out their sacred mission of safeguarding China's security and unification, and defending its modernization drive." Jiang Zemin, who is also the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, praised officers and men for having stood the test in the course of reform and opening up, and for their being of one heart and mind with the party Central Committee. He also called for efforts to improve ideological work among officers and men in the course of creating a socialist market economy. He stressed the importance of setting lofty ideals, observing discipline, seeking unity, subordinating personal interests to the overall interests of the nation and unswervingly following the party's basic line of taking economic development as the central task. President Jiang described reform, opening up and the modernization drive as a "grand and arduous" undertaking, which requires the mobilization of all social sectors. He said the undertaking makes it imperative to bring into full play the initiative and creativeness of all officers and men so that they will better contribute to army modernization and China's prosperity and long-term stability. The most important task at present is to improve education among officers and men in Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, army building during the new period, party's basic line, army's functions and patriotism, he said. Jiang also stressed the need to improve living conditions for officers and men, noting: "Army units at all levels must try their best to step up agricultural and sideline production." It is an important guiding principle of the party to place equal emphasis on material progress and ideological and cultural progress, he noted. He called on the Army to stand in the forefront of society in promoting ideological and cultural progress. Army units at all levels must persist in strict training of soldiers and explore new ways for troop command, he said. "We must further improve unity between the Army and the government and between the Army and the people," he said in conclusion.
