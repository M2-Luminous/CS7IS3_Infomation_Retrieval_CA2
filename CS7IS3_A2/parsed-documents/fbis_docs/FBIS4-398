Yesterday, 400 Belgian paratroopers took off to take part in the evacuation. The Rwandan Government has officially authorized our planes to land, but, according to the Belgian Defense Ministry, it is not at all clear whether the Rwandan Army is obeying the new government's orders. Kigali airport remains blocked, and the situation is becoming more and more dangerous for Belgian nationals. Jean-Philippe Seti of Radio Suisse Romande reports from Kigali: [Seti] The white population is not being directly targeted, but it is becoming increasingly dangerous to step out into the street, since you can be murdered for your valuables. There is, however, a new element: The hunt for Belgians has begun. It is very dangerous to be a Belgian in Kigali. I have been stopped at several checkpoints and brutally asked whether I am Belgian. It is clear that Belgians are being targeted. The Belgians are particularly afraid. [passage omitted]
