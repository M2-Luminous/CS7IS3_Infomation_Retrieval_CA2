In exchanging greetings, both presidents expressed the desire and goodwill to further develop bilateral relations. Worried about the situation in the Balkans, both presidents committed themselves to prevent, through diplomatic policy and dialogue, the spread of conflict and work for the stability in the region. This morning President Berisha started his activities with a visit to a small church, more than 200 years old, in the center of Bucharest, which for a long time was known as the Albanian Church, called Dintrozi [as heard] in Romanian. Addressing the priest of the church, President Berisha said: I have come here to visit this church, which is a great symbol for all Albanians, as Archbishop Fan Noli, one of the most distinguished figures in letters, the church, and the Albanian political world, addressed his prayers here. I have also come here because I pray to God to bless Albania and Romania, and Albanians of Romania, including Viktor Eftimiu, along with many other Romanian personalities of Albanian origin. Meanwhile, the daily newspapers of Bucharest and the radio and television continue to publish and broadcast news on the visit of President Berisha in Romania. At 1100, Berisha gave an exclusive interview for Romanian Television. After that, Berisha held a meeting with Emil Constantinescu, leader of the Democratic Convention. At this meeting Berisha acquainted his interlocutor with developments in Albania, stressing the achievements of the shock therapy and a group of completely social measures. Honoring the sublime act of the martyrs of Timisoara, Berisha said: They not only gave their lives against Ceausescu's dictatorship, but they shook the foundations of dictatorship in Albania and encouraged Albanians to raise and liberate themselves from it. They will always be honored in Albania. President Berisha also expressed thanks for the help that is being given to Albanian students in Romania, as Constantinescu is rector of the Bucharest University and dean of the Romanian rectors. For his part, Mr. Emil Constantinescu said that we in Romania need the Albanian experience, as it is more important to know than the experience in other countries as the United States or Germany. Our countries have suffered from fierce dictatorships and the transition started under grave conditions. That is why we are interested in getting acquainted with the Albanian experience. Your visit here offers a very good opportunity. Regarding President Berisha's request for supporting the Democratic Party membership in the European Democratic Union, Constantinescu committed himself to render his contribution. President Berisha also gave an interview for the largest opposition paper, ROMANIA LIBERA.
