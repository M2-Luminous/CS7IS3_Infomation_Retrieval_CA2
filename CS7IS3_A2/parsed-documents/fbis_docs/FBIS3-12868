Word of the visit, carried by an opposition radio in northern Iraq, has set off a political crisis within the French Government. The Iraqi opposition radio said Lt. Gen. al-Majid obtained an entry visa to France under an assumed name and on a Jordanian diplomatic passport, along with his secretary, Khalid al-Makhzumi, and his wife, who is Saddam's daughter. Al-Majid had been hospitalized at the King Husayn Medical Center, where he underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor that turned out to be benign. [passage omitted] The question remains, however, whether Jordan really made Jordanian passports available to the Iraqis. Jordan's Interior Minister Salamah Hammad, in a statement to SHIHAN, has disclaimed any knowledge of the passport issue, and stressed that his ministry has not issued passports to any Iraqis.
