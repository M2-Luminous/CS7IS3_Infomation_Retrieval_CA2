In a report submitted to Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki, the Telecommunications Council also recommended scrapping restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications concerns. The ministry is expected to implement the proposals as early as this summer. Under the existing rules, domestic telecommunications firms are prohibited from offering both domestic and overseas services at the same time regarding satellite communications. They also limit foreign ownership of telecommunications companies to less than one-third. But Japan has been under growing pressure from abroad to relax rules on foreign telecommunications concerns, as foreign enterprises step up satellite telecommunications services.
