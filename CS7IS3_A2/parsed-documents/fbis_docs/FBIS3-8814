Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the U.N. protected areas (UNPAs) (Krajina), which expires on March 31, 1994, and set out that the "UNPROFOR presence in the UNPAs is necessary until a political settlement is reached." The Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) was proclaimed a U.N. protected area under the plan of special U.N. envoy for the former Yugoslavia Cyrus Vance in March 1992, after the Krajina-Croatia conflict broke out in 1991 because of Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslavia. The RSK, which comprises predominantly Serb-populated areas within the administrative borders of the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia, was proclaimed in response to Croatia's forcible secession and the attempt of its authorities to reduce the Serb people to a national minority. Kontic said in a letter sent to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that U.N. resolution 871 of October 4, 1993, under which the UNPROFOR's mandate was extended until March 31, 1994, envisaged that the U.N. peace-keepers "remain in the UNPAs until a comprehensive political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis is found." In the letter, a copy of which was sent to TANJUG on Tuesday, Kontic said that resolution 871 also envisaged that the "UNPROFOR mandate is to be renewed if such a solution is not achieved through negotiations." "It is not necessary to make special mention of the importance of the UNPROFOR presence in the past, since it was precisely UNPROFOR that has ensured the consistent implementation of the Vance plan, enabled the maintenance of fragile peace and prevented further confrontation of the parties in conflict," Kontic said in the letter. The Yugoslav prime minister set out that the "F.R. of Yugoslavia considers that conditions have not yet been created for terminating the UNPROFOR peace mission and that the UNPROFOR presence in the UNPAs is necessary until a political settlement is reached." The letter said that if new U.N. troops were to be engaged or regularly replaced, it would, "for historical reasons, be inappropriate to engage troops" from neighbouring countries or former occupying forces. The Yugoslav prime minister said that the "F.R.Y. supports the Vance plan and is interested" that it be fully respected and implemented by all parties. Kontic said that Yugoslavia would "strive to facilitate the UNPROFOR peace mission in the former Yugoslavia and contribute, within the limits of its possibilities, to reducing the costs of the peace mission."
