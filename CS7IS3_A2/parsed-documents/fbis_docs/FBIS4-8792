According to the same sources, some 50 antitank shells were fired and dozens of hand grenades were hurled. The conflict culminated when UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops, stationed at Glavica and Sabanove Kuce, joined the Muslim forces, the Serb military forces claim. They say that the UNPROFOR and government troops were targeting the Serb positions with antiaircraft guns and incendiary ammunition. A trench in the central section of the Serb positions in Ugljesic was destroyed. The Serb fighters returned fire in retaliation for these joint operations, so a lull followed 20 minutes later. The Serbian military forces also report that there were no dead or wounded on the Serb side and that the front lines remain unchanged.
