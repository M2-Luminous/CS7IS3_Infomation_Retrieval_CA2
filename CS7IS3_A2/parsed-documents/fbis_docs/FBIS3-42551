An orbiting vehicle will probe the surface with radar in the frequency range of 0.5-5 MHz with the emission of pulsed radio signals and measurement of the strength of the signals reflected off the nightside surface. Interpretation of the signals will be unusual in that the cryolithosphere is a multicomponent medium with a nonuniform structure that results from, among other things, considerable depth variation in ice content and the possible presence of saline ice and briny solutions. In light of that, the work reported here involves a technique for calculating the depth profiles of the dielectric permeability of the mixtures of the various materials in the cryolithosphere based on the temperature and frequency relationships of the dielectric permeability of ice. The technique assumes that the frozen ground can contain either freshwater ice or saline ice, and it enables calculation of the dielectric permeability of two- and three-phase ellipsoidal-particles mixtures, depending on the volumetric content of the soil components and their dielectric permeability. The dielectric permeability of ice is calculated in the context of the theory of orientation polarization of dielectrics with typical relaxation times. The researchers concluded that the skin layer may be hundreds or thousands of meters thick, depending on the soil composition. Figures 4, references 13: 6 Russian, 7 Western.
