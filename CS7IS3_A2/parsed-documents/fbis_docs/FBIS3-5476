Hosokawa, speaking at the House of Representatives plenary session, said "a window for the negotiations is still open to both Japan and the United States." Japan is determined to go ahead with its pump-priming measures and the opening of its market to foreign traders, he said. The prime minister was referring to his February 11 summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Hosokawa and Clinton announced the breakdown of the framework talks at a joint news conference following the Washington summit. Hosokawa, replying to questions by Shunichi Suzuki, a member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), expressed worries about the reinstatement of the "Super 301" trade provision, which he said violates the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Super 301, reintroduced by Clinton on March 3, gives the U.S. Government power to impose retaliatory tariffs against unfair traders if they fail to remove trade barriers. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told the same session that Japan, the U.S. and South Korea will make joint efforts to resolve the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. At the House of Councillors earlier in the day, Hosokawa renewed his pledge to reform Japan's economic structure, which has been criticized by other countries as impeding fair trade. "The Japanese people expected the coalition government to break the rigidity of politics and the economy caused by the long-term rule of the Liberal Democratic Party," he said. Hosokawa also expressed hope that the Japanese economy will see a recovery in fiscal 1994, which begins in April. Accelerating inventory adjustment in the private sector offers bright prospects but the economy remains stagnant in general, he said at the upper house session. "The government compiled the 15 trillion yen stimulus package and incorporated measures into the fiscal 1994 budget to bring the economy back on track as early as possible in fiscal 1994 and keep up stable growth from fiscal 1995 on," the premier said. He was responding to questions by Tomio Yamamoto, an LDP upper house legislator. Hosokawa tried to allay concern about a possible shortage of rice, saying the government increased the amount of domestically grown rice to be sold in March and is taking steps to solve the shortage. Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of rice to make up for the shortage resulting from last year's worst harvest in the postwar period. Representatives of political parties started three days of interpellations Monday on last Friday's policy speeches by Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers.
