The a-boron samples analyzed were metallic boron films, whisker-like, and fiber prepared by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD),[.sup]1[/] and fine powders deposited at ambient (room) temperature by a laser-induced dielectric breakdown (LIDB) reaction.[.sup]2[/] It was found that the SRO structures as observed on the reduced RDF's, G(r)[.sub]obs[/]'S, gave similar undulations to those derived from the _b_-rhombohedral boron structure regardless of the differences in their appearance and growth conditions. In the present work, we have studied by using the same method the following various types of a-boron different from those described above: i) Reddish brown powders of Moissan boron[.sup]3[/] produced by Mg metallothermic reduction of boron oxide: MTR. ii) Metallic thin films deposited at 530�C at low pressure as 0.1 Pa (7.5 x 10[.sup]-4[/] torr) of a mixed gas of B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]+H[.sub]2[/] (30% in B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]) by the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma CVD method[.sup]4,5[/]: LPCVD. iii) Metallic thin films vacuum deposited (10[.sup]-6[/] torr) from sintered Moissan boron by irradiation of electron beams (acceleration voltage: 4 kV, I[.sub]emis[/]: 110 mA): PVD. iv) Dark brown films vacuum deposited (10[.sup]-6[/] torr) by laser ablation of metallic boron (ND:YAG laser, 10 Hz, pulse energy: 0.1 J, pulse width: 4ns): LPVD. The SRO structures of a-boron here obtained are almost the same as those published previously. Thus the SRO structure of a-boron does not depend on the preparative methods and the boron sources. These remind the term ``Ideal'' amorphous state.[.sup]6[/] The SRO structure is recapitulated[.sup]1[/] that the a-boron has a short range order in that the B[.sub]12[/] icosahedra are linked along their pseudo-fivefold axes with a rotation of up to �/5 with respect to each other (out of phase).
