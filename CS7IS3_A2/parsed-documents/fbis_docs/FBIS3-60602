He noted that unfounded accusations have been heard on the part of certain participants at the lofty forum to the effect that Ukraine has supposedly declared itself a nuclear state. However, the minister of foreign affairs emphasized, Ukraine does not want and has never desired to acquire operational control over nuclear weapons. The nuclear button is located in Moscow, and one should not forget this. For Ukraine nuclear weapons are material wealth, in which the labor of the Ukrainian people has been invested. There is, therefore, every ground for demanding just compensation, Anatoliy Zlenko stated. The minister explained Ukraine's stance regarding the nuclear weapons located on its territory. The decision of the Supreme Council on ratification of the START I Treaty, he said, opens the way to gradual elimination of nuclear arsenals. The world should realize this, understand it, and take a step to meeting Ukraine halfway. The head of the foreign policy department stressed that giving Ukraine appropriate guarantees of security and economic assistance on the part of the world community would remove all obstacles from Ukraine's path to acceding to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Touching on the issue of giving Russia a mandate for peace-making operations on the territory of the former USSR, the minister of foreign affairs emphasized that a reliable mechanism to control such operations needs to be created, which should only involve multinational forces. The television and radio agency Novyny reported this at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.
