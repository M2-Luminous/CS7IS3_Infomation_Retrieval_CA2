FR941104-1-00029 FR941104-1-00006 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms 27 CFR Part 9 [Notice No. 801] RIN 1512-AA07 The St. Helena Viticultural Area (94F-015P) AGENCY: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) is considering the establishment of a viticultural area in the State of California to be known as ``St. Helena.'' The proposed area is located totally within Napa County. This proposal is the result of a petition submitted by Mr. Charles A. Carpy, Chairman of the St. Helena Appellation Committee. The establishment of viticultural areas and the subsequent use of viticultural area names as appellations of origin in wine labeling and advertising will help consumers better identify the wines they may purchase, and will help winemakers distinguish their products from wines made in other areas. DATES: Written comments must be received by February 2, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to: Chief, Wine and Beer Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, P.O. Box 50221, Washington, DC 20091-0221 (Attn: Notice No. 801). Copies of the petition, the proposed regulations, the appropriate maps, and any written comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours at: ATF Reading Room, Office of Public Affairs and Disclosure, Room 6480, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert White, Wine and Beer Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20226 (202-927-8230). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR Part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of definitive viticultural areas. The regulations allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used as an appellation of origin on wine labels and in wine advertisements. On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new Part 9 to 27 CFR, for the listing of approved American viticultural areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27 CFR, defines an American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of which have been delineated in Subpart C of Part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a viticultural area. The petition should include: (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition; (b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; (c) Evidence relating to the geographical features (climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area from surrounding areas; (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the viticultural area, based on the features which can be found on United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest applicable scale; and
