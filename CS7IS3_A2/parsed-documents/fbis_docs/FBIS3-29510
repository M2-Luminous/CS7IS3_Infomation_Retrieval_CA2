The ministry said imports in the April-December period totaled 437,000 tons, rising 25.7 percent from a year earlier and topping the annual record of 423,000 tons set in fiscal 1992. Imports in fiscal 1993, ending March 31, are expected to total 550,000 tons, the ministry forecast. Japan liberalized beef imports in 1991 and reduced tariffs in 1992 and 1993. Imported beef is used mostly by restaurant chains. The ministry said beef imports are expected to continue increasing in the coming years, since Japan agreed in December at the Uruguay Round of global trade talks to further reduce the tariffs to 38.5 percent from the present 50 percent in the six years beginning 1995.
