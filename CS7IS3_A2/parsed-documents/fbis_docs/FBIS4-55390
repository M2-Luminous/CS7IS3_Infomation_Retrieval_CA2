Mass concentrations of Serbian military forces and their movement have created a tense situation in the above said villages and regions around, because Serbian soldiers are also using fire weapons during the exercises. The "Azem Bejtja" School yard in Dubovc, its grounds as well as the territories of the former mine have turned into areas mined by the Serbian soldiers, creating hazards for the Albanians residing in these areas. Situations of this kind have also been created in Skenderaj, with dozens of Serbian soldiers and their dogs standing in front of the houses of Mikushice's inhabitants shooting incessantly with fire weapons. The Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms also reports that about 300 Serbian troops have engaged in military exercises with mechanised means in Sibovc of the Podujeve commune. Military concentrations have been noticed recently also in Necavc, near Hani i Elezit, with soldiers openly provoking Albanians and grabbing their cattle. The mass concentrations of military troops and their engagement in exercises show of an escalation of military tension, besides that of the police, which are of dangerous consequences not only for the inhabitants of the said areas but also of the areas beyond. This also testifies to the fact that now, with the Kosova question being on the agenda of the international organisations to solve it through peaceful ways, Belgrade is determined to follow the track of war.
