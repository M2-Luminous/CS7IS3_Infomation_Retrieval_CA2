People associated with different organizations and various political persuasions will attend, said Rene Mujica, an adviser to Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina. During an interview on Radio Rebelde, Mujica explained that approximately 200 persons will receive personal invitations and that representatives of anti-Cuban terrorist groups -- which are mainly based in the United States -- will be excluded. This meeting, scheduled for 22-24 April, was announced by Foreign Minister Robaina on 14 February. Robaina explained that one of the conference's goals is "to examine measures that could be adopted to normalize the immigrants' ties to their homeland." Mujica says this is not seen as a short-term issue, since most of the immigrants' ties with their homeland have developed within the framework of 35 years of [word indistinct] by the United States against the Cuban revolution. Considering these antecedents, one can understand that the goal of normalizing the immigrants' relations with their homeland will not be easy, Mujica said. However, he added, we believe this is a legitimate objective that benefits all parties involved and injures no one, and it can be achieved if both we and the immigrants have the will to work towards its realization. The official did not rule out finding a way to achieve this goal with former counterrevolutionaries who have changed their attitude, but he made clear that this objective can never be achieved with those who persist with an antinational attitude. There is no place here for the counterrevolution, Mujica stressed. It was recalled that the first meeting between local authorities and immigrants took place in late 1978, but afterward, the aggressive policy toward Cuba of the Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations deftly constrained the development of these ties.
