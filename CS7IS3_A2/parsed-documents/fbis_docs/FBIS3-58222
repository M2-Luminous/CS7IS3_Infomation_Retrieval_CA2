On Wednesday [12 January], there will be the no-confidence debate and vote, then President Scalfaro will decide when to dissolve the chambers. Giovanni Masotti reports: [Masotti] This could be the final week for this brief and troubled Eleventh legislature -- the last one of the First Republic. The elections of 5 April 1992 seem like a very long time ago. These elections brought about the formation of this parliament, which has been rocked by the Clean Hands enquiry. In the last few hours, further poisonous speculation has been aimed at the president and at the institutions. On Tuesday, an event will be held that seems to symbolize the end of an era -- on the eve of Wednesday's no-confidence debate, the parliamentary Immunity Committee will question [Maurizio] Broccoletti, the former Intelligence and Democratic Security Service [Sisde] treasurer, and it will examine the position of the former interior ministers, [Antonio] Gava and [Vicenzo] Scotti. The day after the no-confidence debate, Prime Minister Ciampi could go to the Quirinale Palace [president's office] and hand in his resignation to President Scalfaro without waiting for the outcome of the no-confidence vote which has been presented by Pannella. On Friday, the head of state could then decide to dissolve the chambers. In the meantime, all eyes are turned to the possible voting alliances. There has been hectic activity on the moderate front, which is trying to gather in its sparse membership. Bossi has done a U-turn by announcing that federalism can wait, that the Northern League is happy with regionalism so as not to divide the Liberal Democrats and to beat Occhetto. Bossi's declarations have been welcomed by both the Christian Democrat neo-Centrists who are ready to ditch Martinazzoli and by Berlusconi, who has been discussing the possibility of an alliance with the League for a long time.
