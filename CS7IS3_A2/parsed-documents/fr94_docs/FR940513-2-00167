FR940513-2-00167 FR940513-2-00083 2. The directors of the Company, trustees of the Trust, and the directors/trustees of any subsequently created Funds (collectively, ``Directors/Trustees''), including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, will approve the offering of multiple classes of shares (the ``Multi-Class System''). The minutes of the respective meetings of the Directors/Trustees regarding the deliberations of the Directors/Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the Directors/Trustees' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds including a majority of the Directors/Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of Directors/Trustees, and the Directors/Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. 4. On an ongoing basis, the Directors/Trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the various classes of shares. The Directors/Trustees, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Each Fund's adviser and distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Directors/Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Fund's adviser and distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. 5. If a Fund implements any amendment to its 12b&hyph;1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by class of shares (for purposes of the Application, ``Class X'') under the plan, existing shares of a class of shares that converts into Class X shares after a period of time (for purposes of the application, ``Class Y'') will stop converting into Class X unless the Class Y shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Directors/Trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Class Y shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Class X''), identical in all material respects to Class X as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Class X. If deemed advisable by the Directors/Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Class Y shares for a new class (``New Class Y''), identical to existing Class Y shares in all material respects except that New Class Y will convert into New Class X. New Class X or New Class Y may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in any manner that the Directors/Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition (4), any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Class X or New Class Y shall be borne solely by the adviser and the distributor. Class Y shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Class X shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Class X plan and the relationship of such plan to the Class Y shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 6. The Administrative Services Arrangements will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 7. The Directors/Trustees of the Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Directors/Trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review an approval of the independent Directors/Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
