In a dictatorial decree, he appointed himself prime minister. Through this ploy, Saddam is trying to blame Ahmad Husayn and his ministers for the suffocating economic and social crises from which the Iraqi masses are suffering. But this farce means nothing to the Iraqi citizens; it can never mislead the Iraqi people. As president, Saddam Husayn has failed to find any solution to the problems of the Iraqis, problems caused by his own wrong policies. How then can he, as prime minister, save the Iraqis from their tragedies and ordeals? Apart from this, the Iraqi citizen knows full well that Saddam Husayn is the source of all power in Iraq: the legislative, executive, and judicial. No power in Iraq can implement a law, make a decision, or pass a ruling without Saddam's approval. The law of force prevails in Iraq, and Saddam is its source. If Saddam enjoys absolute power to do whatever he wants--or, indeed, if he is the sole source of power--then why did he want to take the premiership for himself? Is it because Saddam Husayn has a brain capable of saving the Iraqis from the plights and tragedies that he himself created? We believe that there are many reasons behind Saddam's decision to take the prime ministry for himself. These reasons, we believe, have nothing to do with the failure of this or that ministerial group to address the economic situation. These reasons include the following: 1. The lack of confidence between Saddam Husayn and his closest allies in the government. 2. The desire not to allow any government or party official to remain in a post through which he may [words indistinct]. In this context, we can mention Sa'dun Hammadi, Muhammad Hamzah al-Zubaydi, and Ahmad Husayn. They all served as prime ministers but were sacked by Saddam Husayn within less than four years. 3. An attempt to delude the Iraqi people into thinking that Saddam Husayn is not the sole reason behind the deterioration of the economic and social conditions in Iraq. 4. The blunder and [word indistinct] in the top ranks of authority and the need to remove from power the regime officials who are not from the ruling family. This is probably the strongest of all the reasons. Here, we must recall the accusations leveled by 'Udayy Saddam Husayn against the regime's ministers, ambassadors, and diplomats in one of his articles in BABIL in March. The article was full of criticism injected with threats against the ministers. 'Udayy accused the ministers and the diplomats of negligence and incompetence. He branded the ambassadors as brokers and traders in carpets and female journalists. He underestimated the standing of people in most of the regime's ministries. That (?article) was the first step in removing many regime figures whom Saddam did not like to see in power. At that time, we explained 'Udayy's threats as the first step in a plan to remove many officials from sensitive posts in the regime's institutions to allow the ruling family to interfere in the most minute details in the life of the Iraqi citizen. Surely, if things continue like this, the regime's Council of Ministers, the Revolution Command Council, and all important posts will be distributed among Saddam Husayn's relatives and henchmen. At any rate, we think that this move is too late. Saddam's attempts to save the dictatorial regime from collapse are doomed. They will not negate the fact that the regime has been turned into a defective body moaning under the yoke of its deep wounds and drawing its last breath.
