Early in February 1934 during the anti-Japanese armed struggle, President Kim Il-song went to then Mipo-Myon, Onsong County, North Hamgyong Province, and called and guided the conference of party and revolutionary organisations in the homeland. Yi Kun-mo, chief secretary of the North Hamgyong provincial committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the North Hamgyong provincial people's committee, made a report. The reporter said: At the conference, the great leader set forth the task to forcefully conduct the work of building party organisations in close combination with the armed struggle and the mass struggle. He also put forward the task to set up regional guidance organs such as district party committees in the regions where many basic party organisations had been formed and skillfully apply in party leadership principles and methods of underground work suited to the conditions of secret activities. The great leader expounded the questions of thoroughly applying the principle of democratic centralism in party leadership, ensuring the purity of the party ranks and their unity in ideology and purpose, extensively forming anti-Japanese mass underground organisations and fully ensuring their guidance by party organisations, enhancing the militant function and role of party organisations at all levels and giving effective assistance to the anti-Japanese guerrillas and guerrilla-held zones. Indeed, the conference was a historic one which marked a new milestone in lifting the work of chuche-type revolutionary party building to a new higher stage and a significant one which gave a strong impetus to the development of the revolutionary movement as a whole.
