Dzhabrailov: "Monopolism: Barriers in the Way to the Market. Problems and Solutions"] [Text] Historically it so happens that on its way to the market the economy of Azerbaijan has to destroy a supermonopolized structure and provide conditions for the formation of a competitive environment. It is impossible to create a market economy in the absence of demonopolization, just as it is impossible to create competition without privatizing state property. This problem is frequently brought up in the mass media, which consider naive and primitive patterns for fighting monopolism. Scenarios are proposed which frequently identify monopolism with monopolies, and the latter--with the dominant position of companies in the market. Various forms of monopolism are frequently mixed up, while techniques for fighting them are borrowed either from the "workaday" world or from college textbooks on economic theories. The urgency of developing the effective means for combating monopolism can hardly be overestimated, because this is now problem No. 1. It is virtually impossible to embark on privatization, solve any structural problems, or fight inflation to counter a slump in production unless we are able to develop an economic strategy that could successfully counter monopolism and destroy the economic basis for its recurrence. Not a single state of the world has been able to avoid a fall in the living standard of the people, a slump in production, inflation, unemployment, and so on in the process of making a transition to the market. The difference is that some states effect demonopolization in the economy by resolute methods within one year (for example, the Czech Republic) or stop hyperinflation within two or three months (Greece, Austria, Yugoslavia), whereas others unsuccessfully try to solve these problems over decades (most Latin American countries). This is why the issue should not be just how to develop the concept of an antimonopoly policy and a program for demonopolizing the economy (on paper) but also how to take the greatest possible advantage of opportunities to implement them. It may be conjectured that it is virtually impossible to perform financial stabilization and implement anti-inflationary, fiscal, and foreign economic policy without restricting [as published] the interconnection with the antimonopoly policy. In anticipation of objections from my unseen opponents, I would like to refer to the experience of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For example, Ye. Gaydar's program of financial stabilization failed solely because they tried to solve this serious problem exclusively by monetary methods. It is impossible to solve this problem through the sphere of distribution, without serious changes in the economic structure, in the environment in which objective conditions exist in the economy for the expanded reproduction of inflationary phenomena. This elementary truth appears to have been forgotten by us. Moreover, we can be accused of Marxism and antireformism. However, we would like to remind propagandists and agitators of various hues who have a notion of economic theory at the "street" level that the Marxist theory of money, capital, added value, profit, reproduction, and crises has not yet been refuted by anyone. The wish is to solve all problems in a hurry without destroying the economic mode that has been created over decades. This thought was borne out yet again by a sharp deterioration of the economic situation in Russia at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, following the monetarist experiment of the Russia's Choice type. Results The crisis in the economy is growing. There are no rays of stabilization in the economy. The following data for the first quarter of 1994 compared to the corresponding period of 1993 testify to this: --output of the net material product fell by 25.5 percent; --the defaulted debt of enterprises increased by a factor of 13; --gross capital investment was off by 41 percent; --housing construction diminished by 55 percent; --retail sales fell by 46 percent; --the index of prices and rates for goods and services went up by a factor of 11.3; --the monetary income of the population increased by a factor of 4.5. The coefficient of the lead of the growth of prices compared to the growth of monetary income came to 2.5. The purchasing power of the population diminished by the same amount. We should add to this the monthly level of inflation--30 percent, and an abrupt reduction in employment. According to our data, unemployment in the republic now comes to about 0.9 million. This amounts to 35 percent of the economically active population. No wonder that under the circumstances, the 1994 state budget was drafted with a deficit of 47 billion manats. Therefore, budgetary expenditures exceed revenues by 30 percent. Macroeconomic Problems: Reality and Projections A reduction in the monetary income of the population in real terms has brought about a contraction of effective demand. The capacity of the market for consumer goods fell by a factor of 2.5 to three. Delays in the payment of wages, retirement benefits, and allowances by two to three months should have apparently stabilized the growth of prices and the level of inflation. In reality everything is the other way around: the rate of inflation and prices increase month after month. A fall in investment by a factor of more than two and a 13-fold increase in defaulted debt have brought many enterprises to the brink of bankruptcy; consequently, the recession in production has deepened and employment declined. In reality, the slump in production does not come to 25-26 percent, as reported by official statistics, but is considerably greater. The government and the National Bank are trying to prevent reductions in output by higher state expenditures and credit outlays. However, these measures are not successful because they depreciate the manat and distort monetary circulation still more. The slump in production will deepen unless extraordinary measures are taken promptly. This poses the danger of an economic cataclysm. It seems that the government has opted for an erroneous tactic. Two versions of a solution are possible in this instance. The first is to restore centralized management of the economy. The second is to develop a program for priority measures for carrying out market reform with an active system for social protection of the population. In this case, programs for the demonopolization of the economy should become a priority. Types of Monopolism in the Economy There are differences between monopoly practices, a monopoly, and the dominant economic agent. If we recognize as dominant the position of an economic agent (joint-stock company, limited liability company, and so on) which is based on the superiority of its economic potential and which makes it possible for the agent to decisively influence the competition and thus hamper access to the market to other participants in the market, an economic agent whose market share exceeds 35 percent is considered dominant. Correspondingly, there may not be more than two to three dominant economic agents in the market. An economic agent which absolutely dominates the market is recognized to be a monopoly. As a rule, its share exceeds 51 percent. There may be one monopoly in the market. However, there may be several monopolists in the market for homogeneous goods. This is a so-called "collective monopoly" whereby several economic agents are bound by an agreement among themselves. Monopolism, or monopoly practices (activities, behavior), should be distinguished from a monopoly and a dominant economic agent. Both monopoly and nonmonopoly economic agents, state central and regional organs of power, or departmental organs of government whose actions are aimed at preventing, restricting, or eliminating competition to the detriment of consumer interests may engage in monopoly practices. Therefore, the following types of monopolism shall be distinguished: --state monopolism (that of the organs of power); --departmental monopolism (that of the organs of government); --regional monopolism (that of the organs of local power); --monopolism of economic agents. The following are derivative from the above four types of monopolism: --financial and credit monopolism; --natural monopolism; --patent and license monopolism; --monopolism arising out of horizontal and vertical agreements between players in the market. Therefore, monopolism is associated with activities aimed at restricting or eliminating competition and harm the interests of consumers. In Azerbaijan state and departmental monopolism, the monopolism of economic agents, as well as natural and financial-credit monopolism shine through most vividly. Abuses by Market Agents as a Form of Manifestation of Monopolism It is necessary to note that there are monopolists and monopolists. Theoretically, two kinds of monopolists may exist. Some can ensure their dominant position through a difficult but honest competitive struggle. As a rule, they engage in fair competition without restricting it and without harming the interests of consumers in any way. Other monopolists take advantage of their dominant position in the market to raise market prices, with the quality of the product deteriorating, and use illegal means for counteracting competition. Abuses in the market may be manifested in the following forms: --market share manipulation, raises or, on the contrary, reductions in it with a view to causing a shortage; --price manipulation, with the price being raised or reduced with a view to increasing consumer demand and taking advantage of it for one's own interest; --product quality manipulation, which pursues the objective of reducing the cost of production; --the use of methods of a noneconomic nature with a view to erecting barriers in the market and suppressing existing or potential competitors. Virtually all forms of the manifestation of monopolism are registered in the economy of Azerbaijan. The growth of prices following their liberalization was largely "due" not only to inflation but also monopolism in the economy. The situation is exacerbated by the absence of a competitive environment in markets for particular products, as well as the absence of all effective methods of antimonopoly regulation, and an economic mechanism for counteracting the abuses of monopolies and dominant market agents. It has now been more than one year since the parliament passed the Law "On Antimonopoly Activities," but it is still inoperative because of the lack of a mechanism for its implementation. Meanwhile, the situation in the market has been deteriorating continuously. The gap between the growth of prices and the monetary income of the population has been growing. Customer demand has been restricted to the necessities, goods with a low elasticity of demand, and the physical subsistence minimum. Who is responsible for this? Six out of 17 ministries of the republic and five state committees out of 22 are economic ministries and state committees. However, this is of no use. A state program for transition to a market economy has not been approved to this day; implementation arrangements for most of the laws adopted by the parliament in 1992-1993 are absent. Banking and tax legislation is imperfect.... Data from the bulletin of the State Committee for Statistics of Azerbaijan for the first quarter of 1994 and data from the CIS Statistical Committee have been used in this item.
