The second battalion from the Ciscarpathian Military District is rushing to reinforce UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, more precisely, in the hottest spot there -- the Muslim enclave of Gorazhde. Our young compatriots, who have given their consent to don "blue helmets," have already begun to count the "bucks" they will be paid for each day of service. Some of them will get $600 per month, while others will be paid $900. For this money, not even an unemployed American black man would agree to stick his neck out and risk being shot. The current misery and willingness to honestly, though with a great deal of risk, improve their family's financial situation without resorting to criminal activities, have forced the boys and men of Galicia to go to the Balkans. Watching the picturesque beaches of Balaton Lake roll past as they ride in the railroad cars, they do not yet suspect that UN technical services have already taken care of their front service and possible dark days await them. According to Zagreb radio, additional zinc coffins have recently been stockpiled in military warehouses. It is no secret that the subsequent truce may prove unstable. Even though the Serbs have been forced to agree on a cease-fire and their cannons have been temporarily silenced, they have frequently violated previous agreements and shown an arrogant attitude toward peacekeepers. It was enough for Moscow to beckon Belgrade with its finger and the Serbian separatists recaptured the cannons seized by the Russian "blue" troopers on a previous day. In the vicinity of Gorazhde, Russian soldiers have also ended up among the UN hostages. What can be said about the exceptionally obedient Ukrainian soldiers? By the way, they will be exposed to great military pressures in Bosnia. On the one hand, they will have to bend to the Kiev leadership, which continues to tailgate its "elder brother" in formulating foreign policy, while on the other hand, the Serbs are angry at Ukraine because it does not exhibit an openly pro-Russian attitude and has certain relations with Croatia. In addition, the Croatian Ruthenians and Ukrainians, as well as official Zagreb, have not abandoned their intentions to recapture Vukovar and other territories occupied by the Serbs. Thus, the Ukrainian peacekeepers will not have to only carry out the instructions of the UN secretary general, but also permanently watch the behavior of their "elder brothers" -- the Russians and the Serbs. Otherwise, the Serbian cutthroats will not pay attention to the fact that our boys are wearing "blue helmets." Speaking in a generally calm manner during a meeting marking the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk nervously reacted to a banner carried by Ukrainian "Greenpeace" activists -- who demanded that all the lethal Chernobyl reactors be closed down -- explaining that there are no ways to raise money for energy resources, without which Ukraine will choke. This is an open lie however, and so are the statements that there is no money for essential medicines, raw materials, and spare parts for industrial enterprises, which have already put workers and engineers into despair and made them ready to take any steps. The high leadership, however, has managed to shake out huge amounts of hard currency from the state coffers to finance the UN peacekeeping battalions in former Yugoslavia. Of course, nobody is against additional ways of earning money, even if they are dangerous, but, I repeat, they must be decent. Why, however, should this generate further impoverishment among a huge part of society? It is understandable that officials in the capital on the Dnepr are trying to look honorable before the world, especially the United Nations, and in this way pay for the debts of the Ukrainian SSR to this international organization. Ukraine has already lost its stake in the foreign property of the former USSR to Russia. Since Yeltsin's Russia has pronounced itself the inheritor to the Bolshevik empire, why would official Kiev not ask Moscow to pay the United Nations for the bills of KGB agents who were exclusively performing assignments for the Kremlin, hiding behind the USSR banner? Yet another question arises: Did anybody consult leaders of the oblasts comprising the Ciscarpathian Military District, when the issue of the second peacekeeping battalion first arose? Were the deaths of our sons and daughters in Afghanistan and Chernobyl not enough? Do we have to send them to the Balkan slaughterhouse as well? One can only hope that in the new parliament there will be deputies who will address this issue directly to Ukraine's highest authorities.
