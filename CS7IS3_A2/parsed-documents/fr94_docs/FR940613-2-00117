ACTION: Notice of funding availability. SUMMARY: This NOFA announces the availability of funding for activities under the Vacancy Reduction Program.

Assessment teams have conducted on-site assessments of the vacancy situation at known eligible PHAs, and when notified will conduct an assessment at any PHA that meets the eligibility requirements but has not been assessed. In addition, when requested, HUD will provide assistance to any eligible PHA in developing its vacancy reduction plan. Although funds available under this NOFA will be used to implement the plans, these funds are intended to supplement other initiatives of the PHA that will reduce the rate of vacancies in a PHA's inventory. The NOFA contains information on the following: (a) The purpose of the NOFA, available amounts, and eligibility; and (b) Application processing, including how to apply, the required content of the application, and how selections will be made.

Any PHA that considers itself eligible for funding under this NOFA, but that has not yet been scheduled for an assessment under 24 CFR 968.410, must request an assessment before June 28, 1994. The above-stated deadlines are firm as to date and hour. Applications may be hand-delivered or mailed, but applications sent by facsimile will not be accepted.
