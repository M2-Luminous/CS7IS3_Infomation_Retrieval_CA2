France decided to evacuate its citizens from the country, which was united only four years ago and whose rival leaders from the old North and South Yemen have been in dispute since last August. A southern air raid on Sanaa airport lit the fuse, prompting President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner, to order a 30-day state of emergency to counter "separatist" forces based in the southern port city of Aden. The airport was closed to civilian airliners, while a northern raid on Aden airport also forced its closure. A northern military spokesman later said all-out fighting erupted between rival troops in the seven main provinces, all on or near the border which used to divide the country at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Five southern warplanes were shot down, he said, quoted by the official news agency Saba'. Southern troops had suffered heavy losses in the clashes at Lahij, Abyan, Ta'izz, al-Bayda', Dhamar, Aden and Ibb. There was no immediate casualty toll. Tanks and troops patrolled the streets of the capital, as panic- buyers swamped the shops and many families packed up and headed for the countryside in trucks loaded with mattresses and boxes. Later as night fell, more anti-aircraft fire was heard over Sanaa. The streets were totally deserted of civilians and the city was hit by an electricity black-out. Salih and his vice president, 'Ali Salim al-Bid have been in dispute for eight months on the running of the country created when former North Yemen and the poorer, Marxist south unified on May 22, 1990. A reconciliation accord they signed in Amman on February 20 failed to ease the tension, with al-Bid calling for decentralization and series of military, political and economic reforms. A diplomat, contacted by telephone from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), said there had also been heavy gunfire around Salih's palace. Southern planes bombed the government headquarters and a radio and television centre in a dawn raid, witnesses said. Anti-aircraft guns shot down one of the planes, which crashed in southern Sanaa in a black cloud of smoke. Witnesses said northern forces were quick to take their revenge, destroying the Sanaa headquarters of al-Bid's Yemen Socalist Party, and tanks had been positioned on the rubble. The Italian embassy next door was also damaged. US special envoy Robert Pelletreau met Salih to express his country's support for the "unity and democracy" in Yemen, Saba' said. The US state department on Wednesday proposed a plan for the warring factions to separate their forces, agree to halt redeployments, establish better communications and reestablish dialogue. In Paris, the foreign ministry said France was evacuating all its nationals from Aden because of the fighting and would help any other foreigners from European Union countries. About 60 French nationals live in Aden, the foreign ministry said, but it could not specify how many other Europeans were there or in Yemen overall. The French government earlier ordered its forces at its major base in nearby Djibouti to prepare for the possible mass evacuation of foreigners. In London, the Foreign Office called for the rival Yemeni chiefs to "reengage urgently a dialogue." Britain has not ordered its people out of Yemen but said they could take advantage of the French evacuation if they wanted. The 800 Britons, most of whom work in the oil industry, should "keep their heads down." Britain was the colonial power in Aden until quitting in 1967 after much bloodshed. Airports in the towns of Ta'izz in the south and al-Hudaydah in the west also came under attack Thursday from southern planes but were not hit, the defence ministry said. Clashes have also been going on since Wednesday between northern and southern units in Dhamar, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of Sanaa, in Aden and in Redfan in the north. A southern unit was reportedly wiped out by northern troops in fighting overnight in Dhamar. Tension was also running high in Abyan, to the east of Aden and in Shabwah where the majority of the country's vital oilfields are based. Last week, fighting broke out in the town of 'Imran, north of Sanaa, killing 79 people, according to official northern figures. Other reports spoke of more than 200 dead. Yemen's giant northern neighbour Saudi Arabia appealed Thursday for its leaders to "put the national interest" above all others and halt the escalating fighting, as Egypt joined in calls for an end to the bloodshed. A plane carrying Arab League mediators was unable to land because of the bombing of the capital's airport, league secretary general 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid said in Cairo. The rival army forces in Yemen, which each have about 30,000 troops, have never been merged and the country has been plagued by tribal and political feuds. Each side is supported by rival tribes, which are well-equipped and can together raise forces of about 100,000.
