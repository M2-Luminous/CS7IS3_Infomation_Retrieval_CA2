How about the possibility of Japan altering its foreign policy following the end of the cold war? [Saito] Japan should continue to seek the axis of coordinates [zahyojiku] of its foreign policy in relations with the United States. The United States is among the nations that share Japan's values and systems, and it has the most powerful influence among them. Japan has relied on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty for its security. Now that the relatively simple structure of the East-West confrontation has changed and a new complicated structure has emerged in the world, elements that Japan must take into account are growing in number. The role to be played by Japan in resolving global problems such as overpopulation and the environment is increasing, and Japan will have to make more contributions to maintaining world peace. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] As for Japan's international contributions, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], has put forward a plan to turn Japan into a "normal nation" that can make even military contributions. [Saito] It is clear that there are constitutional constraints on what Japan can do. Bureaucrats should not debate amending the Constitution. Nonetheless, there still are things that Japan can do within the framework of the current Constitution. The International Peace Cooperation Law has just been enacted, and it is necessary to proceed cautiously in interpreting the law. It cannot be said that Japan has made contributions to the international community to the very limits of its constitutional constraints. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The February Japan-U.S. summit talks broke off. Would you comment on these? [Saito] I think that this was very regrettable. It was a matter of course for Japan to reject the U.S. demand to set numerical targets as long as the United States stuck to this demand. If the Japanese Government committed itself to trade matters that are beyond its authority, this would force Japanese enterprises to engage in managed trade. Managed trade runs counter to what the Hosokawa cabinet intends to do. If Japan went along with the United States on the demand to set numerical targets, it would have only deferred the solution of trade issues between the two countries. Although Japanese-U.S. relations would have improved temporarily, it is clear that Japan one or two years later would have been unable to meet the numerical targets. If the United States were to criticize Japan one or two years later for failing to live up to its promises, Japanese-U.S. relations would be worse than they are now. Japan cannot do such an irresponsible thing. The breaking off of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks dealt a blow to Japanese-U.S. relations, and Japan has to make efforts to patch up relations with the United States. Trade issues between Japan and the United States stem from Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States. The United States has contended that it can no longer tolerate the trade imbalance, and we are well aware of the U.S. position. Japan should understand the U.S. position on the trade imbalance and should make its utmost efforts to correct the trade imbalance. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What should Japan itself be thinking about? [Saito] If there is anything that Japan must reflect upon, it is Japan's failure to get its message across to the United States that Japan seriously intends to spur its economy and that it is resolved to cut taxes deeply to that end. Japan should have articulated its plans to the United States. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The Foreign Ministry is losing its influence at home. What do you think about this? [Saito] You are right. It would be good if it had more influence at home, but.... [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Have Japanese-U.S. relations matured into an "adult relationship"? [Saito] I think that Japanese-U.S. relations have already matured into an adult relationship. Japan has said no to the United Sates. Japan has asserted what it has had to do and it has conceded what it has had to concede. I do not think that the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks began a completely new age in postwar Japanese-U.S. relations. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is there not a fear that the Japanese have become more or less nationalistic? [Saito] I have not received such an impression. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The United States has been criticizing Japan's bureaucrats. Would you comment on this? [Saito] I believe that this criticism is based on a misunderstanding. In some ways, Japanese bureaucrats must review their practices; Japanese bureaucrats have stuck to their past practices. In the eyes of Americans, Japanese bureaucrats are conservatives. Americans appear to have the impression that "Japanese bureaucrats are bad guys who cause politicians to drag their feet," but most of their impression is based on a misunderstanding. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Who is deciding Japan's foreign policy? Politicians or bureaucrats? [Saito] What the bureaucrats must do is plan and draft Japan's foreign policy, and then the politicians must make a final decision on Japan's foreign policy. The role of bureaucrats is to use their experiences to compile their recommendations in an objective way and to present these to the politicians. Depending on the circumstances, bureaucrats should make recommendations and submit these to the politicians. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the consistency of Japan's foreign policy should be maintained despite a change of government? [Saito] As far as the present coalition government is concerned, it announced shortly after it came to power that it will continue Japan's established foreign and security policies. My opinion is that, if a political party with completely different foreign and security policies comes to power, the Foreign Ministry has the responsibility to present vigorously its recommendations to the ruling party to keep Japan's foreign policy as consistent as possible. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Mr. Ozawa has proposed introducing a "senior vice minister system" [fukudaijinsei] with the aim of reflecting politicians' ideas in policies. What do you think of this? [Saito] Introducing the senior vice minister system is a great idea. If senior vice ministers assume the responsibility of answering questions in the Diet, this would leave ministers free to visit other nations and meet with key foreign officials. Foreign policy should be planned and drafted calmly and objectively on the basis of experiences without any specific position being taken into account. There is no way but for bureaucrats to do that work. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development program is heightening tensions. [Saito] If the United Nations adopts a resolution on the matter, it is a matter of course that Japan will take full measures to implement the resolution, within the framework of the Constitution. Japan's role in implementing the resolution will be great. The nations that will face a threat from North Korea are Japan and South Korea. If Japan deals with the resolution indifferently or reluctantly, it will lose the trust of the international community and greatly harm Japanese-U.S. relations.
