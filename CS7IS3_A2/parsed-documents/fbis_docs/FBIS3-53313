A government official, however, reported only one death and eight injuries in clashes that took place late Tuesday afternoon between police and an infuriated crowd protesting alleged police brutality in the Damak district, 298 kilometres (186 miles) southeast of here. A senior official of the home ministry said that a mob of over 5,000 local residents attacked the Damak police station, throwing stones and smashing windows. They also smashed the windshields of two police vehicles. At least 30 police officers were injured in the melee, the official said. But a Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) source told AFP that three civilians had died and 32 were injured. Police fired tear-gas shells, blank rounds and finally a few live rounds to disperse the crowd, a senior government official said. "Eight people received bullet injuries while others were injured in a police batton charge," the official said. "The political situation at Damak is now quiet and normalcy has returned after a meeting of political party workers and local administration authorities," the official added. The incident was sparked after police allegedly mistreated an elderly woman whom they had asked to clear the street.
