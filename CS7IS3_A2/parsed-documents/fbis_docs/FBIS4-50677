She made these remarks while calling on visiting Surinamese President Ronald R. Venetiaan at the state guesthouse here this afternoon. Suriname lies on the north coast of South America, and Chen noted that China and Suriname are far apart geographically and differ in national conditions, but they are both developing countries, facing common tasks of developing their economies and raising their people's living standards. The two countries have shared identical or similar views on many international issues, she added. During the meeting Chen reviewed with pleasure her trip to Suriname last July, saying that she was deeply impressed by the visit. Venetiaan said his visit was short, but he had witnessed a prosperous and stable China. He said he very much admired the rapid development of China's economy under the condition of a stable society, due to the Chinese leaders' correct strategic ideology. Earlier, when interviewed by Chinese journalists, Venetiaan described his China visit as "very important for Suriname". He said that during the visit he has been discussing with Chinese leaders the situation of the two countries. His visit to China has enabled the friendship between the two countries to "become effective", he said. On the future of bilateral ties, Venetiaan said that the prospects for the relations between the two countries, economic cooperation and trade in particular, "are very good". He noted that Suriname is a country with a small population. But, he added, it has a reasonable amount of natural resources. Suriname has possibilities for development, he said, adding, it is possible for the two countries to discuss how to use Suriname's high proportion of forest coverage. "I think there is possibility for the two countries to cooperate" in this regard, he said. On the question of Suriname's joining the Caribbean Community, Venetiaan said political and economic integration in the Caribbean region would benefit every country of this region. Suriname is looking forward to joining the Caribbean Community in July this year, he said. It is now an observer of the organization.
