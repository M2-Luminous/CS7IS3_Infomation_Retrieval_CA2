The alleged criminal is the brother of Jorge Eduardo "Tato" Avendano, a lieutenant of late Pablo Escobar, who after escaping with the "capo" and eight other collaborators in July 1992 from Envigado Prison surrendered to justice two months later. According to Fernando Mancilla, Antioquia Department regional prosecutor, "Loco" Avendano's surrender "was carried out normally," and after giving his first deposition to authorities, he was confined to the prison of the neighboring locality of Itagui, where there are other Escobar henchmen. The judicial official has refrained from commenting on whether this surrender means the resumption of cartel members surrendering to justice to take advantage of the legislation contemplating reduced jail sentences and other benefits for drug traffickers who turn themselves in and confess at least one of their offenses.
