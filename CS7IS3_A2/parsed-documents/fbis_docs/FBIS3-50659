The 120,000 residents of Tuxtla Gutierrez, located 680 km southeast of Mexico City, are nervous about the presence of the EZLN and they fear being involved in combat between the rebels and the Army. At the military airport of Tuxtla Gutierrez, which is near the civilian airport, there have been approximately 20 helicopters since the conflict first began last Saturday. The helicopters are moving troops to the area of conflict. The atmosphere on the city streets is tense and most of the residents prefer staying at home. The highways to San Cristobal de las Casas, one of the main centers of the conflict -- which is about 50 km from here -- are nearly deserted for fear of the firefights and the Army has set up checkpoints. Rumors are circulating to the effect the soldiers and rebels are fighting just 10 km from Tuxtla Gutierrez. Other rumors say rebels have been seen near Chapa de Corzo, 15 km from Tuxtla Gutierrez, and that the guerrillas reportedly plan to storm the jail at Cerro Hueco, on the outskirts of Tuxtla Gutierrez. Residents from Tuxtla Gutierrez told EFE that the majority of the people in this city reject the rebel actions, although there might be some support in the mountain area where the majority of the people are Indians. The people say there is little information on the clashes, radio communications are bad, and the situation is difficult in the rural areas where there are Indian chiefs. A civilian source pointed out that in Las Margaritas, the Indian chiefs do not allow the Indians who work on farms to wear clothing similar to military uniforms as they fear being attacked. The source told EFE that the people in this area are extremely neglected and abandoned as the Indian chiefs are akin to feudal lords who manage the lives of the Indians and practically keep them as slaves. It is believed that there are areas in Chiapas where one Indian dies every day as a result of the violence generated by the Indian chiefs and the police forces, the source added. In his New Year's message to the people of Chiapas, acting Governor Elmar Setzer said that "it is regrettable that the subversive groups have generated such actions of violence and vandalism that have broken the juridical order and disrupted the social peace and public harmony to which we are accustomed in Chiapas." He added that "these actions have been rejected by all sectors of the population, and various groups have called for a dialogue and a peaceful solution to the situation created by the armed aggressor group." Setzer asked the people to be prudent and not be overcome by panic and rumors, and facilitate the work of the Army that seeks to reinforce protection and security in the affected areas.
