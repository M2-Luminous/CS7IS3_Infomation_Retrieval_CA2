Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-DPRK-IAEA Pyongyang Seeks to Explain Differences With IAEA SUMMARY Clearly alarmed by the swiftness with which the IAEA is calling a Board of Governors meeting, Pyongyang has made a public effort to explain its differences with the IAEA on resolution of the nuclear inspection issue, an effort apparently motivated by concern over the need to salvage high-level talks with Washington and head off possible UN sanctions. END SUMMARY Pyongyang's latest authoritative pronouncement on the nuclear inspection issue, which came in an 18 March Atomic Energy General Department(SEE NOTE) spokesman's press statement, seemed to carefully avoid foreclosing the possibility of a negotiated settlement (Pyongyang radio, 18 March). Although the statement carried the standard warning against applying pressure on Pyongyang and charges of Western plans to "crush" the DPRK, its major complaint seemed to be that the IAEA is convening a Board of Governors meeting--reportedly for 21 March (Yonhap, 17 March)- -"even before" analyzing the results of the just concluded inspections, having "hastily" reached the "unjust" conclusion that "it cannot guarantee" non-diversion of nuclear materials. (NOTE: The department was previously known as the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry. Pyongyang media have not been observed to report on the apparent reorganization.) The statement, which made it clear that Pyongyang had allowed the IAEA inspection this time solely to facilitate DPRK-U.S. high- level talks,(SEE NOTE) noted areas of basic disagreement with the IAEA. This disagreement is due, the statement claimed, to the inspection team's attempts to go beyond the contents of a 15 March bilateral agreement reached in Vienna with the IAEA. According to Pyongyang: + The IAEA inspection team unfairly maintained that the inspections were being conducted under Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) safeguards. The North Korean statement claimed that Pyongyang had agreed only to allow inspections "purely" to ensure continuity of the safeguards, reiterating Pyongyang's contention that its "special status" of having only "temporarily suspended" withdrawal from the NPT exempts it from normal safeguards obligations. + The IAEA's insistence on 1) extracting samples in sealed-off areas where the seals remained intact; 2) gamma radiation mapping at all points, instead of selected points; and 3) examining "the cooling system," went beyond what is needed to merely ensure continuity of the safeguards. Such inspections, the statement maintained, would have made the inspections "equivalent" to routine and ad hoc inspections required under the safeguards. (NOTE: Underscoring Pyongyang's eagerness to resume high-level bilateral talks with Washington, North Korean Ambassador to Moscow Son Song-pil has reiterated Pyongyang's contention that the DPRK-U.S. talks, once held, will serve as "an important occasion" to solve the nuclear issue and will also lead to "easy resolution" of pending inter-Korean issues (Pyongyang radio, 18 March).) Charges of "Pressure" Tactics The statement complained that the IAEA had sent three messages to Pyongyang during the inspection, "threatening" to "report to the Board of Governors that the agency is not in a position to verify non-diversion of nuclear materials" unless its demands were met. However, in warning against such "pressure" tactics, the North Korean statement said that any attempts at pressuring the DPRK "would lead to a situation in which we would have no choice but to take a decisive measure to counter them." The statement went on to pledge that Pyongyang will watch to see if the IAEA "intends to resolve our nuclear issue fairly or attempts to use it for political aims"--a relatively circumspect formulation that would appear to allow Pyongyang a certain range of latitude in judging IAEA action on the inspection issue. Implications Although the statement seemed to leave little room for compromise, it did stop short of an ultimatum, adopting instead a wait-and-see attitude toward future IAEA action. These caveats suggests that Pyongyang is trying to protect the possibility of engaging in bilateral talks with Washington by somehow preventing referral of the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council.
