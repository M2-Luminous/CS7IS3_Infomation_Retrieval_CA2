Spare parts for Russian MiG fighters were involved. The security authorities have not ruled out that the shipment was intended for the war zone in Bosnia. Twelve crates were delivered by truck to Hoersching on Tuesday [7 June] and stored intermediately at the customs office there. The goods arrived from a CIS state. Security authorities have so far not revealed which one. The truck entered the country at some border crossing. The freight documents were issued in cyrillic letters. They were not translated by the customs officers. Thus, no one knew that the consignment contained spare parts for MiG fighters. The documents themselves were fine. When the goods were stored at Hoersching airport, attentive customers had the documents translated. Then the suspicion arose that war materiel might be involved the import and transit of which is not permitted. The freight was to be transported to Amsterdam from Hoersching. Officially, the spare parts were to be forwarded by air freight from there to India. However, the security authorities do not rule out that the MiG spare parts were really destined for the war zone in Bosnia. The 12 crates were confiscated, and legal proceedings--against unnamed individuals--have been initiated given the violation of the war materiel law has been initiated. It has to be clarified whether the truck drivers knew what the sealed crates contained.
