FBIS4-34726 "drlat121_n_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-121 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Chile State Possession of Easter Island Reaffirmed State Possession of Easter Island Reaffirmed PY2306015194 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2141 GMT 21 Jun 94 PY2306015194 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Santiago, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The Chilean Government reaffirmed today that the territories of Easter Island, a Chilean possession of 160 square km located 3,600 km west of the continent, whose inhabitants have been on indefinite strike since 20 June, belong to the state. The islanders, who make up a population of 2,800 people, sued the Chilean Government for the return of their land, which was declared state property in 1933. They also want the electoral law reformed to give them a deputy and a senator to represent them in Congress. The National Resources Ministry said today that "according to our legislation, and this has been recognized, the State of Chile owns the territories that make up Easter Island." Interior Minister German Correa said in Santiago that not everyone in that community was on strike. He announced that an official of the Regional Development Undersecretariat will travel to the island in the next few days to examine the on-site situation and report to officials. About 18 months ago a group of islanders took over the airfield at Mataveri Airport for several days, demanding more flights of Lan-Chile, which is the only airline that flies to the island, and protesting an airfare hike. This situation was resolved with the mediation of Interior Ministry Under Secretary Belisario Velasco. Easter Island, which lives from tourism thanks to the 867 "moais" or giant statues spread over its territory, became famous last year during the filming of the picture "Rapa Nui" by U.S. actor Kevin Costner, who came to the island to direct the film, in which 300 islanders worked as extras.
