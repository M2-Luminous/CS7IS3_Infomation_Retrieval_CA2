"President Kim Il-song said that North Korea (DPRK) would freeze its nuclear program, but with assurance that a third round of talks would take place and that North Korea could replace the present nuclear reactor system," Carter said at a press conference. "But he did not agree to permanent freezing of the nuclear exercises, nuclear activities in North Korea," Carter said, adding that Kim Il-song made it clear that this is possible "only if there is assurance of light water reactor technology being available to North Korea." Carter returned here Saturday [18 June] morning via the truce village of Panmunjom following his four-day private visit to the DPRK. He passed through Panmunjom Wednesday on his way to Pyongyang after meeting with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu during his three-day visit to Seoul. The former U.S. President, who met with President Kim Il-song twice during his stay in Pyongyang, said that the DPRK leader has made two specific requests. One is that the U.S. would support the DPRK's desire to replace graphite moderated reactor with light water reactor and the other is that the DPRK be assured officially it will not be subject to nuclear attack from the U.S. or other outside forces, Carter said. He noted that President Kim Il-song would like that to be done within the context of the joint declaration of the DPRK and South Korea concerning denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Washington, Carter said, is willing to reassure the DPRK against nuclear attack and to support inter-Korean agreement on denuclearization. "I was authorized to say that in the context of the North-South Korean declaration on denuclearization, that the U.S. will be willing to join in on such assurance," he said. Carter quoted Kim Il-song as saying that the DPRK never has planned to "develop nuclear weapons." He clarified what appeared to be the major discrepancy between him and U.S. President Bill Clinton after reports on Friday evening that Carter informed Kim Il-song that the U.S. stopped discussing sanctions at the United Nations and agreed to hold the next round of high-level talks with Pyongyang. "I informed President Kim that in my opinion, if (North Korean) commitments were carried out, the need or effort of sanctions would be put in abeyance and that the third round of talks would be rescheduled soon to resolve all the issues related to the nuclear issue," Carter said. Referring to the effect of sanctions against the DPRK, Carter said, "I don't think that threat of sanctions has any effect at all as far as damage to its economy, society is concerned." While briefing South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on his Pyongyang visit this morning, Carter also conveyed President Kim Il-song's proposal for an inter-Korean summit. Kim Yong-sam accepted the proposal forthwith. Carter, who was visiting the Korean peninsula in a private capacity, is expected to brief the Clinton administration as soon as he returns to the U.S. on Saturday evening.
