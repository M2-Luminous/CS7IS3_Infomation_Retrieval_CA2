Besides the question of the financing and income of political parties and the possible suspension of their activities, exclusive membership is likely the most controversial issue linked to the bill on people's associating in political parties and movements, which is to be debated in the parliamentary session which begins today, the daily states. Coalition deputies insist that exclusive membership be included in the bill, while the opposition opposes the idea, arguing that the principle would violate the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, TELEGRAF reports. The new bill is likely to eliminate the possibility of collective membership of political parties, which enabled political entities to circumvent electoral law, especially regarding the minimum percentage of votes required for an election coalition to be represented in parliament, the daily explains. It gives an example of the Liberal Social Union (LSU), which acquired parliamentary seats in the last elections though it associated four political entities and its share of the vote only slightly surpassed 5 percent. In the last elections, held in June 1992, 5 percent of votes were required by law for a party to be represented in parliament, while a coalition had to receive 7 percent of the vote and more, according to the number of entities associated. Government coalition deputies are afraid that if the new law on political parties does not embed exclusive membership, electoral law might be circumvented again. "Members of political parties wanting to create a latent election coalition, will become parallel members of a sort of an umbrella party to compose a joint list of candidates," the paper writes. Moreover, the advocates of exclusive membership argue that it would be "absurd" if one could be simultaneously a member of such different parties, as the (extreme-right opposition) republicans, the communists and the (government coalition) Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), TELEGRAF notes. However, the Constitution clearly states that people can freely associate in any groups, the number of which is unlimited, the paper writes. It is not necessary to re-interpret the Constitution and push for exclusive membership, as time will solve the question. "Now most citizens are already reasonable and would not strive for membership of two parties. In future, voters will prefer a party with a clear structure which could embed exclusive membership in its own statutes, to a party trying to gain parliament seats at any cost, through various latent coalitions," the paper concludes.
