The budget deficit will be 4.1 percent this year, according to the CPB [Central Planning Bureau]. The collective tax burden (taxation and social premiums) will remain at 54.3 percent. This forecast was given by CPB director G. Zalm this morning at the presentation of the Central Economic Plan. In order to keep the budget deficit within the limits, "use was often made of coverage which was not included in the planning a year ago," Zalm said. "They have wandered a fair way off the original targets," Zalm said this morning. The Planning Bureau director pointed out that "all in all, there were many mitigating circumstances for why the targets have not been reached." But Zalm said this did not prevent the fact that the present governmental team "has not made it easier for the next cabinet." In comparison with other countries, the Netherlands has not done badly, according to the CPB. The budget deficit dropped between 1990 and 1994. The deficit still dropped when the increasing one-off coverage criticized by the CPB is taken into account. The situation has also improved if the European definition of the budget deficit (the so-called current account deficit) is used. In the 12 European Union countries, the total government current account deficit increased from an average of 4 to 6 percent between 1990 and 1994, the CPB said, but in the Netherlands it dropped from 4.6 to 4.0 percent. In the 24 rich Western industrial countries which are OECD members, the current account deficit increased from 2.1 to 4.0 percent in the same period. The Central Economic Plan contained another positive point for government finances. Total collective expenditure would drop by nearly 3 percent in 1994 and 1995, according to the CPB forecast. The CPB said this was not connected to volume growth, which would continue to increase slightly, but to striking developments in price levels. The price levels in collective expenditure will increase slower than gross national product in 1994. That was due to the "moderate wage developments, particularly by the collective sector, and above all the reduction in social security payments," according to the CPB. The CPB was less positive about unemployment. The unemployed working population would increase by 80,000 this year and by 10,000 more in 1995. Without the recent reduction in employers' contributions (2 billion guilders), 5,000-10,000 more persons unemployed.
