Addressing PMA [Pakistan Military Academy] long course passing-out parade in Kakul today, the president said we strongly believe in the principle of peaceful coexistence and noninterference in the affairs of others. He said we have no aggressive designs against anyone and wish to live in peace and harmony with all, especially our neighbors. The president said, however, we have to maintain high level of preparedness to thwart any evil designs that imperil or jeopardize Pakistan's integrity. The parade was held in open in spite of continuing rain. [passage omitted] Addressing the parade, the president lauded the professional capabilities of Pakistan armed forces. [Begin Leghari recording] Let me assure you that the Government of Pakistan is fully conscious of our security needs and is doing its best to keep the armed forces of the country fully prepared to effectively defend the motherland and thwart any foreign aggression. Despite the many constraints, particularly economic, we shall equip our armed forces with the latest technologically advanced weapon systems and knowledge of related fields to qualitatively improve their condition so that the adverse effect of numerical inferiority can be offset. I am confident that our forces will be in a position to face the consequences of fast-changing geopolitical and geostrategic situation that Pakistan finds itself in. In fact our armed forces have already proved their effectiveness, both inside as well as outside the country, as part of different UN missions. We rightly feel proud of them.
