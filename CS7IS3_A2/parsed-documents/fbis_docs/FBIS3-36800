The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper carries an interview with the Russian president's assistant Viktor Ilyushin who notes: "There is a segment of people who regard themselves democrats and are in a state of constant struggle. "When Ryzhkov was cabinet head, they fought Ryzhkov. When Gorbachev became president, they fought Gorbachev. They are now fighting Yeltsin. I'm not sure that if another political leader comes into office in the future, they will stop fighting him. Although it is hard for us to live through all this, but this is a disease of our teenage years, I mean teenage years of democracy." The same newspaper comments on a visit by Azeri President Geydar Aliyev to Turkey, noting: "The policy pursued by Geydar Aliyev completely convinced Ankara of the need for close cooperation with the new Azeri authorities. "Besides, a concept put forth by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on ensuring Moscow's strategic interests in the Commonwealth of Independent States, which provides for conducting peace-keeping operations in 'flash points' by Russian troops, is evidently not to the liking of Turkey having its own interests in Azerbaijan." NEZAVISIMAYA reports in another article that 1,181 emergencies were registered in the Russian Federation in 1993, with the number of casualties reaching 10,133. Out of the total, 1,224 people died. The newspaper claims that "the year 1994 will witness a possible increase in the number of breakdowns and disasters on all types of transport, in the extracting and processing industries, expecially at mines, oil, gas and chemical enterprises, which will be caused by deteriorating repair work, delayed replacement of outdated mechanisms, unstable management of production, low technological and labour discipline and lower responsibility for labour safety." The TRUD newspaper features an interview with former First Vice- Premier Yegor Gaydar who holds that "an amnesty is inopportune now". Explaining his viewpoint, he notes that "crime is rampant in the country. "Moreover, the work on the previous amnesty has just been completed. The new amnesty has been poorly prepared organisationally. The declaration of an amnesty decree creates an illusion of impunity for a number of crimes listed in the decree." The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper runs an article by prominent economist Yevgeniy Yasin, director of the expert institute of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who says: "The process of forming a market economy is progressing, irrespective of likes or dislikes of the government, the academy of sciences or anybody else. "It is connected with the setting of new relative prices and new price proportions. They are being formed, despite interferences caused by the structure of our economy. "An analysis we carried out last autumn shows that prices approach world ones where they are not regulated. This is a positive process on the whole. Regrettably, it has negative aspects, since enterprises feel that while in the past they had comfortable life and correleration of prices, production costs, technologies, etc. were balanced, they are upset now. "However, if there were no disbalances, there would be no impetus for restructuring." The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper runs an interview with Gennadiy Voronin, deputy chairman of the Russian State Committee on Munitions Industries, who states that the Russian Navy is now living through "a stage of delapidation. "Time is needed for what we should do to overcome this stage in compliance with the new military doctrine: to do with small numbers but high quality. Regrettably, the Navy lacks this quality to acquire new properties that is it has no new high precision weapons, advanced ships, control systems, etc. "To tell the truth, we do not have now a programme for combat materiel we earlier had for 10 or 15 years ahead. We have been waiting for it for 18 months. It has been compiled and initialled. "However, it is not yet an official document which could be sent to our factories. I believe that it will be approved in the first quarter of this year." The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper carries an interview with Pyotr Romanov, member of the Federation Council (upper chamber of the Russian parliament), in whose opinion "it is a crime to say, as some politicians do, that we shall live better this year. "They had no right to extrapolate on our country some or other programme drafted or tested somewhere in the West. Russia is neither Germany, nor Poland, nor America, nor still Israel. Our Russian people handle a situation and appraise it in their own way." The same newspaper runs an interview with defence lawyers of former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, saying that "if the court does not give a political appraisal to this case (eds: events of September-October 1993 in Moscow), this will be totally wrong". The PRAVDA newspaper reports that Russian Procurator-General Aleksandr Kazannik visited Ruslan Khasbulatov at the Lefortovo prison in Moscow at the latter's request. The newspaper claims that "according to leaked information, the exchange of opinions between the two former associates in the democratic camp (eds: Khasbulatov was elected parliament speaker with solid support from Yeltsin) resembled a dialogue between the deaf and the blind".
