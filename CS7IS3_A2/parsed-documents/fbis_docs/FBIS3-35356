He noted that trade has increased by 30 percent. Silva went on to mention the negotiations between Israel and the European Union. He advocated an identical accord to that in force with the European Free Trade Association countries. Prime Minister Rabin said he did not believe that the Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho would take place in the next two weeks as it had been reported. Rabin is optimistic but said the next three months was a more reasonable period for a final accord.
