China's reintegration into GATT was one of the items on the agenda. Mrs. Scrivener recalled that the European Union (EU) has always supported this request. "It falls within the scope of a deeper integration of China into world trade," she added. It logically follows the objectives that were defined in Marrakesh during the formal conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Mrs. Scrivener added that China was expected to clearly commit itself to meet specific conditions, to adopt a pragmatic approach, and to implement provisional stages. The European commissioner stressed "it is necesssary that trading partners like China and the European Union clearly show their determination to guarantee fair trade, an essential condition to give each country a chance to ensure its economic development." Mrs. Scrivener welcomed the initial results of the technical assistance developed with China in customs matters, and she proposed that a joint activity program be set up in customs and taxation matters. "Working together to fight evils like counterfeiting and fraud will make the economic agents more confident." The Chinese deputy minister has agreed in principle to this approach. Mrs. Scrivener, who is satisfied with the economic reforms initiated by China on the path to a market economy and with the reforms carried out in taxation matters (a tax on corporate profits as well as a VAT [value-added tax] system have been introduced), welcomed the Chinese authorities' commitment to deal with European companies on an equal basis, as confirmed by Gu Yongjiang. "Customs cooperation between the European Union and China must be enhanced," Mrs. Scrivener said. "This will help guarantee more competitive trade relations between China and the European Union." At the end of the talks, Mrs. Scrivener accepted the invitation extended by Deputy Minister Gu to visit China in the coming months.
