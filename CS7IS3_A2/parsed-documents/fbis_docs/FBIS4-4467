This is understandable because corruption, manipulation, illegal fees, abuse of office or whatever you call it, always ends up the same way: the loss of money that the state uses to fund development. Ironically, corrupt people are usually educated, have social status and plenty of power. Given all these advantages, they can try to protect themselves or at least make their modus operandi more sophisticated. Attorney General Singgih, SH [Master of Laws], in a paper presented by Amran Hamid, SH, a member of his staff, at an international seminar entitled Urban Crime Trends in Criminal Policy held some time ago in Yogyakarta, revealed that according to figures from the Attorney General's office the quantity of corruption in departments or in nondepartmental government institutions has actually been declining from year to year. However, the quality of the corruption has been increasing. From the 1988-1989 fiscal year to the 1992-1993 fiscal year the state lost 1,346 trillion rupiahs as a result of various cases of corruption in Indonesia. In an average year, Operation Justice was able to recover less than 10 percent of the money corrupted away from the state. In fact, only 1.28 percent of the 138.2 billion rupiahs that the state lost in corruption in the 1992-1993 fiscal year could be rescued (National News, 3 February 1993). From these figures we can get an idea of how much money the state is losing to corruption. It is no exaggeration to say that corruption is a vicious cancer which has spread throughout the entire body and has nibbled away at almost every level of social life from the lowest bureaucrat to the highest. In this brief analysis, we will try to look at the dominant factors in corruption and at alternative solutions which might reduce the amount of future corruption without belittling the significance of efforts which the government has made up to this point. Government Efforts To overcome the increasing loss of state funds through corruption, the government has really tried in a number of ways to "reduce" the amount. This includes Presidential Directive Number 52 of 1970 concerning the Obligation of State Employees to List their Assets, opening P.O. Box 5000, creating oversight institutions, such as the BPK [Financial Control Board], the BPKP [Development and Financial Oversight Board] and the Attorney General's office, but the reality is that previous efforts have still not been very effective in cutting down on the amount of corruption. The same is true of the Criminal Corruption Act (UUTPK), Law Number 3 of 1971, which relates to activities categorized as TPK [Criminal Corruption]; this can be seen in Article 1 paragraphs 1, b, c of the General Provisions. Just to remind the reader it would be good for us to look at those provisions. According to Article 1 of the UUTPK, the following are to be sentenced for Criminal Corruption: a. whoever violates the law by taking any action to enrich himself, another person or group, which directly or indirectly damages the finances and/or economy of the state, or if the action either unbeknownst [as published] to him or which he should think will damage the finances or the economy of the state. b. whoever, with the intention of benefitting himself or a group, misuses the authority, opportunities or means which he has by virtue of his office or position and which can directly or indirectly damage the finances or economy of the state. In addition to enacting strict legal regulations, the Minister of State for the Reform of the State Apparatus, at that time Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, also tried to use built-in controls (WASKAT). But this effort also proved insufficient if we look at the figures for the loss of government funds again. It is the practice of collusion or conspiracy between "the top and the bottom," and also possibly between government officials and the private sector, which has caused a sharp increase in losses to the development budget. The pressures of need, the closeness of relationships, the pleasure taken in short cuts and in creating mutually beneficial relationships are indicators of a spurt in corruption. This is in line with the statement made by the economic observer Kwik Kian Gie at a one-day session on Increasing the Role of BEPEKA [Financial Examination Board] in the Era of the Second PJPT [Long-Term Planning] in Jakarta on 25 January 1994. He said that if all of the BPK's findings were openly reported to the DPR [Parliament], as is required by the 1945 Constitution, it is possible that too many respected and highly placed bureaucrats would be caught and that bureaucratic stability would be shaken (National News 26 January 1994). There are many obstacles in the way of authorities trying to prove collusion between "the high and the low". Efforts to salvage state losses have often run up against problems of finding out the facts. When certain figures suspected of corrupting away billions are checked, they no longer have the wealth. It turns out that they have transferred their wealth several times over so that it is no longer officially in their possession. Confiscate It It is really not too hard to find out if someone is being corrupt if we really want to. All you have to do is look at the person's monthly salary. For example, if a person makes three million rupiahs per month, 1.5 million will be used for food, family needs and other necessities. If the remaining 1.5 million rupiahs is saved, the savings will amount to 30 million rupiahs in two years. If he wants to have a fairly good car, he will have to save for two years. But in fact and people can see this he has three or four luxury cars. This doesn't even count other assets such as a house, land, bank deposits, etc. As was touched on above, in many cases as soon as a corrupt person suspects that his corruption is about to be discovered, he tries to transfer his wealth as quickly as possible. In fact, it is even possible that he will manage by one means or another to transfer wealth which has already been confiscated to a third party. Moreover, if they have not been arrested yet, it is possible that they will try to move their wealth abroad because the corrupt know that Article 35 paragraphs 1 and 2 of Law Number 3 of 1971 can be used as an effective weapon in the fight for keeping the wealth they have gotten from corruption. According to Article 35 paragraph (1) of Law Number 3 of 1971, "Goods not owned by the person sentenced cannot be seized if the rights of a third party who has good intentions will be violated". According to paragraph (2), "If goods to be seized by a court order also include goods owned by a third party who has good intentions, within three months of the judgment he can submit a letter to the court objecting to the seizure of his goods. The prosecutor will be asked for an explanation but the explanation of the interested party must also be heard." Nevertheless, because corrupt people always have so many tricks, the best option for rescuing state funds is to confiscate them so as to prevent a transfer to a third party. At the very least, this option should be chosen as soon as there are indications that someone is being corrupt. The Role of Religious Figures Given the difficulties of overcoming corruption, it would be interesting to think about the opinion expressed by Sayed Hussein Alatas in 1986. Alatas said that the role of holy and charismatic religious figures has been the most important single factor in taming corruption throughout Asian history, as long as no other antidote was available. The government must try to spread the influence of these religious figures through education and through other institutions. They must broadcast information about their opposition to corruption and this must be developed within their traditional cultures. Efforts of this type should be considered a force which supplements other ways of fighting against corruption and it must be made clear that the goal is to achieve a just and unbiased society. The facts show that such holy and charismatic figures can speak directly to the masses using words which are easy to understand because these words are much more effective than a dry philosophical speech about justice. To conclude this short essay, why don't we try apply the alternatives described above since the corrupt ignore the regulations. At the very least, it could reduce the financial loss to the state due to corruption.
