FR940124-2-00048 FR940124-2-00040 10. In addition to mortality risks, Security Life will assume an expense risk under the Contracts. This risk arises because the administrative charges under outstanding Contracts, which cannot be raised, may be insufficient to cover actual administrative expenses. 11. As compensation for assuming these mortality and expense risks, Security Life proposes to assess against the Account a daily charge at an annual aggregate rate of 1.55%. Approximately 1.20% of this annual charge is allocated to the mortality risks that Security Life will assume, and 0.35% is allocated to the expense risks that Security Life will assume. Of the 1.20% charge allocated to the mortality risk, 0.90% is for the cost of the basic death benefit and the other mortality risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts, and 0.30% is for the cost of the enhanced death benefit. Security Life will assess the charge for mortality and expense risks during the accumulation period and annuity period, except that Security Life will not assess the 0.30% charge for the enhanced death benefit during the annuity period. Security Life guarantees that it will not raise the charge for the duration of the Contracts. 12. If the administrative charges and the mortality and expense risk charge are insufficient to cover the expenses and costs assumed, the loss will be borne by Security Life. Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to Security Life. Security Life represents that it likely will earn a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. To the extent that the surrender charge is insufficient to cover the actual costs of distribution, the expenses will be paid from Security Life's general account assets, which will include profit, if any, derived from the mortality and expenses risk charge. 13. Applicants request that the order also permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of any other separate account established by Security Life in the future to support deferred variable annuity contracts, which contracts are offered on a basis that is similar in all material respects to the basis on which the Contracts are offered. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act granting exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Applicants submit that their request for an order that applies to the Account and to future separate accounts issuing contracts that are substantially similar to the Contracts is appropriate in the public interest. Such an order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for Security Life to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing its administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. The delay and expense involved in having to repeatedly seek exemptive relief would impair Security Life's ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Applicants further submit that the requested relief is consistent with the purposes of the Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If Security Life were required to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this Application, investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby. Thus, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed by section 26(a)(1) of the Act and are held under an agreement that provides that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants' proposed mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense. 3. Applicants have concluded that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% (which includes the basic mortality risk charge of 0.90% and the expense risk charge of 0.35%), or 1.55% (which includes the foregoing charge of 1.25% and the enhanced mortality risk charge of 0.30%), is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts and reasonable in amount as determined by industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that these determinations are based on their analysis of publicly available information about similar industry practices, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels and benefits provided, the existence of expense charge guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. Security Life undertakes to maintain at its home office, and make available to the Commission or its staff upon request, a memorandum setting forth in detail the methodology used in making the foregoing determinations.
