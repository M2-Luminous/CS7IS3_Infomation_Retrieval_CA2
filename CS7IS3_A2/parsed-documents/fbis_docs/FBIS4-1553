State Councillor and State Council Secretary General Luo Gan attended and spoke at the meeting. Criminal activities such as theft and sabotage of railway, oilfield, power, and communications equipment and facilities have become rampant in recent years. Incomplete statistics for 1993 compiled by the Departments of Railways, Power, Posts and Telecommunications, and Petroleum show that the number of cases involving theft and sabotage of railway, power, communications, and petroleum equipment totalled over 19,600; that over 3.67 million meters of electric wire, cable, power transmission line, telecommunications line, electric pump cable, and power-driven cable were stolen; and that over 36,000 pieces of materials from power transmission towers, as well as 830,000 meters of oil pump levers, were stolen, resulting in a direct economic loss of 319 million yuan. These criminal acts have seriously disrupted the social order, have affected the state's economic construction and national defense building, and have resulted in a great loss in state property and people's lives. Participants in the meeting called on local public security organs to increase the work of investigating and cracking such cases, to carry out indepth investigation and study to determine major regions where crackdowns are to be carried out, and to strive to crack a number of major cases with great impact on society in a short time. They also called on public security organs to enhance coordination with courts and procuratorates; to resolutely implement the policy of swiftly and severely cracking down on criminal activities according to law; and to mete out severe punishments to thieves, to those who receive and sell stolen goods, and to key members of theft rings who create major losses to industrial and agricultural production as well as to national defense building. Participants in the meeting also stressed that those who steal and sabotage military communications equipment, railway and power facilities, and other important production equipment should never be let off lightly in view of the serious consequences of their acts and of the great impact they have on society. The phenomenon of imposing a fine instead of meting out a prison term should be resolutely rectified, and the practice of giving verbal admonishment instead of inflicting penalties should be strictly forbidden. Luo Gan spoke at the meeting. He said railways, oil, power, and communications are the state's basic industries, occupying a decisive position in national economic construction. A high degree of importance should be attached to the development of, and security guarantees should be provided to, these industries since they have a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood as well as on the overall situation of reform and opening up. He called on relevant departments to make close coordination, to cooperate with each other, and to make the utmost efforts to achieve success in the struggle against the theft of state property. Departments and units also attending today's joint teleconference included the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Power Industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Internal Trade, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the China National Petroleum Corporation.
