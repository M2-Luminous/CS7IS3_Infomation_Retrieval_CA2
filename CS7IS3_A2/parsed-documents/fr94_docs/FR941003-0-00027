FR941003-0-00027 FR941003-0-00006 Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this action will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The time period addressed by this regulation is consistent with the time period when most traffic using the Black Rock Canal is already controlled by the operation of the Black Rock Locks and when there is little or no significant vessel traffic on the waterway. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this action under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.5 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination Statement has been prepared and placed in the docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
