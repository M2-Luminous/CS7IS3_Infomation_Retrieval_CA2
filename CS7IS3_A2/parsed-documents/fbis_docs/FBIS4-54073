FBIS4-54073 "dreas101_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 North Korea TV Reports Letter to IAEA Director TV Reports Letter to IAEA Director SK2505125094 Pyongyang Korean Central Television Network in Korean 1129 GMT 25 May 94 SK2505125094 Pyongyang Korean Central Television Network Korean BFN [Text] Pak Yong-nam, director of the Atomic Energy General Department of the DPRK, has sent a letter to Hans Blix, general director of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], in connection with the fact that a case involving the concealment of plutonium had taken place in Japan. The letter says: On 4 May, the director of the U.S. Nuclear Control Institute, in a letter to the U.S. Secretary of State, pointed out that 70 kg of plutonium, a massive amount, had been concealed in the Tokai Nuclear Fuel Plant, Ibaragi Prefecture, Japan. He also directed serious attention to this. The letter points out as follows: International opinion expresses the concern that, given the fact that numerous nuclear facilities have been operated in Japan for tens of years, a more massive amount of plutonium may have been concealed in Japan and used in producing nuclear weapons. Voices are growing every day that demand an urgent and clear explanation of the truth of this incident. The agency invented a nuclear suspicion with regard to our fledgling [chongsohan] peaceful nuclear activities and thereby created complexity, while failing to call into question the fact that 70 kg of plutonium, a massive amount, had not been reported but concealed for five years at a plant in Japan, where it is said an IAEA inspection team stays permanently and conducts inspections, and Japan's dangerous nuclear activities. The international community expresses deep concern over the obvious double-standard policy. The letter goes on to say that this case cannot be overlooked today when Japan's nuclear armament which has reached the danger line in actuality poses a threat to peace and security in Asia and, in particular, on the Korean peninsula. The letter also stressed that it is necessary for the secretariat of the agency to accept the voices of the international community as a matter of course; raise the case involving the concealment of plutonium in Japan for discussion at an extraordinary meeting of the agency's board of governors without delay; probe the truth behind it; take a measure for a more overall and thoroughgoing special inspection of all the nuclear facilities in Japan; and promptly take other practical measures to resolve the suspicion and worry of the international community.
