The meeting was attended by GCC delegations and senior officials. At the beginning of the meeting, the Saudi minister welcomed the participants and expressed his sincere wishes that their visit would boost U.S.-GCC economic dialogue. He expressed appreciation for the U.S. people and government for their support during the Gulf crisis and stressed that "our joint effort to support international legitimacy" had led to the liberation of Kuwait. He confirmed the GCC desire to enhance economic cooperation with the United States to coincide with excellent political and strategic relations between the two sides. He expressed satisfaction with the development of trade between the U.S. and the GCC and pointed out that today's meeting would help expand and diversify trade exchange. "I would like to cease [as received] this opportunity to congratulate the U.S. Government on successfully concluding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and I would also like to express our complete satisfaction with the outcome of the Uruguay round of international trade negotiations," al-Sulayyim said adding that these two accomplishments were two steps on the right path towards a more liberated world trade order. He said GCC states firmly believe in the freedom of trade and keenly follow up the growth of world trade and are seriously considering joining the GATT agreement. He said the Kingdom has officially applied for GATT membership and expressed hope that the U.S. would support this request. He also pointed out that Bahrain has recently joined the GATT. He also confirmed the keenness of GCC states on the protection of copy rights and the facilitation of resolving trade disputes. He pointed in this connection to the decision by the recent GCC summit to set up a commercial arbitration center and a previous summit's decision to approve the patent system and set up an office for the protection of copy rights. Dr. al-Sulayyim expressed hope that these measures would encourage and protect direct U.S. investments in GCC states and said he was looking forward to negotiations on a legal formula for an agreement on the protection and encouragement of exchanged investments in the United States and GCC countries. Turning to the field of energy, he said it was an important sector of GCC-U.S. cooperation and stressed that their bilateral dialogue had led to exchanging information and evaluating this important sector. He said the GCC, as a main source of producing hydrocarbon energy, and the United States, main consumer, have a joint interest in establishing healthy and stable energy markets. He said their joint efforts in this field would give a positive signal to the energy industry to encourage investments and meet future international demand. However, he expressed GCC [word indistinct] about growing trends in consumer countries to place more hurdles in the face of energy trade with the excuse of protecting the environment. He said GCC states agree with this noble goal but do not believe that prejudice against oil for the sake of other more polluting energy sources is required or justified. "That is why we look forward to the understanding and empathy of our friends in the United States for this legitimate concern," he said. Brown addressed the meeting confirming that GCC states and the U.S. have joint economic interests. He said GCC states look forward to new industries and the U.S. looks forward to new markets. He added that GCC states aim to attract international investments to realize security and the U.S. aims to reach security by increasing investments outside its borders. He stressed that their joint efforts could lead to an unusually successful economic cooperation. He expressed confidence that current meetings and talks between the U.S. and the GCC would increase their chances to found more liberated markets and closer cooperation. He underlined the importance of U.S. efforts to reach an international agreement on the GATT and confirmed that the Clinton administration aims to realize a more open and active international economy and pointed to current negotiation between the U.S. and Japan to reach a trade balance between them. He added that the United States has realized that its national security is linked to its economic security and that is why it has expanded its international relations. He said the return of peace to the Middle East stimulates hope to provide more freedom to devote resources to more economic development. He also confirmed that economic development can bolster the stability of peace.
