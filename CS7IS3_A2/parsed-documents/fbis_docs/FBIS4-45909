During this period, China has built a very efficient nuclear safety supervision and administration system. An international regulatory review mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], a working visit to China recently, concluded that China's nuclear safety supervision and administration system conforms to the standards of usual international practice. Huang Qitao, director general of the National Nuclear Safety Administration [NNSA], which is an independent government department with jurisdiction over nuclear safety supervision and administration, said in an interview with this reporter: The fact that China -- young is terms of nuclear energy development -- is able to attain the level it has achieved today in nuclear safety supervision and administration can be attributed to its active participation in international cooperation. He stressed: China is positive, open-minded, and unreserved when it comes to promoting international cooperation and exchanges in nuclear safety. NNSA has signed agreements on cooperation in nuclear safety with the United States, France, Italy, Spain, Pakistan, Germany, and Japan. It has also maintained regular contacts and conducted exchanges with a number of countries with which no such agreement has been signed. China will also sign agreements on cooperation in nuclear safety with a number of other countries. Huang Qitao said: In regard to nuclear safety supervision and administration, China has received generous support from the United Nations Development Program [UNDP], IAEA, EC, and other international organizations. They have provided China with technical training, information, computer software, and other data relevant to the safe operations of nuclear plants. He said China has also taken an active part in international cooperation in nuclear safety under the auspices of the IAEA, including the entire processing of drafting of the "International Convention on Nuclear Safety" under IAEA sponsorship. China will fulfill all the obligations provided in the convention when it is signed. Huang Qitao said: China has gained a great deal of valuable experience from its active and frequent participation in international cooperation and exchanges. It has also made its experience available to other countries without any reservations. For this reason, all participants are beneficiaries of international cooperation in nuclear safety. He noted that China will step up its efforts in international cooperation on nuclear safety and take an active part, as ever before, in international cooperation sponsored by the IAEA. Annick Carnino, head of the international regulatory review mission, also noted in an interview with XINHUA while she was in China: The IAEA will strengthen cooperation with China in nuclear safety supervision and administration and provide assistance, to the extent possible, in making preparations for dealing with nuclear emergencies.
