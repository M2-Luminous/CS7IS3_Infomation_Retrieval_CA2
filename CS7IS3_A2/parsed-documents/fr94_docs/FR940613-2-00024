Imports charged to these category limits for the period June 1, 1993 through May 31, 1994 shall be charged against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits established for that period have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set forth in this directive. The limits set forth above are subject to adjustment in the future pursuant to the provisions of the current bilateral agreement between the Governments of the United States and the Czech Republic. In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).
