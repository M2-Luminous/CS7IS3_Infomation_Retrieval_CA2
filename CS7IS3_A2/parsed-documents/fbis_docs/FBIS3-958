They urged the president to lead the country to democracy and said they would be willing to meet with him. "The main responsibility is, in a particular way, on the president of the Republic who is also the commander in chief of the Armed Forces and therefore, can change the situation," they said. Quoting a previous statement, they declared: "As president, he cannot escape his responsibility. He cannot escape the judgement of history." The bishops made their remarks in a pastoral letter, "On the Road to Democracy," which will be read in all churches serving the seven million strong Catholic population on Sunday [20 March]. Seven prelates, including Cardinal Maurice Otunga, presented the letter at the Catholic Secretariat's headquarters in Nairobi. Parts of the document quoted or repeated previous statements by the bishops or Pope John Paul II or bodies such as the Justice and Peace Commission. Taking turns to read the letter, the bishops also criticised opposition parties for internal divisions, struggles for personal power and visible orientation towards tribal membership. All this, they said, was "a source of confusion and disappointment" to the people. The bishops called for the rewriting of the Constitution "to fit our political circumstances." This should be done not by a group of politicians but by an enlarged independent constituent body. "Our constitution was composed when there was a de facto one-party system and was suitable to the situation of that time. "A complete revision has to be entrusted to a large constituent body of experienced competent citizens representing all trends of society and not just to a reduced group of politicians," the bishops said. The Constitution should be endorsed by popular consent. The bishops complained that KANU [Kenya African National Union] ignored other political parties and interpreted not being a member of KANU as being against the government. This could be seen from utterances of senior ministers that only KANU zones would benefit from government development programmes. National resources, they said, were a right and not a gift from KANU. They said that if KANU could not serve all Kenyans equally then it was breaking the contract of service and had no business being in power "because ipso facto it loses the moral right to govern." The bishops reiterated that multipartyism was not synonymous with discord but it did not mean democracy had arrived in Kenya. The letter said the situation in the public universities was chaotic. "No matter how the government would wish the public to forget the university problem, that is just not going to happen. A problem which is postponed is not solved," they said. [passage omitted] Referring to government efforts to convince people that tribal violence was started by the opposition, the letter said Kenyans had come to believe that the authorities passively watched or collaborated in the clashes. They said it was well known who ordered the demolition of Maela camp and Nakuru kiosks and who sent bulldozers to Buru Thessalia holding ground to evict people who had lived there for more than 50 years. "Should we believe the words about national unity pronounced by our president during the celebration of Kenyatta Day or the words inciting to tribal revenge pronounced in Parliament by one of his ministers with total impunity and even support of many KANU members of parliament?" the bishops asked.
