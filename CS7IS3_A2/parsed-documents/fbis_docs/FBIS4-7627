Official sources have so far not said whether this is just an indication of NATO's growing presence within the activity of the UN in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the first step in taking Croatia, through the "Partnership for Peace," into full membership in NATO. Only the growing presence of NATO forces -- provided that elements of the Croat-Muslim agreements are implemented -- could guarantee the re-establishment of the disrupted balance, i.e., introduce a lasting and more stable peace in these parts. The choice of location is no accident. Belgrade headquarters knows that very well, for many examinations for the rank of general in the former Yugoslavia were based exactly on variants of defending the hinterland of Zadar, the valley of the Neretva River, and the Kupres valley from potential landing operations and attacks by NATO forces. Strategic Routes Zadar and its hinterland, Ravni Kotari, is the widest gateway to the Balkans. This is where a more serious marine-airborne assault could take place, one including an army group (about three divisions or 45,000 men) for further penetration toward the Balkan interior (toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia). No other part of the Adriatic coast, from Albania to Slovenia, is so suitable for assaults by major forces, for their consolidation and advance north- east. The potential assault would be made easier as Zemunik [Zadar] Airport is nearby and also as Croatian forces control a good part of the hinterland and the saddle of Mali Alan. A radar installation positioned on that saddle could knock out [Serb-held] Udbina Airport, thus establishing total control -- both on land and in the air -- of forces moving toward the heart of the Balkans, whose keys are held by those who control Kupres and the Kupres gateway, the main operational route for the Balkans -- the Serbs, in the present case. Establishing a bridgehead in Ravni Kotari and total control of the area would open the road to Kupres. Another important Adriatic route toward the gateway to the Balkans is the Neretva valley. In comparison with the Zadar route, it is definitely a less suitable variant for penetrating into the Balkans, but only if the forces controlling the banks of the Neretva are hostile to those penetrating into the territory. That is not the case this time: The banks of the Neretva are controlled by the Croats and the Muslims. Consequently, it would not be very difficult for NATO to send a major fleet along the Neretva River from Ploce all the way to Capljina. The plateau above Slano, in the area of Cepikuce, which was liberated by the Croatian Army in a large-scale operation, is actually a lookout from which eastern Herzegovina is controlled and it is an ideal starting point for all actions toward Trebinje, Bileca and deeper into Bosnia-Herzegovina territory toward the Drina valley. The Mosaic of Outcomes If Vis should become a NATO base, it would keep the role it played in the defense doctrine of former Yugoslavia; it would be an vital logistic base, an unsinkable warehouse of military supplies for land forces. Such an outcome of the crisis in these parts, a replaying of the Yalta agreement moving the border of U.S. interests east of Trieste to the banks of the Bosna River or the Drina, is becoming increasingly certain. It is with this in mind that one must view the pronounced interest of Washington in the Croat-Muslim conciliation and the presence of U.S. soldiers in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] (the Vardar valley is still an extremely important operational route for penetration into the Balkans). The statement of General John Shalikashvili, who said that interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina are important enough to send 25,000 U.S. soldiers, sheds more light on U.S. interests. At any rate, Washington's message is that the Bosnia-Herzegovina fire must be extinguished in order to prevent it from spreading to Albania, Macedonia, and Greece, for, in that variant of the outcome of the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, "some other forces" might come into conflict as well. If we also consider the statement of the UN secretary general, who said that, after Russia and the United States came into the Balkan pot, the international Conference on Former Yugoslavia has become superfluous -- the mosaic of outcomes of the crisis will definitely appear in its more integral version. In any case, the UN has been unable to find a good model for peace in the Balkans. That organization -- in the Yugoslav crisis and in the war there -- has shown too many weaknesses, and if it really intends to be a moving force of the new world order, it must undergo thorough repairs. At any rate, it was announced that the UN would be completely reconstructed by the end of 1995. In these circumstances, a new world order means nothing else than realizing old global deals without (for the time being) large-scale military conflicts. Croatian Gains The potential Croatian gains in the new circumstances -- that is, at a time of a more engaged presence of the United States and Russia in the Balkans and in the negotiations between Zagreb and Sarajevo -- have lately been discussed by general Anton Tus in his interview for VECERNJI LIST. The biggest gain is, of course, Washington's determination, in agreement with Moscow, to extinguish the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and stop the conflict between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Linking the airspace of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is here very important for Croatia. "In military and defense terms, this joint area is extremely important for Croatia. There would be no critical intersecting points and there would be fewer unsafe borders. It would be much better to have a friendly neighbor without having to expect a strategic surprise from the territory. We would also gain with regard to strategic depth of the territory; consequently, Dalmatia and Slavonia would not have to fear a flank attack. Geopolitically and geostrategically speaking, the situation would be much better and balanced." We still do not know the solution to the problem of the trans- continental main road stretching from the port of Ploce to the Neretva valley and the Bosna River, through Vinkovci and Vukovar, the Danube valley toward Budapest, Vienna, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and further west on the Danube-Rhine-Danube canal. It is the shortest traffic route leading from the southern Adriatic to Central Europe and its geopolitical and geostrategic importance surpasses local interests. At present, the main road is cut in several places in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it is therefore important that the two countries, Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina, establish complete control over it. The Legendary 50-50 Washington's fear that the war will spread to Macedonia, Albania, and Greece indicates the extreme importance of the events in Bosnia- Herzegovina for the stability of southeastern Europe. In that context, let us remember a Croatian initiative made at the CSCE, viz. the initiative for disarmament and arms control in countries created on the territory of former Yugoslavia, which was, in the future, to improve the stability of that territory and south-east Europe in general. According to our information, Croatia has already agreed to a quota of 23,000 professional military forces. Judging by the military activities of the Serbs in Bosnia- Herzegovina and Croatia, and by the fresh supply of forces and equipment coming to [Serb-occupied] Croatia from Serbia, Belgrade is still not thinking about peace, security, or cooperation. The Serbian announcement that they would yield to the Muslims 16 percent of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory that they have conquered, and the announced arrival of the Knin team at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb for negotiations are encouraging, though weak signals of changing views (unless it is another case of a verbal trick). By arranging the Croat-Muslim agreement, Washington has done its part of the job, and now it is Moscow's turn to put some pressure on the Serbs. With regard to that, it is encouraging to hear the announcement of closer military cooperation between Russia and NATO. Such cooperation is not possible without solid arguments. NATO could strengthen its arguments by setting up bases in Croatia. Anyhow, the U.S.-Russian deal could ultimately mean the surfacing of the final solution for the crisis in these parts and realizing the legendary 50-50 division and Russian access to a warm sea. Let us hope it will be east of the Drina route, not east of the valley of the Neretva and the Bosna.
