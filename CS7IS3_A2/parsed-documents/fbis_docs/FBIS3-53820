In its editorial Friday, the paper says that this is the first time that a genuine opportunity exists to normalize relations between Syria and Israel and that the ball is now in Israel's court. Israel, it adds, should respond to Syria's clear and forthright willingness to normalize relations with that country under a final peace accord. The paper calls on Israel to declare whether it is prepared for a complete withdrawal from the Golan. In light of this, the paper notes, it can be said that the al- Asad-Clinton summit has been successful and that it will hold the door wide open for positive developments in the negotiations in Washington next week. Accordingly, the paper adds, we can say that 1994 will be a year of peace between Syria and Israel, which deserves to be called the peace of the brave.
