[Ciscar] I am in politics because of a commitment which dates not from now but from when I was 18, at the time of the struggle against the dictatorship. That original commitment, which many of us young people had at that time, led me to political commitment, also to the struggle against inequalities. Later, in 1978, my link with the Socialist Party was established. [Beltran] Are you a Guerraist? A renewalist? With which currents within the party have you identified? [Ciscar] I committed myself from the outset to a blueprint, which is the Socialist blueprint, without further labels. I have always believed that that blueprint must be tackled on the basis of renewal, and I have worked for reflection on ideas and proposals which interest people not to be abandoned. In any event, that attitude is already implicit in my commitment to democracy and as a Socialist. [Beltran] What circumstances made possible your becoming organization secretary? [Ciscar] Election as organization secretary or as the person responsible for any other area of the Federal Executive Committee occurs for two reasons. The first is that the secretary general has decided to have you at his disposal. The second is that the delegates have supported the proposal. It is indisputable that the secretary general takes into account the opinions which emerge in the party. [Beltran] And did not the fact that you belong to a federation -- the Valencian Federation -- which went to the congress united under the flag of integration carry weight? [Ciscar] There is no doubt that the Valencian delegation, led by Joan Lerma, played a constructive role, both in contributing ideas and in securing agreements for setting the congress on the right course. Moreover, the fact that Lerma chaired the congress made it necessary to play that role more diligently. [Beltran] What does integration mean in a party polarized between Guerraists and renewalists? [Ciscar] Felipe Gonzalez stated that the congress must be one of renewal of ideas at the same time as one of integration in order to ensure that the party does not lose its cohesion. Thus there was an extensive renewal in the sphere of ideas, thanks primarily to a fluid debate which made it possible from the precongress stage to accept proposals by a very large majority. As was natural, there were also changes in order to form a team of people who can carry out those ideas. At the same time, it was made very clear that society's concerns and the party's run in the same direction. [Beltran] What is your opinion of the work of Jose Maria Benegas -- your predecessor in the post? [Ciscar] He has worked very hard for several years, and now he has accepted another post within the Executive Committee. [Beltran] And how do you view his performance as organization secretary? [Ciscar] Work in the Federal Executive Committee is teamwork; it must be performed jointly. It is true that each area has some tasks, and also that everybody has his temperament and way of doing things. I believe that the organization secretary must encourage openness, tolerance, and dialogue within the party and at all levels. [Beltran] What is your opinion of the new Executive Committee? [Cscar] It has very considerable support. It is clearly led by Felipe Gonzalez, and it contains a large contingent of people with responsibilities in the government, autonomous community premiers, and federation secretaries general. It is broadly representative. [Beltran] Must the door be opened up to society? [Ciscar] The party must be consistent with the renewal of ideas, and should avoid acting in a dogmatic and secretive way. I will make an effort to ensure that the congress resolutions are implemented, and although I have never before held directly organizational responsibilities, but rather institutional and parliamentary responsibilities, I will work to achieve this hopefully on the basis of transparency, dialogue, and openness. [Beltran] You are taking over the organization at a time of poor election prospects. [Ciscar] Over the past few years Spain has experienced very considerable changes. Democracy has been consolidated, our commitment to Europe has been reaffirmed, and the foundations of the welfare state have been laid. Our aim must be to intensify that work. [Beltran] Corruption and the controversy over the parties' funding have recently marked political life. How will you approach this matter from your new post? [Ciscar] The Socialist Party is the most closely watched of all, and this is natural because it holds the greatest responsibility. It is also the most open, but this is not enough; it should be much more so. Felipe Gonzalez has spoken of promoting the party's clear and transparent functioning, and I have been called upon to work on the basis of that approach.
