FBIS4-59685 "drnes095_j_94032" FBIS-NES-94-095 Daily Report 15 May 1994 ARAB PENINSULA Yemen `Official Source' Reacts to Proposal `Official Source' Reacts to Proposal JN1505054494 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0430 GMT 15 May 94 JN1505054494 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] Commenting on a news agency report on an intiative by the Political Bureau of the Socialist Party to halt the fighting, a responsible official source said this proposal is only one of a host of false statements designed to mislead world public opinion, just as the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] has been doing since the fabrication of the crisis on 19 August 1993. It began the crisis with its dialogue among the government coalition leadership, down to the points declared by the Socialist Party as a condition for the termination of the fabricated crisis. It continued its policy after the issue was referred to the Political Forces Dialogue Committee and after the pledge and accord document was prepared as it tried to foil the efforts put into this document by igniting the military situation in Abyan Governorate on the eve of its signing, 20 February. The latest [as heard] Socialist Party lie was its disavowal of what was stated in the first part of the military section of the pledge and accord document. That exposed disavowal was accompanied by a serious escalation in the military situation and the kindling of war on Wednesday, 4 May. The source said the secessionist gang in the Socialist Party is responsible for starting and continuing the fighting and that the proper way out of the present situation is the Socialist Party's abidance by the following: 1. Acceptance of constitutional legitimacy and its legislative and executive institutions. 2. Prevention of the gang of rebellion and secession in the Socialist Party leadership from issuing orders to the units under its control. 3. Subjection of these units to the constitutional institutions and legitimate leadership elected by them. The source said he hoped that the Socialist Party leaders who were not dragged into the schemes of the gang of rebellion and secession will shoulder their responsibility and deter this gang, which lost its party legitimacy after igniting the military situation and insisting on the continuation of fighting in implementation of its secessionist plan, which seeks to fragment the homeland.
