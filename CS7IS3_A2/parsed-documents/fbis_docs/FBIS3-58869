The topic of discussion was the European Union Treaty. Cavaco Silva called for everyone's commitment to the building of Europe. He also explained the government's strategy for the next few years. Guterres spoke after [the prime minister] to stress that Portugal is not taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the European Community. It was a heated debate in Sao Bento [Parliament seat], Tiago Rebelo reports. [Begin recording] [Rebelo] After praising Parliament's commitment to European matters, Cavaco Silva went on to list the three main strategic objectives for the 90's. [Cavaco] Firstly, the development of our economic and social structures with a view to reaching average European levels by the beginning of next century. Secondly, a greater presence of Portugal in the world through a strengthening of the heritage of our past, namely, the Atlantic ties and the special relation with Portuguese-speaking countries. Thirdly, a guarantee of security and peace within a framework of cooperation, of which NATO is an essential pillar, but which will be increasingly based on an effective European defense and security identity. [Rebelo] Cavaco Silva's address fully supported the European Union, from the Economic and Monetary Union to the question of foreign policy. Antonio Guterres, taking on the role of opposition leader, did not waste any time in accusing the government of lacking a strategy for the defense of Portugal's interests in Europe. The secretary general of the Socialist Party quoted as an example of this, what he considered to be a permissive policy with regard to economic competition with Spain. As for economic policies, Cavaco Silva is a fundamentalist -- Guterres said in order to blame the head of government for the economic crisis. [Guterres] It is necessary to find in Portugal a prime minister, who despite generous EC support, has led this country into recession, unemployment, and high interest rates -- he is here today in this room, it is not necessary to make prophetic assumptions about the future. [Rebelo] The CDS [Social Democratic Center Party] demanded that the government clarify whether we are heading toward European federalism. The prime minister responded by saying that the CDS's worry did not make any sense, because that question did not apply to Europe and it will not do so for many, many years.
