He said this at a news conference after presenting a check for 100,000 ringgit [Malaysian currency] to the nongovernmental organization's council on AIDS at the ministry. The financial assistance is to help Malaysian AIDS Foundation to carry out its activities. Datuk Lee said the special unit, which has replaced the AIDS task force set up earlier, will monitor all AIDS cases and take appropriate steps to control the disease.
