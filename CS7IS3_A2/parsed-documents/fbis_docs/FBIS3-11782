He went to the Haitian parliament on 24 March to dispel any of the deputies' suspicions about the quality of the food products which will be distributed to 50,000 children. The following is a report by Daly Valet. [Begin recording] [Valet] "During this meeting with the deputies, French Charge Philippe Seltz guaranteed that the food products that will be transported by the French ship will meet all humanitarian and sanitary regulations. Seltz said he hopes the ship will be able to unload at the Port-au-Prince wharf because, in his opinion, the French Government wants to help the Haitian people through the crisis they have been experiencing since 30 September 1991." [Seltz] I spoke with the president of the Chamber of Deputies and several parliamentarians. We exchanged general views on questions regarding, among other things, this ship. Obviously, I hope that there will be no problem relating to its arrival. [Unidentified journalist] Nevertheless, the ship will arrive and will also be unloaded? [Seltz] I hope so. [Valet] "Seltz also discussed political issues with the deputies. Concerning the parliamentary plan that was passed by the Chamber of Deputies, the French diplomat did not say whether the French Government supports the plan or not. He just said that the French Government remains committed to the Governors Island agreement. According to him, all points in this agreement must be respected." [Seltz] ...the traditional position of France and the rest of the international community. [Journalist] What is it? What position? [Seltz] The implementation of all points of the Governors Island agreement and the New York pact. [Journalist] You are against this plan? Are you against the plan of the parliamentarians? [Seltz] No, I have not said that at all. I tell you that I favor the implementation [pauses] that France favors the implementation of all the points of the Governors Island agreement just like other countries have always said. [Journalist] How do you interpret the American's position? [Seltz] The same way. [Journalist] And the Americans' position on the parliamentarians' plan? [Seltz] That can be a first step. [Journalist] Toward what? [Seltz] Toward the implementation of the Governors Island agreement. [passage omitted] [Valet] "Seltz visited the Chamber of Deputies diplomatic lounge to explain about the French ship's arrival in Haiti, the ship that is carrying humanitarian aid. Remember that Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde has already come out against the arrival of this ship. According to the deputy, France is a hypocrite, a deceiver.
