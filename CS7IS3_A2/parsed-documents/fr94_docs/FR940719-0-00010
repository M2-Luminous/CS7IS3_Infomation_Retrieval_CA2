FR940719-0-00010 FR940719-0-00002 Paperwork Reduction Act The final amendments do not change paperwork requirements. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any significant economic impact a proposed regulation may have on a substantial number of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in assets). The revised rule is generally less restrictive than the current regulation. Overall, the NCUA Board expects the change to benefit credit unions by permitting them to maintain a larger amount of nonmember accounts before requesting a waiver from the Regional Director. Accordingly, the Board determines and certifies that this final rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions and that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Executive Order 12612 Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The amendment applies to federally-insured state-chartered credit unions that accept public unit and nonmember accounts. The final rule would make it possible for a federally-insured credit union to accept a larger amount of nonmember deposits without requesting an exemption.
