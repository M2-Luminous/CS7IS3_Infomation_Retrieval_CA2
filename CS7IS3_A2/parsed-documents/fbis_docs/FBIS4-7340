FBIS4-7340 "dreas083_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 North Korea South Urged To Repatriate Korean War POW's South Urged To Repatriate Korean War POW's SK2604103594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1009 GMT 26 Apr 94 SK2604103594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA)--The South Korean authorities, ignoring the unanimous demand of people at home and abroad, are persistently refusing to send back to the North Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who spent long years in prison, unconverted, after being taken prisoners during the war. This comes under fire in papers here today. The South Korean Red Cross, in a telephone message to the North side on April 22, categorically refused their repatriation, alleging that they were not prisoners of war, but "offenders who killed innocent people" and they "acquired the nationality of South Korea of their own accord." A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: This is nothing but a far-fetched argument aimed at evading the responsibility for such criminal acts as unjustifiably detaining and persecuting them and keeping them in South Korea. As the South Korean authorities kept them in South Korea, they had no other choice but to "acquire the nationality of South Korea" to eke out existence. If they wanted to remain in South Korea, why did they request the International Committee of the Red Cross to cooperate in their repatriation? Still more preposterous is the allegation of the South Korean Red Cross that they are "offenders who killed innocent people." They were soldiers of the Korean People's Army and patriots who fought against the aggression of outside forces and for the peace and reunification of the country in the Fatherland Liberation War. Thd assertion of the South Korean Red Cross that they do not fall under the category of the POW is a challenge to the international law and humanitarian idea and a sophism unacceptable to anyone. The lonely old valetudinarian men with not many remain years are now maintaining the barest existence with toilsome physical labour. It is an humanitarian issue awaiting urgent solution to send them back to the North where there are their home towns and families and relatives. If the South Korean Red Cross had a shred of national conscience and respected the humanitarian idea, it must send them back to the North at an early date in compliance with the Korean armistice agreement and the international law on pows, instead of obstructing their repatriation by raising unreasonable conditions under the manipulation of the authorities. MINJU CHOSON says if the South Korean rulers persistently evaded their responsibility, they will face a stern judgement by the nation.
