In Kyrgyzstan the meeting with President Askar Akayev was a demonstration of mutual affection. "Boris Nikolayevich regards you with affection, and there is no concealing this," the Russian minister remarked to the Kyrgyz president. "You are a refined, highly intelligent person with firm democratic convictions, and this brings you close to Boris Nikolayevich." Kozyrev had brought to Bishkek a message from Yeltsin, which, we were to understand, gave high marks to the official program for stabilization of the position of the Russian-speaking population overseen by Akayev himself. Russia, in turn, promised "as much economic assistance as possible" to support the enterprises at which this Russian-speaking population is employed. The actual expression of the assistance will be determined at the time of the future visit to Kyrgyzstan of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Meanwhile, the fact that Kozyrev's first trip in the new year began in Bishkek immediately prior to the referendum on confidence in President Akayev could have served as a kind of pointer to how the Russian-speaking population should determine its sympathies at the time of the ballot. Kozyrev declared that Akayev's approach to the problem--"respect for citizens who have to live where they live and work there also--is working for the sovereignty of Kyrgyzstan and its prestige." The minister disapproved, on the contrary, of the position of the former Soviet republics which believe that "they are asserting their sovereignty" (which, according to him, no one disputes) "by pushing out the Russian population. We will not be insensitive to this." The parties signed a consular convention, and Askar Akayev described the relations of the two countries as a "strengthening of the Eurasian connection" and defined their three main sources and ingredients: the strengthening of sovereignty, the preservation of the "spring of Russian culture and language," thanks to which "Kyrgyzstan arose" (he proposed making the Slavonic University, which opened last year, a regional university and retaining Russian as an official language), and, finally, the choice of Russia as principal ally--"Russia has always had interests here, and they should be preserved." "Who said," Kozyrev observed in response, "that we have to choose between East and West? We are in both places, we have no inferiority complex." The president of Kyrgyzstan identified his position on the question of dual citizenship as follows: As a constitutional provision, it would signify the disintegration of a country in which 80 nationalities, including 20 major ethnic groups, live. The matter can be resolved on the basis of a bilateral interstate agreement. Kozyrev confirmed that a treaty basis, which would help determine the balance of rights and obligations in order to avoid a "dual burden," was needed for a solution of this question. No state, he observed, should fear damage to its sovereignty, and citizens on its territory should be subordinate to the laws, although they could have supplementary rights also. Dual-citizenship status could give rise to uncertain cases for Russia also. As far as can be judged, a legislative initiative in the parliament of Kyrgyzstan on the question of citizenship could evoke an ambivalent response. The arrangements with Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, which were arrived at relatively painlessly, are assets for Russia, but it is in these countries that the position of Russian speakers is for various reasons the least acute. In addition, the intentions of the leader of the country could to a certain extent also adjust the position of his closest neighbors--Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan--which occupy a far tougher position on this matter and would hardly receive with enthusiasm a breakthrough on the "Kyrgyz flank." Kozyrev himself, for that matter, is not inclined to consider this position insurmountable. Responding to a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA question as to what principle could be made the basis of dual citizenship for Russian speakers--ethnic or linguistic--he said: "This question is extraordinarily complex, and it should not be oversimplified but decided in each specific case--with regard both to our national legislation and treaties with the corresponding states. In some republics the agreements would have their own specific features, and the approach would not be ethnic, of course, but, if you wish, a `human-rights' approach. It is quite complex to resolve this problem with any republic, but no one is now refusing to discuss the question of citizenship altogether because there could be various versions of a solution. A delegation of Uzbekistan headed by the acting chairman of the Supreme Council has just been in Moscow, and I have had a very detailed telephone conversation with Nazarbayev. In a week I plan to visit Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The main thing is that there be no hysteria over the problem: The task is to prevent passions becoming inflamed. A demonstration of our 'heroism'--we stick to our guns--would give rise only to a reluctance to talk on their part. This stage has been negotiated, we are now at the stage of actual work on what the balance of rights and obligations should be. Insofar as the problem of dual citizenship has, truly, absolutely not been settled." Before the start of his visit to China, the minister of foreign affairs conducted a regional conference with the heads of the border oblasts, at which he promised them that he would open up Russian regions for relations with their neighbors, but "intelligently, not recklessly." He confirmed that the problem of the mass entry and "settlement" of Chinese in Russia had created a tense situation, and for this reason the 1993 agreement had radically reduced the number of persons entitled to non-visa entry. But the minister proposed that border trade, which has helped the population of the Far East resolve to a large extent the problem of what to eat and with what to clothe itself, be switched from the tourist-bag to the interregional and interstate level. The surplus balance in trade with China (Russia's second largest trading partner) has amounted to $2.5 billion and has surpassed in terms of volume the peak of the trade of the whole of the USSR in 1990. True, the Far East authorities are complaining that they are trading mainly with China's northeast provinces, from where goods of inferior quality to those produced in the south are being "palmed off" on them. Nonetheless, as Amur Governor Polevanov declared, "Chinese expansion in the Far East is a reality with which we are forced to reckon." According to him, there is no legislation that determines the legal position of foreigners under the conditions of the "nonforcible settlement" of the region by the Chinese. He supported the idea of the creation of a free trade zone here and gave as an example his neighbors, who have made provision for concessionary taxation for potential investors. The governor proposed that up to 70 percent of customs payments going to the treasury remain in the oblast and also handed over an appeal to President Yeltsin consenting to the construction of a cosmodrome in Svobodnyy, at the former place of deployment of a missile unit. In Beijing Andrey Kozyrev held talks with the Chinese leaders. After a meeting with his colleague, Qian Qichen, he declared that the two countries' relations could be raised to the level of constructive partnership, which signifies, if not allied relations, close interaction, in any event. Agreement was reached on the continuation of top-level contacts--PRC Chairman Jiang Zemin will visit Moscow, and before this, Viktor Chernomyrdin will make a trip to China. The heads of the foreign policy departments also discussed questions of a border settlement. Since the end of the 1950's, Kozyrev observed, negotiations on territorial demarcation were the main irritant in Soviet-Chinese relations. Today an agreement on the eastern sector of the common border, and this is 4,300 km from Maritime Kray to Mongolia, has been concluded between Russia and China and ratified. The parties have agreed to maintain the status quo until the completion of its demarcation. "The demarcation will be undertaken on the basis of the incontestable criteria of international law," the Russian minister said, and although discussion of the problem continues, Russia and China have deemed it possible, with the participation of the border regions, to undertake joint economic activity on the disputed territories. Negotiations on border issues will continue also on the western sector of the border between China and a joint delegation of four states--Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Understanding was reached on an easing of the border-crossing conditions for inhabitants of the border areas, but also on undesirable "side occurrences" being taken under control (according to Jiang Zemin, "when a door is opened, flies also may fly in together with the good people"). At the end of the visit Andrey Kozyrev described the present relations as follows: "We have passed the stage of inheritance of the Soviet Union and, after a long normalization of relations, we have switched to normal cooperation." The specific forms of this cooperation should be determined during the visit to Beijing of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Kozyrev termed his tour of China's provinces, on the other hand, preparation for a favorable climate. In, particularly, Shenzhen, a special economic zone, and in Shenxi, where the lion's share of enterprises built with the participation of the Soviet Union is concentrated and in whose reconstruction, in the minister's opinion, there would be no harm in Russia participating. The minister evaluated the experience of the special economic zone in the south of China as a regional version of China's reforms, "a very specific experiment under very specific conditions," and proposed that there be no illusions as to the possibility of it being copied, even less "idealized and ideologized." The prospects of relations with China afforded the minister a reason, for that matter, to call this country also the "near abroad" inasmuch as, according to him, "there are no first-and second-class foreign countries, and China is our neighbor. I am trying to introduce this concept in its healthy meaning: The near abroad means all our immediate neighbors." Nor, in this connection, did the minister overlook domestic problems: "Talk about Russian neo-imperialism merely diverts attention from the real problems connected with Russia's special role in the CIS. Maintaining stability there is in the interests of the entire Eurasian region. I propose that those in the West who have an interest in this help our efforts. Those, however, who think that they could not reach agreement with me and will find someone else are mistaken. They do not know our internal situation or the composition of the State Duma--I invite them to make themselves acquainted."
