The extremely tentative hints of economic liberalization and the rigidity of the regime in the political arena are not actually enough to justify opening up a dialogue with Europe, or the broadening of economic relations. The substance of the message from the Europeans is that Cuba must do more, at least as far as economic reforms are concerned, if it wants to emerge from its isolation. Nevertheless, in this interview with CORRIERE DELLA SERA, Alarcon does not appear to be dramatizing the situation. [Bonanni] Mr. Chairman, why Europe? [Alarcon] Because after the collapse of the USSR, Europe became even more important for our economic interests. Traditionally, i.e., before the revolution, the United States was virtually our exclusive market. Afterwards, our partners were the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries. Now, with the disappearance of the USSR, there is no doubt that our interest is centered on Europe and Latin America. [Bonanni] Does that mean that, notwithstanding any informal contacts, you are not expecting the United States to lift its embargo in the short term? [Alarcon] I would like to point out that we do not have secret contacts with Washington. Moreover, I do not believe that the situation can be unblocked quickly: at least within Clinton's term. Logically speaking, now that the Cold War is over, and now that the East-West antagonism is over, relations between the United States and Cuba would improve. Yet, the opposite has happened. The American blockade has been reinforced. In Washington there are those who believed that, following the disappearance of the USSR, the economic problems would lead to the collapse of the Cuban revolution. Yet, we have successfully resisted for four years. Obviously the situation is difficult and the problems are serious. However, as long as we hold out, the American strategy will prove to be unsustainable. There are already American companies which are looking worriedly at our new economic contacts with Europe and Latin America. [Bonanni] Even your relations with Cuban refugees seem to have improved. [Alarcon] Yes. Even though we are not expecting an improvement in relations with the United States, it must be acknowledged that something is changing. After 12 years of very tough conservative politics, there is an administration in Washington today that has contacts with more moderate sectors of the Cuban immigrants. The Cuban far right, which dictated Reagan's and Bush's policy, was linked too much to the Republicans and it is now starting to lose influence. [Bonanni] America is changing. What about Cuba? To what extent are you interested in the Chinese model? [Alarcon] We are studying it with great interest, as well as the Vietnamese model. They too are developing countries that are following the socialist path. However, there are major economic and cultural differences. The Chinese rationalization efforts cannot be applied to us: They have a large market, great natural resources, an enormous population, and an ancient tradition of entrepreneurship. In any case, the time of models is over. Everyone must find their own road. [Bonanni] How do you respond to the European pressure for political and economic reform? [Alarcon] I would not talk in terms of pressure. Generally speaking, the Europeans understand that Cuba is in a tough situation. It must adapt to a changing world. However, I believe that our pragmatic approach is convincing. We are the ones who suffered the most from the collapse of the Soviet Union, but today we are also the most stable country of the former socialist world. The euphoria of the capitalist world following the events in Eastern Europe is now calming down and making room for worries about the dangers arising from political instability. The economic operators have understood this. They know that in Cuba we have an educated and prepared population, and that there is no risk of political instability. Thus, despite the American pressure, they are beginning to invest. After resisting for four years, I hope that our situation can change for the better.
