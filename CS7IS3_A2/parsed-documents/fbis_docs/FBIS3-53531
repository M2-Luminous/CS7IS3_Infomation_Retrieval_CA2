Reacting to the U.S.-Russia joint declaration issued in Moscow yesterday at the end of the summit talks, New Delhi perceives that the basic orientation of the declaration echoed the objectives emphasized by India at the United Nations. A statement issued by the External Affairs Ministry spokesman said that while India wants objectives of comprehensive test ban pursued expeditiously within a specified timeframe, it should be applicable to all members of the international community. In view of this, New Delhi has pursued confidence building measures with its neighbors and participated in a series of bilateral discussions with different countries. However, as far as a suggestion of the Moscow declaration that the NPT should be extended indefinitely and unconditionally in the present form, New Delhi is of the view that it needs to be altered on nondiscriminatory lines. It should take into account international developments of the last three decades and the imperative necessity for complete disarmament to end all weapons of mass destruction. The declaration issued after the talks between Mr. Bill Clinton and Mr. Boris Yeltsin said that the two countries will support efforts to set up a multilateral forum to deal with nonproliferation problems in South Asia. It also called upon India and Pakistan to join the treaty banning nuclear tests and the proposed convention on banning the production of materials for nuclear arms.
