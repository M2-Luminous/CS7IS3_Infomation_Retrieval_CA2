AL-DUSTUR has learned that 15 Central Committee members will accompany President Yasir 'Arafat when he returns to the Gaza Strip. Informed sources have told AL-DUSTUR that the Israeli authorities have excluded Major General Muhammad Jihad from those who were allowed to return. Maj. Gen. Muhammad Jihad leads the hardliners within Fatah who oppose negotiations with Israel and any agreements that result from them. The informed military sources said this hardline trend comprises many military people. It works within Fatah against the negotiations and is active at Fatah Central Committee and Revolutionary Council meetings in support of a reinvigorated intifadah. [passage omitted]
