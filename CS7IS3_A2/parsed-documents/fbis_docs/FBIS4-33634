In light of this situation, President Salinas set a 30-day deadline for the government and organizations to comply with the recommendations. Here is a report by Jaime Guerrero: [Begin recording] [Guerrero] The leading problem the CNDH faces is that of partial compliance with its recommendations, but a statement issued today at Los Pinos presidential residence could be interpreted as a warning. The federal government might apply sanctions against those who do not fully comply with CNDH recommendations. Several governors might be among those penalized. Jorge Madrazo has submitted his report. Madrazo said that during the past four years, the CNDH issued 796 recommendations, of which 51 percent were in partial compliance. As a result, a 30-day deadline was established for state governments and organizations to comply with CNDH recommendations. President Salinas has said the law will be applied to its fullest extent. [Salinas] I urge state governors to join this national effort with a greater enthusiasm, and I urge the CNDH president to disclose, under a strict time limit, a new public report on the results of compliance with the recommendations. The last results have been referred here as negligent noncompliance. [Guerrero] During the past year, the CNDH received approximately 9,000 complaints, of which human rights violations in prisons, abuse of authority, and arbitrary arrests head the list. Torture reportedly ranks 10th on the long list of violations nationwide. [Madrazo] In the fight against torture, we have not had the resolute support of all governors or all judges. [end recording]
