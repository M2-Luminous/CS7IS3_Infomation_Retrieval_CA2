The provisions of this subpart implement section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub.

(a) Mutually exclusive initial applications in the following services or classes of services are subject to competitive bidding: (1) Interactive Video Data Service (see 47 CFR part 95, subpart F); (2) Marine Public Coast Stations (see 47 CFR part 80, subpart J); (3) Multipoint Distribution Service and Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (see 47 CFR part 21, subpart K). This subsection does not apply to applications in these services that were filed prior to July 26, 1993; (4) Exclusive Private Carrier Paging above 900 MHz (see 47 CFR part 90, subpart P and the Private Carrier Paging Exclusivity Report and Order, 8 FCC Rcd 8318 (1993)); (5) Public Mobile Services (see 47 CFR part 22), except in the 800 MHz Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service, and in the Rural Radio Service. Paragraph (a)(g) of this section does not apply to certain applications in the cellular radio service that were filed prior to July 26, 1993; (6) Specialized Mobile Radio Service (SMR) (see 47 CFR part 90, subpart S) including finder's preference requests for frequencies allocated to the SMR service (see 47 CFR 90.173); and (7) Personal Communications Services (PCS) (see 47 CFR part 24). Note: To determine the rules that apply to competitive bidding in the foregoing services, specific service rules should also be consulted. (b) The following types of license applications are not subject to competitive bidding procedures: (1) Applications for renewal of licenses; (2) Applications for modification of license; provided, however, that the Commission may determine in particular instances that applications for modification that are mutually exclusive with other applications should be subject to competitive bidding; (3) Applications for subsidiary communications services. A ``subsidiary communications service'' is a class of service where the signal for that service is indivisible from that of the main channel signal and that main channel signal is exempt from competitive bidding under other provisions of these rules. See, e.g., §1.2102(c) (exempting broadcast services). Examples of such subsidiary communications services are those transmitted on subcarriers within the FM baseband signal (see 47 CFR 73.295), and signals transmitted within the Vertical Blanking Interval of a broadcast television signal; and (4) Applications for frequencies used as an intermediate link or links in the provision of a continuous, end-to-end service were no service is provided directly to subscribers over the frequencies. Examples of such intermediate links are (i) Point-to-point microwave facilities used to connect a cellular radio telephone base station with a cellular radio telephone mobile telephone switching office; and (ii) Point-to-point microwave facilities used as part of the service offering in the provision of telephone exchange or interexchange service. (c) Applications in the following services or classes of services are not subject to competitive bidding: (1) Alaska-Private Fixed Stations (see 47 CFR part 80, subpart O); (2) Broadcast radio (AM and FM) and broadcast television (VHF, UHF, LPTV) under 47 CFR part 73; (3) Broadcast Auxiliary and Cable Television Relay Services (see 47 CFR part 74, subparts D, E, F, G, H and L and part 78, subpart B); (4) Instructional Television Fixed Service (see 47 CFR part 74, subpart I); (5) Maritime Support Stations (see 47 CFR part 80, subpart N); (6) Marine Operational Fixed Stations (see 47 CFR part 80, subpart L);
