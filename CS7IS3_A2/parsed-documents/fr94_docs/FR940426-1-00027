FR940426-1-00027 FR940426-1-00004 VIII. Regulation of Other Manipulative Activity During Offerings Concept Seven: Where necessary or appropriate, regulation should address the activities of persons other than distribution participants who have substantial incentives to manipulate security prices during offerings. The Trading Practices Rules address the manipulative activities of distribution participants and their affiliated purchasers. However, other parties also may have substantial incentives to manipulate the price of a security around the time of a securities offering. The difficulty lies in drawing clear lines that appropriately address manipulation practices but that do not interfere with legitimate market and business activity. One context that has been addressed is sales of securities prior to the pricing of an offering. The Commission has applied fundamental manipulation concepts to this activity: ``Where * * * those who have a substantial interest in the establishment of lower market prices take active steps to accomplish their objective, a finding of manipulative purpose is warranted'' under Exchange act sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Securities Act Section 17(a). 110 110 J.A.B. Securities Co., Inc., 47 SEC 86, 92 & n.17 (1979). Specifically, the Commission views short selling in anticipation of a public offering and the subsequent covering of those short sales with the offered securities as a manipulative activity. Such short sales are detrimental to the capital formation process, because the decreased price resulting from those sales deprives the issuer of offering proceeds that otherwise would have been realized had the market not been subject to such activity. 111 Persons who sell short and cover their sales out of a public offering are not subject to the usual market risk associated with short sales, because they have access to a pool of securities obtainable from distribution participants at a fixed, and generally lower, price. It is this lower risk that can provide an incentive for manipulative short selling. The Commission adopted Rule 10b&hyph;21 in 1988 to prohibit this type of short selling and covering. 112 111 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26028 (August 25, 1988), 53 FR 33455, 33456. See also Rule 10b&hyph;21 Release. 112 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;21. See, e.g., SEC v. Curtis Ivey and Gregg Kaplan, Lit. Release No. 14042 (April 5, 1994). In addition to short sellers, persons may engage in long sales in order to depress the market price in anticipation of an offering. For instance, they may have indicated their interest in buying the offered securities from the underwriter, but want to do so at a lower price. 113 113 See, e.g., SEC v. Soros Fund Management, Inc., No. 79 Civ. 2641 (S.D.N.Y. 1979), Lit. Release No. 8763 (May 21, 1979) (consent decree finding violations of Exchange Act sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Rule 10b&hyph;5 thereunder and Securities Act section 17(a)). Question 4.1. Does Rule 10b&hyph;21 adequately address the concerns raised by short selling in anticipation of an offering? Question 4.2. Should Rule 10b&hyph;21 explicitly cover sales of related securities in addition to the offered securities? Question 4.3. Are there other manipulative activities during an offering that should be addressed by regulation and that can be regulated feasibly? IX. Extraterritorial Effects of Antimanipulation Regulation Concept Eight: Consistent with the protection of United States investors, regulation of offerings should avoid conflicts with global distribution practices. Shortly after adoption of the Trading Practices Rules, the Commission took the position that, with respect to multinational offerings of securities occurring in whole or in part in the United States, the Trading Practices Rules apply to all distribution participants and their affiliated purchasers, wherever they are located or effect transactions. 114 The basis for this position is that transactions occurring in a foreign jurisdiction can affect the market for the security being distributed in the United States, and such activity might result in the harm that Rule 10b&hyph;6 was designed to prevent (i.e., the creation of artificial prices by persons participating in the distribution). 115 As the world's securities markets have become increasingly interconnected and, in particular, as multinational offerings have become more common, market participants have asserted that the extraterritorial effects of the Trading Practices Rules disrupt foreign distribution participants' normal market practices and may discourage some offerings from being made in the United States. 116 These effects also may impose compliance burdens on foreign persons that conflict with regulatory requirements in their home jurisdictions. 117 114 See, e.g., Letters regarding Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. (December 23, 1957); Philips N.V. (May 15, 1962); Standard Oil Co. (New Jersey) (February 6, 1970); and S.S. Kresge & Co. (April 14, 1972). In some respects, other jurisdictions have taken a similar approach. See Chapter III, Part 10, Rule 10.06 of the Rules of the U.K. Securities and Investments Board, 2 Fin. Serv. Rep. (CCH) at Â¶184,281. 115 Generally, U.S. courts have recognized the application of U.S. federal securities laws to fraudulent or manipulative activities in a foreign jurisdiction where such activities have an ``effect'' in the United States, Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405 F.2d 200, 208 (2d Cir.), rev'd in part on other grounds, 405 F.2d 215 (2d Cir. 1968) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom. Manley v. Schoenbaum, 395 U.S. 906; Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F.2d 974, 991 (2d Cir. 1975); see also Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, 416 (1987), or where conduct that occurs in the United States is an ``essential link'' in the foreign fraudulent or manipulative activities. Leasco Data Processing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F.2d 1326, 1335 (2d Cir. 1972). 116 See Rule 144A Release, 58 FR at 60327. 117 See Statement of Policy, 58 FR at 60324.
