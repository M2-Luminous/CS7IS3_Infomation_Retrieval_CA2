These issues will soon cease to occupy the top of the country's agenda, she said. Ciller noted that this will allow for increased efforts to improve the economy, which has been drained by the struggle against terrorism. In a news conference in Ankara today, Ciller recalled that terrorism was at the top of the country's agenda when the government assumed power seven to eight months ago. Citing examples of newspaper headlines on terrorist incidents published at the time, Ciller explained that the state is now able to significantly counter terrorism. The prime minister said that during this period, the government attacked the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization's financial resources and, to a large extent, put a stop to the organization's narcotics smuggling activities. Some of the specially trained antiterror teams have also been sent to the region, she added. Recalling that the banning of the PKK in many countries also occurred in this period, Ciller announced: The next few months will constitute a turning point in the struggle against the PKK and in protecting the unity and integrity of the country. These issues will drop to the bottom of the agenda, she said. [passage omitted] Commenting on economic issues, the prime minister stated that when the government came to power, the growth rate was zero, the inflation rate was 78 percent, the struggle against terrorism drained 26 trillion Turkish lira, and the policy of subsidies no longer served its original goals. Around the same time, Ciller explained, the state economic enterprises, which employ 700,000 workers, showed a loss of 70-90 trillion Turkish lira; the deficit of SST [Social Security Organization] was 24 trillion Turkish lira and that of Bag-Kurt [Social Security Association for Tradesmen, Artisans, and Independent Workers] was 6 trillion Turkish lira; and the foreign currency rate adjustments were kept below the rate of inflation. Ciller said that this discrepancy in the currency adjustments and the debts accrued in the past caused a public deficit of 217 trillion Turkish lira, which must be paid by the people in the form of taxes. Pointing out that the government assumed its duty with a determination to break this vicious circle in the economy, Ciller remarked that a certain distance has been covered in this field as well. For the first time, the Treasury did not have to borrow any money in January and February this year because the state obtained new resources close to $5.5 million, thus allowing existing debts to be stretched over longer terms.
