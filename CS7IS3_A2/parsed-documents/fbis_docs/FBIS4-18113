A former Nazi SS shock trooper, he currently risks being brought to trial. The magistrature is considering this possibility because, following the attack on the Luebeck synagogue, he confirmed that, in his opinion, Jewish community leader Ignatz Bubis was an instigator of ethnic hatred and responsible for antisemitism. [Tarquini] What do you think of the vote in Italy? [Schoenhuber] It is the beginning of a Europewide turn to the Right, which will be particularly marked in East Europe. [Tarquini] Why in the East particularly? [Schoenhuber] Because, having traveled widely from Russia to the Baltic, and Ukraine, I am convinced that a national ethos will play an increasingly important role, especially in the East. This will also be a reaction, on the part of national consciousness, against communist internationalism; and I believe that, in general, Europe as a whole is looking to the Right. [Tarquini] Why? [Schoenhuber] It seems to me that the Christian parties, in particular, have lost all credibility. They have lied to the people for decades, and they must now pay for the consequences, as happened in Italy. [Tarquini] Do you believe National Alliance will play a leading role in government? [Schoenhuber] I cannot tell from here, as a German. I can only say that my fellow members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg who are in the MSI [Italian Social Movement], are democratic and reasonable, and they have all my respect. [Tarquini] Are you hoping that there will be repercussions in Germany? [Schoenhuber] The political situation in Germany will become, in a sense, italianized. In our country, the establishment parties will also have to foot the bill, though it may not be as steep as in Italy. They have received an ominous message from the Italian elections. [Tarquini] What sort of Italy and what sort of Germany do you expect to see two years from now? [Schoenhuber] To begin with, a democratic Italy and a democratic Germany, with a stronger national consciousness. The way that Italians are trying to solve their political problems is setting an example throughout Europe. Secondly, the traditional and left-wing party alignments are now outdated in the whole continent. [Tarquini] Does the right turn involve the risk of social tensions? [Schoenhuber] Life is full of risks in itself. You cannot live without risks, but they must be calculated risks. [Tarquini] Do you believe that it is correct to reopen territorial questions in Europe, including, say, Alto Adige and former German territories in the East? [Schoenhuber] The territorial question will be posed, though democratically. There is no room in my party for advocates of an Alto Adige annexation. I am demanding the right of every people to self-determination, not annexations.
