The biggest disillusion of separatists who organized the meeting was the fact that the Turkish society living in Belgium showed no reaction to the meeting and did not enter any dispute, despite the provocations the conference made. Since the beginning of the conference Saturday [12 March], separatists kept on saying that they were facing danger and Turks can attack any time. However, there was neither an attack nor an interest towards the meeting. The Belgian police took intensive measures around the Sheraton Hotel which the meeting was held. A gendarme official in site was saying, "the danger does not come from the Turkish society, but from the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] militants inside." The Belgian media did not cover the conference and the small number of audience included Pakistanis invited to the conference, who were not listening to the conference but drawing pictures. None of the separatists in the meeting were speaking Kurdish. All the addresses, excluding former True Path Party member Abdulmelik Firat, were speaking Turkish. After PKK head Abdullah Ocalan's message, which claimed that the terror organization was not intending to divide Turkey, was read, a naive British participant who said "I did not know that he was not a terrorist and did not aim at dividing Turkey" was evaluated by the other participants as "the only person who took the message at face value." Meanwhile member of Democracy Party Remzi Kartal took the floor to say that "they had been forced to carry an armed fight against Turkey." The Democracy Party, which hold 13 seats at the Turkish Grand National Assembly denies that it has links with separatist terror organization PKK which claims nearly 11,000 lives in Turkey in a decade of its bloody campaign against the Turkish state and people.
