Northeast Utilities, et al. (70&hyph;8062) Northeast Utilities (``Northeast''), 174 Brush Hill Ave., West Springfield, Massachusetts 01089, a registered holding company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Charter Oak Energy, Inc. (``Charter Oak'') and COE Development Corporation (``COE Development'') (collectively, ``Applicants''), each located at 107 Selden Street, Berlin, Connecticut, 06037&hyph;1616, have filed a further post-effective amendment under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 13(b), 32, and 33 of the Act and rules 45, 53, 87, 90, and 91 thereunder to their application-declaration filed under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), and 13(b) of the Act and rules 45, 87, 90, and 91 thereunder. By order dated January 24, 1994 (HCAR. 25977) (``January 1994 Order'') Charter Oak and COE Development were authorized to engage in preliminary development activities and make investments in and finance the acquisition of exempt wholesale generators (``EWGs'') and foreign utility companies (``FUCOs'') in the amount of $100 million through December 30, 1994. The January 1994 Order also authorized the Applicants to issue guarantees and assume the liabilities of subsidiary companies for preliminary development activities. The Applicants now propose to issue guarantees and assume the liabilities of subsidiary companies for development activities, including construction and permanent financing, and contingent liabilities subsequent to operation with regard to those EWG and FUCO projects that do not require advance approval from the Commission for the Applicants to acquire an interest. The Applicants have found that on occasion such guarantees and assumptions of liability may provide them with opportunities to participate in private power opportunities on a favorable basis without expending funds. The full contingent amount of any guarantees or assumptions of liabilities would be counted as part of the authorized development activities limit of $100 million authorized in the January 1994 Order. The Applicants also propose to use Charter Oak or other system company employees within a de minimis â€™limit to render services to affiliated EWGs and FUCOs. The Applicants represent that they would not use more than 0.5% of total holding company system employees and no more than 1% of the system service company employees at any one time for rendering services to affiliated EWGs and FUCOs. Consolidated Natural Gas Company (70&hyph;8107) Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG''), CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, a registered holding company, has filed a declaration under sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5) thereunder. CNG proposes on or before June 30, 1995 to issue and sell the remaining unissued balance of up to $400 million principal amount of debt securities (``Securities'') authorized by the Commission on April 21, 1993 (HCAR No. 25800) under a new indenture (``Indenture''). The Securities will be sold in one or more series at a price, exclusive of accrued interest, which will be not less than 98% nor more than 101% of the principal amount and at an interest rate which will be a multiple of 1/8, 1/10, or 1/20 of 1%. The Securities will mature in not more than thirty years from the date of issue. CNG proposes to issue and sell the Securities either by competitive bidding, including the alternative bidding procedures authorized by the Commission's Statement of Policy Concerning Application of Rule 50 under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (HCAR No. 22623, Sept. 2, 1982) or by an exception to competitive bidding under Rule 50(a)(5). In the event Rule 50 is rescinded, CNG requests authority to be permitted to issue and sell the Securities under competitive bidding including the alternative procedures without prior Commission approval. The Indenture differs from CNG's current indenture (``1971 Indenture'') in eight substantial ways: (1) Setting of terms; (2) form of security; (3) lien restrictions; (4) sale and leaseback restrictions; (5) additional debt incurrence limitations; (6) issue and sale of subsidiaries' stock; (7) limitation of dividends; and (8) defeasance.
