FR940822-2-00045 FR940822-2-00033 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;714&hyph;000] Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.; Notice of Application August 16, 1994. Take notice that on August 15, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1396, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;714&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for (1) a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing certain river crossings, and (2) an order permitting and approving the abandonment of existing facilities at the same location, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Transco states that it has three pipelines which cross the Amite River in Louisiana: (1) 30-inch diameter Main Line A, (2) 36-inch diameter Main Line B and (3) 36-inch Maine Line C. Transco states that all gas produced onshore and offshore Texas and Louisiana which flows through Transco's system to Transco's markets in the deep south, atlantic seaboard and eastern markets flows through the Amite River crossing (with the exception of the gas attached to Transco's mainline by way of the Southeast Louisiana Gathering System, which interconnects with Transco's mainline at Compressor Station No. 65, located approximately 11 miles north of the Amite River). Transco states that because of river scouring, bank washing and channel meander/realignment, Main Line A is exposed. It is indicated that Line A has been taken out of service because Transco is concerned that a significant flood event could occur and rupture the line. It is also indicated that Main Lines B and C are not yet exposed, but Transco is concerned that they would become exposed because the river is realigning in a southward direction. Transco states that it cannot perform these replacements pursuant to Section 2.55(b) of the Commission's Regulations because of the Commission's recent clarification of Section 2.55(b) in the order issued on May 12, 1994, in Arkla Energy Resources Company, Docket No. CP91&hyph;2069&hyph;000 (67 FERC Â¶61,173), involving the issue of replacements outside of existing right-of-way. Transco states that it is imperative that it complete the new crossings in time to provide service during the upcoming winter heating season. Transco states that it proposes to install approximately 2,700 feet of new 36-inch diameter Main Line B by horizontal directional drilling under the Amite River, at the location of its existing pipeline crossing of the Amite River. Transco indicates that directionally drilled pipeline are more secure than the older pipelines which were installed by way of trenching the river bed. It is stated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe would be conventionally installed from the entrance of the bore on the east side of the river and tied in to existing Main Lines A and B by means of a new manifold. It is also indicated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe would be conventionally installed from the exit of the bore on the west bank of the river and tied into existing Main Lines A and B by means of a new manifold. Transco states that it also proposes to install approximately 2,700 feet of new 36-inch diameter Main Line C by horizontal directional drilling under the Amite River. It is indicated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe will be conventionally installed from the entrance of the bore on the east side of the river and tied into existing Main Line Lines A, B, and C by means of the manifold mentioned above. It is also stated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe would be conventionally installed from the exit of the bore on the west side of the river and tied into Main Lines A, B, and C by means of the manifold mentioned above. Transco states that proposed replacements would restore the long-term integrity of Transco's transmission system at the Amite River crossings. It is stated that system capacity across the Amite River after installation of the two new river crossings would be 2,361,000 Mcf per day compared with a current capacity of 2,369,000 Mcf per day. Transco states that the three existing pipelines would be retired and removed. Transco estimates the cost of installing both new lines at approximately $6,000,000, to be financed initially through short-term loans and funds on hand, with permanent financing to be undertaken at a later date. Transco estimates the cost of the removal work at $280,000. Transco states that issuance of a certificate and construction clearance by September 15, 1994, is justified for three reasons: (1) The need for security of gas service during the upcoming winter heating season, (2) historically, during the months of August and September, it is expected that the Amite River floodplain would be dryer than at any time of the year, and thus provide the most favorable conditions for the contractor's equipment, and (3) the de minimis impact on the environment of the crossing project. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before August 31, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and permission for abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Transco to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
