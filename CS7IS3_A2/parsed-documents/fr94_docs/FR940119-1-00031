ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: In 1991, the Department issued a report on emergency flow restricting devices (EFRDs) that proposed seeking public input on the placement of EFRDs at certain locations on hazardous liquid pipelines.

The regulations are to be issued following a survey and assessment of the effectiveness of such equipment. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) poses a series of questions in order to solicit public input for the survey process.
