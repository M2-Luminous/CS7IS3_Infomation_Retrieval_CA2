[Begin Zedillo recording] On 24 April, I invited two of the presidential candidates to a public debate. This debate, held on 12 May, confirmed my party's commitment to democracy. I invited them to debate for two reasons. First, I wished to demonstrate with facts that I believe firmly in the discussion of ideas among several persons. I am convinced the leadership that Mexico requires must be based on the best ideas and programs. Second, I am convinced that my party's proposal is the best, offers the greatest possibilities of turning the progress of the national economy into tangible benefits for the family economy, preserves the attainments that we, the Mexican people, have reached with so great sacrifices, and proposes the great social and juridical reform that Mexico demands. On 12 May, I expressed my interest in holding a debate with all nine presidential candidates. Today, I wish to formalize this invitation, which also corresponds to the interests of the other parties. I propose that we hold this debate as soon as practicable. The country is entitled to it. The country wishes to continue these democratic practices. For this reason, I expect a prompt reply to this invitation. I am extending this invitation under the same principles and in the same democratic spirit that guided the first debate. This is to say, that the nine parties should discuss a format that will guarantee impartiality, clarity, and equity. Each of the candidates should be given an equal amount of time. The debate should be broadcast live by radio and television and a single signal should be used, which can be picked up and transmitted by all the stations that so desire. This debate will meet a demand from every single one of you: to have better information at the time our votes are cast on 21 August. On that day, all of us should participate in an exercise in responsibility and knowledge. We all desire a process that will conclude in peace and harmony, an exemplary electoral process in the history of our country. I know that we can do it, provided we are united. Thanks. [end recording] [Later, this "24 Hours" newscast carries a report that on 7 June the nine presidential candidates will speak during a dinner traditionally held by newspaper editors to commemorate Freedom of the Press Day. In a recorded statement, Ricardo Perete, president of the Association of Daily Newspapers of Mexico [ADIMEX], says: "It occurred to us to invite the nine candidates to this important meeting commemorating Freedom of the Press Day so they can express their views. This will not be a debate. Each of them will be given five minutes. They will choose their own topics. They will not be interrupted at all. Yes, there will be a moderator, who will advise the candidates when their time is up." Perete adds that the order for the speakers will be determined by a drawing to be held in the ADIMEX head office.]
