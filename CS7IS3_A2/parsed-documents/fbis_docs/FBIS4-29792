Defence Minister Mohamed Najib Abdul Razak said that as a provider, the U.S. could offer countries like Malaysia technology transfer, information, and access to state-of-the-art training to assist in Malaysia's effort to modernise its defence capabilities. I hope our modernisation process will continue because a stronger Malaysia, in military terms, makes for a stronger ASEAN ... I see it as a deterrent value, he told members of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace at a luncheon address on Malaysia's concept of strategic security: Towards a Stable and Peaceful Environment Wednesday. Najib, who is in the U.S. for a nine-day visit, quashes the idea of an arms race in the region, emphasising that Malaysia's modernisation programme was not to keep up with the neighbouring countries, but merely to replace its antiquated asset, some purchased when my father was defence minister, he told an amused audience. There is no immediate threat, but if things do go wrong (I'm not saying things will go wrong) we will be more prepared ... ASEAN will be more prepared. Who knows what will happen in the 21st century, he said. On why Malaysia recently purchased only eight F-18 from the U.S. but 18 MiG-29 from the Russians, he explained that the costs of the two packages were equivalent. He added that although the Russian MiGs were older, they were equipped with new engines and air frames that met Malaysia's specifications and current needs. As for the eight F-18s, he quipped, there's scope for more ... We only have half a squadron ... No pilot likes to fly with half a squadron. Najib later told journalists that Malaysia had no immediate plans to purchase additional F-18s and that his visit to the McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis, Missouri next week was to identify areas of cooperation and technology transfer.
