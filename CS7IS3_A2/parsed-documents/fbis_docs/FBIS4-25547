Kakizawa was quoted by a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman as telling his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen that Japan has always regarded banning nuclear tests as one of the highest priorities in the field of disarmament and that it strongly urges China not to repeat nuclear testing in the future. The Japanese foreign minister said Friday's nuclear test was also regrettable in light of the Japanese Government's guidelines, released in June 1992, which state that recipient countries of Japan's official development assistance (ODA) should promote disarmament, the spokesman said. Kakizawa's remarks suggested that China's failure to stop nuclear tests may have a negative impact on Japan's yen loan programs from fiscal 1996 and thereafter, the official said. Qian reiterated that China's nuclear tests are the fewest among those carried out by world nuclear powers, the spokesman said. The Japanese minister was in Beijing mainly to discuss measures to cope with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development.
