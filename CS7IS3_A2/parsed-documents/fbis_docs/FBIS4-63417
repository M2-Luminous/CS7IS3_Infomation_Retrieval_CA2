Underwater Currents in the Pacific..."] [Text] Despite strict official explanations, many officers at the Defense Ministry and the General Staff are more and more often comparing the explosions of the Pacific Fleet arsenals with those that rocked the North Caucasus during the withdrawal of the Russian Army from the area. One is getting the impression that the Defense Ministry is "disarming" itself in this unconventional fashion by destroying excess reserves without taking any unnecessary trouble. Suggestions that Admiral Gurinov, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, may have been fired for reasons other than the latest explosion also incline one toward this theory. The situation at the Northern Fleet, say, is hardly any better, if not much worse. While an arsenal blew up at the Pacific Fleet, the Northern Fleet saw a much more serious incident: nuclear materials were stolen twice within a month there. But the fleet commander has emerged from the incidents unscathed. Once he arrived in the fleet following the tragedy on the Russkiy island last year, Admiral Gurinov launched a flurry of activity, trying to create some semblance of a Navy out of the Pacific Fleet, or rather out of its remnants. But the inertia of disintegration had gone so far that the energetic admiral was scarcely able to accomplish anything within so short a period. Meanwhile, Grachev waited for reports of drastic change. But no rosy reports were forthcoming. Gurinov reported to Moscow that the situation was extremely unfavorable in virtually all areas. Moreover, on that same Russkiy island several more tragic incidents occurred, also because of paralysis; it was ordered to keep them strictly secret. The fleet continued to degenerate. Furthermore, the new commander appeared to have decided to put an end to lavish receptions for ministerial commissions, a move that added fuel to the fire. But according to an old tradition of top authorities in Russia it was "something personal" that appears was the last straw. A Japanese company undertook to mediate the sale of the Pacific Fleet's 12 decommissioned diesel submarines to North Korea. Somehow the State Property Committee also stuck to the deal drawing on support from a very high-ranking official at the Defense Ministry. Once the first two submarines were sent to North Korea for dismantling, a universal outcry was raised that the North Koreans could use the submarines as combat ships (after repairs and the installation of weapons). Journalists demanded explanations from the Pacific Fleet command. Then the angered admiral Gurinov took a step unheard of in the Armed Forces. In his interview for a major news agency he said that the deal was for some reason sponsored by the State Property Committee and was struck at the consent of the defense minister, who did not even think it necessary to advise the Pacific Fleet commander of what percentage of the deal the fleet would get. A number of informed sources at the Defense Ministry started openly saying that Gurinov's career after that could be considered finished. At a meeting of the Defense Ministry collegium in early May, where the level of combat training of the Army and the Navy in the first six months of this year was assessed, Grachev, as the saying goes, razed the Pacific Fleet to the ground. Naval commanders are becoming increasingly petty. These are not Ushakov, Nakhimov, or Kornilov. This time, Russia has lost yet another "unlucky" admiral. To all appearances, he fell victim to intrigues at the ministerial palace, not battles for improving the fleet's combat readiness.
