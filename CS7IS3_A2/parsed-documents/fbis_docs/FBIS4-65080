As for spying on the parties, after the polemics over the file on the League, from now on there will be very strict rules. There will be no reports on any "political and official organizations," and no activities will be permitted "outside the sphere of institutional responsibilities." Center chiefs will pay personally for any violations. After eight months at the head of a storm-tossed Sisde, Domenico Salazar talked about agents "retiring" and others entering on duty, including those with "famous fathers," who have, he said, displayed "a high degree of professionalism and expertise." He also talked about the "bogus train bomb" -- reports of which had an "authenticity rating of C3, that is, very low" but which nevertheless had to be investigated. He talked about the "misfortune" of the "black sheep" (namely, [former Sisde chief] Broccoletti and company) who involved in scandals and trials a service that now "has to regain the dignity that it needs in the eyes of the public and the media." Suspicions, polemics, accusations. The service, Salazar said, "is operating well," but "that does not seem to interest anyone." Is this the fault of an image that has now been "distorted" by those who are still trying to undermine it? "The mysterious sickness is not within Sisde. It is outside." This is what he had to say: [Purgatori] Mr. Salazar, during your period as director of Sisde, some 300 agents have been dismissed. This constitutes an outright purge.... [Salazar] People have been excessively alarmist about this alleged "purge," though that term is very remote from the actual truth of the matter. When I assumed my post, I was asked to assess the usefulness, professionalism, and reliability of my personnel with a view to making Sisde as efficient and reliable an organization as possible from the viewpoint of democratic security. And this is precisely what I have done. [Purgatori] On the basis of what criteria? [Salazar] Only one, the only feasible one in practice: to have members of staff assessed by their own office chiefs. This is such a general and obvious rule that it applies to all offices in the world, whether public or private, so I do not think I need to say any more about it. Every division chief classified his own staff according to different productivity ratings, without any outside influence, and placed in the lowest bracket those that were superfluous or unfit to work for Sisde. [Purgatori] Were they unreliable, incompetent, or corrupt? [Salazar] They simply failed to satisfy the criteria I just mentioned. Personally, I do not even know these members of staff. On average, they entered service five years ago, that is, well before I assumed my post. [Purgatori] Some of them have already taken legal action to be reinstated or to protest the decisions. Can you rule out abuses or vendettas on the part of your division chiefs? [Salazar] Well, some people have suggested such a possibility. But if there were any abuses or vendettas on the part of division chiefs, I certainly could not know about them. Be that as it may, these libelous charges must be supported by concrete evidence. [Purgatori] Sisde is a hotbed of nepotism -- sons of politicians, magistrates, generals, officials. How many of them have you dismissed? [Salazar] I can only tell you that on the basis of the assessments 67 individuals were returned to their respective administrations or at least transferred to another administration according to a precise and rigorous procedure. A further 170 people were separated from service for various reasons -- mostly with pensions or special early pension arrangements. Since our manpower totals some 300,000, it seems to me that there is no connection between transfers or dismissals on the one hand and the employment of temporary personnel on the other. These latter total some 50 and could all easily be allocated to some of the 300 vacant positions. But there has been a great deal of nonsense talked about the business of these temporary staff, too, thus creating alarm by focusing public attention on a nonexistent problem. [Purgatori] Did the purge not serve precisely to make way for further sons of the famous and temporary staff? [Salazar] Such an insinuation is an absolute lie, and those responsible for it will answer for it in the appropriate forums. Be that as it may, the regularization of the position of temporary staff -- who are fully entitled to assert their own position in the courts -- was not a hasty initiative on my part but the implementation of precise requirements on the basis of instructions from the Prime Minister's Office. If these temporary staff have famous fathers, that would be reason enough for me to avoid making unfair comments. During our internal competition we established that these people display a high degree of professionalism and expertise. It would be a strange circumstance if all the fathers' sins were to fall on their sons, and by sins I mean the very fact that their fathers are famous. [Purgatori] Sisde is under a cloud of suspicions, legal inquiries, and a generally negative public opinion. The business of the bogus train bomb was not a heroic episode. Then there are the suspicions in connection with the bombings in Rome, Florence, and Milan. [Salazar] Look, I am tired of repeating that the train bomb -- an operation started before I assumed this post -- was merely one of over 700 reports in the field of organized crime, added to which there are the approximately 500 reports in the field of terrorism and subversion. We have had over 500 people arrested, have captured 70 wanted persons, and so forth. Why should a single erroneous report be so important within the overall context of our work? [Purgatori] But an erroneous report, especially if it concerns a bombing, could bring a secret service to its knees. [Salazar] So I should explain. We prepare reports originating from a certain source, which we try to assess as best we can. And over 95 percent of our reports are confirmed. But it must be clear that on the whole these reports by the services constitute only pointers or suspicions, which it is then the duty of the judicial police to investigate and to back up with supporting evidence. The results of this are presented to the judicial authorities, not to us. So we cannot be answerable for the accuracy or otherwise of the report, even though we do assess it. [Purgatori] And what happened in the case of the bogus bomb? [Salazar] What happened was that the report was issued with a reliability rating of C3, that is, very low. But that does not alter the fact that all possible kinds of checks had to be carried out immediately. Let me ask you: Faced with the possibility that there is a bomb on an aircraft or a train, would you be prepared not to forward the report to the police immediately so that all possible checks could be carried out? I do not think so. So it seems to me that it is time to put an end to this business of our "disgrace." [Purgatori] Let us talk about the incompetence of the untrained personnel and Sisde's lack of international credibility. [Salazar] I must deny this immediately. Consider that when the head of the secret service of a neighboring country heard that, after the well-known events, it was intended to deprive Sisde of the autonomy that it enjoyed, he immediately offered to bear witness to our efficiency in an international forum. [Purgatori] The issue of the file on the League remains unresolved. You maintain that it contained newspaper cuttings. But the service's past suggests something quite different. Do you or do you not spy on the parties? [Salazar] It must suffice for you to know that I have in fact issued instructions to all operational staff for center chiefs to confine themselves to intelligence activities of strict institutional relevance without straying from their proper sphere of responsibility. I expressly forbade any intelligence activities with respect to political and official organizations and stated in writing that any violations would constitute illegal and unauthorized actions. The consequences would be the personal responsibility of the center chief himself. [Purgatori] Tell us what crises Sisde is tackling and has to resolve in the midst of this storm. [Salazar] The first problem, and the greatest, is how to enable Sisde to regain its proper dignity in the eyes of the public and the media. But I still cannot understand why, with all the structures that have had the misfortune to encounter black sheep (and frankly, I do not know which of them has none), the same attitude has not been adopted, but an issue has been made only in the case of a body whose principal responsibility is precisely to defend the state. [Purgatori] Mr. Salazar, what is your mysterious sickness? [Salazar] I could reply that the newspapers are not helping us. It does not seem to interest anyone that this organization is operating well. The sole concern is to seek out disappointed dismissed personnel, to impart a distorted image of the service and its staff, to highlight what is wrong, even if that is now water under the bridge. As you can see, the mysterious sickness is not within Sisde. It is outside.
