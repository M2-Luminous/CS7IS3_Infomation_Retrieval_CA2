FBIS4-8019 "dreeu068_p_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 POLAND Walesa's Conditions To Meet Coalition Noted Walesa's Conditions To Meet Coalition Noted WS0804100894 Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 8 Apr 94 p 4 WS0804100894 Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY Polish BFN [Article by Luiza Kowalska and Robert Krasowski: "President's Conditions; Walesa Wants National Security Council"] [Text] The president is ready to meet Pawlak and Kwasniewski, but, in return, he wants the coalition to withdraw Rosati's candidacy, and he also wants a speedy establishment of a National Security Council [RBN]. The coalition fears that the RBN will strengthen the president's powers to an undesirable extent. "The president is open to proposals for a meeting with the coalition's leaders," stated Andrzej Drzycimski, the Belweder's spokesman, after a Walesa-Oleksy meeting during which the Sejm speaker tried to persuade the president to meet Prime Minister Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. But Drzycimski also suggested that such a meeting may take place only after the coalition meets two conditions. The first would be the coalition's official decision to give up trying to force Dariusz Rosati's candidacy for the post of finance minister and deputy prime minister. The president assured Oleksy yesterday that his decision to reject Rosati's candidacy is irreversible. Second, the Belweder is demanding an acceleration of work on the establishment of the RBN. "It does not make sense to establish spur-of-the-moment and extraconstitutional agencies" is the way Drzycimski commented on the idea of a Walesa-Kwasniewski-Pawlak meeting. "But the RBN and, until it is established, the National Defense Committee [KOK] could be such a constitutional forum." "I want to believe that what Minister Drzycimski says has nothing to do with what Mr. President thinks," Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the SLD told ZYCIE WARSZAWY. "After all, completely different issues are discussed during KOK's sessions." The purpose of the trilateral meeting suggested by the SLD is to resolve the political stalemate caused by the rejection of Rosati's candidacy. The SLD fears that a withdrawal of Rosati and the submission of a new candidate will not solve the problem because there are no guarantees that the president will not apply a veto a second time. Drzycimski said yesterday that, before an official announcement of a new candidate, the coalition should present it to the Belweder. The president's spokesman admits that there is no constitutional requirement for the government to consult the president over candidates for governmental posts. "But, if one wants the candidate to be approved...," Drzycimski said. Both parties to the meeting denied that the name of a new SLD candidate was mentioned during the talks. It is still not known when the Walesa-Pawlak-Kwasniewski meeting could take place. Drzycimski stated that it was not possible up to now because Kwasniewski has been abroad. But Oleksy stated that the SLD leader is returning on Friday, and it is possible that the meeting will take place that day. Oleksy said after the meeting that he was trying to persuade the president to sign the budget law and the electoral law to gmina [small administrative units] councils soon. But the president said he has not yet made a final decision on these issues. --A decision to establish the RBN was made on the initiative of the Belweder during the most recent KOK session, in November 1993. The RBN was supposed to be the supreme state agency in the area of the country's defense system and security. The government would have to execute the RBN's decisions, whereas the RBN's composition would be the same as that of KOK--among other things, it would include the president; the prime minister; Sejm and Senate speakers; chiefs of the Defense Ministry, the Internal Affairs Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the Finance Ministry; and the chief of the President's Office. The coalition has initially agreed to the establishment of the RBN, and Sejm Speaker Oleksy even promised speedy legislative proceedings. But once specific items relative to the RBN were presented, the coalition refused to support the idea any longer. According to the coalition's representatives, the RBN's composition would cause an imbalance in the legal status guaranteed by the Constitution because a majority of the RBN's members would be associated with the Belweder camp. The Belweder in turn thinks that the RBN idea limits presidential powers, and that is why the coalition leaders, who are already making plans to assume the presidency, want to prevent its establishment.
