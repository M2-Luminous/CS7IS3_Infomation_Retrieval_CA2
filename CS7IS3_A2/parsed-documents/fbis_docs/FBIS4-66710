India, in its first right of reply at the United Nations Human Rights Commission session here, said that the statement made by the leader of the Pakistani delegation, Mr. Iqbal Akhund regarding the self-determination of the Kashmiri people is "neither justified nor factual." The former foreign secretary and envoy, Mr. T.N. Kaul, who exercised the right to reply said that Mr. Akhund's statement more closely reflected the "condition of people living in Pakistan occupied Kashmir and the northern territories where free and fair elections have not been held so far, where fundamental freedoms are suppressed ruthlessly." "Even inside Pakistan, atrocities committed by Pakistani army and security forces in Sindh, Baluchistan, and the Frontier Provinces are well known," he said while objecting to Pakistan internationalising bilateral problems thereby making a solution more difficult. Referring to the Shimla agreement signed when he was foreign secretary, Mr. Kaul said that what Pakistan was doing for the last four years was a blatant violation of this pact. It had set up training bases in PoK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir] and in Pakistan itself for militants armed and financed and guided to commit acts of sabotage, subversion, loot and arson in both Punjab and J and K. "They have failed in Punjab and are failing in Jammu and Kashmir also. Hence, their attempt to internationalise the issue," he added. Stating that he was born and brought up in Kashmir, unlike Mr. Iqbal Akhund, and some who did not even speak the Kashmiri language but claimed to be Kashmiris, Mr. Kaul rejected the accusation that "India's terrorism in Kashmir was supported by draconian laws." "When misguided youths and local insurgents are aided, abetted instigated by a neighbouring country to commit loot, arson, rape and murder and drive at the point of the gun, minorities and even Muslims who do not agree with them, from their hearths and homes, no government worth its salt can shirk its duty to protect the people against such acts," Mr. Kaul replied. Till the end of 1993, over 11,000 Kalashnikovs, 700 machine guns, 600 rocket launchers, 15,000 hand grenades besides wireless sets, rockets and a lot of ammunition and explosives had been captured, all supplied by the Pakistan ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence] to the insurgents, he said. A recently captured foreign mercenary admitted to having raped 85 women, all Muslims, as there were hardly any non-Muslim women left in the valley. Ms. Karen Parker of the International Educational Development, an NGO, demanded that, the promised plebiscite in Kashmir be conducted now so that the 40-year old UN resolution could be implemented. "The occupying power responds with the barrel of the gun, 600,000 strong, aimed at the Kashmiri people. Is this what the Commission means by democratic process?" she asked. The Kashmiris may not have oil, unlike Kuwait, but they had a passionate yearning for their promised plebiscite, she said. The NGOs from Pakistan who spoke on the subject were Dr. (Ms.) Attiya Inayatullah of the World Muslim Congress and Mr. Syed Nazir Gilani of the World Society of Victimology. Mr. Gilani said that "while armed separatists were said to be responsible for kidnapping and killing government officials as well as members of the paramilitary forces and civilians, serious concerns had also been expressed over a large number of killings by the Indian security forces. Victims of torture included policemen, he said. The UN had procrastinated in its will and India had frustrated every opportunity to investigate the breach of these violations, he said. Dr. Inayatullah, who has created some controversy because of her being chairman of the executive board of UNESCO as well as adopting the role of an NGO, relied on statistics provided by the All Parties Hurriyet Conference to depict the human rights situation in the Valley and called Dr. Farooq Abdullah a "quisling". In an oral intervention by International Pen, the world association of writers representing members in 87 countries, Ms. F. Assaad said that Pen did not condemn anti-terrorist legislation per se and indeed recognised that legal measures were by far the most effective instrument in the struggle against violent insurgency. However, it was concerned that such legislation often including clauses which could lead to violations of the rights of those not advocating violence. In India, TADA [Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act] contained clauses which penalised the right of freedom of expression. It stated that such acts included views through speech or any other media.
