The mechanism for accumulating and transmitting energy by rare earth metal ions and the fundamental properties of known ASL matrices activated with rare earth metal ions determine the lower density limit of power P[.sub]min[/] and its associated upper wavelength limit _l_[.sub]max[/] of transformed infra-red radiation. Visualizers and the luminophores used in them may be divided into three groups, depending on intended use and design. The simplest visualizer is intended for observations made with the naked eye of relatively weak infra-red sources (light emitting diodes, lasers), and it consists of an ordinary screen covered with a layer of ASL within which the entire infra-red transformation process takes place. Visualizers for ``weak'' fields (ï¿½10[.sup]- 2[/] watt per cm[.sup]2[/]) are capable of transforming IR-radiation of 1.1 mkm or greater into visual, such as objects viewed in a dark moon-less night. The spectral make up of this type of illumination is determined by the transmission lines of water vapor, one of which takes place in the 1.4-1.6 mkm range. These visualizers embody a hybrid-cascade layout which includes a screen having an ASL and a phototransformer. Here, the luminescent screen transforms the 1.4-1.6 lines into the shorter IR region of 0.8-1.1 mkm with the phototransformer performing the dual functions of intensifying and transforming the glow from the luminophore into illumination on the exit screen. The most promising trend in the development of antistokes infra-red visualizers with P[.sub]min[/] < 10[.sup]-2[/] watt per cm[.sup]2[/] and _l_[.sub]max[/] > 1.1 mkm may be realized under the conditions of a quantum counter in a parametric converter of the ``heterodyne'' type. Its operation is based on the properties of several ASL to increase the intensity of a spectral line in the presence of two other radiations, one of which has a long wavelength and serves as excitation source, while the other of another wavelength serves as a signal. Results obtained provide a basis for considering the second and third trends as the most promising for visualizers of weak and ultra-weak infra-red radiation in the 1-13 mkm range. Their realization requires the development of new, non-traditional methods and devices for parametric excitation, as well as the development of new classes of antistokes luminophores.
