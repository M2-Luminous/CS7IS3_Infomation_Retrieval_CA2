In their opinion, poverty in our country is escalating from a social problem into a political one: The lumpenization of society and the growth in irritation, dissatisfaction, and wounded dignity in a considerable section of the population which only recently was considered perfectly successful in terms of its standard of living do not lead to democracy but create preconditions for a new dictatorship. Duma Deputy Ella Pamfilova, former minister of social protection of the population, believes that the way out can be found by creating a long-term federal program to combat poverty. It must be based on the package of draft laws which specialists have already worked out: Deputies intend to submit it soon for examination by the State Duma. The first thing in this package must be a law on the minimum living wage, which should include criteria for assessing the standard of living and the minimum per capita provision, below which the state cannot allow itself to fall. Deputy Petr Shchelishch ("Yabloko") is convinced that poverty is not only a problem of the poor but a problem of the moral health of society. Since there are different paths to poverty (nowadays they depend not only on the person himself), the means of assisting the individual on the part of the state and society must also be different: from direct poverty benefits for those who cannot resolve this problem on their own to the creation of a system to support those who are in a position to create the basis of their prosperity by their own efforts (young families, people who have lost their job, etc.). For this it is necessary to reorient the state's system of priorities: Expenditure on "bread and shelter" must be the top priority. Without this it is impossible to transform society efficiently, since the growth of the "nouveau pauvre" section narrows the base of economic and political reforms. Problems of poverty -- above all, the question of the minimum living wage -- will today be the subject of parliamentary hearings in the State Duma organized on the initiative of the Committee on Labor and Social Support and of parliament's democratic factions. In their initiative the deputies of a democratic orientation proceed from the premise that further ignoring of social problems discredits not only the authorities implementing the reform in the country but also the reforms themselves.
