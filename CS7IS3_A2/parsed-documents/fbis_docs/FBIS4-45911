The news analyst says: The white paper on the development of a fast breeder reactor by the South Korean puppets, which was recently issued by the South Korean National Democratic Front, shows how desperately the South Korean puppets work to develop nuclear weapons. The South Korean puppets claim that the fast breeder reactor is the "most efficient source of energy" and its development is needed for "economic value." Their third-rate trick, however, cannot work. They are desperately working to develop this type of reactor because they scheme to produce large quantities of nuclear weapon- grade plutonium and increase the amount of its stockpiling through legitimate import of plutonium under the pretext of feeding the fast breeder reactor. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must close down the pressurized heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose reactor and immediately stop the development of a fast breeder reactor before it meets with a bitterer denunciation and rejection at home and abroad as a nuclear maniac.
