The statement reads in full: The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea The illegalities of the United States in violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and paralyzing the armistice supervisory mechanism have now reached the climax. The United States wrecked the third round of DPRK-USA talks when there emerged prospects of resolving satisfactorily the issues with respect to DPRK-USA relations, and now is massively deploying its Armed Forces on and around the Korean peninsula. Despite the unanimous opposition of our people and the world public, the United States has defiantly shipped "Patriot" new-type missiles into South Korea for their combat-ready deployment by the end of April, and reportedly intends to force the "Team Spirit '94" joint military exercises, a nuclear war game, in November this year. The United States has already beefed up its air fleet in South Korea with a squadron of "Apache" helicopters, and is reported to be planning to introduce various types of brigadesize combat armaments in the future. On the other hand, the U.S. Naval forces, which have clustered around the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, still stand by there, far from breaking up. Thus, the United States has revealed through its own actions that it has scrapped completely the Korean Armistice Agreement, which was signed by the United States in the name of the United Nations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The fundamental requirements for maintaining the armistice arrangement are non-introduction of any operational materiel from abroad and cessation of arms buildup on the Korean peninsula now in a state of cease-fire. This notwithstanding, the United States has unilaterally broken the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement all along ever since the very year when it signed the agreement of July 1953, and introduced into South Korea up-to-date military hardware, including over 1,000 nuclear weapons. It was at least for fear of a possible exposure of its intentional violations of the Korean Armistice Agreement that the United States had previously engaged in a camouflaged and clandestine introduction of an enormous quantity of its nuclear weapons and other armaments into South Korea, but these days the United States is shipping in and deploying its sophisticated missiles and combat technical equipment there openly and in broad daylight. This vividly shows that the United States has disowned the effectiveness of the Korean Armistice Agreement and ignores even its existence. Over the period of a little more than four decades, the United States has acted against its own obligations as the real party to the Armistice Agreement, not only violating and invalidating the provisions of the agreement systematically but also paralyzing the armistice supervisory mechanism. In the years that followed the conclusion of the Armistice Agreement, the United States violated the agreement. As its own violations of the agreement were detected and disclosed by the neutral nations inspection teams of the neutral nations supervisory commission, the United States unilaterally forced the inspection teams to withdraw from the United Nations command-controlled area in June 1956, although the inspection teams were established pursuant to Section C of the Article II of the Armistice Agreement. Moreover, the United States malfunctioned the armistice mechanism in March 1991 when it designated a South Korean Army "general" as the chief delegate of the United Nations command to the Military Armistice Commission, for which he is totally unqualified because of legal irrelevance of this action to the Armistice Agreement. Such unreasonable behaviour on the part of the United States has now turned the Korean Armistice Agreement into blank sheets of paper incapable of helping to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula and reduced the Military Armistice Commission to a de facto nominal and inoperative body in which its legitimate component parties have ceased to exist. So far, the United States has systematically undermined the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and is now threatening the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with force, while deploying its massive reinforcements on and around the Korean peninsula. Such actions only add greater clarity to the United States' ulterior intent to strangle the socialist countries in Asia, including the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The current reality is that while the United States is behaving itself unchallenged in shipping its Armed Forces and armaments into South Korea and in aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war at its discretion, the Armistice Agreement has proven itself so ineffective and helpless that it cannot play any role as an institutional mechanism established to prevent these actions. This situation poses a question of what are purposes the Armistice Agreement or armistice mechanism is intended to serve. It is quite natural that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will no longer entertain any expectations of the Korean Armistice Agreement and armistice mechanism, now that they have failed to live up to their responsibility for stabilizing the situation on the Korean peninsula and curbing military buildup there and they have been used for covering up the United States' policy of strangling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is only thanks to the patient and peace-loving policy and will of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that the armistice has so far stayed in place and peace has been maintained on the Korean peninsula. A number of complicated and acute problems, including the nuclear issue, have cropped up on the Korean peninsula today due to the continued existence of the armistice under which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States, the signatories to the Armistice Agreement, are the parties to hostilities. It is abnormal, on every account, that the state of ceasefire of the 1950s should have lasted unchanged for four decades up to date. All the developments on the Korean peninsula highlight the absolute necessity for establishing a peace arrangement, that will replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and substitute for the present armistice mechanism, with a view to achieving non-hostile relations and rapprochement between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States and to establishing genuine peace and security on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposes to the United States of America that the two countries hold negotiations for the establishment of a new peace arrangement which will help to prevent arms buildup or recurrence of war, stabilize the situation and reliably guarantee durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula on a practical basis. The United States must renounce its confrontation-oriented concept and war psychology and respond to the above peace proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
