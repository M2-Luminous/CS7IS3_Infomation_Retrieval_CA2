FR940627-0-00065 FR940627-0-00012 26 CFR Part 1 [TD 8548] RIN 1545&hyph;AR61 Qualified Separate Lines of Business AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains amendments to the final regulations under section 414(r) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provide that an employer may be treated as operating separate lines of business for purposes of applying the minimum coverage requirements of section 410(b) and the minimum participation requirements of section 401(a)(26). The regulations reflect the enactment of section 414(r) by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent changes made by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 and the Public Debt Limit Increase Act of 1989. The regulations provide guidance necessary to comply with the law and affect sponsors of and participants in tax-qualified retirement plans and certain other employee benefit plans. DATES: These regulations are effective January 1, 1994. The regulations apply to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, except as provided in the transition rules of ยง1.414(r)&hyph;1(d)(9).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Proposed regulations under section 414(r) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) were published in the Federal Register on February 1, 1991 (56 FR 3988). Written comments were received from the public on the proposed regulations. In addition, a public hearing on the proposed regulations was held on May 16, 1991. After consideration of all the written comments received and the statements made at the public hearing, the proposed regulations under section 414(r) were adopted, as modified, by final regulations (TD 8376) published in the Federal Register on December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63420). On August 10, 1992, proposed regulations were published in the Federal Register (57 FR 35536) to extend the effective date of the final regulations under section 414(r) (and related regulations), generally to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994. On September 7, 1993, proposed regulations amending the final regulations under sections 414(r) and 410(b) were published in the Federal Register (58 FR 47090). Written comments were received from the public on the proposed regulations, and a public hearing was held on November 10, 1993. After consideration of all the written comments received and the statements made at the public hearing, these regulations are adopted as modified by this Treasury decision. Temporary regulations (TD 8173) and proposed regulations under section 414(q) of the Code (relating to the definition of highly compensated employee) were published in the Federal Register on February 19, 1988 (53 FR 4965 and 4999). In conjunction with the February 1991 proposed regulations under section 414(r), amendments to the temporary regulations (TD 8334) and proposed regulations under section 414(q) were published in the Federal Register on February 1, 1991 (56 FR 3976 and 4023). The amendments related to the employee exclusions for purposes of satisfying the 50-employee requirement for a separate line of business under section 414(r)(2)(A) of the Code. Under section 7805(e)(2) of the Code, the February 1991 amendments to the temporary regulations under section 414(q) expired after three years (January 31, 1994). In order to retain the application of those rules, the February 1991 proposed regulations under section 414(q) are adopted by this Treasury decision. Explanation of Provisions 1. Overview In general, all employees of a single employer, determined under section 414 of the Code, are taken into account for purposes of applying the minimum coverage requirements of section 410(b) and the minimum participation requirements of section 401(a)(26) to a qualified plan. Section 410(b)(5) provides an exception if an employer operates qualified separate lines of business under section 414(r). If the employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business, section 410(b)(5) generally permits the employer to apply the minimum coverage requirements separately with respect to the employees of each qualified separate line of business. A similar exception is provided for purposes of applying the minimum participation requirements of section 401(a)(26) and the 55-percent average benefits test of section 129(d)(8). An employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business if (1) the employer designates its lines of business by reference to the property or services provided by each line, (2) each line of business is organized and operated separately from the remainder of the employer, and (3) each of these separate lines of business meets additional statutory requirements (including administrative scrutiny) and thus constitutes a qualified separate line of business. Each employee of an employer that operates qualified separate lines of business is assigned to a particular line of business for purposes of nondiscrimination testing. The September 1993 proposed regulations amend the final regulations under section 414(r) generally to address issues raised since the publication of the final regulations. The proposed regulations include the following major changes: _Allowing an employee to be treated as a substantial-service employee with respect to a line of business if at least 50 percent of the employee's services are provided to that line. _Applying the separate management and separate workforce tests to a line of business without regard to substantial-service employees of other lines. _Excluding nonresident aliens in applying the separate management and separate workforce tests. _Expanding the special rules for vertically integrated lines of business and transferred employees. _Increasing access to individual determinations under administrative scrutiny. _Clarifying the treatment of employees who change from one disaggregation population to another.
