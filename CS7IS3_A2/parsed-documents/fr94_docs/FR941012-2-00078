FR941012-2-00078 FR941012-2-00052 In rehabilitation, there is programmatic interest in clinical research and clinical trials on improved approaches to comprehensive rehabilitation. This includes research directed towards minimizing the secondary complications of injury including pressure sores, contracture, muscular atrophy, skeletal deformity and other definable conditions. This research should cover methods of their prevention and take into account the injured person's need for education to prevent recurrent medical problems and the role of the family in preventing secondary conditions. Population-based and longitudinal studies are needed to better establish the prognoses and rehabilitation needs of patients with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, burns, and severe sensory loss. In biomechanics, there is special programmatic interest in brain and spinal cord injury. This interest includes the biomechanical evaluation of intervention concepts and strategies (e.g., bike helmets, energy absorbing playground surfaces, hip pads, motor vehicle side impact and rollover countermeasures, etc.), development of models to elucidate injury physiology and pharmacologic, surgical and other interventions; defining human tolerance limits for injury among children, women, the chronically ill and older persons; improvements in injury assessment technology; and understanding impact injury mechanisms and quantifying injury-related biomechanical responses for critical areas of the human body (e.g., brain and vertebral injury with spinal cord involvement). Consideration will also be given to the biomechanics of thoracic and abdominal viscera, musculature and joints including the articular cartilage, tendons and ligaments. In epidemiology, there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks of injury which might lead to new or more effective interventions. Also of interest is epidemiologic research having as its focus the development of improved methods and the evaluation and improvement of injury surveillance systems. Research is needed that more accurately defines the cost of unintentional injury and the cost effectiveness or prevention effectiveness of interventions. Cost analysis should be included in the plans, where appropriate, to evaluate an intervention(s) pertinent to one of the topics previously outlined under prevention, acute care, rehabilitation, biomechanics, etc. A more complete discussion of methodologies for assessing cost analysis is presented in, A Framework for Assessing the Effectiveness of Disease and Injury Prevention, (CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, March 27, 1992, Volume 41, Number RR&hyph;3, pages 5&hyph;11). (To receive information on these reports see the section Where to Obtain Additional Information.) Evaluation Criteria Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed by CDC staff for completeness and responsiveness as outlined under the previous heading, Program Requirements (A&hyph;F). Incomplete applications and applications that are not responsive will be returned to the applicant without further consideration. Applications which are complete and responsive may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by a peer review group to determine if the application is of sufficient technical and scientific merit to warrant further review (triage); the CDC will withdraw from further consideration applications judged to be noncompetitive and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and the official signing for the applicant organization. Those applications judged to be competitive will be further evaluated by a dual review process. Awards will be made based on priority score ranking by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC), programmatic priorities and needs by the Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control, and the availability of funds. A. The first review will be a peer review conducted by the IRGRC on all applications. Factors to be considered will include: 1. The specific aims of the research project, i.e., the broad longterm objectives, the intended accomplishment of the specific research proposal, and the hypothesis to be tested;
