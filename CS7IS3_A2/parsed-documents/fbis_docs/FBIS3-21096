O.: Network Interconnections: Cisco-IBM Agreement"] [Text] Cisco is offering an IBM channel attachment card for its Model 7000 router, that includes emulation of the 3172 network controller. Developed together with IBM's Mainframes Division, this card together with the 7000 router eliminates the need for a 3745 front-end computer, the operating cost of which still brings shudders to the users of the 50,000 type 3270 systems in service throughout the world. The new Cisco card is immediately available and is expected to improve routing performance--between a TCP/IP network and [IBM's] SNA [Systems Network Architecture] protocol, for example--but still without providing SNA type PU 4 routing, which the 3745 is equipped to do. This function will become available only with support of APPN's, expected by the end of next year on the 7000. This apparent allegiance on the part of IBM (if one considers that it could be prejudicing the success of its own routers) is backed by an agreement between Cisco and IBM's Maintenance Division providing for the installation of routers equipped in the United States. This agreement, which is to take on worldwide scoop very soon, will constitute a not inconsequential trump card for Cisco in the duel to the bitter end that its 7000 router is waging against Wellfleet's Backbone Node. This is not the first time that a supplier of routers has offered a direct "attachment" to an IBM mainframe. Network Systems has been offering one on its Model 6800 for the past six months. But it is the first time that IBM has manufactured an Escon card (136 Mbits/sec fiber-optic link) in cooperation with one of its most direct competitors in the routing sector. Marc Essinger, of IBM's Communications Service, says it is in keeping with Big Blue's most recent decisions, and that it means: "Furnishing an immediate solution to its clients, even if it appears, a priori, to prejudice the company's own interests." Two suppliers of concentrators--Cabletron and Chipcom--are also expected to announce "channel" links to improve the offering of mainframe/local network connections. Chipcom supplies the basic components of IBM's 8750 router.
