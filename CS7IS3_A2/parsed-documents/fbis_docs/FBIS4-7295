The fighting near the Thai border district of Aranyaprathet, Sakaeo Province, has resulted in a number of artillery shells falling on Thai territory and caused damage to the lives and property of Thai people living along the border. More than 30,000 Cambodians have fled across the border into Thai territory. The senior Thai military official reported that the Khmer Rouge have seized part of the area of Km 12 of the Poipet-Sisophon Road, which is a major transport route. Their actions are aimed at blocking the Cambodian Government's troop reinforcements, who seek to wipe out Khmer Rouge forces and also Phnum Malai which serves as a Khmer Rouge major stronghold. This road is also an important route for the transport of various kinds of goods from Thailand to Cambodia. With the seizure by the Khmer Rouge, the route has been cut and this will cause great difficulties for the Cambodian Government and people. The Thai people living along the border in Aranyaprathet District, Sakaeo Province are advised to be cautious regarding possible dangers caused by the fighting between the two Cambodian factions and always to follow closely and listen to warnings from Thai military authorities.
