Mr. Kranidhiotis also answered a series of questions from the foreign European Parliament deputies. This was the first official briefing of the European Parliament on the Greek presidency's program. In his address, Mr. Kranidhiotis presented the general guidelines of the program on joint foreign policy and security of the European Union [EU]. Concerning the Community's expansion, Mr. Kranidhiotis stressed that the Greek presidency will pursue the conclusion of negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway by 1 March, while also promoting the accession of Cyprus and Malta. Referring to the Cyprus issue, he noted the important decision by the Council on the appointment of an observer, who will be briefing the Council on the development of the intercommunal talks in New York. He also informed the Commission members that a meeting on the EU-Cyprus association will be held in Brussels in May. Mr. Kranidhiotis then referred to the EU's joint action in foreign policy issues and pointed out that the presidency will primarily deal with former Yugoslavia and the effective promotion of humanitarian aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He then answered questions from foreign Eurodeputies on the situation in Bosnia, the Palestinian issue, and Skopje. Responding to a question on Skopje from a Dutch deputy, who alleged that Greece has proceeded with a de facto closure of its borders with that republic, Mr. Kranidhitios categorically denied this allegation, stressing that most of Skopeje's imports come through Greece, including 80-85 percent of its oil. Concluding this issue, Mr. Kranidhiotis reiterated the well-known Greek positions on Skopje and stressed that, in addition to the well-known issue of the name, we expect from Skopje a series of moves such as the abolition of the Greek emblems and the amendment of the preamble to the constitution, which implies clear irredentist and expansionist intentions.
