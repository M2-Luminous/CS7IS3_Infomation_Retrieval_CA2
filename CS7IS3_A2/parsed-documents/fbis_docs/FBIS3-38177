Ciller's remarks, carried by the press, once again confirm that this lady does not understand the cybernetics of her own country and that we will all have to endure this unfortunate period in Turkish political history for the time being until she is forced out of power one way or another. Ciller told her journalist friends that the people of Istanbul would not vote for the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (Refah Partisi-RP). If she is really sincere in this belief then we can only shudder at this revelation of her ignorance of the realities of Turkey. Is Ciller aware that those people she said would not vote for the Welfare Party actually elected four pro-Islamic mayors in districts of Istanbul in the local elections held in only six districts in 1992? Is Ciller aware that public opinion polls show the RP running neck and neck with the Motherland Party and her own DYP in the public opinions polls for Istanbul? Is Ciller also aware that her gross mistakes and incompetence have disenchanted the masses and people are turning their backs on the DYP? Many conservative people who used to vote for the DYP are now voicing deep disappointment and say they will neither vote for this party nor for the Motherland. Some say they are undecided on who else to vote for, while some openly say they will vote for the RP. Did Ciller ever stop to think when the successful DYP Istanbul district Mayor Gulay Atig quit the party and joined the rival Motherland? The RP is being promoted as a "clean and honest" party in the midst of all the corruption and adversities displayed by the DYP and Motherland, but it seems Ciller, living in her own dream world, hardly realizes this. People are still talking about rumors of the windfall profits made by some people close to Ciller during the recent foreign currency crisis... Is the prime minister aware that while her top aides are trying to put on a brave face in public, they are all privately saying Ciller and the government is now in a hopeless state and that things are getting worse? Ciller may be in a daydream, but we feel it is time the administrators of the DYP distanced themselves from her hallucinations and started taking measures to avoid a disaster in the upcoming local elections.
