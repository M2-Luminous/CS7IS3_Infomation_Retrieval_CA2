FR940610-2-00177 FR940610-2-00090 Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee; Transport Airplane and Engine Issues AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of new task assignments for the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee. SUMMARY: Notice is given of new task assignments for the Loads and Dynamics Harmonization Working Group of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC). This notice informs the public of the activities of the ARAC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael H. Borfitz, Assistant Executive Director, Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee, Transport Airplane and Engine Issues, FAA Engine & Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7110, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 22, 1991 (56 FR 2190), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC). The committee provides advice and recommendations to the FAA Administrator, through the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification, on the full range of the FAA's rulemaking activities with respect to aviation-related issues.. In order to develop such advice and recommendations, the ARAC may choose to establish working groups to which specific tasks are assigned. Such working groups are comprised of experts from those organizations having an interest in the assigned tasks. A working group member need not be a representative of the full committee. One of the working groups established by the ARAC is the Loads and Dynamics Harmonization Working Group. The FAA announced at the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA)-Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Harmonization Conference in Toronto, Canada June 2&hyph;5, 1992, that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing objective to ``harmonize'' the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) and the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Tasks The Loads and Dynamics Harmonization Working Group's tasks are as follows: Task 1_Interaction of Systems and Structure: Review existing special conditions for fly-by-wire airplanes and existing requirements for control systems, including automatic and/or power-operated systems, and recommend to the ARAC any new revised general requirements needed for flight control systems and structures affected by those systems (§§25.302, 25.671, 25.1329, part 25 appendix K). Task 2_Continuous Turbulence Loads: Review the requirement for the continuous turbulence standard in light of the ARAC proposal for a tuned discrete gust requirement in order to determine whether the continuous turbulence requirement should be revised or removed from the FAR/JAR for better consistency with the new proposed tuned discrete gust criteria (§25.305(d)). Task 3_Strength and Deformation: Review the recent requirements adopted in the FAR by Amendment 25&hyph;77 (for the design of transport airplanes against buffet and forced structural vibrations) and consider appropriate changes for the JAR and FAR to harmonize these rules (§§25.305 (e) and (f)). Task 4_Design Flap Speeds: Review the current flap design loads requirements to resolve differences in interpretation between the FAA and JAA concerning the structural design stall speeds on which the flap design speeds are based. Recent measurements of gust speeds at low altitudes, where flaps are normally extended, indicate a more severe gust environment may be present. Review all aspects of the flap design load requirements, including the design airspeeds, vertical and head-on design gust criteria, and the effects of automatic retraction and load relief systems (§25.335(e)). Task 5_Residual Strength Loads for Damage Tolerance: Review the differences in residual strength design load requirements between the FAR and JAR and resolve differences to harmonize this rule. Prepare a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or make recommendations to other ARAC efforts concerning FAR §25.571, so that they can be included in rulemaking that may be forthcoming from those efforts (§25.571(b)). Task 6_Shock Absorption Tests: Review the changes recently introduced into the JAR that have resulted in differences between the FAR and JAR in regard to the requirement for shock absorption tests. Review those changes in view of harmonizing the FAR and JAR (§25.723(a)). Task 7_Rough Air Speed: The ARAC has proposed a new §25.1517 concerning rough air speed design standards in its proposal for a tuned discrete gust requirement. This action is harmonized with the current JAR 25.1517; however, further changes in the rough air speed requirement may be needed in both the FAR and JAR. Review JAR 25.1517 and the new proposed FAR 25.1517 to determine if further changes are needed. If so, prepare a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or, if possible, combine these changes with other rulemaking efforts (§25.1517). Task 8_Taxi, Takeoff, and Landing Roll: Prepare an advisory circular that establishes criteria that may be used to calculate rough runway and taxiway loads, as required by §§25.491, 25.235, and 25.305.
