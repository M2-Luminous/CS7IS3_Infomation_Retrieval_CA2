"If there is no resignation by the prime minister, if there is no confidence vote, and if no censure motion is submitted," the IU coordinator general said, "let the Spanish people pass sentence 12 June and say who should carry it out." In a tough but calm tone, for which Felipe Gonzalez gave thanks, following the tension of the debate with Aznar, the IU leader reiterated the reasons for demanding Gonzalez' resignation, "and in this order": unemployment, the destruction of the industrial fabric, an antisocial policy unparalleled throughout Europe, because he is the person responsible for the advance of not only the social but also the ideological right, and because he has encouraged an economic policy that facilitates corruption. Anguita devoted part of his speech to explaining the need for Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra to appear before the Roldan committee, as being jointly responsible for the former Civil Guard director general's appointment, and to demanding that he, too, accept his responsibility by tendering his resignation. Responding to Aznar's assertions that he cannot submit a censure motion because he does not have any political group's support, Anguita asserted that if the IU had a sufficient number of deputies to use this procedure, it would do so, as Felipe Gonzalez did when Suarez was prime minister, "while knowing that we would lose it, because it is no use making empty threats." He therefore regretted that the People's Party "did not submit a censure motion in order to listen to another government program." He reiterated the demand for Gonzalez' resignation "for the sake of stability," "because I do not understand the Caesarism of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], which bases political stability on one person," and he asserted that if Gonzalez were replaced by another Socialist, the IU "would listen to the program and go all out for him if he changed policy." Anguita demanded that Gonzalez undergo a confidence vote so that "the nationalists will say in parliament what you say they told you over the telephone, and thus we will know who is who." If none of this happens, he believes that an election will have to be called, since what is not possible is for everything to continue as hitherto, with the series of resignations, Luis Roldan's escape, and the jailing of [former Bank of Spain Governor] Mariano Rubio, since, he stated, if all this has happened without anybody's being aware, "the whole ministerial bench would have to go, but not because of joint responsibility but because of ineptitude."
