The deliberations began after the ruling coalition and opposition parties agreed to accept Committee Chairman Kichio Inoue's compromise proposal to the Liberal Democratic Party's demand to summon a former lawyer for Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist sect that backs Komeito. Both sides agreed to Inoue's proposal to start debate on the stopgap budget and then conclude the issue of Diet testimony by the time the upper house starts discussions on the full state budget for the current fiscal year, which began April 1. The LDP is demanding that Masatomo Yamazaki, a former legal adviser to the Buddhist sect, testify before the committee over relations between Komeito and the politically active Buddhist organization. The ruling coalition, which includes Komeito, is opposed to the demand. In the committee session, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, in response to questions by an LDP lawmaker on a controversial news report, denied he brought a letter from Soka Gakkai head Daisaku Ikeda to the Pope during his recent European tour. Hata said he believes that Komeito is independent of Soka Gakkai's religious teachings or activities. Komeito is a key component of the minority coalition that backs the Hata administration. Friday's agreement to discuss supplementation of the provisional budget came just before the stopgap budget was to expire Friday. The Diet has yet to start debate on the full budget for the current fiscal year due to political turmoil over former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's shady financial dealings, which forced him to resign on April 8. During the agenda-setting meeting for the committee, the LDP accused the coalition of "abnormal handling" of Diet business that caused the delay.
