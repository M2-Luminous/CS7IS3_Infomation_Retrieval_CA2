On 5 January a reporter from the Voice of the Great Somali People who witnessed the incident said that while the Pakistani troops were dumping the refuse, the residents of the area attempted to stop them from causing environmental damage. The Pakistani troops answered the civilians by opening fire with automatic weapons, wounding three persons -- a woman and two children. Also, showing the declared hatred of the Somali people by UNOSOM troops -- and especially the U.S. Forces -- yesterday U.S. Forces fired on a Somali who was passing by the American Embassy -- the innocent and defenseless Somali man died on the spot.
