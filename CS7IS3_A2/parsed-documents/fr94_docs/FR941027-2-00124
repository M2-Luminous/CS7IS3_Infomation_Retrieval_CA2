FR941027-2-00124 FR941027-2-00075 Principal Findings •A review of GM submissions, as well as ODI testing, indicates that there are no data on which to conclude that the GM trucks to which FMVSS No. 301 applied, when new, did not comply with the standard. •There are no data to indicate a relationship between fuel tank corrosion and increased fire risk in the subject vehicles, either in side impacts or in non-crash incidents. •Apart from the basic decision to locate the fuel tanks of the subject vehicles outside of the frame rails, many of the specific features of the design of the fuel storage system and the surrounding area have increased the likelihood of post-crash fuel fires in the subject vehicles. •Based on a review of 1979&hyph;1993 accident data reflecting the performance of full-sized pickups in side-impact fatal crashes involving fire, occupants of the subject vehicles experienced 2.8 times as many fire-related fatalities (i.e., fatalities in crashes in which a fire occurred) per million registered vehicle-years as occupants of Ford pickups and 2.5 times as many as occupants of Dodge pickups. Where the FARS code indicated that the most harmful event (MHE) of the crash was fire, the GM-to-Ford occupant fatality per million registered vehicle-years ratio is 3.4 to 1, and the GM-to-Dodge ratio is 6.1 to 1. •Real-world accidents data do not support GM's contention that GM and Ford pickup trucks have comparable side-impact fire performance and that differences in driver demographics and driver behavior explain the difference in the rates of fire-related and MHE-fire fatalities in side-impact crashes for the GM and Ford pickups. This is demonstrated by the tremendous reduction in the rate of MHE-fire side-impact fatalities that occurred after GM moved the fuel tanks for these pickups inside the frame rails in model year 1988. •Contrary to GM's contentions, the MHE coding in FARS is a reliable indicator of the number of fatalities actually caused by fire. •FARS data indicate that, if past trends continue, there would be approximately five additional fatalities due to fire in side-impact crashes in 1994 compared to what would occur if the subject vehicles had the same side-impact fire performance as Ford full-sized pickups. •Reports of non-fatal burn injuries indicate that, if past trends continue, there would be three to four additional non-fatal burn injuries in 1994 in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles compared to the Ford pickups. •Laboratory crash data indicate that, at certain impact speeds and configurations, the subject vehicles will leak fuel in side impacts, while comparable Ford pickups will not. •While the crash severities in fatal side-impact, fire-involved crashes involving the subject vehicles are far in excess of the severity specified in FMVSS No. 301, they are generally less than the severities that result in fires in fatal side-impact crashes involving the Ford pickups. •GM was aware at the time it designed the subject vehicles in the early 1970s that side-mounted fuel tank design presented an increased risk of post-crash fuel fed fires in side impacts, compared to the risk associated with other feasible alternative designs. Moreover, GM obtained additional information demonstrating the increased risk associated with the side-mounted tanks during the 15-year period the subject vehicles were in production. Principal Conclusions •The increased risk of death and injury from fire in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles is a result of the design of their fuel storage system, primarily the location of the fuel tanks outside of the frame rails, supplemented by other features of the design. •Given the state of the art at the time and GM's awareness of the likely consequences, it was unreasonable for GM to design the subject vehicles with fuel tanks outside the frame rails.
