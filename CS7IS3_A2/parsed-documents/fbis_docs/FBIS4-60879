Kondulukov; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Excerpts] Today veterans of the Communist demonstrations and battles at Ostankino and the White House are marking May Day. Representatives of the Russian Communist Workers' Party and the liberal patriotic party Rebirth, as well as the All-Union Communist Bolshevik Party, Working Russia, the Komsomol, and generally all shades of the communist spectrum have gathered by the giant Lenin monument on Oktyabrskaya Square. [passage omitted] The untiring propagandist Viktor Anpilov called on those assembled to prepare for a political strike and to join the ranks of the Russian Communist Workers' Party, which is already beginning to compile lists of people's presidential candidates. Every opposition candidate will have to make three basic promises: To abolish mayors, to legalize Soviet power, and to return to the people what has been stolen from them -- land, factories, and currency accounts. [Begin Anpilov recording, addressing rally] We did not want a war in 1993. But we will fight on to eventual victory, and stop the hated regime that is carrying out the forcible capitalization of our country, comrades. [end recording] Anpilov does not intend to adopt peaceful proposals. In his words, the main condition for civic peace is the resignation of Yeltsin and the capitalist government. Yes, today the Communists are demanding a lot -- the cancellation of the results of the December referendum, a change of government, the elimination of the post of president, power for the Soviets, and the restoration of the Soviet Union. In order to achieve this, the Communists are determined to expand their ranks, and that is their main task today. As one of the Russian Communist Workers' Party leaders said, that means more leaflets, more words, and more propaganda work in factory shops and on the trolleybuses.
