Establishing the level of oil production ceiling in the third quarter of the current Christian year in view of market conditions, electing a new secretary general, and deciding to change the location of the OPEC secretariat are among the main topics of the discussions of OPEC's 96th session. It should be mentioned that in the last session of the oil ministers which was held in the month of Farvardin [March-April] of the current year the level of OPEC production was established at 24.520 million barrels per day. In the past two month, as a result of the commitment shown by the members to the fixed quotas and of the emergence of signs of improvement in the world economy, a new round was created to increase the price of oil. It was thus that the OPEC oil marker price reached $16. Although the price sought by OPEC for its marker price was determined at $21 per barrel and the organization still has a long way to go to reach its target, the existing climate at OPEC's 96th session manifests the willingness of all the members to maintain the present production ceiling. Despite the fact that the demand for oil has overtaken its supply and despite the increasing prices, OPEC's still aims to control the level of production. In the viewpoint of economic experts, the fluctuations in the oil prices have a very important effect on the development plans of the members of OPEC. These countries are mainly dependent on oil income and even a dollar reduction in the oil price will reduce the income of the member countries by $9 billion. Therefore, under the present situation, where it seems that members of OPEC are united in their view in protecting the production ceiling despite the oil demand and economic problems of the member countries, this hope will be created that once again OPEC, which has passed through three decades of experiences and ups and downs, will find its true position and authority in the international economic arena. In the opinion of experts on oil issues, protecting the production ceiling of 24.5 million barrels per day, taking into account this prediction that demand will reach 26 million barrels per day during the 3rd and 4th quarter of the current Christian year, facilitates the process of achieving higher prices. However, the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has always strived to establish a just price for oil, supports any action that will lead to an increase in the oil price and gives authority to OPEC and believes that protecting the regular flow of oil supply to the world economy depends on stable prices. Such an aim will guarantee the interests of producers and consumers alike.
