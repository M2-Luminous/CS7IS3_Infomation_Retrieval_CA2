"I will not take this step until I judge government policy in the credit and monetary sphere to have changed so much as to constitute the end of reforms." According to Boris Fedorov, one such indicator for him might be a considerable increase in the ceiling on the issue of credit in the first quarter of 1994. "If under pressure from all manner of lobbies the government issues over 10 trillion rubles in Central Bank credit, there can be no question of any financial stabilization," the minister believes. In Fedorov's opinion, what is now being observed on the money market is quite natural. "We are on the verge of a change of economic policy and the money market is responding appropriately to this." Boris Fedorov does not believe that he set the prime minister "deliberately unacceptable terms" in demanding that Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Viktor Gerashchenko be removed from government. "We are talking about the country's future, about what the government's strategic course will be, and how it will affect millions of Russian citizens. I can only be accountable for that which has been entrusted to me if I have a chance of influencing it."
