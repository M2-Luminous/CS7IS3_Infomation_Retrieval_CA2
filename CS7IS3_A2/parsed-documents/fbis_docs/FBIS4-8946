[Perisic] The shelling of the Serbian territory near Gorazde by NATO is certainly complicating the military-political situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Besides, such an action by the NATO air-force can undoubtedly result in immense consequences for peace in the Balkans and in Europe. In the case of further air-strikes on Serbian territory, the danger of the war escalating to an uncontrollable level will increase. Which is to say, this act encourages the supporters of the war option, which makes all those who have peace at their heart very worried. I want to emphasize particularly that it is an act of aggression against the Serbian people, which has a legitimate and natural right to self-defense, guaranteed by the UN Charter. The Yugoslav Army is following the development of the situation that has come about after the NATO bombardment continuously and with the greatest attention. Consequently, we are undertaking all necessary measures to protect the territorial integrity of our country. In the case of a possible major violation of the FRY's air-space, the army will implement the course of action anticipated in the case of its combat deployment. [Lazanski] What phase of the transformation is the Yugoslav Army going through at the moment? [Perisic] The process of the army's transformation is based on the transfer of the authority in the matters of defense to the state, on a new military doctrine, and changes in the normative-legal regulations. The command posts and units have been more rationally organized, and many staff changes have been made. Effectiveness in command and security in the rear echelons have been increased. The army is now in the final phase of the process of depolitization and professionalization. In that context, the curriculums in the system of education and training in the Yugoslav Army have also been changed. Now, the staff is employed according to the new formation-organizational patterns. The replacement of the old insignia with the new ones is underway. All in all, during the past two years, the changes starting from the concept of defense to the visual symbols of the Yugoslav Army have already been made. In the oncoming period, the units within the corps will be reorganized in accordance with the new demands that have been imposed on the Yugoslav Army regarding the country's defense. Consequently, we shall modernize the command posts and units by providing them with new sorts of armament. We believe that the transformation of the army, generally seen, is going on in compliance with the economic potentials of the FRY and the planned spirit. [Lazanski] Are you satisfied with the army budget that was adopted recently? [Perisic] The resources apportioned from the federal budget for the financing of the Yugoslav Army in 1994 amount to 43 percent of the estimated GNP. The means that have been approved, provided that the Yugoslav Army gets the real value, will enable us to meet some 57 percent of the estimated needs in 1994. While estimating the total of the funds foreseen for the federal budget, starting from the adopted economic policy for 1994, the Program of Reconstruction of the Monetary System, and other measures of the recuperation of the country, the Federal Government could not provide the proposed level of funds, so it had to cut it by half. Regarding the difficult economic situation in the country, and the measures that are undertaken for its recuperation, we have accepted the aforementioned percentage as a necessity in the current circumstances. Therefore, we have been forced to make great cuts in the development, and to postpone some aspects of the transformation program until later. In general, however, we are not satisfied with the inflow of resources in the federal budget cash-box. In the first three months of this year, the army was allotted 51 percent of the planned amount for that period. At the moment, we owe some 50 million dinars to the army suppliers. Therefore we have great problems getting regular food supplies, with the maintenance of equipment, and the disbursement of salaries. Many firms, the army's traditional partners, have been in an extremely difficult financial situation because of our debts. In such difficult circumstances, in the command posts, units, and army institutions, certain planned measures have been undertaken, aimed at the rationalization of the utilization, and the maximal economizing of the material-technical and financial means. Compared with other countries in the world, we spend considerably less money per soldier. For instance, in other countries the costs per soldier in U.S. dollars are as follows: Italy -- $47,881; Belgium -- $38,555; Austria -- $31,923; Greece -- $27,683; Hungary -- $14,358; Bulgaria -- $11,028, Turkey -- $8,923; and the FRY -- $5,500. We are doing everything we can to prevent such a difficult economic situation from considerably affecting the country's security. New Concept of Defense [Lazanski] What will be the priorities of such a military budget? [Perisic] Differing from earlier years, when the army budget was allotted as a single amount, this year, following the proposal by the Assembly deputies, the budget for the Yugoslav Army in 1994 has been apportioned according to the particular purposes, that is, planned commitments. Thereby the priorities have already been established. Keeping this in mind, and also the fact that the funds are insufficient, I would point out only some of the priorities: Covering the expenses that considerably influence army readiness, the payment of running expenses for food, clothes, energy, and the renewal of material reserves. Despite the existence of objective difficulties in society and the lack of necessary financial means, we are endeavoring to keep up the necessary technological-technical level of providing the army with armament and military equipment. In addition, particular attention is paid to the Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defense [RVPVO], and other systems. [Lazanski] What is the doctrinal approach to the defense of the country like now? [Perisic] The basic goal of the FRY is to secure the existential survival of the Serbian and Montenegrin people, as well as of all other citizens, and the entire civilizational development of society. From this basic goal all other goals, like national, political, economic, defense, and similar goals, are derived. The basic political and doctrinal determinations are: First, the protection and defense of the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the FRY from all forms of outside aggression; Second, the betterment of the defense ability of the society, and the protection of peace on the state borders; Third, planned and organizational preparations aimed at the effective functioning of the defense system in all conditions; Fourth, the defense of the country is a vital function of the state and society, that is to say, a duty and right of all citizens and institutions that are organized as a unique and effective system; Fifth, the repulsion of any form of armed aggression against the country; Sixth, the FRY does not identify any country as its enemy in advance, but rather intercedes for the establishment and maintenance of peace and security in the neighboring countries, Europe, and world in order to make possible equal cooperation among different countries; Seventh, in the case of armed aggression against the FRY, the Yugoslav Army and society in general would withstand it by using any means, until the final defeat of the aggressor is accomplished. The new concept is characterized by the nationalization, rather than the socialization of the defense system. While making a choice between certain forms of military organization, we chose a smaller, highly professional, mobile army in peacetime that is capable of preventing any kind of surprise, and of creating conditions for the development of a mass army trained and determined to wage a war in any conditions, until the final victory. [Lazanski] In which way does the Yugoslav Army intend to school young people now, and thereby to obtain reserve officers? [Perisic] Since September 1991, the schools for the education of reserve officers have been closed down. However, the role of the reserve army staff is derived from the military doctrine and the concept of defense of the FRY, so that we shall soon begin with the fulfillment of those demands of defense. With the Bill on Military Schools and Army's Scientific-Research Institutions, a new system of educating the cadre is founded. The future reserve army staff will be composed of the people educated in the schools for reserve officers, of conscripts that have already served in the army, but whose skills are of particular interest to the Yugoslav Army -- perhaps some additional schooling or specialization will be necessary afterwards -- then also of the people who are employed in the army under two-year contracts and who have acquired certain skills of particular interest to the Yugoslav Army and also of the active army personnel that will be transferred to the reserve, regarding their own desires or the army's needs. The schools for reserve officers will admit mostly candidates who already have a university degree. Military Alliances [Lazanski] Is the military top brass aware of the military alliances that are being formed around our country, and that they may be dangerous for the FRY? [Perisic] With respect to the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], which was a non-aligned country, the military and political position of the FRY has been changed. Our incipient stance is that the defense of our country may be organized and carried out according to the following possibilities: A defense without allies, a defense with potential allies, a defense relying upon subsequent allies, and a defense with clearly defined allies. In that sense, the choice of allies and models of defense is taken by the government. In the circumstances of a blockade, the possibility of joining military alliances is excluded. We are not interested in entering aggressive military alliances. In peacetime we do not consider joining military alliances, because, in our opinion, there are no particular reasons for that. The FRY would enter a military alliance with those countries that are not aggressors, that have been attacked, or whose vital interests are endangered. We base any prospects for a military alliance on the congruence of strategic and political interests. Rather than believing that a military alliance provides a greater degree of security, or of defense potential, we feel that one's own independence and sovereignty may be endangered through such alliances. The Yugoslav Army attentively follows the developments in Europe and in the world, and particularly those in our direct neighborhood, in order to be able to undertake necessary measures in the organization of the defense system and the prevention of possible surprises. [Lazanski] To what extent is the Partnership for Peace program attractive to the Yugoslav Army, and to what extent is it a serious military challenge and threat? [Perisic] The Yugoslav Army must understand, rather than form state policy. It is designed by the FRY's leadership. Consequently, the answer to this question must be given by the state leadership. Current Military Programs [Lazanski] When does the Yugoslav Army intend to purchase a serious amount of the most up-to-date air-force weapons, as well as surface-to-surface missile systems? Does that depend exclusively on the sanctions and the country's finances? [Perisic] Regardless of a certain technical-technological inferiority in relation to the most high-tech armies, the Yugoslav Army is even now capable of fighting for, and defending the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the FRY, which also includes inflicting intolerable losses upon any aggressor. The Air-Force and Anti-Aircraft Defense of the Yugoslav Army has at its disposal such weapons that make possible the elementary protection of the civilians, vital buildings, and the territory. In the case of a more serious violation of Yugoslav air space, the Air-Force and Anti-Aircraft Defense is ready to react in an appropriate way. Because of the war in our neighborhood, and many threats, the Yugoslav Army is certainly in need of the most modern weapons for aviation and of missile systems. However, their purchase is limited by the economic circumstances in the country. [Lazanski] By what percentage can the current military industry can be correlated with the military industry of the former SFRY? [Perisic] The capacities of the military industry that have remained in the republics that seceded, and the majority of such industrial capacities are located in those republics, are lost to the Yugoslav Army. Those are very important capacities, some of which, like the overhauling works in Travnik, were among the most modern. A part of the military industries that has remained in the FRY has been designed and constructed to meet a considerably greater demand than there is currently. Those capacities will be adjusted to objective production possibilities, and will be partly converted into the production for civil needs of the society. Only economically acceptable programs will be financed. In our institutes we have considerable scientific and laboratory capacities for researches and development. We have the technical documentation on all the weapons that were manufactured in the former SFRY. We have managed to reorganize the production quickly, so that today we manufacture all kinds of rifles, aircraft and anti-aircraft guns and ammunition, anti-aircraft and mortar ammunition, guided and nonguided anti-tank rockets, aircraft bombs, the means of personal nuclear-chemical-biological protection, light piston aircraft, certain electronic signalling devices, reconnaissance radar, radar detectors, and so forth. The domestic industrial plants also manufacture various ignition devices that are a great priority, gunpowder, rocket fuel, some types and calibers of artillery ammunition, explosives, mines, and hand grenades. There are fields in which we are among the very top manufacturers in the world, in view of our achievements and quality: For instance, the increase in range of artillery shells by some 30 percent (using gunpowder of better quality, better subcaliber ammunition and cumulative projectiles), new systems of fire regulation installed in anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns, the modernized T-55 tank, the production of pyro-cartridges [as published] for pilot seats, the modernized G-4M plane, the new pilotless plane, and so forth. Besides, the overhauling of a considerable part of the machinery and military equipment has been carried out. This is to say, thanks to the dedicated engagement of scientists and many smaller and larger firms, we are managing to eliminate some consequences of the existing inferiority in the field of armament and military equipment manufacture. [Lazanski] Are the projects of manufacturing the M-84 tank, dubbed Vihor, the Vidra fighting infantry vehicle, and the G-4 plane still of current interest? Is there any clear deadline by which those projects may be continued? [Perisic] Those production lines are still of current interest. There are expert cadres entrusted with the realization of those projects, and also a major part of such manufacturing capacities is still functioning. The introduction of those projects in the process of realization directly depends on the economic situation in society, and on available financial means. The dynamics will be continuously harmonized with the realistic potential of the Yugoslav Army for the purchase of those weapons. When the sanctions are lifted, those projects will be orientated toward exports, which will certainly speed up the process of their realization. The State Decides on Priests in the Yugoslav Army [Lazanski] Which of the most sophisticated weapons that are not manufactured in Yugoslavia will the Yugoslav Army go for? Will they be Western, Russian, or perhaps Chinese weapons? [Perisic] We have gone for the production of arms and military equipment in our factories. We shall be purchasing the most modern fighting systems abroad, but those will be of various origins. In that way we shall avoid dependency on particular dealers regarding spare parts, maintenance, training, and so forth. In view of the fact that the procurement of arms and military equipment from abroad has been very difficult for us because of the sanctions, for the time being we are not considering that possibility very much. When the time comes for us to be able to purchase certain fighting systems, contemporary arms, and equipment on the world market, we shall endeavor to purchase those categories that are compatible with the FRY's defense system. In addition, we shall pay particular attention to the quality, price, and maintenance conditions of those arms, rather than to the countries those arms come from. [Lazanski] How do you, Mr. General, view the war in former Yugoslavia, since you took part in the 1991-1992 operations? Could the former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] have settled certain things in a more elegant way, or perhaps prevented them? [Perisic] The war in the former SFRY was triggered, in the first place, by the secession of the Republic of Slovenia, then by the secession of Croatia, and finally, of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which the ongoing war has characteristics of an ethnic, religious, and civil war. In that context, the former JNA was not a key factor in the disintegration of the SFRY. A different question is whether the JNA, given a deep economic crisis and political instability at the time, could have prevented the secession by force. I personally think that it could not, but, anyway, the assessment of that question should be given by expert institutions, viewing it from a certain distance of time. [Lazanski] Will army service in the Yugoslav Army involve also the ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, and the Muslims from Sandzak in the future? [Perisic] According to Article 63 of the Constitution, Article 279 of the Law on Army, and Article 21 of the Law on Defense, army service is stipulated for all the citizens of the FRY, regardless of national or religious affiliation. Therefore, that also applies to the ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and Metohija, as well as to the Muslims from Sandzak. There are certain difficulties regarding the call-up of conscripts and the mobilization of reservists for army maneuvers, due to the war in our neighborhood, the activities of separatist groups, propaganda, various manipulations, and the dodging of the fulfillment of duties toward the country. We are doing everything to prevent those occurrences from considerably diminishing the readiness of command posts and units to carry out their tasks. [Lazanski] Are you considering the engagement of army priests in the Yugoslav Army? [Perisic] The regulations on the service in the Yugoslav Army, in compliance with the Constitution, say that persons serving in the Yugoslav Army are allowed to visit religious centers, to worship, and wear amulets and relics, as well as to use religious books, but the dissemination of religion is forbidden. In addition, it has been made possible for believers whose faith forbids carrying arms to serve in the army under special conditions. Therefore, a particular need for the employment of priests in the army does not exist. However, the decision on whether the Yugoslav Army should have priests or not should be made by the authorized state institutions. [Lazanski] If and when the embassies of the FRY are inaugurated in the former Yugoslav republics, will you send Yugoslav military attaches there, or will that be carried out from Belgrade, because the distances are not so great? [Perisic] The decision on possible military attaches within the diplomatic-consular missions of the FRY in the former Yugoslav republics should be made by the authorized state institutions. When an overall political solution for former Yugoslavia is adopted, when the mutual diplomatic relations through embassies are established, and the questions of the partition balance and boundaries are settled, then the question of military attaches will be settled as well.
