About 400 Vietnamese boat people staged a mass demonstration at Tai A Chau Detention Center against the new repatriation measures which order all the 52,000 Vietnamese asylum-seekers in camps of Asian countries to return to their homes by the end of next year. Tension mounted in the detention camps Monday [14 February] when detainees awaited the outcome of the Geneva meeting which agreed to speed up the repatriation by returning all those who did not actively object to returning. Camp protests swelled across the detention centers in Hong Kong. Some 90 people, including a few of pregnant women, staged a hunger strike at Kai Tak Transit Center Monday, shouting slogans in protest against the Hong Kong Government's screening policy to determine refugee status. However, the overall atmosphere in the camps had become calm and peaceful although a number of peaceful demonstrations in various detention centers took place coinciding with the Geneva meeting, local acting secretary for security announced at a press conference held here today. Of all the 52,000 Vietnamese asylum-seekers in Asian camps, about half, or 25,660 Vietnamese boat people, are staying in Hong Kong. The majority of them have been screened out and the rest are awaiting for screening, according to the latest government figures. Hong Kong Acting Secretary for Security Ken Woodhouse said today that he welcomed the U.N. new decision on repatriation. "While voluntary repatriation remains our preferred option for securing the return of the Vietnamese to Vietnam, there is a need to speed up the process of repatriation to meet the internationally agreed two-year timetable," he said at a press conference held here today. The Vietnamese boat people have been a heavy burden for Hong Kong in the past 18 years and the recent decision will send a clear message to the camp population that their future lies in Vietnam not in camps in Hong Kong, he added. It was reported Hong Kong may offer three options to detainees: the existing voluntary repatriation program, a forced repatriation program and the non-objectors program for those who do not volunteer to return. "We will begin to work out the details for the non-objectors scheme with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees as soon as practicable," Woodhouse said.
