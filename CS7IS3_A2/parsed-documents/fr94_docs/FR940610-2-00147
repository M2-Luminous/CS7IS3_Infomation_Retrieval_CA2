SUMMARY: In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S. Code, chapter 35), this notice announces a request for reclearance of two information collections. OPM Forms 1496, Application for Deferred Retirement (Separation before October 1, 1956), and 1496A, Application for Deferred Retirement (Separation on or after October 1, 1956), are used by eligible former Federal employees to apply for a deferred Civil Service annuity. Two forms are needed because there was a major revision in the law effective October 1, 1956; this affects the general information provided with the forms. Approximately 3,000 deferred retirements are processed annually; 200 of these are submitted on OPM Form 1496 and 2,800 are on OPM Form 1496A. Both forms take approximately 60 minutes to complete. The combined annual burden is 3,000 hours. For copies of this proposal, contact C. Ronald Trueworthy on (703) 908&hyph;8550.
