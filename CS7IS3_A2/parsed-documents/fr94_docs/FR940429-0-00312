(C) A guaranty agency shall review its records and identify all schools that appear to have closed on or after January 1, 1986 and prior to June 13, 1994, and shall identify the loans made to any borrower (or student) who appears to have been enrolled at the school on the school closure date or who withdrew not more than 90 days prior to the closure date. (D) A guaranty agency shall notify the Secretary immediately if it determines that a school not previously known to have closed appears to have closed, and, within 30 days of making that determination, notify all lenders participating in its program to suspend collection efforts against individuals with respect to loans made for attendance at the closed school, if the student to whom (or on whose behalf) a loan was made, appears to have been enrolled at the school on the closing date, or withdrew not more than 90 days prior to the date the school appears to have closed. Within 30 days after receiving confirmation of the date of a school's closure from the Secretary, the agency shall_ ( 1 ) Notify all lenders participating in its program to mail a discharge application explaining the procedures and eligibility criteria for obtaining a discharge and an explanation of the information that must be included in the sworn statement (which may be combined) to all borrowers who may be eligible for a closed school discharge; and ( 2 ) Review the records of loans that it holds, identify the loans made to any borrower (or student) who appears to have been enrolled at the school on the school closure date or who withdrew not more than 90 days prior to the closure date, and mail a discharge application and an explanation of the information that must be included in the sworn statement (which may be combined) to the borrower. The application shall inform the borrower of the procedures and eligibility criteria for obtaining a discharge. (E) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(i)(D)( 2 ) of this section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the borrower's current address is known, the guaranty agency shall immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments), and notify the borrower that the agency will provide additional information about the procedures for requesting a discharge after the agency has received confirmation from the Secretary that the school had closed. (F) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(i)(D)( 2 ) of this section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the borrower's current address is unknown, the agency shall, by June 13, 1995, further refine the list of borrowers whose loans are potentially subject to discharge under paragraph (d) of this section by consulting with representatives of the closed school, the school's licensing agency, accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties. Upon learning the new address of a borrower who would still be considered potentially eligible for a discharge, the guaranty agency shall, within 30 days after learning the borrower's new address, mail to the borrower a discharge application that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(6)(i)(E) of this section. (G) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in paragraph (d)(6)(i)(E) or (F) of this section has satisfied all of the conditions required for a discharge, the agency shall notify the borrower in writing of that determination within 30 days after making that determination. (H) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in paragraph (d)(6)(i)(E) or (F) of this section does not qualify for a discharge, the agency shall notify the borrower in writing of that determination and the reasons for it within 30 days after the date the agency_ ( 1 ) Made that determination based on information available to the guaranty agency; ( 2 ) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had not closed; ( 3 ) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had closed on a date that was more than 90 days after the borrower (or student) withdrew from the school;
