The reports outline possible preventive measures and call for vigilance by regional states over the emergence of new trafficking methods and techniques. They also call for the adoption of measures to reduce illegal production in the region, which should be followed by measures to reduce illegal demand for drugs in consuming countries; the promulgation of appropriate regulations, the adoption of other measures to effectively implement the provisions of the 1988 agreement; and the exchange of information on criminal organizations involved in illegal drug trafficking in the region. The reports also stressed the need for collective efforts and vigilance, especially at border monitoring posts, in order to ensure greater effectiveness in organizing the traffic of sulfates, and for supporting the recommendations of the international conference on chemical operations.
