Ortega Comments on Meeting With Watson PA1703224394 Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 17 Mar 94 pp 1, 8 PA1703224394 Managua BARRICADA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] [Text] General Humberto Ortega declared, following a "frank, cordial, and open" meeting with Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs, that the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] "will never" accept a military law approved "under U.S. pressure or by capricious positions." Gen. Ortega added that he will "not retire under anyone's pressure, nor will the EPS tolerate another situation similar to what took place on 2 September 1993" when President Violeta Chamorro announced that the current Army commander in chief would retire in 1994. Before departing Nicaragua, Watson commented that what happened on 2 September 1993 "was not the result of U.S. pressure; she said it was for her own reasons." Watson, who is the first U.S. official of his position to meet with the EPS general staff, refused to say whether Gen. Ortega should retire this year, like Chamorro said in 1993. "The Army and government are talking about this very delicate topic," Watson said. In a news conference Gen. Ortega reiterated the EPS rejection of the human rights report prepared by the U.S. State Department. "This report is not objective and does not fall within the framework of the relationship that should exist between two sovereign countries," Ortega told Watson. Watson's Promise Presidency Minister Engineer Antonio Lacayo also expressed rejection of this document at the Augusto Cesar Sandino Airport, where he arrived to bid Watson farewell. Minister Lacayo reiterated that the military law draft bill will be in the hands of the National Assembly in two weeks at the latest and that the U.S. State Department report "is rather old" and is loaded with "[word indistinct] language." According to Gen. Ortega, Mr. Watson promised to take into account "other Nicaraguan points of view" when drafting the next report on the topic. He also insisted that the military law "will be a law on which most Nicaraguans agree." Watson stressed that one of the basic topics dealt with during his first visit to Nicaragua was human rights and reiterated how important it is for the United States "that all human rights violators are taken to justice." On the other hand, Ortega, who refused to tell reporters whether he would retire or not from the EPS this year, stressed to Watson the "deep crisis" that Nicaragua is going through due to the high incidence of violence and lack of citizens' security and the opportunity the United States has to contribute to national stability. "It is useless to move ahead in other fields if the country is going to crumble due to problems such as state corruption, drug trafficking, etc.," Ortega ended.
