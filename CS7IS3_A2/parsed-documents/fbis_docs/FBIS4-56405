At the closing of a session of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], which approved guidelines for the strengthening of the country's finances, Castro said it is necessary to make concessions to adapt the country to a world dominated by capitalism, but without moving away from the country's principles. Speaking to more than 550 deputies and several dozen foreign and Cuban guests, he ruled out the possible application of neoliberal formulas because, according to him, these measures have not solved problems such as unemployment, which continues to increase even if the economy grows. In his opinion, the world is in the hands of the multinational companies and capitalism, and this situation will continue for a relatively long time, a reality that the Revolution will have to bear in mind. He pointed out that Cuba is willing to make concessions but only the indispensable ones to survive and develop. Fidel Castro noted that the survival of socialism in Cuba, almost four years after the disappearance of the USSR, is also taking place at a time in which the country is blockaded by the United States and its anti-Cuban policy. He pointed out, however, that despite this situation, the number of foreign companies interested in investing in Cuba has increased because the nation occupies an important position among the countries considered safe for investment. The Cuban president said the current problem is not limited to domestic finances, a topic that was debated by the ANPP, because the scarcity of foreign exchange considerably limits the purchasing of food, medicines, fuel, raw materials, and spare parts to keep the economy running. He noted that the reactivation of the economy is a difficult process because the agriculture sector has to work with a shortage of pesticides, fertilizers, and the country lacks the resources to purchase steel with which to manufacture plows. Cuban President Fidel Castro said, however, that the country is not discouraged and is facing the difficulties under complex conditions. For example, he said sugarcane cutters do not even have the appropriate shoes, workers are poorly dressed, and workers are not eating the proper foods for the jobs they perform. In this regard, he described as an example of courage the agreements reached today by the ANPP to create an integral tax system, to increase the prices of certain products, to eliminate certain free services and subsidies because of company losses, as well as to recover the value of the peso, without ruling out the exchange of money to achieve it. He pointed out that the government will not rest in applying this measure designed by the ANPP; it will do so gradually but without delay because it will begin this week with the passage of a decree on the confiscation of illegally acquired property.
