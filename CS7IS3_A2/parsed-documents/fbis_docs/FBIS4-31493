The media -- television, radio, the press as well as billboard owners -- should be obliged to inform the Central Electoral Commission immediately after the elections of the amount each political party spent on advertising, Jan Carnogursky said at a press conference today. The Slovak general elections are scheduled for September 30 and October 1. If party spending on the campaign exceeded the limit by ten percent the state contribution to the party in question would be cut by the according amount, he proposed. Carnogursky said the KDH had found support for the motion within the government coalition. He did not say when his party would formally submit the bill to parliament. The proposal is seen as being directed against Vladimir Meciar's party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), allegedly the richest party after presiding over many privatisation projects while in power. Meciar denies the allegations.
