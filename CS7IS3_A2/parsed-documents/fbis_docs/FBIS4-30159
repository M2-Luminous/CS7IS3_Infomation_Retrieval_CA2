Showing a scene of the great leader President Kim Il-song talking with Carter, Swedish TV June 16 stressed it is only President Kim Il-song, the great leader of the Korean people, who could have a decisive influence in solving the crisis created on the Korean peninsula surrounding the nuclear issue. President Kim Il-song expressed optimism about the prospect of solving the crisis surrounding the Korean peninsula, the TV reported. On the same day, Norwegian TV said only President Kim Il-song could indicate the way of solving the present crisis of the Korean peninsula. The Italian paper LA STAMPA spotlighted a picture the great leader had taken with Carter and said a heated atmosphere between Pyongyang and Washington was removed after President Kim Il-song received Carter for hours. Noting that Carter described his Pyongyang visit as a fruitful visit which brought about an important progress, the paper said this was a good news for the United States when the U.S. plan of "sanctions" against North Korea virtually touched off strong reaction in the United Nations and Washington was in a difficult position. XINHUA News Agency June 18 quoted Carter as telling President Kim Il-song that the United States has stopped its activity for "sanctions" against the DPRK. The Danish Central Radio June 17 said Carter visited North Korea with a mission of solving the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. Carter told that the United States would begin a new negotiation with North Korea and was ready to openly declare the non-use of nuclear weapons against North Korea, the radio said. The Chinese PEOPLE'S DAILY June 20 quoted Carter as saying at a press conference in Seoul on June 18 that establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea will be useful in promoting understanding and exchange between the two countries. Carter said if talks are held, they should shift from "sanctions" to the third-round talks and stop urging "sanctions" at the UN Security Council from this point of view, the U.S. Radio Voice of America reported June 20. The radio also quoted Gallucci as saying he hopes the U.S. Administration will continue following the content of talks between Carter and President Kim Il-song at this point. The Japanese NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN June 18 said the Clinton administration began to move toward full resumption of the U.S.-DPRK dialogue after President Kim Il-song received former President Carter twice. The United States manifested its stance actually not to call in question the past "nuclear development issue" of North Korea but solve the issue between the two countries, excluding the International Atomic Energy Agency, the paper wrote. It can be said that the U.S. Administration took the hand held out by President Kim Il-song in the last moment without delay, added the paper.
