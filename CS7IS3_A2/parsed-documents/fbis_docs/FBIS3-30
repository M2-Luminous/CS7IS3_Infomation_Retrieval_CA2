Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-14MAR94-DPRK-ROK DPRK Seems Ready to Lift Barriers to Envoy Exchange With ROK SUMMARY In a move designed to realize high-level U.S.-DPRK talks, Pyongyang used the 12 March meeting with Seoul to suggest a willingness to withdraw the four demands it had previously insisted Seoul must meet before presidential envoys could be exchanged. In signaling its willingness to move toward holding an inter-Korean summit, the North also claimed that it is the South that has repeatedly rejected North Korean summit offers, including one heretofore unreported. In keeping with its new interest in exchanging envoys, Pyongyang media have so far continued to temper personal attacks on ROK President Kim Yong- sam, a circumspection first noted last week. END SUMMARY Pyongyang media treatment of the 12 March working-level talks suggested that the North is poised to strike a deal with the South on the exchange of special envoys. Pyongyang radio on 12 March depicted the North Korean chief delegate--identified in South Korean media as Pak Yong-su--as noting that of the 28 points raised in connection with procedural matters for the envoy exchange, "all but four points" had been agreed upon "in principle." Furthermore, Pak was cited as making conciliatory gestures for resolving the four North Korean demands: + Pak said that two issues--the "large-scale nuclear war exercises" and the "international cooperation system" (an allusion to threats of UN sanctions)--could be discussed by the envoys. Further defusing these issues, he claimed that the South had announced its decision "not to stage" Team Spirit this year. + On the introduction of the Patriot missile to the South, he seemed to agree with the South's alleged statement that "the situation had changed" because Seoul "had already decided to shelve the plan" to bring in the missiles. + On ROK President Kim's earlier remarks that he "cannot shake hands with a party that possesses nuclear weapons," Pak seemed to suggest that the question is moot, since the "person in the highest authority" in the South subsequently said that the North has no nuclear weapons. Pak noted that although the South's response to the four North Korean demands still falls "short of our expectations," it is proof of Seoul's recognition of the basic "reasonableness" of the demands (Pyongyang radio, 12 March)--a formulation that may allow Pyongyang, having made its points, to yield without losing its "dignity." Summit Talks Signaling a willingness to eventually hold a North-South summit meeting, while at the same time illustrating North Korea's desire to put the South on the defensive, Pak claimed that the South has rejected the North's offers of top- level talks dating back 20 years. In particular, he revealed that in "early April 1992" an unnamed North Korean "special envoy visited Seoul and invited the ROK president to Pyongyang around the time of DPRK President Kim Il-song's 80th birthday. Implying that Pyongyang could use the South's rejection of the summit for propaganda purposes, Pak pointedly noted that up to now the North had "never mentioned" its special envoy's visit to Seoul or his offer. Joint Communique Seeking to foster the impression of progress at the 12 March meeting, the North unsuccessfully proposed a North-South joint communique(SEE NOTE) to "reconfirm" both sides' intention to exchange envoys "at an early date." Pyongyang apparently hoped it could use such a communique to claim to Washington that North Korea has met its prerequisites for reconvening high-level U.S.-North Korea talks. (Although U.S.- DPRK high-level talks tentatively are set to start on 21 March, Washington is reportedly insisting that the special envoys must be exchanged between the North and South before such talks could be held (Yonhap, 12 March).) (NOTE: Precedents for issuing North-South joint communiques in recent years are somewhat mixed. A joint communique was issued at the fourth round of inter-Korean prime ministerial talks (Pyongyang radio, 24 October) in a departure from the practice of the previous three rounds. Communiques were also issued following inter-Korean talks on the nuclear issue in 1992 (Pyongyang radio, 19 February 1992, 14 March 1992). However, in August 1992 the South rejected a North Korean proposal for a joint communique following another meeting on the nuclear issue (Yonhap, 31 August 1992).) Just how eagerly Pyongyang wanted a joint communique was demonstrated in the extraordinarily conciliatory remarks Pak made in pressing for the communique. In accusing the South of delaying the realization of the envoy exchange by "suspecting" Korean motives, Pyongyang radio portrayed Pak as indirectly admitting that the North was also partly to blame for the delay (12 March). The radio cited him as saying that the North on its part had created "four barriers "--a clear reference to the four North Korean demands. In pleading for compromise, Pak also cautioned against the sides playing a zero-sum game, declaring that neither side should "absolutize" its own position. Limiting Rhetoric In line with the image of conciliation the North Korean leadership is trying to project, Pyongyang media have in recent days continued to moderate their personal attacks on ROK President Kim. The KCNA report of an 11 March commentary in the party paper Nodong Sinmun calling for unity of South Korean "patriots" against their government avoided using the South Korean leader's name, referring to the ROK Government only as the "'civilian' fascist forces" (11 March). For the past few months, Pyongyang media have been signaling the North's reluctance to deal with the South Korean government with repeated harsh personal attacks on President Kim. The first sign of moderation on this issue appeared last week. Implications Pyongyang's attempt to project a conciliatory stance toward Seoul suggests that the North may try to work out a substantive accord on the envoy exchange at the next scheduled session on 16 March. Failing that, the North may hope that taking the high road on this issue will strengthen its contention of the South's intransigence and thus enable it to pressure the United States to proceed with bilateral talks.
