Notwithstanding differences on constitutional matters, the parties recognised the right of people to participate or not to participate in the forthcoming general elections. After a constructive exchange of views, the parties agreed to work together to ensure that canvassing for respective views should be able to take place without let or hindrance. In an effort to resolve outstanding constitutional deadlocks, the parties agreed to explore with their principals the possibility of international mediation and in this regard the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] would consider provisional registration in terms of the electoral act. Both parties agreed that the present levels of violence in our society were totally unacceptable and were jeopardising conditions for socio-economic reconstruction and development. They therefore resolved to redouble their efforts to encourage their respective constituencies to participate in and support National Peace Accord structures and all peace initiatives. While recognising the fact that members of the ANC [African National Congress] and IFP are involved in political violence, the parties are of the view that the primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order remains with the government of the day. The parties also explored the possibility of making greater use of international expertise in areas such as conflict resolution and the investigation of political violence. It was agreed that a task group would be established in order to faciliate the strengthening of peace committees and to attend to communication between the parties.
