A relevant IAEA high-ranking official said that through overall inspections [chonmyon sachal], which will be resumed in the future, the IAEA plans to restore the damaged continuity of inspections of North Korea. Toward this end, it will send the inspection team to Pyongyang after adding three or four additional experts. He stressed that the IAEA plans to send an inspection team of approximately seven experts to Pyongyang for the nuclear inspection of North Korea, which will be resumed in the future. He said he was not sure if North Korea would accept the seven experts because the IAEA has not received an official message from the North Korean side yet. He said, however, that the IAEA plans to discuss the issue with North Korea through consultations. He stressed that the inspections must be regularly conducted in order to completely restore the continuity of inspections and he expressed the hope that North Korea will respond positively. He said that the inspection team, which is ready to go to North Korea now, is standing by in order to change monitoring equipment in North Korean nuclear facilities, including six monitoring cameras and over 40 pieces of sealing equipment [pongin changchi] and to check in detail the total stock of nuclear material that has not yet been examined.
