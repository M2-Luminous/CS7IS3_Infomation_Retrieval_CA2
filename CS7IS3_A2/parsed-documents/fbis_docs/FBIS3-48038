The resignation of Tun Datu Mustapha as Sabah affairs minister, chairman of the UMNO [United Malays National Organization] Merudu Division, and consequently an UMNO member will not affect anyone. Tun Datu Mustapha had the right to make this decision. It showed, however, that Tun Datu Mustapaha was not committed to UMNO. [passage omitted] Asked about Datuk Jeffrey Kitingan, director of the Sabah Foundation, who has cited the possibility of playing politics to revamp relations between the federal government and the Sabah Government, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said that the federal government has never quarreled with the people of Sabah. The federal government merely disagrees with the present Sabah leadership: [Begin Mahathir recording] I have heard these rumors for a long time. Indeed, they want to be readmitted into the National Front. We cannot just readmit them, though. You remember that we admitted them after they insisted, but they quit the National Front easily at a time when we were facing a general election. Thus, we cannot readmit them easily. First, we want to know the extent and see the proof of their commitment. If they are able to prove that they really had nothing to do with their leader's action, we will consider readmitting them, because we are not extremely rigid; we have mercy for them. [end recording]
