FR940503-1-00076 FR940503-1-00012 A skewing in a negative direction of the average of baselines with respect to foreign conventional gasoline, is of significant concern because EPA anticipates that most foreign sources of gasoline will provide conventional gasoline to the U.S. This assumption is based on EPA's belief that few foreign producers of gasoline have invested in the capital equipment necessary for complying with the reformulated gasoline program. Further, the increased costs of capitalization realized by a refiner entering the reformulated gasoline market would be exacerbated by the continuing costs of overseas shipping under the segregated fuels requirement proposed in this amendment. Accordingly, there appears to be few economic incentives for foreign refiners to reallocate production from conventional to reformulated gasolines. Thus, EPA is not proposing to change the approach contained in the Final Rule pertaining to baselines for imported conventional gasoline, and EPA expects all or almost all importers to default to the statutory baseline. EPA requests comment as to the magnitude of any potential adverse air quality consequences that would result from gaming under today's proposal. D. EPA's Compliance Oversight Authority The preamble to the Final Rule expresses EPA's concern that it would lack adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement techniques to ensure that foreign refineries comply fully with the reformulated gasoline program. This concern arose out of the perceived need to bring any enforcement actions against importers that would rely on baseline audits and inspections of foreign refiners, and that these foreign refiners may not be subject to the full panoply of enforcement mechanisms available with domestic corporations. Today's proposed amendment, however, provides for compliance monitoring and enforcement pertaining to foreign-produced reformulated gasoline to focus on domestic importers. Such foreign-produced reformulated gasoline would be subject to the full array of monitoring and enforcement devices available to EPA. It has been argued that importers' potential liability, including but not limited to exposure to potential relegation to compliance with the statutory baseline, will be adequate to ensure that importers would import gasoline using an individual foreign refinery's baseline only where the importer has sufficient confidence the requirements of this program would be met, including the compliance monitoring provisions that require the cooperation of the foreign refiner and the government of the country in which the foreign refiner is located. These compliance monitoring and enforcement provisions appears to be equivalent to EPA's compliance monitoring and enforcement authority over domestic refiners. The proposal provides that, as a condition for the use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline, EPA would be guaranteed full and immediate access to conduct compliance oversight inspections, collect gasoline samples and perform compliance audits at the foreign refinery. EPA's compliance audits supplement the baseline certification and annual audits specified elsewhere in this proposal. EPA's compliance oversight authority is proposed to last until January 1, 2003, consistent with the statute of limitations governing violations of the reformulated gasoline program and associated statutes governing the submission of information to the U.S. government. In addition, foreign refiners electing to petition to use an individual baseline would be required to engage a domestic CPA to conduct a baseline certification audit and annual attest engagements. EPA anticipates that and is seeking comment on whether the professional standards governing the conduct of such audits, as well as the amenability of a U.S. CPA to EPA compliance monitoring and enforcement, is adequate assurance that EPA can effectively monitor foreign refiners for program compliance.
