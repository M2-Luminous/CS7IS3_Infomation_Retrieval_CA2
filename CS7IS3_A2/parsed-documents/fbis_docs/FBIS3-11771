More than 141,000 persons, 4 percent of the 3.5 million Cuban workers, currently work independently on the island, protected by a law that was approved in September and increased to 136 the number of self-employment categories. The new law, announced on Sunday, establishes a fine of 1,500 pesos for persons who engage in an activity that is not legally authorized, and 1,200 pesos for persons who do not have a certificate that accredits them as independent workers. A Cuban's average salary is approximately 150 pesos per month. A 1,200-pesos fine will be imposed on persons acting as intermediaries to provide services or sponsor the sale of products manufactured by a self- employed person, whether legally authorized or not. Likewise, Cubans who take advantage of the market conditions to sell or offer services at clearly exorbitant prices can also be sanctioned by the law. Also, a fine of 600 pesos will be imposed on persons who violate health regulations; and a 1,200-pesos fine to whoever "hides, denies, or forges information that is officially requested by the appropriate authorities, or whoever intentionally obstructs the authorities' actions. According to statistics from the Labor Research Institute, more than 141,000 Cubans are self-employed, including electricians, masons, carpenters, photographers, electric appliance repairmen, masseurs, and craftsmen. Persons who want to work independently must obtain a permit from the State Labor and Social Security Committee, and are required to pay a tax to the State Finance Committee, based on the type of activity they carry out. In order to obtain self-employment authorization, a person has to be retired, a housewife, or be registered under the subsidy system due to a reorganization or paralysis of activities. Professionals in active service and directorate board members are excluded. Cuban economic authorities have affirmed on more than one occasion that self-employment is necessary given the lack of full-time jobs and the state's inability to provide certain services. Since the authorization of self-employment jobs increased, handicraft street vendors, bicycle parking attendants, and automobile washers, and other articles have proliferated throughout the island. In most cases they offer their services and products in dollars.
