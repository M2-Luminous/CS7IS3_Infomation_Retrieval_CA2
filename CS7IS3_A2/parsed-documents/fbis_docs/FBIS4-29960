Following the "Sunny 1500 CX" recently put on sale, it is scheduled to be carried on some "Pulsars" that will have a full model change next year. Thereafter, it plans to carry it on a total of eight car classes along with full model changes. Nissan is promoting cost reductions by sharing parts with existing engines and considers it a product where low price and low fuel consumption coexist. Favored as targets for carrying the lean-burning engine are the eight car classes of Pulsar, "Bluebird," "Primera," "Presea," "March," "Avenir," and "AD wagon," in addition to the Sunny which already has been set. There also are the "Cedric/Gloria," "Laurel," and "Sefillo" 2000-cc types, but it seems that it will be narrowed to classes below 1800-cc to 2000-cc middle displacement. For the engine, existing engines will be made lean burning like the "GA" engine of the Sunny. In the future, Nissan will change to lean-burning car classes carrying the "SR" engines such as the Bluebird and Primera and the "CG" engine for the March along with full model changes. In particular, the policy is to cultivate cars carrying lean-burning engines as the central type for the Sunny and Bluebird which are the highest volume sales classes. The lean-burning engine is a mechanism where fuel consumption is reduced by increasing the volume of air for burning gasoline. Toyota Motor and Honda Motor were forerunners in this field, but Nissan has perfected a low-price engine by greatly improving the fuel consumption of the GA engine itself along with full model change of the Sunny, and adopting the lean-burning method in addition to that. Viewed by body price, the lean-burning cars of other companies are about 100,000 yen higher than the regular type. Nissan is proceeding in part sharing with regular engines that have rather low fuel consumption and has held the increase to about 30,000 yen. It estimates that if it increases the car classes carrying it and further raises productivity, it can lower prices further. The strategy is to cultivate the low fuel consumption, lean-burning engine as the mainstream while avoiding an increase in body prices.
