The Mojahedin-e Khalq said in a statement published by its Paris office that "it never carries out bomb attacks that endanger the lives of innocent people," adding that it "clearly condemns this sort of act." Three passers-by were wounded and shops were damaged near Ferdowsi Square in downtown Tehran late Thursday when two bombs apparently placed in a rubbish bin exploded on a street corner, the official news agency IRNA said in Tehran. A woman later phoned IRNA from Paris to claim responsibility for the blast on behalf of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, Iran's main armed opposition group, the agency reported. An IRNA reporter saw an ambulance rushing three people to hospital, where officials said one of them was critically injured.
