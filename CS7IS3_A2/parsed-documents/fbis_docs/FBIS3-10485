Our country advocates an independent peace policy as a basis for its foreign policy, the ranking diplomat of the People's Republic of China stated, reiterating that these objectives will be strengthened in its ties with Venezuela. Relations between Beijing and Caracas will be boosted soon with "high-level visits" and increased bilateral economic cooperation. After meeting with Roy Chaderton, his Venezuelan counterpart, and establishing the political Chinese-Venezuelan consultation mechanisms, Liu plans to meet with President Rafael Caldera and Foreign Minister Miguel Burelli Rivas.
