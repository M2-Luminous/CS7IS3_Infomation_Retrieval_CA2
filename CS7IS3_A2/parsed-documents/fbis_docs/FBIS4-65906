This was stated this week by IMF Director General Michel Camdessus during his visit to Spain. Do you agree with this analysis? [Solbes] Political uncertainty always affects the economy. It is absurd to deny it. The financial markets -- especially the stock exchange and the peseta -- have reacted badly at some junctures when it seemed that political stability in Spain could not be guaranteed. Right now, that danger of political instability has been completely surmounted, and the financial markets are behaving well again. [LA VANGUARDIA] But do you not believe that business investment could reflect adversely the current atmosphere of political uncertainty? [Solbes] Investment by large enterprises is planned well in advance and is normally of a long-term nature. Investment by small and medium enterprises may perhaps have been delayed somewhat. But there is no doubt that political tension adversely affects the economy. Therefore, each political force must face up to its responsibilities, and the public must know how to assess the conduct of each of them. [LA VANGUARDIA] So do you believe there will be no further scandals to complicate matters again? [Solbes] I cannot swear to it, but I believe that yes, there will be calm and confidence will be recovered. The government has made very important decisions to increase oversight and has accepted its political responsibilities, and I hope that no further problems will arise. [LA VANGUARDIA] Have you noted any sign of an economic stoppage during May? [Solbes] No, so far we have no information that permits us to believe that this has occurred. [LA VANGUARDIA] Has investment now finally taken off as you have hinted? [Solbes] Investment in capital goods is beginning to take off, judging by the good performance of imports. Investment in housing shows good prospects in light of cement consumption. On the other hand, investment in public works is performing more sluggishly than expected. [LA VANGUARDIA] The Bank of Spain lowered interest rates by 0.25 percent Friday [13 May], after the Bundesbank had done so by 0.50 percent Wednesday. Is there scope left for further falls in the short or medium term? [Solbes] The key to further falls in interest rates lies in two things -- the other European countries lowering them and our being able to reduce inflation and the public deficit. But the remaining scope is very small, both for ourselves and for the countries around us. In general, the big cuts in the price of money have already been made. [LA VANGUARDIA] Do you believe the peseta's current exchange rate is at the right level? [Solbes] The peseta's exchange rate against the [German] mark has performed rather worse over the past few days. A few weeks ago, we were at 81 pesetas to the mark. I accept that we could reach 82 pesetas to the mark, but I do not believe the peseta's depreciation beyond that to be justified. [LA VANGUARDIA] But a cheap peseta is what enterprises are demanding. The outcome of the devaluation has been very good for the economy, so far. [Solbes] The peseta exchange rate must reflect the objective state of the Spanish economy, and, from that viewpoint, exceeding the current levels would place us on an unrealistic exchange rate. [LA VANGUARDIA] What do you have to say about the fact that wages are increasing by 3.8 percent on average, in light of the few agreements that have been signed, whereas you advised a wage freeze? [Solbes] I would have preferred agreements more in keeping with the difficult economic situation in which we find ourselves. However, if that percentage of increase is confirmed, wage increases will be less than they were last year, but with insufficient restraint to be able to create jobs. If there is no wage restraint, the danger that jobs will be lost is real. I deem it a good thing for everybody to realize this and behave reasonably. [LA VANGUARDIA] Do you not believe that these 3.8-percent increases could jeopardize the inflation target for this year, especially since we still have an annual rate of around 5 percent? [Solbes] If in 1993, with high wage increases, we had an annual inflation rate of 4.9 percent, things should go better this year. The increase in wages is more moderate, and this must be acknowledged. Inflation will perform better this year than last year, and I still expect to end it at 3.5 percent, because the wage increases are more moderate than in 1993; there has been no tax increase, and the impact of devaluation has been assimilated in almost all sectors except food. According to the figures published Friday, underlying inflation went very well in April. It is true that overall inflation has improved by just 0.1 percent, but that was mainly as a result of food prices, which still show the increase caused by the impact of the devaluation of the peseta. We will begin to see an improvement in food prices from June onward, and this will bring inflation down to more appropriate levels. That is where we have the greatest scope to improve prices. [LA VANGUARDIA] What is your opinion of the trade unions' conduct? Do you not believe that if they accept wage restraint, it will be in return for blocking the implementation of the labor reform in enterprises? [Solbes] They may try to do so, but it would be a mistake. The country needs the reform, and not implementing it means opting for not creating jobs, which is an aim that the trade unions should share. [LA VANGUARDIA] It seems that the government -- and, more specifically, yourself -- has lost much of the enthusiasm for the EC that used to characterize it years ago. Is it true that you now deem it impossible for Spain to adopt the European top speed toward a single currency? [Solbes] The Community's decision on the European top speed will be taken in 1996. To speak now of the prospects that there will be at that time is premature. The European Commission's latest report states that only three countries fulfill the conditions laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. Over the past few years, not only has there not been greater convergence, but divergence between the Community's economies has increased. In 1996, there will also be an additional problem -- deciding how the European Union [EU] is to proceed from the broad fluctuation band of the European Monetary System to the narrow band and the single currency. And in the face of this challenge, I personally, like many other European economy ministers, will never propose that Spain proceed to this third stage of monetary union if we are not really ready. The third stage requires not only a healthy and sound economic discipline, but also entails restrictions that can only be satisfied if some minimum conditions are fulfilled. To believe that we could have an absolutely stable currency situation and maintain a significant inflation differential would be absurd. However, the decisions in 1996 will not depend on us alone. They will require a new reflection on the state of the European project. [LA VANGUARDIA] So must we forgo the European top speed? [Solbes] Despite all the European project's problems, what seems to me really important is that we make every possible effort to ensure that the Spanish economy's real conditions approach those of the other member countries. So if we achieve this, we will be in a better position to make the leap to the third stage of European Monetary Union [EMU], which is the stage leading to the single currency, when the time comes. Otherwise, if we are unable to achieve this, I would advise not entering this third stage. [LA VANGUARDIA] In giving up, as it has done, the idea of reducing the public deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 1997, the government has also now given up the idea of adopting the top speed in EMU. Is this not so? [Solbes] Not at all. Our public deficit clearly worsened with the crisis. We are not the only country in Europe -- far from it -- that has had this problem. The Community's average public deficit is 5.1 percent of GDP. Therefore there are several European countries with budgetary difficulties similar to ours. We plan to end this year with a state public deficit of 5.7 percent of GDP, plus the 1 percent of the deficit created in the autonomous communities and local administrations. The important thing is to change the trend in the deficit and continue to reduce it. [LA VANGUARDIA] What is the government's aim with respect to next year's budget? [Solbes] We have outlined the budgetary scenario for the next three years, and it is extremely restrictive. All the government ministers now have information about the future financial framework within which they will have to operate. Despite this, it is a difficult endeavor to reduce the public deficit from 6.7 percent to 3 percent of GDP in virtually three years. We seek to achieve 3 percent of GDP in 1997 but, if this is not possible, we will try to come as close to it as possible. [LA VANGUARDIA] In that atmosphere of budgetary restriction, how can aid for Seat or Suzuki be found? [Solbes] I see great difficulties in finding public aid for Volkswagen or Suzuki. The EU strictly limits direct aid. There is greater scope for aid for design, research, and technological development. The government will help as far as possible within the established rules. [LA VANGUARDIA] The government's plan to reduce the deficit is very little known. What are that plan's main guidelines? [Solbes] The guidelines proceed from three major assumptions -- keeping the broad outlines of 1994, with some corrections, mainly linked to wage reviews. In the public sector, officials will have a pay rise in 1995 that will coincide with the inflation forecast for that year. In 1993, officials' wages increased by 1.8 percent, with an inflation rate of 4.9 percent. This year, the rise in officials' pay has been zero, with an inflation rate of 3.5 percent. So public officials have already made a very considerable pay effort. However, in the case of personnel costs, we wish to continue to maintain the restrictive policy on hiring new personnel. We will also maintain a restrictive policy on expenditure on goods and services, as well as on transfers to public enterprises and other bodies. From the viewpoint of revenue, the basic idea is to keep the currently existing level of taxation as the average. However, maintaining the tax burden does not mean not making some changes. [LA VANGUARDIA] How much will public expenditure increase next year? [Solbes] I wish you had asked me how much the public deficit will be reduced next year, but, joking apart, my intention is for it to increase in nominal terms, although it should reduce its share in GDP.
