Any military solution must be ruled out. Foreign Minister Antonio Martino stated this when telling the Chamber of Deputies of the latest developments in the civil war in the African country. Martino said that Italy will continue to work for a peaceful solution under the aegis of the United Nations to stop the crisis from spreading to neighboring countries, starting with Burundi. Martino announced that he will be sending Franco Rocchetta, deputy secretary for foreign affairs, to the African country within the next few days.
