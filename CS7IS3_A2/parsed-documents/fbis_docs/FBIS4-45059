The new retail prices took effect on 17 April. The price of granulated sugar in bulk went up from 17.35 to 26.85 dinars [DA] per kilogram, while that of packaged granulated sugar rose from DA20.10 to DA29.25 per kilogram. The average price of coffee rose from DA135 to DA200 per kilogram. Prices vary depending on the quantity in the package. Ground coffee in 250-gram packages will now be sold for DA210.60 per kilogram (about DA53 per package) and for slightly less (DA208.25 per kilogram) in the case of the 500-gram package. The price of coffee beans is now DA198.25 per kilogram (a little under DA50 for a 250-gram package), while unroasted coffee will be sold to roasters for DA131.10 per kilogram, all taxes included. No new price increase is scheduled before December 1994, according to Enapal's management, which says it has sufficiently "reassuring" inventories to stick to that schedule. The profit margins have been increased from DA0.50 (35 centimes for Enapal and 15 centimes for wholesalers) to DA1.50 (DA1 for Enapal and DA0.50 for wholesalers). Enapal based the new prices on the latest devaluation of the dinar (40 percent), the increase in profit margins for producers and marketers, and the new VAT [value-added tax] rates, which fell from 21 to 7 percent in the case of sugar but remained unchanged in the case of coffee (21 percent). New Prices The public is informed that effective 17 April 1994, the new prices charged by Enapal for sugar and coffee imported, processed, and distributed by its units are as follows (in dinars per kilogram): New Sugar, Coffee Prices Product Price to Price to Price to wholesaler retailer consumer Bulk granulated 24.30 24.85 26.85 sugar Packaged 26.72 27.25 29.25 granulated sugar Roasted coffee: Beans (500 grams) 176.50* 183.75* 193.75* Beans (250 grams) 181.00* 188.25* 198.25* Beans (125 grams) 183.25* 190.50* 200.50* Ground (500 grams) 191.00* 198.25* 208.25* Ground (250 grams) 193.35* 200.60* 210.60* Ground (125 grams) 195.70* 202.95* 212.95* * Kilogram price.
