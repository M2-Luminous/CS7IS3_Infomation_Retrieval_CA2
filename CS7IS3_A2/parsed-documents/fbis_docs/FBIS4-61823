It is sometimes even terrifying to take hold of them since you suddenly have another bomb on your hands. Our correspondent in the Crimea had not had time to tell us of a provocative report on an allegedly political attack on the wife of the commander of the Black Sea Fleet before the editorial office received another similar report from ITAR-TASS. From the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press service. They accuse their Russian colleagues of "preparing to hijack to Russia missile-carrying Tu-22 aircraft from Black Sea Fleet air force regiments." Ukraine claims that it is planned to make this flight against the backdrop of routine tactical air exercises I called one of the leaders of the Navy's air forces and asked: Is this true? The general was indignant: "It's out-and-out lies." And he complained that pilots are not being allowed to fly because of these persistent suspicions for which there is incidentally no documentary corroboration. And a pilot, even a top-notch pilot, who has spent a month or two on the ground, is no longer a pilot, but at best a trainee. Well, he asked sadly, have people now lost the right to a profession, to earn a crust, owing to the political wrangling? I had just cleared up the situation involving the aircraft when television announced: Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukrainian defense minister, has banned Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander in chief of the Navy, from flying to Sevastopol to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the city's liberation from the fascist occupiers, a ceremony to which the Russian admiral was invited by 20 organizations in Sevastopol. I contacted the admiral's aides. They confirmed that this had happened -- Kasatonov stayed in Moscow while Vice Admiral Ivan Vasilyev, Navy deputy commander for rear services, had to fly to Sevastopol. His candidacy caused no particular objections in Kiev's military-ministerial circles. Admittedly, the fax machine has "fired" another mind-blowing charge -- an open letter from his former fellow servicemen in the Northern Fleet -- at another admiral, this time a Ukrainian: Volodymyr Beskorovaynyy, commander of that country's Navy. What epithets the admirals and captains first and second rank directed at him. I cannot cite them -- the paper would not withstand it. And all because Beskorovaynyy behaved unworthily, according to the men of the Northern Fleet, during the conflict with the Cheleken hydrographic ship. Not only is it surprising that the open letter carries 30 signatures and names with posts ranging from deputy commander of a formation of nuclear submarines to the commander of an individual unit -- a few years ago you would have been flung in jail for that kind of list -- but also that undoubtedly worthy people hope that appeals of this kind today can stop a particular political action. I do not want to accuse anyone, much less defend anyone. I just want one thing -- a truce in this war of nerves and mind-blowing information. I realize that it is pointless urging politicians to behave nobly, but perhaps journalists can do so by declaring a moratorium on reports that cause political explosions.
