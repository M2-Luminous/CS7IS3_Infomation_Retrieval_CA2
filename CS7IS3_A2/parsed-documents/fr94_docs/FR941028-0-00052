FR941028-0-00052 FR941028-0-00009 Whether a settlement is adequate will be a function of the entire context of a particular case. Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, whether the settling owner or controller has performed required reclamation to abate the violations other than the delinquent civil penalties in a timely manner. The regulatory authority should also consider the degree to which the facts indicate that the owner or controller had the authority to exercise control of the violator. If the owner or controller had such authority, whether it chose to exercise such authority or not, it is less credible for the owner or controller to argue that it was unaware of the activities and violations such that a significant discount in civil penalty amount is warranted for the owner or controller. In substance, with such authority, the owner or controller would have had the ability to be informed of violations in a timely manner if he or she had wanted to be so informed. The regulatory authority should also consider the size and solvency of the owner or controller and the impact that the payment of a reduced amount of the civil penalty will have upon the activities of that company and other companies similarly situated. Further, the regulatory authority should consider the impact of the settlement upon the integrity of the regulatory authority's enforcement program. In other words, will the proposed settlement encourage companies to conclude that there is an economic benefit in ignoring the civil penalties and violations of their owned or controlled entities until such companies are required to settle by regulatory authorities? In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has not adopted the provisions of the proposed rule which would have deleted the presumption that NOV abatement currently contained in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) and which would have created a safe harbor for owners or controllers with respect to delinquent civil penalties for violations cited prior to October 3, 1988. In paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule, OSM has inserted language providing for a presumption of NOV abatement for NOV's whose abatement periods have not yet expired where the permit applicants have certified that such NOV's are in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation. In the final rule, OSM has also deleted the language contained in the proposed rule which would have provided the safe harbor for certain owners or controllers. OSM has otherwise adopted the provisions of the proposed rule as the final rule. Section 773.20_Improvidently Issued Permits: General Procedures. In the proposed rule, OSM proposed to amend paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 30 CFR 773.20 to delete the reference to the presumption of NOV abatement contained in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). See Proposed Rule, Use of the Applicant/Violator Computer System in Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval, 56 FR 45780, 45784&hyph;45785 (September 6, 1991). The basis for such deletion was to assure consistency with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) which were to be similarly amended. In the final rule, OSM has reinserted language which addresses the situation which occurs when a permit is issued in reliance upon the presumption that an NOV is being abated in the absence of a cessation order and a cessation order is, in fact, issued with respect to the violation. In such an event, a regulatory authority is required to find that the permit has been improvidently issued. The September, 1991, proposed rule deleted this language to assure consistency with OSM's proposal to delete the presumption of NOV abatement from the permit review process of 30 CFR 773.15(b). As described in this preamble in the discussion relating to 30 CFR 773.15(b), OSM has decided to include a presumption of NOV abatement for that regulation. To assure consistency between the treatment of improvidently issued permits and permit applications, OSM has reinserted language which addresses the presumption of NOV abatement into 30 CFR 773.20(b)(1)(i)(B). The agency's reasons for retaining a presumption of NOV abatement are described fully in the preamble discussion with respect to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
