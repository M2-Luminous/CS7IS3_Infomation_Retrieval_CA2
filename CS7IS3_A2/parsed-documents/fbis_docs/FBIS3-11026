Cheek thus confirmed what was reported by CLARIN on 14 March. In order that Gore's proposal not sound like diplomatic pressure, Secretary for the Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto Lestelle said "it is very probable" that Gore and President Menem will discuss this sensitive subject. "There is absolute coordination between Argentina and the United States on this subject," Lestelle pointed out. During a news conference on 14 March to report on Gore's agenda here, Cheek said the "United States has been suggesting and endorsing the laws approved by Congress that, I understand, are supported by the Argentine Government and the majority of Congress." In order to clarify any doubt, the U.S. ambassador added: "We have stressed the need for the approval of these laws in order to give the Argentine Government the necessary cooperation." In this manner, Cheek referred to the draft bills that create the status of repentant, informer, undercover agent, and controlled delivery of drug shipments, which the powerful DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) demands to make the struggle against drug trafficking in our country "more efficient." DEA experts believe that with these new laws drug traffickers can be fought "more efficiently." Besides asking to approve these laws, Washington also wants the military to give their logistical support to the security forces in this struggle, although it understands that "for the time being" it is not necessary. U.S. Antinarcotics Under Secretary Robert Gelbard [title as published] last week gave signals about these two subjects to officials from the Argentine Foreign and Interior Ministries and the Secretariat for the Prevention of Drug Abuse. Following a ceremony in the Communications Secretariat headed by Oscar Gonzalez, Ambassador Cheek referred to the U.S. interest in the approval of a law including, among other subjects, the status of repentant. The U.S. concern over these laws began to be expressed mainly after the Mar del Plata Penal Court for Economic Crimes released Colombian John Arroyave Arias, who was involved in the Shrimp Operation. After learning about Cheek's statements, Lestelle said he believes the draft bill he sent to Congress 20 days ago "will be approved before the end of the year, if the congressmen decide so." Lestelle added: "We rejected a draft bill approved by the lower house because it lacks the status of repentant." Radical Civic Union [UCR] congressmen nonetheless unleashed a storm. UCR Deputy Gaston Ortiz Maldonado, vice president of the Chamber of Deputies Drug Addiction Committee, labeled Lestelle's decision to send a new draft bill to Congress as "untimely" given that the lower house already had approved a bill he himself drafted.
