We participants in the joint meeting send this letter to South Korean authorities, political parties, individual figures, and overseas compatriots from a sheer desire to jointly open the nation's way [chillo] with the strength of the united 70 million compatriots under the grave situation in which the nation's well-being [annyong] and the country's reunification cause are faced with a severe threat [omjunghi wihyop tanghago innun]. It is the 70 million compatriots' firm will and a solemn request by the national history to realize reunification in the nineties by achieving the great unity of the whole nation. Today, when the 49th annual layer is being added to the history of national division, what is coming closer to our people is not the reunification of the country, but the danger of war, nuclear war. War would only bring a disaster to both the North and the South, giving no advantage to either side. It is too late to regard war, which is coming closer to the people, as just a danger, and we have no time to only worry about the situation without doing nothing. Today's grave situation was derived by the nuclear commotion by outside forces and the bellicose forces following them, and has reached a more dangerous phase because of their worthless maneuver of stepping it up gradually [mumohan kyedansik hwaktae chaektong]. We presented the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, a milestone of reconciliation and unity, in April 1993 to prevent the creation of this situation and have made all sincere efforts to realize the program. The danger of war, which will make outside forces gain the third party's profit and will result in the ruin of the whole nation, would not have come to our country if the South Korean authorities had responded to [houng] our program of the great national unity and held our hands, their fellow countrymen. All compatriots cannot forget the bitter historic lesson from illustrious officials of our country who brought the ruin of the country by betraying fellow countrymen to collude with outside forces in the past. The South Korean authorities, however, are going to revive [chaehyon] the history. This is intolerable. We must prevent war, a national disaster, in any way. The way to prevent it can be seen only in achieving the great unity of the whole nation. The great unity of the whole nation is indeed the best way [kajang hullyunghan chillo] of the nation, which enables us to break through today's difficult situation, to maintain peace of the country, and to open the road to the fatherland's reunification. The 10-point program of great unity of the whole country for national reunification put forward by the respected President Kim Il-song shows such an excellent solution for our fellow countrymen. With its great tractive force and just and fair nature, the 10-point program of great unity of the whole country is enjoying more active support and sympathy from all Korean compatriots with each passing day. There is no reason that one cannot support the program today, which is being supported by all Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas, even if one ignored it in the past. The position toward the 10-point program of great unity of the whole country will be a touchstone distinguishing between unity and confrontation in our country, between peace and war, and between reunification and division. Today when the danger of war--the nuclear war--is near at hand before the nation, if one denies the great unity of the country by presenting differences in ideologies, ideals, and systems, it will be a grave antinational crime of seeking confrontation, war, and division. The 10-point program of great unity of the whole country is a common national guideline and chapter which gives unity, peace, and reunification to our people. Proceeding from the desire to achieve this program, we earnestly propose that a national conference be held in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of the 15 August national liberation anniversary this year, one year before its 50th anniversary. Representatives of the authorities, political parties, and public organizations, as well as individual figures, in the North and the South, who can reflect the will of the whole country in conformity with the nature and purpose of the conference, as well as representatives of overseas compatriots, can participate in the national meeting with equal standings, irrespective of differences in their political views, religion, affiliated organizations, and positions. The national conference can frankly discuss various issues for the nation's peace and reunification, including practical measures to promote great unity of the whole country. If the national conference is convened, the people and figures from all walks of life in the North and the South, opening up their hearts, can confirm that they are the same people who share the same blood, and can promote great unity. Thus, they can seek a shortcut for expeditiously achieving reunification in the nineties by uniting the nation's wisdom and will and by transcending differences in ideologies, ideals, political views, and religion. With a view to successfully ensuring the national conference, we recognize that formation of a preparatory committee for the national conference, made up of five representatives respectively from the North, the South and overseas, is necessary. The preparatory committee for the national conference can hold its first meeting in Pyongyang or Seoul in May; can decide on the date and place of the national meeting, as well as the method of the meeting; and can discuss other working-level matters concerning convocation and operation of the conference. We also believe it is good to have bilateral and multilateral contacts between compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas in order to adjust their opinions before convocation of the historic national conference. We express the hope that the compatriots in the South and overseas will actively respond to our proposal for convening the national conference, which proceeded from a position of lofty patriotism. [Signed] The joint conference of the government, political parties, and public organizations in the DPRK for expediting the independent and peaceful reunification of the nation by thoroughly accomplishing the 10-point program of great unity of the whole country for national reunification. [Date] 11 April 1994, Pyongyang
