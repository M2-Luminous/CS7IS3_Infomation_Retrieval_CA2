Who is the initiator of this project? [Shumeyko] The initiative to conclude the treaty between the Kaliningrad Oblast administration and the federal government belongs to the Security Council. I would like to emphasize that the Potsdam Agreement has no time limit. However, some politicians use its 50th anniversary to raise the issue of Kaliningrad's status, claiming that the term of this agreement expires because the USSR and Stalin no longer exist. Furthermore, they state that Russia is not the legal heir to the Soviet Union, and Kaliningrad Oblast could become a German protectorate or a separate state. At the same time, some propose setting up a demilitarized zone on the territory of Kaliningrad Oblast because the presence of troops allegedly blocks economic development, and so on. Therefore, the Security Council decided to sign this agreement. [Reporter] What provisions will the agreement include? Will relations be altered? [Shumeyko] The power and rights to be relegated by the federal government to the local authorities correspond to the equivalent volume of power and rights to be handed over by local authorities to the federal government. Thus, the Security Council came to the conclusion that currently it is expedient to relegate as much power as possible to the local administration to enable it to react operatively and timely to any developments. Instant and adequate reaction by the local authorities to every development in this area is of key importance for Russia. Hence, we will thoroughly prepare this agreement. We will properly decide what functions should be relegated and which of them should remain under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.
