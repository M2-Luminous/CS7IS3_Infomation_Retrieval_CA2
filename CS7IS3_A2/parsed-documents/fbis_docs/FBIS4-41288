The statement demanded that Estonian authorities give residence permits to all persons registered as residents before July 1990, except those categories of residents listed in the aliens law as ineligible, military retirees among them. Pyotr Rozhok, chairman of Russian community in Estonia's committee on Russian citizens' problems and representative of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia, now issued a counter-statement declaring that his organization actually wants permanent residence permits for all non-citizens who lived permanently in Estonia before July 1993 when the aliens law was adopted. Rozhok claimed Russian community in Estonia had forbidden Zybin to speak on behalf of the organization. In his opinion, the Yugantsov-Zybin statement actually supported "deportation of military pensioners." Today's statement was signed, besides Rozhok, by Zybin's deputy, Stanislav Mikhailov, and another Russian Community leader, Yuri Kotenkov.
