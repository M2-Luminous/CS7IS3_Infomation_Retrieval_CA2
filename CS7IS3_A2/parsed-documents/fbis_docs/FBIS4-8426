Afterwards they were joined by other members of the delegations and after the talks which are now over, and which lasted several hours, the two ministers spoke to journalists.

This relates above all to the implementation of the Washington agreement and the inclusion of the Serbs in the negotiations on a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
