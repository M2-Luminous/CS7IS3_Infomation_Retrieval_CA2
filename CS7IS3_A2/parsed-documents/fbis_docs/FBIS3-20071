Even so prospects are not bad, as is made clear in the report from Nacho Hernandez, who has been attending the meeting for Radio Exterior de Espana. [Hernandez] This meeting in Ioannina closes with the rudiments of a compromise on the institutional reform of the European Union. Any formula will have to be first approved by the governments of the member countries. If that happens the agreement will come next Wednesday [30 March]. It would be a political declaration giving every guarantee that negotiations on a question will continue, that all necessary efforts will be made, for a reasonable period of time in a case where three countries representing a total of 23 votes are opposed. This is the formula which, as Foreign Minister Javier Solana recalled, our country has defended: [Begin Solana recording] I see some reactions from some of the people who have spoken that are very negative toward our position and toward the potential text, and I believe it shows the effort we are making. I believe it is a symptom that the text is in the right direction for us [as heard]. [end recording] [Hernandez] Spain believes the final agreement will come about next Wednesday. We ended this meeting, Minister Solana said, in the spirit of finding a formula that will enable us to get along together. The difficulties, he added, may now come from countries which have maintained an unflexible stance -- that would be Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. [passage omitted]
