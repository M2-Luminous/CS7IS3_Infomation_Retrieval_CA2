During this session, the Standing Committee examined several issues and developments on the national scene, particularly the recent developments in our country in light of the finalization of the document of pledge and accord by the Political Forces Dialogue Committee to overcome the crisis and build the Yemeni state as well as the positive supportive stand declared toward this document by the GPC. The conferees also discussed a number of organizational issues as well as the missions and tasks the GPC will undertake during the forthcoming phase. The session was opened by Koranic recitations. Brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and GPC secretary general, then delivered a speech, noting the importance of this extraordinary session of the GPC Standing Committee, and highlighting the critical issues it is examining, chief among which is the accord document initialed by the parties to the Political Forces Dialogue Committee. He said that our people are currently on the threshold of an important historical phase after the realization of their great accomplishment on 22 May 1990. He added: Right now, we are meeting while our people are looking forward, with strong hopes and great confidence, to ending the regrettable crisis which surfaced on 19 August 1993, and which we never sought in the first place. This crisis has caused immense devastation. It has been a terrible nightmare that weighed heavily on the minds of the people, who have been caused a great deal of suffering, the brother Presidential Council chairman maintained. The chairman of the Presidential Council and the GPC secretary general added: When unity was achieved, we agreed to follow the best way in our experiment to build a new Yemen. We also agreed to follow positive courses in this experiment. He added: The crises are not part of these positive courses. There were many good mechanisms that could have been followed in the fields of development, administration, and building the individual. Also, there are many positive courses that could be followed in building streets, establishing the basic structures of development, founding educational academies, and exploiting resources. Salih said: What calls for pride is that the GPC has always championed these mechanisms and has played a prominent role in achieving many of the achievements witnessed by all Yemenis. The mechanism of the GPC was that of building and construction, promoting the standards of individuals, safeguarding the people's blood and rights, and respecting their rights, Salih maintained. The GPC has always shown love and tolerance to all out of its concern for the higher interests of the homeland and people. It also cooperated with the honest and good national forces to build Yemen's prosperous future. Salih added that the GPC has a clear record full of good intentions and sacrifices for the homeland, and full of tolerance and amity among its members and with others. The GPC has embodied the strong commitment to democracy within its ranks and in dealing with others, and has pioneered the entrenching of political pluralism within the party's framework. The party has provided a national umbrella for all to work for a secure, unified, and prosperous homeland. The brother president said: The crisis and all its repercussions--the likes of which the homeland had never witnessed throughout its contemporary history--constituted a clear circumvention of constitutional legitimacy and the results of the parliamentary elections held on 27 April 1993, which represented the shining image of the great unity achievement. However, we hope that the document of pledge and accord will be the means for resolving the crisis and deterring those who want to harm the homeland, its unity, and democratic march. We have to begin a new stage in which everyone shoulders his responsibilities concerning the practical implementation of the document, and everyone devotes himself to construction and development rather than continuing these repeated crises, the reasons for which we all know, as well as those responsible for them. President Salih said: Sanaa, the political capital of united Yemen, which embraced all the Yemeni homeland's sons throughout the stages of national struggle for liberation from British tyranny and colonialism, will continue to be the city of peace and steadfastness, and will continue to embrace unity. Sanaa will also embrace all parties, the same as it embraced the revolution and the republican system and protected them in the face of all challenges and all hostile attacks launched by the revolution's enemies in the 1960's and 1970's. He said: On 22 May 1990 we began a new stage, and we should eliminate the consequences of the past mentality and the remnants of the totalitarian regime. We should never allow the mentality of conspiracy, bloody coups, and ideological and political terrorism to return or dominate our new life. Today, we call on GPC cadres and supporters to prepare to be--as our people have known them to be--at the forefront of the national fold, shouldering their responsibilities efficiently and sincerely to safeguard unity and democracy, and to grasp and interact with the facts and all national and international changes in a manner that meets our people's aspirations for progress and prosperity. They should always be the strong defenders of unity and democracy. He said: We highly appreciate the efforts made by the Political Forces Dialogue Committee, and applaud the role played by the GPC representative within the framework of the committee. We hope that the political forces, led by the GPC, the Yemeni Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, will intensify their efforts to implement the document. This is the real test of credibility and intentions, and this requires unity of political will and collective efforts by all constitutional establishments to shoulder their duties in an effective manner in order to implement the document. The brother president said: We call on all political forces, social figures, intellectuals, and all the homeland's sons to comprehend well the dangers facing the homeland, and to be united in the face of all those who try to divide the national fold or endanger our national and homeland's unity. We should move to the stage of construction rather than harmful political disputes. He who calls for sectarianism is not one of us because we are a united Yemeni people and all of us shoulder the responsibility for maintaining the unity of the ranks and homeland. The Standing Committee discussed several important national and organizational issues on its agenda, as well as developments relating to the political crisis. The committee will continue its discussions tomorrow, Monday.
