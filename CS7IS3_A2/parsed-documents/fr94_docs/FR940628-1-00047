FR940628-1-00047 FR940628-1-00010 We also request comments on whether an employee's stock or other non-salary financial interests in the applicant institution should be covered. This is of particular relevance when the grant or contract is with a for-profit enterprise. Specifically, should we be concerned, and how could we expect the company to ``manage'' against conflict, when the company's employees obviously stand to benefit if the product is a commercial success? The proposed rule includes an exemption for an ownership interest in the institution if it is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) applicant. Can we justify exempting SBIR awards and not all other awards to both large and small profit-making enterprises? Should we exempt from disclosure any equity or ownership interest in the applicant institution? Should we exempt disclosure of interests other than bonuses or other compensation tied to the outcome of the research? II. Burdens Upon Applicants The proposed regulation is intended to minimize reporting and other burdens upon applicants to the maximum extent feasible. Certain types or amounts of financial interests that cannot be reasonably expected to bias the research are excluded from the requirements for disclosure by investigators. Such interests are also excluded from the certification of whether these are Significant Financial Interests that must accompany each application. Even when there is a Significant Financial Interest of the type specified in the proposed rule, the institutions are given broad discretion in managing the conflict; details of the interest need not be reported to the PHS awarding component. It is the responsibility of that component to determine whether to review the institutional records relating to the disclosure and management of that interest. The Department will also seek to reduce burdens upon applicants by being available to provide advice and assistance as applicants establish the policies and procedures required by this subpart. The PHS Awarding Components will be available to respond to general inquiries regarding compliance with this subpart. Another way of reducing burdens upon applicants is to exempt certain types of applicants from the requirements or to impose different, less burdensome requirements on them. The proposed ยง50.602 provides that the regulations do not apply to SBIR Phase I applications and that where the applicant for a research grant is an individual, determinations of the procedures to be followed to ensure the objectivity of the research will be made on a case-by-case basis. The National Science Foundation (NSF) exempts from its Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy that is being published in this issue of the Federal Register grantees employing fifty persons or less. Comment on whether HHS should adopt a similar exclusion is requested. Our experiences with conflict of interest situations indicate that investigators working for small entities may be just as subject to conflicts of interest as investigators working at large institutions. The interests of appropriate coverage and of reducing burdens might both be served by determining the procedures to be followed by small entities on a case-by-case basis as is proposed for individuals.
