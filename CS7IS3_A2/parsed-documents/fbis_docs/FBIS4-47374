A. Reshetov, A. B. Karasev and G. A. Savin; UDC 528.711.1.(15)] [Abstract] Remote sensing activities in Russia are reviewed. Past achievements are summarized and the ongoing work is discussed in detail. The collection and sale of remote sensing data constitute a potential source of foreign exchange and it is the intention to make these materials available on the world market. Collaboration with the developing countries will also be stressed. However, the even more important role played by remote sensing materials in the development of the Russian economy is emphasized (exploration for mineral resources, environmental protection, etc.). The following are regarded as the immediate objectives in the field of development of detailed observation subsystems: modernization of the Resurs-FI and Resurs-FII satellites (1994-1996) for increasing their technical-economic efficiency by improving resolution on the ground by 20-40%, increasing the area of the survey from one vehicle and lengthening its lifetime; activation (1993-1994) of a new vehicle of the Resurs-F series with a ground resolution better than 5 m; flight tests (1996-1997) of a new vehicle of the Resurs-F series which will replace the Resurs-FI and F-II (work on creating the new vehicle is being funded by the Russian Space Agency); adaptation of the information received from the new vehicles to the tasks of different departments; modernization of the surface complex for the interbranch processing of information to a level which will make it possible to draw a wide range of Russian entrepreneurs into the subsequent processing and application of the results; development and introduction of technologies for the digital processing of satellite images within the framework of geoinformation systems for the production of precise cartographic materials oriented on the needs of planning and control agencies, search for and evaluation of natural resources and environmental monitoring. Russia must be prepared for active participation in the international satellite information market. The Russian government and companies, especially the Priroda State Center, are ready to cooperate with companies in other countries in marketing of products developed using Russian remote sensing systems.
