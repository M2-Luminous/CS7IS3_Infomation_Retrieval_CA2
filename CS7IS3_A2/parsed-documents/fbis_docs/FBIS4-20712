Poverty has "retreated markedly in Tunisia." This is what Mr. Abdellatif Ben Kilani, director at the Ministry of Social Affairs, stated at the national seminar on food and nutrition policy planning recently organized in Tunis by the Ministry of Agriculture, with the collaboration of the Ministry of Health and the FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization]. Presenting a study on the present status and the future of the National Program of Aid to Needy Families (PNAFN), Mr. Ben Kilani indicated that, based on the threshold calculated by the National Statistics Institute (INS), "the underprivileged percentage dropped from 33 percent in 1967 to 22.2 percent in 1975, from 12.9 percent in 1980 to 7.7 percent in 1985, and to 6.7 percent in 1990, representing 82,000 families at present, or about 544,000 individuals." The official commented on the phenomenon, ascribing it to the country's economic growth as well as to "a genuine political will to fight poverty, which resulted in many programs" being implemented. The officials classified these programs according to their goals: prevention, integration, or assistance. For instance, "some programs specifically geared to the poor provide direct aid or subsidies and support the creation of income sources. Others, universal in scope, play a decisive part in fighting poverty, either by preserving the purchasing power or by improving living conditions. Others, finally, aim rather to prevent poverty," the official explained. As a result, during the Seventh Plan (1987-1991), State expenditures in this respect totaled 18 percent of the GDP, or D12,140,000. This is a very high figure, the official noted. Yet, he pointed out, "the State's efforts to eradicate poverty go beyond mere operational programs and also take the form of legislative measures." Among these, Mr. Ben Kilani mentioned "tax exemptions granted to lowest income categories and specific benefits with respect to credit, which result in a considerable loss of revenues for the State." The official also mentioned "policies with an obvious social dimension, such as education, vocational training, or family planning, which have an immediate or deferred impact on the disadvantaged." Direct efforts to assist needy families through regular or occasional aid are easier to quantify. As an example of occasional aid for the year 1992, the official quoted the following figures: - D3.606 million were distributed to 40,000 needy families on the occasion of religious holidays; - D15.5 million were distributed at the beginning of the school year, on behalf of 305,000 students from needy families. This, of course, was in addition to aid in kind, such as meals provided by the IFTAR [expansion not given]. As for regular aid, it includes essentially food provided to poor young students in the most disadvantaged areas. This is subsidized in part by the World Food Program [WFP], with the State paying for the rest. Thus, the official mentioned that 1,350 school cafeterias currently provide meals for 223,480 primary school students, i.e.,16.3 percent of all primary school students. As far as cash is concerned, regular aid is mostly provided by the PNAFN. It is intended for "families that are totally destitute and without resources, large families with limited resources, and the old or handicapped with no one to support them." In his speech, Mr. Ben Kilani analyzed the PNAFN components, adding a few recommendations on how to improve its services. The program, he indicated, covered 101,000 families in 1992. Each family received on the average D250, i.e., a 178-percent increase compared with 1987. [Box, p 3] A Profile of the Disadvantaged What are actually the characteristics of Tunisian disadvantaged populations? Referring to the 1990 INS survey, Mr. Abdellatif Ben Kilani, director at the Ministry of Social Affairs, made the following observations: - "The disadvantaged represent a very variable percentage of the population, depending on the social class and job category of the household head: 19 percent among the unemployed active population, and 2 percent among craftsmen and independent workers. Actually, in addition to these two categories, poverty affects nonfarm workers (249,000), farm workers (98,000), retired and other nonactive individuals (51,000), and farmers (32,000)." - "Since the last decade, poverty has assumed new forms; in fact, it has become more urban than rural (67 percent currently compared with 33 percent during the first two decades)." - "It affects not only those who cannot work, but also women and workers in the informal sector." - "The poverty rate exceeds 10 percent in the west while remaining below 5 percent in coastal areas."
