It is perhaps for the first time in the history of Belarusian journalism that we address you with those words. The newspapers that we happen to manage reflect political and socioeconomic processes in different ways. Sometimes, reality receives utterly contrary assessments. This is only normal. A diversity of opinions is one of the main illustrations of social democratization. However, the time has come for all disagreements to be put aside. The Belarusian press has found itself on the brink of ruin! Recent days have seen yet another steep jump in paper prices, now running between 8 and 10 million rubles [R] per tonne. In addition, rental payments and prices for printing materials, publishing, and transportation services have all increased considerably. The costs of publishing a large-circulation newspaper are nearing R1 billion a week. Subscription revenues are only enough for a few days. It stands to reason that while setting prices for our publications, we tried to make them affordable for all segments of society. This is a goal any civilized state should seek. Unfortunately, neither advertising nor other forms of commercial activities, to which our papers are forced to resort, can ensure the continued existence for the press. We have repeatedly called upon parliament and the government to undertake urgent measures to protect openness. Top priority measures include: compensating postal workers for newspaper shipments, distributions, and deliveries; support of printing enterprises; a centrally managed system of paper distribution; and lower taxes. Regrettably, our requests have not been heard. The situation that has now taken shape forces us to suspend publication of our newspapers. This is not a strike, even though there are grounds to call one. However, aware of the great responsibility assumed by the press during the presidential campaign, we, for the time being, decline from applying this legal tool to protect our civil and professional rights. Editorial staffs continue to work as normal, and are ready to resume publication as soon as a way out the present deadlock is found. Dear Readers: Our conscientiousness is clear in front of you -- we have done everything possible... We will also do the impossible, and will try to publish issues devoted to May Day [1 May] and Victory Day [9 May], so that we do not spoil your festive mood. [Signed] Igor Osinskiy, SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA chief editor; Iosif Seredich, NARODNAYA GAZETA chief editor; Vladimir Narkevich, ZVYAZDA chief editor; Nikolay Shloma, MINSKAYA PRAWDA chief editor.
