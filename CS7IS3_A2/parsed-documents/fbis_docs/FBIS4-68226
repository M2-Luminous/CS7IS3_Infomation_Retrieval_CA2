Sensational Document Falls Into KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's Hands"] [Text] Information Memorandum "On State of Affairs in the Northern Fleet" 1. General Evaluation of the State of the Northern Fleet and of the Problem of Ensuring the Combat Activity of the Fleet's Forces and the Social Protection of Servicemen and Their Families and Civilian Personnel The Northern Fleet is one of the most powerful and modern of the Russian Federation Armed Forces' operational-strategic formations.... At the present time the Northern Fleet is the only force capable of opposing the NATO countries' naval groupings in the North Atlantic region. The fleet's role in, and responsibility for, the defense of the Russian Federation's economic interests in the transpolar region is increasing because of the exploitation of oil and gas reserves on the continental shelf, the protection of fishing, the escort of transarctic crossings and ships traveling from Europe to the Far East and Southeast Asia, and also the provision of reliable cover for access to the world's oceans. The viability and combat effectiveness of the fleet depend on full and timely financing. However, in recent times the Russian Federation Ministries of Finance and Defense have been implementing only partial financing of the Northern Fleet. The shortage of money has led to a 45 percent reduction in the Northern Fleet's ships and vessels since 1988. Industry delivers only two combatant ships every year. At the same time more than 50 ships were decommissioned in 1991-1993. Special alarm is caused by the state of the recycling of nuclear submarines, the storage and reprocessing of radioactive waste, and by questions of radiation and ecological safety. The irregularity of finance and the inability to pay suppliers is causing serious breakdowns in the provision of fuels and lubricants to the fleet. The absence of a mechanism for the practical implementation of individual articles of the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen" for the provision of social and legal guarantees and privileges to servicemen and their families, and also delays in payment and indexation of wages and allowances, are having a detrimental effect on the vital activity and morale of the fleet's naval and civilian personnel.... The cadre problem has become acute -- as a result of the exodus of the population from the Kola Peninsula to the countries of the CIS and the Russian Federation's central oblasts a great shortage of skilled specialists has arisen in the maintenance services and subdepartments which ensure the vital activity of Northern Fleet garrisons. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the most qualified specialists are moving into local administration structures because of the low level of pay in comparison with similar services in the Russian Federation's housing and utilities sector. The difficulties of maintaining the fleet's personnel levels at full strength are growing. Analysis of the young replacement recruits arriving on the ships showed a sharp reduction in the qualities exhibited by draftees. The number of servicemen with health defects and inadequate physical development has grown significantly (from 1.2 percent to 6.7 percent), and the number of new-arrivals with disproportionate heights and weights has increased. One in five young seamen are guilty of deviant behavior; one in six were brought up in single-parent families, mainly by the mother.... On Ship Repairs and the Recycling of Ships and Radioactive Waste In 1993 the Northern Fleet had 332 ships in need of repair. These included 35 nuclear submarines, seven diesel submarines, 39 surface ships, and 251 service craft. On the basis of the quantity of money allocated only 21 combatant ships were sent for repairs. Thus the fleet's total repair requirements were met by 27 percent. The repair of auxiliary fleet ships is a cause for special alarm. With a total requirement of 5.0 billion rubles [R] and $40 million for these purposes only R283 million were allocated in 1993, which constitutes 3.8 percent. This state of affairs could lead to failures in ensuring the fleet's combat effectiveness by as early as 1995. At the same time it is essential to bear in mind that as of today 42 percent of ships have completed their regulation service lives and are liable to be withdrawn from the fleet, while the period between repairs has been allowed to overrun for 53 percent of ships. There are 112 foreign-built ships in the fleet. The routine repairs of more than 70 of these are overdue. Since 1993 these ships have ceased to be sent abroad for repairs because of the lack of hard currency appropriations.... In order to fulfill the recycling program and the START treaties, appropriations at the level of R899.0 million (in current prices) are needed. In 1993 the fleet received R1,566,700,000 (17.4 percent of the sum requested). A critical situation has arisen in the fleet over the removal of spent nuclear fuel. In 1992 the fleet ended the practice of dumping liquid and solid radioactive waste in the sea. The temporary storage areas for solid radioactive waste are completely full.... Because of the absence of finance for the capital construction of storage facilitiesfor spent nuclear fuels and a permanent special-purpose wharf [statsionarnyy tekhnologicheskiy prichal] in the Andreyev and Nerpichye inlets and for the repair and modernization of the railroad from Kola Station to Nerpichye Station, the fleet cannot begin the removal of spent nuclear fuel in the new ecologically safe TK-18 containers.... On Missile and Artillery Weapons Efficiency in the solution of questions regarding the repair of missile and artillery weapon components and the replenishment of spare parts, tools, and accessories kits has sharply deteriorated. Since January 1991 the Navy Armored Tank Supply Service has failed to achieve the task of supplying the Northern fleet with new MAZ-537 tow trucks to replace those whose engine life has expired.... The fleet has four floating cranes left which are permitted to be used on operations involving special-category freights; new ones are not being delivered.... The cranes are being stretched to the maximum. Their failure would entail the end of work with special-category freights.... The problem of recycling arms and munitions currently in operation at Northern Fleet bases and storehouses is acute. A large number of missiles for which there are no carriers has accumulated.... On Mines and Torpedos It is essential to accelerate the production of mines and antimine weapons at the Russian Federation's defense industry plants in the cities of St. Petersburg, Perm, Votkinsk, and Yekaterinburg, where the necessary production facilities exist. This is connected with the fact that the chief plants for the production of these weapons are in Kazakhstan, and arms production at them has already ceased. There is no possibility of replenishing arms reserves in the fleet.... On Supplying Fuels and Lubricants In connection with the fleet's monetary debts to industrial enterprises, supplies of petroleum products and solid fuel to the fleet have virtually ceased. The fleet received 68 percent of its diesel fuel requirement in 1993. There are not sufficient tanks to store fuel.... On the Maritime Engineering Service At the present time worker and employee manning levels in the Northern Fleet's communal services stand on average at 20-30 percent. In order to maintain the stock of housing and barracks and communal facilities in proper running order the command authorities have been forced to divert personnel to the aforementioned work. This is seriously detrimental to the combat training and combat readiness of the fleet's units. Given the existing personnel shortage (around 40 percent), people are being seriously physically overstretched.... In view of the manning levels and the technical condition of the ships, the fleet is delivering only 36 percent of the planned level of stocks, including 50 percent (52,000 tonnes) of liquid fuel requirements and 17 percent (15,000) of dry freight requirements by means of its own resources; hence the fleet is forced every year to hire ships from civilian ship owners, which requires additional monetary expenditure, including of hard currency. The fleet does not have ships of its own capable of transporting the necessary amount of freight. Of the 50 transport ships the fleet needs, it actually has just 35 (70 percent), among which 19 (54 percent) have completed their regulation service lives and are due to be written off. On Clothing Supplies At the present time, because of shortfalls in supplies from industry of a large number of items of military dress, the situation as regards the provision of clothing to the fleet's forces remains tense. Thus, for example, supplies of fur jackets for submariners meet 1 percent of requirements, supplies of footwear, 76 percent of requirements. On Food Supplies The nonfulfillment of the Russian Federation President's directive "On the Abolition of Advance Payment for Products (Commodities) Delivered to Regions of the Far North and Equivalent Localities" is leading to increasing difficulties in providing food for personnel. The safekeeping of food is a pressing problem, owing to the shortage of storage capacities. In individual garrisons there are shortages of up to 30 percent of the storehouses, depots, and refrigerators that are required. The material-technical base of military trade remains a tricky problem. In garrisons in Pechenga, Vysokiy, Kilp-Yavr, Afrikanda, Korzunovo, and Kildin Island, and others, 70 percent of enterprises are housed in delapidated, unadapted premises built before the war. On the Provision of Housing The Northern Fleet has a sufficient material and technical base and sufficient personnel to construct and commission the necessary facilities.... However, questions of funding housing construction today encroach extremely painfully on the interests not only of people, but also of production units. Social tension is growing in the labor collectives of "Sevvoyenmorstroy".... On Ensuring the Social Protection of Servicemen and Their Families The adoption of a package of laws on the social protection of servicemen and their families has been positively received in the Northern Fleet. However, the adopted laws of the "military" package are not yet operating fully.... On Closed Administrative-Territorial Enities The majority of the Northern Fleet's remote garrisons have the status of closed administrative-territorial entities. The peculiarities of life in these entities require an increased level of budget finance and additional social protection measures, privileges, and guarantees provided at state level. Analysis shows that the Russian Federation Law "On the Closed Administrative-Territorial Entity" is not being fully implemented. Appeals received from inhabitants of the cities of Murmansk-140, Murmansk-150, and the settlement of Vidyayevo reflect the most typical socioeconomic problems of the Northern Fleet's remote garrisons. These appeals (they are forwarded to the apparatus of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers-Government) demand the adoption of additional measures to ensure the implementation of the law. Our Commentary The Northern Fleet was in 1993 recognized as the best fleet of the Russian Federation. The authors of the memorandum -- high-ranking Russian military men -- try in the language of facts and figures to explain to the State Duma and the minister of defense that the country could soon be deprived of its most combat-effective fleet, and thus by the end of the century be without a proper maritime strategic defense system. Unfortunately, this is happening at a time when, in accordance with the START-II treaty, the proportion of the sea-launched grouping of ICBM's in Russia is doubling. Perhaps the situation in the world has thawed to such a degree that other countries have kissed their navies goodbye? It would appear not: In the United States, for example, more than 100 ships are being commissioned in 1993-1995, including three aircraft carriers, seven missile-carrying submarines, 18 nuclear multi-purpose submarines, eight cruisers, 16 destroyers, three amphibious warships, three acoustic research ships, and seven tankers. This is no accident: Any state that pretends to the role of a great power must ensure its naval power. So, is it possible to resolve the Northern Fleet's problems under real economic conditions? One method was proposed at a session of the Interdepartmental Commission for Defense Security held 28 April under the chairmanship of A. Kokoshin. The proposal was to derive funds to set up a new infrastructure for the Northern Fleet on the basis of "centers of growth" of industrial production and the diversification of military-industrial complex enterprises and through the subsequent increase of the tax base and the influx of private money. The minimum number of ultramodern combatant ships in the fleet will be determined on the basis of national security interests, and the full support of these ships with auxiliary vessels and shore services should eliminate the disproportion between the combatant ships' requirements and the possibilities of servicing them. All the same the impression arises that moods leading, to put it mildly, to the underestimation of the role of a strong Navy -- which is designed to support Russia's strategic interests -- have gained the upper hand in the country's military-political leadership. All the attention of several Ministry of Defense leaders is today focused on mobile forces, and the backbone of these forces -- Airborne Troops, which are intended to be the basis of Russia's military might. However, it is no secret that mobile forces are designed primarily for fighting an internal enemy. Does this mean that danger to Russia from without no longer exists?
