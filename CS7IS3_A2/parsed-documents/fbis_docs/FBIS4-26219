Even in the teeth of wintry winds she doesn't give up the work. The reason is simple: It earns her much more than she makes in her other job at a cotton-spinning factory, which is choking on its debts. As a vendor, she earns about 1,000 yuan ($115) a month, 10 times what she gets from the factory. "I just idle time away in my factory because I have little to do. Our products do not sell well, and the inventory is big," she said. "Many of us workers try to get extra pay from moonlighting." Liu is one of the millions of textile workers feeling the squeeze of quasi-unemployment. They stay at work even though there's little to do. They draw pay that is extremely humble, and getting even worse as inflation continues to spiral upward. More than 15 million workers are employed in China's 50,000 textile enterprises. But in 39 major cities about half of the State textile factories are running in the red. According to the most recent statistics, these enterprises lost 1.58 billion yuan ($182 million) in the first 10 months of 1993. Manufacturing is so decayed that the China National Textile Council, which governs the industry, has had to lease out some of its vacant offices in its Beijing headquarters to flourishing companies, both Chinese and foreign, that are engaged in healthier trades. Many industry officials who once cherished their administrative power have "jumped into the sea"--plunged into the bracing waters of free enterprise. Du Yuzhou, vice-chairman of the ministerial-level China Council of Textile Industry, admitted that efficiency and exports are slipping. Exports grew by 6 per cent last year to $22 billion, but were offset by a flood of imported--and expensive--raw materials. This left net export income of only $10.7 billion. The torpor of the industry belies the fact that China's 1.2 billion people constitute the world's largest textile market. Its textile exports account for one-seventh of the world's total, and are the country's leading spinner of foreign exchange. Nevertheless, the industry is facing harsh competition from abroad. Chinese textiles (including dyeing products) must cope with rising costs and outdated technology. China lags behind such fast-growing powers as Hong Kong and South Korea. In addition, the emergence of a bundle of export processing zones in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand offers international consumers cheaper alternatives to China [sentence as published]. "Backward processing technology such as printing and dyeing has hurt the quality of China's textile products," said Zhou Xiang, a specialist at the China Textile Institute. This conclusion is shared by at least one European fashion designer who sells her silk products in China. Although the raw materials and workers come from China, she points out that the printing is done elsewhere. To prevent being squeezed out of the international market. the China National Textile Council has drawn up a blueprint for the industry's future. Cutting production capacity and modernizing technology are considered the keys to a revival. The industry plans to reduce capacity by one-quarter to improve efficiency and raise quality. By cutting back production at inefficient plants, the government can invest the savings in competitive ones. The blueprint also calls for fostering more technology- and capital-intensive projects to make enterprises more competitive against foreign manufacturers. Top exporters will receive more financial support in expanding sales. The government is also encouraging companies to issue stock to raise badly needed investment capital . The country already has 69 standard joint-stock textile companies, of which 22 are listed on stock markets. Some cities will lease out or auction off small and medium-sized State enterprises to help them restructure. At the same time, township enterprises will have more chances to develop as demand grows from rural consumers with more money to spend. In 1992, the country's 190,000 township textile enterprises produced more than 97 billion yuan ($11 billion) worth of goods. Output of the more than 380,000 village-level textile enterprises, meanwhile, amounted to 63.4 billion yuan ($7.3 billion). Reinvigorating the textile industry will also depend on the fast-growing domestic market, which is now learning the value of marketing as well as production. Many factories that used to rely on wholesalers are opening their own sales outlets across the country. In addition, half of the 8.5 million self-employed Chinese are engaged in selling garments and textile products . Authorities also encourage foreign participation in resuscitating the manufacture of textiles. According to incomplete statistics from the National Textile Council, the industry has more than 10.000 joint ventures, representing investment of more than $7 billion. The investors include multinational corporations such as the DuPont Co. of the United States, BASF AG and W. Schlafhorstag & Co. of Germany, and TPL of Italy. Foreign capital has also come from government loans, international commercial loans and leasing operations.
