After meeting for two hours today with Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the Liaison Committee, Sha'th said that they agreed to hold the meetings alternately in Gaza and Jerusalem. Sha'th pointed out that the date of each of these meetings will be set after consultation with Maj. Gen. Shahaq. Sha'th added that he and Shahaq also discussed problems connected to the application of autonomy such as travel permits for the Palestinians and resuming the talks about Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails. He explained that Israel has so far released only 1,200 detainees out of a total of 5,000 who should have been released in line with the agreement between the two sides. He said negotiations over the release of the others will be conducted during the next meeting with Shahaq. Sha'th said he will meet in the near future with Israeli Police Affairs Minister Moshe Shahal to discuss the conditions of the detainees who have not yet been released. The Palestinian official reported that Israel has approved the entry of the families of the Palestinian police, totaling 50,000 people, and also approved the return of 72 other Palestinian families who until now have been residing in Rafah's Egyptian sector. They will move to the village of Tall al-Sultan in the Gaza Strip. Amnon Shahaq announced that Dr. Sha'th does not intend to visit Jerusalem tomorrow because he will be occupied elsewhere. Sha'th has asked that the number of Palestinian workers who work inside Israel be increased. Israel formerly suspended the work permits of approximately 130,000 workers, except 10,000 workers from Gaza.
