'Amr said he will visit his relatives and hold contacts and consultations with Palestinian political forces and nationalist figures in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to pursue efforts made last year to set up a Palestinian democratic grouping. 'Amr said this grouping is a developed formula of the initiative proposed by 116 Palestinian personalities from inside and outside the territories in a memorandum that called for enhancing democracy in the Palestinian arena inside and outside the territories. 'Amr added that this initiative does not conflict with the fact that he is a member of Fatah or with his official duties in the PLO. 'Amr worked as director general of Palestinian radios for 10 years, and then as a media adviser to the Palestinian president, and ambassador to the Soviet Union for five years.
