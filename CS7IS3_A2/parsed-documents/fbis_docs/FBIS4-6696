However, Kim warned that the United States is mistaken if it thinks that through pressure and coercion it can bring the DPRK to its knees. The above was said by DPRK President Kim Il-song in an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA at the Government Palace. In a lengthy two-hour interview, Kim Il-song talked about the tense situation currently experienced in the DPRK, its relations with China and other countries, foreign investments, and the prospects for the country's reunification. Kim also spoke fondly of the DPRK's relations with Cuba and President Fidel Castro. In Pyongyang, one can sense calm. The tall and modern buildings and wide avenues welcome a sunny spring. Taking care of the flowers, the April Festival, and the celebrations to mark the 82d birthday of the "great leader," as the Koreans call Kim Il-song, mark the spirit of these days in Pyongyang. One does not get a sense of a war-like atmosphere in some areas of the Korean countryside. The peasants work the land, grow rice, and the industries continue operating. An energetic and calm speaker, the president greets us in the august dignity of the Great Hall of the Government Palace. Kim Il-song answers our questions openly and very lucidly. "We have no intentions, nor are we capable of producing nuclear weapons. We do not need to produce them, and even if we did produce one or two, that would make no sense [eso no tendria ningun sentido]. Our government invariably makes efforts to ensure the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Kim said. Kim explained that this problem began with the introduction of nuclear weapons in South Korea by the United States. The United States deployed a large number of these weapons to maintain the southern part of the country under its control, to confront our country, and to implement its aggressive strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. Kim Il-song believes the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula began with the hostile U.S. policy toward his country, and, therefore, it must be resolved in bilateral negotiations. Considering that in recent years the Cold War ended worldwide and North and South Korea have signed nonaggression agreements and a joint declaration on denuclearization of the peninsula, there is no justification for the United States to continue maintaining its nuclear arms in the South, the president pointed out. The veteran Korean leader led the anti-Japanese struggle in the 1930's, which culminated with the antifascist victory after the monumental battles of 1945. Years later, from 1950 to 1953, he confronted the invasion of Korean territory by the United States and its allies. Fierce battles were waged and the country was virtually destroyed. The 38th Parallel and Panmunjom became fixed in the memory of humanity through persistent anticommunist propaganda that depicted U.S. citizens as defenders of noble ideals. Later, the reconstruction of the country began under the leadership of Kim Il-song. Cities were rebuilt, including Pyongyang, which had been razed. Industry was constructed and agriculture reestablished. Today Korea is a country of 23 million inhabitants which has eradicated poverty. That same man, who has a great deal of history in his background, now explains that "in order to not lose the control they now have over South Korea and to crush our republic, the North Americans are seeking another pretext and spreading groundless nuclear insinuations to intentionally worsen the situation." South Korean authorities have joined this nuclear scandal and are acting hysterically to provoke a new war. The United States has distorted what was agreed with us, he said. It provoked the break in the talks and, by mobilizing international organizations to exert pressure on Korea, it worsened the situation to the extreme, he added. Kim Il-song firmly stated that pressure and coercion can never be the method to resolve problems. The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through pressure and coercion it can bring our people to their knees, because they value independence as they value their own lives. If it becomes obstinate in pressuring our republic, we will be forced to adopt legitimate self-defense measures to safeguard the nation's dignity and sovereignty. During the interview, the paramount Korean leader reiterated that the unwavering position of Democratic Korea is to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue. Whether it can be resolved through peaceful means depends entirely on the United States, which must cease its clumsy international pressure against our republic and adopt a trustworthy position, he added. International organizations should not support the unjust demands of this power (the United States); instead, they should endorse solutions to the problem, Kim Il-song stressed. Foreign Relations Korea wants to maintain good relations with its neighbors. With China, relations are good; with Japan, they are hostile. The traditional friendship between Korea and China continues to develop. The Japanese Government has maintained unalterable hostility, and if an unexpected incident takes place here, it would not bode well for Japan, he said. When dealing with international relations, the paramount leader of the DPRK confirmed that his government's foreign policy is based on the ideals of independence, peace, and friendship. He said Korea hopes to foster cooperation with socialist and nonaligned nations and to establish links with capitalist nations that respect its sovereignty. Korea opposes all types of domination and submission, and it attributes a great deal of importance to linking itself peacefully to nearby nations, "some of which, he indicated, get along well with us, while others do not." With China we have good relations.'' Korea and China are neighbors, separated by rivers, and their peoples are beloved comrades in arms and brothers who struggle for a common cause. Resolutely united, they have struggled and shed their blood in the fight against imperialism. They have been supporting and cooperating with each other in their efforts for socialism.'' [quotation marks as received] The president explained that the traditional friendship between Korea and China continues to develop in the political, economic, and cultural fields because of joint efforts of the two nations' government parties and peoples. In terms of Japan, he indicated that, on the contrary, normal relations have not been established between the two nations because the Japanese Government has maintained a policy of unalterable hostility. In recent times, it has played into the hands of the United States in its conspiracy against Korea, thereby undermining the resolution of the nuclear problem on the peninsula. It is attempting to realize its dirty political and military ambitions. He warned: "If the situation worsens here and an unexpected event takes place, this would not bode well for Japan. The Japanese Government should look at the reality of the situation and act with moderation." As for economic relations with other countries, he explained that they are being expanded and developed not only through trade but also through other means such as joint administration and cooperation, which helps build the economy and follows the trend of international economic cooperation. He said that a foreign investment law and other laws have been established in the DPRK to encourage foreign investment in the republic. All of these measures are based on the principles of complete equality and mutual benefit, protection of the foreign businesses, and safeguard of the foreign businesses' legitimate rights and interests. Kim Il-song explained that the Rajin-Sonbong zone has been created as a center for free trade and a free economy, where a better environment and better conditions for investors are promoted. It is located on the border with China and Russia. It has great potential because of its advantageous economic and geographic conditions. Many countries want to invest in the Rajin-Sonbong zone, and the government of the republic has its doors open to foreign investors, he indicated. The Reunification of Korea Our people face great difficulties and obstacles for the reunification of the fatherland, but the prospect is viewed optimistically, President Kim Il-song said. The paramount leader of the DPRK explained that every effort is being made to undertake at all costs this historic task in the 1990's. Last year, the "10-Point Program of the Great Pannational Unity for the Reunification of the Fatherland" was presented. It unanimously reflects the aspirations of all fellow countrymen in the North, South, and overseas to achieve reintegration and national prosperity, above differences of ideology and regime. Nevertheless, he said, the South Korean authorities ignored that aspiration of the entire nation, following a path of submission to foreign forces and of confrontation with the North. The current "power" in South Korea is a servile and a turncoat power, which faithfully follows the foreign forces. The president indicated his people face great difficulties in their struggle for the reunification of the fatherland, but they are optimistic about the prospects for this task. "The forces in favor of reunification irreversibly will overcome and defeat the separatists." The so-called Korean war began on 25 June 1950 when South Korean Army troops launched, with the support of the United States, an invasion into the northern region of the peninsula where the DPRK was established in 1945, after having defeated the fascist Japanese Army. The response by the North was strong and the North's military units occupied Seoul. The United States directly involved itself in the conflict to save its about-to-be-defeated allies. Three years of war went by. This aggressor, the Yankee army, suffered 405,998 casualties; the puppet South Korean Army suffered 1.1 million casualties; and countries that were allies of the United States in this war suffered more than 30,000 casualties. Much of North Korea was virtually destroyed. The war ended on 27 July 1953. The United States was unable to occupy the North. The country remained divided. Forty years have gone by since the war ended. The North has been totally reconstructed and prosperity is tangible. President Kim Il-song continued: Now, considering that there are ideologic differences and different social regimes in the North and South, we have drawn a more rational path for the reunification of the fatherland. Our proposal is to unite in a confederated state that features two regimes and two governments. He said this proposal is fair and realistic and permits an expeditious reunification of the country in an independent and peaceful way, without either side defeating the other. After its reunification, Korea will function as a neutral nation without becoming a satellite of any other nation and without participating in any military alliance or political bloc. Total Support and Solidarity for the Cuban People The Korean president expressed high esteem, total support, and firm solidarity with the Cuban people who are honorably fulfilling the strategic tasks of the "special peacetime period." From the very start of the interview, the veteran leader, who for more than 60 years has worked for the national liberation of his nation, asked about President Fidel Castro and Revolutionary Armed Forces Minister Raul Castro, both of whom he characterized as brothers-in-arms and for whom he expressed high regards. "Even today--he indicated--I recall our 1986 encounter with Fidel Castro, which took place in Pyongyang. It was the first historically significant meeting, which we had been both pursuing for some time. We were able to talk for several hours in a climate of camaraderie. The leaders of the two countries were able to review diverse issues of common interest, including the possibility of increasing and promoting relations of friendship and cooperation." That visit left an unforgettable and profound impression on both nations, and from then on our relations attained new momentum. The DPRK and Cuba are separated by oceans and continents, and yet their respective peoples retain friendly ties as if they were neighbors. This is the friendly pugnacity of brothers of similar mettle who are struggling against imperialism and for the victory of socialism. Our friendship is genuine and solid because it is based on revolutionary principles and moral camaraderie, Kim Il-song stated. He stipulated: "Complex and unexpected events have appeared on the international scene, and yet the links of friendship and cooperation between both nations continue to develop without changes in accordance with what was agreed upon during the two leaders' meetings. These ties remain steadfast amid this traumatic historical phase, which is decisive for the future of socialism. [no closing quotation marks as received] In reference to the critical times the island is facing, Kim Il-song pointed out that the Cuban people are firmly defending their role as the vanguard of socialism in the Western Hemisphere amid difficult conditions under which the imperialists are relentlessly pursuing all sorts of schemes to isolate and destroy it. In this respect, he indicated: "Our people have high regard and express their total support, as well as their firm solidarity, for our Cuban brothers who are honorably carrying out the strategic tasks of the special period during times of peace, and who are singularly united around the Communist Party led by Comrade Fidel Castro. [no closing quotation marks as received] In the future, the Korean people will do everything within their power to bolster relations with their Cuban brothers. Kim Il-song concluded the interview by sending friendly greetings to the Cuban people and expressing his hope for greater successes in the struggle to safeguard the independence, sovereignty, and development of socialism.
