FBIS3-32818 "drlat031_o_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-031 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 Colombia SEMANA Reports Prosecutor Negotiating Independently With Cali Cartel PA1402221394 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 14 Feb 94 PA1402221394 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From the "National" newscast] [Text] The magazine SEMANA reported today that Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, acting on his own and without consulting anyone, has been negotiating for more than a month with the Cali Cartel. According to the publication, the document signed by De Greiff reportedly gave a kind of safe-conduct pass to alleged Cali and Tulua drug traffickers to keep them from being arrested. The names of these drug traffickers are well-known figure Pacho Herrera, Jose Olmedo Campo, and a man named Renteria. According to the magazine, the passes would clearly show Prosecutor De Greiff has been in direct contact with Cali Cartel leaders for more than a month, without previously consulting the government or informing the security corps or the Attorney General's Office. SEMANA said a top government source expressed the government's surprise about the actions taken individually and privately by the prosecutor, because late last year the government and this office agreed to keep each other informed of any developments. According to SEMANA, the serious thing about the case is not the fact that the prosecutor is acting like a loose cannon, but that from the moment when the drug traffickers first came to his office -- on 14 January -- it marked the beginning of the preliminary investigations. In other words, this marked the beginning of the search for evidence that must be provided by the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], the Dijin [Judicial Police and Investigations Directorate] in Colombia, and Interpol. The odd thing is that the Prosecutor General's Office did not officially inform any of these organizations.
