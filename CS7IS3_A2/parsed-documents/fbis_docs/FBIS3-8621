Ratko Mladic, this evening warned the head of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mission for former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, that problematic actions by members of the French UN battalion deployed in the region of Bihac could lead to undesirable incidents. In a letter to Akashi, Gen. Mladic stresses that the French UN battalion has deployed its reconaissance groups in front of the Muslim forces along the lines of separation facing the Serb units. "Thus deployed UNPROFOR reconaissance groups have been used by the Muslim forces as a safe position from where they can open fire against positions held by the army of the Srpska republic. At the same time, they wish to trigger our retaliation against the UNPROFOR members, by which they would cause a conflict between the Serb forces and UNPROFOR," says Gen. Mladic's letter which was forwarded to TANJUG. The commander of the army of the Srpska republic assesses that this deployment of the reconnaissance groups by the French battalion is "objectively speaking benefiting the protection of the Muslim forces and tolerating combat activities from thier positions and adjacent to them; this could force a reaction by our forces in terms of self-defense and cause more serious consequences." Gen. Mladic recalls in his letter to Akashi that "hitherto not one member of the UNPROFOR forces has been killed by our forces, and other unpleasant situations are extremely rare," and he requests that the head of the UNPROFOR mission personally take it upon himself to see to it that the French reconnaissance groups are removed.
