It was learned that 26-year old Liu Hui was formally a sales manager of a company in Hubei's Huangshi city. In March 1992, he illegally left the country and was recruited by a foreign branch of the military intelligence bureau of Taiwan's KMT. He received espionage training and operational funds. In August the same year, he was sent by the military intelligence bureau of Taiwan's KMT back to the mainland and laid low under the cover of conducting business. After returning to Hubei, Liu Hui went to Wuhan, Huangshi, and other places to incite defection and develop a spy network. He attempted to infiltrate our key departments. Meanwhile, he also sent intelligence related to our country's secrets to Taiwan's espionage organization. Liu Hui candidly confessed his espionage activities after being arrested in accordance with the law. The case is being investigated and handled.
