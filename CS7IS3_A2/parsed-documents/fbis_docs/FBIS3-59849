Russia's dithering on the transfer of the cryogenic technology to India notwithstanding, the two countries are still each other's largest partners in science and technology. And the scale of their scientific co-operation is probably the largest between any two countries in the world. The ties have been further strengthened by the just-concluded visit of a high-level delegation of Russian officials and members of the Russian Academy of Sciences, led by the Russian deputy prime minister and academy president, Mr Yuri Osipov. The most significant event of the visit was the signing of the agreement for a joint venture for design and production of light transport aircraft (LTA). Before his departure to Moscow, Mr Osipov told this reporter: "Certain parts of the cryogenic contract signed in 1991 do not go with the present Russian law. But our scientific co-operation covers a vast range of areas. We have a lot in common. We mean a lot to each other." During its 10-day stay here, the Russian team did not hold any specific talks on the cryogenic deal, Mr Osipov said. But there was a general agreement between the two countries that discussions on the issue would continue, he added. As both countries are hard pressed for funds, the emphasis in their scientific collaboration is on programmes of mutual economic benefit. There were also efforts to involve private companies from both sides, Mr Osipov said. A case in point is the involvement of a private company, whose name has not yet been revealed, in the light aircraft programme. The 22-member Russian delegation included an academician Mr G. I. Marchuk, a former president of the Russian Academy of Sciences and academician, Mr A. M. Prokorov, one of the Nobel prize winners for the invention of laser. This was the fifth meeting under the ILTP [Integrated Long Term Programme]. Each country hosts the meeting every alternate year. This year's talks have revived the warmth between the science establishments of the two countries, which, as one Indian scientist put it, "had lost their touch after the break-up of the Soviet Union." The scientific co-operation between the two countries is covered under the ILTP agreement signed in 1987 by India and the former Soviet Union. The two countries are working jointly on about 100 projects. The programme involves 55 institutions in India and 71 in Russia. The Indian side has 240 co-ordinators and the Russian side 172. There has been an exchange of 1,600 scientists since the programme began. The 16 areas covered under ILTP include biotechnology, material sciences, computers, radio-physics and ecology. The light transport aircraft is being developed by the Bangalore-based National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Russian Myashischev Design Bureau. The 14-seater aircraft, called Saras-Duet, will have a Canadian twin-turbo-propelled engine with a range of 2,000 km and speed of 550 to 600 kmph. It is 50:50 partnership between India and Russia. The cost of development as well as two aircraft is estimated at $30 million. The first prototype is likely to be ready by 1995. Another important area of co-operation is the blue laser equipment which can be used for curing TB. Trials under the joint programme are going on at the Mehrauli TB Hospital in Delhi and Choithram Hospital in Indore. The technique involves insertion of optical fibres into the veins through a laser beam passed to the affected part. A few terminal cases have been cured during trials but how the technique works is yet an enigma for scientists. This is probably the reason why the health ministry has not yet cleared it. One of the PARAM supercomputers developed by C-DAC, Pune, has been put up for demonstration at the Institute of Computer-aided Design in Moscow. The Moscow institute is developing software using PARAM. The software is to be sold in India and Russia, as well as third countries. The two countries are also working on a joint programme to develop electronic earthquake sensors. The project taken up by the Chandigarh-based Central Scientific Instrument Organisation, attempts to marry India's expertise in electronics to the very effective sensors, developed by the Russians. The electronic sensors will be used by the Indian Meteorological Department for seismic surveys. The joint programme on catalysis could be useful in pollution control as well as production of petroleum or high-quality wax from methane. The Novosibirsk Institute of Siberia the Dhanbad-based Central Fuel Research Institute and the National Research and Development Council are working jointly on the development of such catalysts.
