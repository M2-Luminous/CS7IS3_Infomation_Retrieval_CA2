A radiocommunication service: (1) Between mobile earth stations and one or more space stations, or between space stations used by this service; or (2) Between mobile earth stations, by means of one or more space stations. This service may also include feeder links necessary for its operation. (RR) * * * * * 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service. A mobile-satellite service that operates in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz and 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz frequency bands, or in any portion thereof. * * * * * 12. Section 25.202 is amended by adding new paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5) to read as follows: §25.202 Frequencies, frequency tolerance and emission limitations. * * * * * (a) *␣*␣* (4) The following frequencies are available for use by the 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service: 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz: User-to-Satellite Link 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz: Satellite-to-User Link (secondary) 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz: Satellite-to-User Link (5) The following frequencies are available for use by the inter-satellite service: 22.55&hyph;23.00 GHz 23.00&hyph;23.55 GHz 24.45&hyph;24.65 GHz 24.65&hyph;24.75 GHz 13. Section 25.203 is amended by revising paragraph (c)(2)(vii) and adding new paragraphs (j) and (k) to read as follows: §25.203 Choice of sites and frequencies. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (vii) Antenna horizon gain plot(s) determined in accordance with §25.253(b) for satellite longitude range specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, taking into account the provisions of §25.253(a)(2) for earth stations operating with non-geostationary satellites. * * * * * (j) Applicants for non-geostationary 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service/radiodetermination satellite service feeder links shall indicate the frequencies and spacecraft antenna gain contours towards each feeder-link earth station location and will coordinate with licensees of other fixed-satellite service and terrestrial-service systems sharing the band to determine geographic protection areas around each non-geostationary mobile-satellite service/radiodetermination satellite service feeder link earth station. (k) An applicant for a non-geostationary 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service space station or earth station that will operate with a geostationary satellite or non-geostationary satellite in a shared frequency band in which the non-geostationary system is (or is proposed to be) licensed for feeder links, shall demonstrate in its application that its proposed space or earth station will not cause unacceptable interference to any other satellite network that is authorized to operate in the same frequency band, or certify that the operations of its space or earth station shall conform to established coordination agreements between the operator(s) of the space station(s) with which the earth station is to communicate and the operator(s) of any other U.S. space station licensed to use the band. 14. Section 25.208 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: §25.208 Power flux density limits. * * * * * (c) In the 17.7&hyph;19.7 GHz, 22.55&hyph;23.00 GHz, 23.00&hyph;23.55 GHz, and 24.45&hyph;24.75 GHz frequency bands, the power flux density at the Earth's surface produced by emissions from a space station for all conditions and for all methods of modulation shall not exceed the following values:
