FR940527-2-00134 FR940527-2-00113 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Rel. Nos. 33&hyph;7063; 34&hyph;34097] Changes and Corrections to EDGAR Phase-in list AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Commission is publishing a list of changes and corrections to the EDGAR phase-in list for companies whose filings are processed by the Division of Corporation Finance. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sylvia J. Reis, Assistant Director, CF EDGAR Policy, Division of Corporation Finance at (202) 942&hyph;2940. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In connection with the adoption of interim rules to implement the operational phase of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system, on March 18, 1993 the Commission published a list of companies whose filings are processed by the Division of Corporation Finance to place registrants on notice as to when they would become subject to mandated electronic filing. 1 The registrants were divided into ten groups to be phased in over the next three years. Rule 901 of Regulation S-T 2 provides that registrants may request a change to their assigned phase-in dates. Such requests may be granted pursuant to delegated authority. In addition, modifications are made to the list to reflect name changes, corporate restructurings, the addition of new entities, and similar factors. Changes to the Division of Corporation Finance phase-in list are published from time to time in the SEC News Digest. The Commission today is publishing a comprehensive list of all changes in Division of Corporation Finance phase-in group assignments made since the phase-in list was published in March 1993; this list supersedes the list of changes published in the Federal Register on October 27, 1993 (Release No. 33&hyph;7023 (October 21, 1993) [58 FR 57877]). This procedure will be repeated from time to time, in order to further notify the public of changes to the list. A change to a company's phase-in date is of particular importance to persons or entities filing documents with respect to that company, since generally such persons must file electronically when the company becomes subject to electronic filing. 3 1 See Release No. 33&hyph;6977 (February 23, 1993), published on March 18, 1993 at 58 FR 14628. The timing for each phase-in group was included in that release as Appendix A, and the phase-in list as Appendix B. As is true with all rules promulgated by the Commission, persons making filings with the Commission are responsible for apprising themselves of their new obligations associated with filing on the EDGAR system. While the Commission attempts to contact registrants in each phase-in group by furnishing a copy of the EDGAR Filer Manual and EDGARLink software prior to phase-in, filers will not be relieved of their electronic filing obligations in the absence of such notification. 2 17 CFR 232.901. 3 Rule 901(b) provides that a party making a filing pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78m or 78n, respectively] with respect to a registrant that has become subject to mandated electronic filing is required to submit that filing in electronic format. Consequently, persons filing a Schedule 13D or 13G, a proxy statement, or tender offer material with respect to an electronic filer are required to make such filings electronically.
