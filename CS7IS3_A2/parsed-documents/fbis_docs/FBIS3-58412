To achieve that, the governor explains in an interview granted to LES ECHOS that he intends to pursue a policy of a "stable franc" -- an expression he prefers to that of "strong franc" -- while accepting the democratic counterpart of independence, namely relations which are as "rich and fruitful" as possible with Parliament. But although the former Treasury director is pleased to see German, British, and French interest rates now return to a "narrow range," the loss of control of European public deficits worries him. As a possible disrupting factor within the European Union, they will be closely monitored by the governor of the Bank of France. And especially by the European Monetary Institute [EMI]. As for the single currency, Jean-Claude Trichet calmly believes in it. Thanks to the fact that the Maastricht Treaty is being implemented to the letter, it will be formed, he thinks, by those in a position to do so. Within the required time and by 1999 at the latest. [LES ECHOS] With the first meeting of the monetary policy committee, you have just inaugurated the new mechanisms of a Bank of France which is independent at last. Is this council not rather too homogeneous to be fully credible? [Trichet] The procedure for appointing the council's members provides exceptional guarantees of credibility. Just think that each of the council's members has, if I can say so, four signatures below his name: That of the speaker who nominated him, and those of the president of the republic, the prime minister, and the economy minister, because the appointment is made by cabinet decree. I think that our college has great collective authority based on a unique combination of strong personalities who have rich and diverse national and international training and experience and have exercised top-level responsibilities. [LES ECHOS] However, do you not think that the council's members largely support the policy known as the strong franc policy? [Trichet] As you know, the term which I prefer is that of the currency's internal and external credibility and stability. This clearly says what it means. Moreover, I do not think you would be able to find one central bank chief in the world who supported a weak currency.... What I am sure about, is that the Monetary Policy Council will define our monetary policy in all conscience without neglecting any analysis, or any approach, and taking advantage of the wealth and diversity of its composition. [LES ECHOS] So, you expect the Monetary Policy Council to show some contradiction in this sphere? [Trichet] There will certainly be no contradiction because the college will decide and its decision will, of course, be clear and single. But there will certainly be depth and richness in the debates within it. The people who are members provide a full guarantee. Just think. There is a chairman of an insurance multinational, who is an economist and financier of international reputation, a journalist whose pedagogical talent is unparalleled in France and who is, moreover, the head of an enterprise, a university teacher who knows all there is to know about France's monetary history and whose many books are regarded as authoritative, an employer with unique experience of large and small high-technology industries, an IMF administrator, the chairman of a bank and head of the Stock Exchange, and an economy minister who everybody remembers. I do no need to introduce the deputy governors of the Bank of France who, like me, are members of the Monetary Policy Council. Believe me, the nine wisemen will do good work. [LES ECHOS] However, do you not have a majority of pro-Maastricht people on this council? [Trichet] I do not intend to become involved in that debate. The Monetary Policy Council defines monetary policy according to the law. The college is a single entity and I will not indulge in the little game of "prognostication." [LES ECHOS] How will you organize the communication of decisions by the Monetary Policy Council? [Trichet] There are obviously important times when there are things to say. I gave a public speech last Friday when the Monetary Policy Council was installed by the prime minister and the bank therefore made a statement on that occasion. The bank will also make statements when the aims of monetary policy are established. This is a conventional communique which obviously changes in nature because previously there was a meeting of the National Credit Council, a speach by the economy and finance minister, and a press conference given by the governor, all of which were coordinated. There will now be a statement on the year's monetary policy after consideration and a decision made fully and exclusively by the Monetary Policy Council. The first two main dates are, first the launch and installation of the new Bank of France and, second, the monetary policy objectives for 1994. A third major date in terms of statements will be the governor's annual report submitted at least once a year, the law stipulates, to the president of the republic and Parliament. [LES ECHOS] Would you be in favor of reporting to Parliament more than once a year? [Trichet] One of the innovations introduced by the new statute is, in fact, the establishment of a strong link between the new institution and Parliament. My objective is to have a well integrated Bank of France which plays an active part in our democratic system. Our institution could not be isolated in an ivory tower. It must establish a permanent dialogue with the nation's deputies and, through them, with public opinion as with the country's vital forces -- I will return to this. This link with Parliament is organized by several provisions of the law: The governor reports to Parliament at least once a year; he passes on the accounts of the Bank of France to the National Assembly and Senate Finance Commissions. The law also stipulates that the latter can ask the governor to attend a hearing and that the governor can ask for a hearing with the Finance Commissions. My feeling on this subject is very clear: I am convinced that the relationship between the institution of the Bank of France and Parliament is crucial, that it is -- in a democracy -- a necessary counterpart of independence and that it is extremely important that we in this house should really be prepared for this relationship to be as rich and fruitful as possible. I have had the opportunity to express my complete readiness for this once again to the chairmen of the two assemblies' Finance Commissions. [LES ECHOS] Aside from these major dates, what method of information will you adopt: That of the Bundesbank's irregular press conferences or the publication of the minutes of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee? [Trichet] Following meetings of the Monetary Policy Council, it is possible to imagine there being a communique in some cases or, if necessary, a press conference. Another thing strikes me as important: What I would call listening and informal exchanges. The Bank of France must have its ear to the whole economy, to the country, and public opinion. It has experience of this: It has its network, its investigations, its consultative council, and its branch councils with industrial and commercial officials throughout the country. An independent central bank absolutely must -- this is true of the United States and Germany to mention just these two examples -- be very close to the real economy and the two sides of industry. This is because the independent central bank has the task of safeguarding the currency -- which is common property -- for the benefit of all and must do so on the basis of four principles: listening, deciding, explaining, and convincing. [LES ECHOS] How will you react to your new relations with the state, with the Treasury, which you headed a short time ago, and especially with the budget ministry? [Trichet] The relationship with the state is laid down by the law. The prime minister and the economy minister have access to the Monetary Policy Council. This is an important initial bridge and does not undermine the monetary authority. Such a provision operates in Germany without there being any doubt about who is responsible for what. [LES ECHOS] But you are cutting the umbilical cord with the Treasury which was an essential element in the Economy Ministry's network? [Trichet] The Treasury is the economy minister. The umbilical cord has indeed been cut. It is the government which wanted it with regard to monetary policy. But there are two other aspects to consider. First, the exchange system. The law says that it is for the government to determine it. The Bretton Woods agreements, the formation of the European Monetary System [EMS], the changes to parity in the EMS are, in the final analysis, the responsibility of governments everywhere. The second important factor is the Bank of France which is the monetary authority, the institution of the republic which, through the legislator's will, has the responsibility of conducting monetary policy everywhere by being the guardian of the currency on behalf of all French people. Third, you have the Bank of France as an enterprise from which the shareholder -- the state -- is justified in asking the same management efficiency as is required from the whole public sector. This sphere does not enter into the sphere of monetary policy. [LES ECHOS] The first discussions within the independent Bank of France will probably relate to the time frames with regard to interest rate reductions? [Trichet] As governor of the Central Bank, I am very privileged: I never say what will be done in the sphere of interest rates. [LES ECHOS] However, do you think you have room to maneuver? [Trichet] I will not say anything about the future which we will discuss in the Monetary Policy Council. I will just make one observation. When I look at the past, I note that the franc's credibility and stability have been accompanied by a very large reduction in our market interest rates. It is the franc's resilience which has made this reduction in our interest rates possible, especially the medium- and long-term rates. [LES ECHOS] Does France's European choice not effectively reduce your room to maneuver and hence the scope of the reform of the Bank of France? [Trichet] When you administer monetary policy, you are not just administering the rate day by day. In reality, we are administering a "yield curve." With proper monetary intruments over the shortest part. With credibility and stability, which are factors which directly and deeply influence the longer term. This is what is being administered with a number of complex, technical tools, but also with the emission of signals which contribute to the clarity of the monetary message. And it is true to say that this "yield curve" of French interest rates is not independent of the European environment, characterized by persistent inflation in some countries and by large public deficits. The art of the central bank chief consists of relying on the credibility and stability of his currency and, taking account of the constraints of the European environment, seeking the best possible yield curve. [LES ECHOS] Are the public deficits in France not taking on worrying proportions? [Trichet] I welcome the French Government's decision to launch a medium-term convergence program to resume control of these public deficits. I think that this is very important. It was also very appropriate to do it at the same time as the Germans, because it is a general European problem. I am convinced that we would not have the low medium- and long-term market interest rates which we now have if this medium-term convergence plan had not existed. There is a close link between the credibility of the restoration of balance in our public accounts and being able to secure better financing conditions for the economy. [LES ECHOS] The financial markets are still finding this rather difficult to believe. Do you think that the risk premium from which the franc suffered has really disappeared? [Trichet] The markets are giving us interest rates of the order of 5 percent over five years and 5.7 percent over 10 years, in other words, rates comparable to those of Germany. Within the Group of Seven, France has the lowest five-year interest rates, aside from Japan. Over recent months, the approach has been this: We have the good fortune to have a good level of long-term credibility; let us safeguard this credibility by pursuing a policy of stability with regard to the franc to secure 10-year rates which are among the lowest in Europe. On that basis, we have been able to record a decrease over the short part of the curve. [LES ECHOS] Do you think it is possible to speed up the process of moving toward Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]? [Trichet] The Maastricht Treaty has been ratified by the European Twelve. We are in phase two and, naturally, together with all our European partners, and especially the Bank of France with the other 11 central banks of the European Union, we will implement phase two and working within the EMI. I have great confidence in Mr. Lamfalussy who has been appointed by the European Council to be its president and I am sure that we will do good work. [LES ECHOS] Is it possible to count on France and Germany as a driving force in this sphere? [Trichet] I hope so, and I am convinced that the Bundesbank and the Bank of France, with all the other central banks, will take care to ensure that real work can be done. Just think that in a period which is, after all, short, we must harmonize monetary instruments at the European level, harmonize statistical and technical concepts making fusion possible because that is the aim laid down by the Maastricht Treaty. It is an enormous task which does not necessarily give rise to high-flown communiques or spectacular initiatives. In my view, the implementation of the EMI opens up very major practical spheres for work. [LES ECHOS] Does the EMI also have to monitor economic management? [Trichet] In addition to monetary cooperation, there is indeed the whole aspect of the judgment passed on all the elements of economic policy in Europe. This brings us back to what I was telling you about our position within regard to public finances at the level of Europe as a whole, which is a serious and crucial subject. [LES ECHOS] Are your prerogatives as governor not likely to be limited by the replacement of the former Committee of Governors by the EMI? [Trichet] The EMI does not upset things from that viewpoint. The Committee of Governors had an important function which it fulfilled informally and formally in semi-official or "ex cathedra" meetings. The governors also participate in all the informal Economic and Finance Council meetings. There are therefore many bridges, many meetings. I think that the EMI will merely consolidate them. [LES ECHOS] Now that we are gently returning to the fluctuation bands which preceded the EMS crisis in the summer, are you in favor of a redefinition of the EMS? [Trichet] In this sphere, too, the fundamental rule must be pragmatism. Experience has shown that the finance ministers and the governors found the right response to July's crisis on 1 and 2 August: To confirm the validity of the scale of central rates, fully justified by the fundamental economic facts while temporarily expanding the fluctuation bands to discourage speculation. This strategy has proved effective. [LES ECHOS] Were you almost surprised by it in restrospect? [Trichet] It is a good system. It was adapted to the circumstances in which the Europeans found themselves. These subjects must not be approached in a theoretical and abstract way, it is better to approach them in a practical and concrete way. That is what we did. And it worked well. [LES ECHOS] Are you in favor of speeding up a rapprochement among the European Union's most stable currencies? [Trichet] Things are in fact very simple. We have the Maastricht Treaty ratified by the Twelve. It has been in force since 1 November. All the states in the European Union are rule-of-law states. We will implement the Maastricht Treaty. Reread it. It gives all the appropriate answers with regard to the criteria and procedures leading to phase three which makes it possible for a single currency to come into force.
