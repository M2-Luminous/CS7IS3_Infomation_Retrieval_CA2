The Czech Trade and Industry Minister emphasized this yesterday before the representatives of German economic and political circles in Sankt Augustin near Bonn. Dlouhy described cheap labor and low wages as one of the main advantages of the economic reform and [a reason for] the successes of Czech exports. At the same time, he rejected the accusations on the part of various Western firms that the Czech Republic carries out dumping exports. Dlouhy spoke yesterday about the results of the economic transformation in the Czech Republic in Sankt Augustin, at the seat of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which is close to the government Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He emphasized in his lecture that an important goal of the reform right now is economic growth to maintain the hitherto social consensus with the economic measures. The Czech Republic is approaching convertibility of the currency, although, according to the minister, it will not happen next year. Dlouhy acknowledged the results of cooperation with Germany, which is the most important trade partner of the Czech Republic. The German side is the most flexible in investments and the foundation of joint ventures. Of the total number of joint ventures in the Czech Republic, approximately 30 percent are German-Czech enterprises. Dlouhy described as an important signal for Western Europe the intensification of the economic cooperation within the framework of the Visegrad Group oriented toward a free trade zone. He pointed out, however, that Prague does not intend to politically institutionalize the collaboration of this group. Minister Dlouhy also spoke in Koeln am/Rhein on the progress of the transformation representatives of one of the most influential economic associations--the Federal Alliance of German Industry (BDI).
