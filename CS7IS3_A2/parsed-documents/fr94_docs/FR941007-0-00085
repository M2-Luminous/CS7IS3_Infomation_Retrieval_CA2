SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LTJG Christina Bjergo, Project Manager, and Ms. Jacqueline L. Sullivan, Project Counsel, OPA 90 Staff. Regulatory History On March 5, 1993, the Coast Guard released Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) No. 2&hyph;93 to provide guidance to the affected community on compliance before Regulation 26 became effective for new ships on April 4, 1993. The NVIC has no regulatory force; it simply provided guidance until the issuance of this regulation. The Coast Guard also issued Change 1 to NVIC 2&hyph;93 on July 28, 1993, providing shipowners with the current list of national operational contact points adopted by the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC). On February 17, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans in the Federal Register (59 FR 8086). The Coast Guard received 36 letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. Background and Purpose MARPOL 73/78 The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. ) (the Act) authorizes the Coast Guard to administer and enforce Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 is entitled ``Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil'' and is designed to prevent the discharge of oil into the marine environment. MARPOL 73/78 defines oil as petroleum in any form, including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse, and refined products; it does not include animal or vegetable based oil or noxious liquid substances. Regulation 26 The MEPC of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 at its 31st session in July 1991. Regulation 26 requires every oil tanker of 150 gross tons and above and every other ship of 400 gross tons and above to carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan approved by its flag state. This requirement entered into force for party states, including the United States, on April 4, 1993, for new ships and enters into force on April 4, 1995, for existing ships. The 32nd session of IMO in March 1992 adopted a set of guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32)) with more specific information for the preparation of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. The guidelines are intended to assist parties to Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 in developing regulations for domestic implementation of Regulation 26, and are the basis of this rule. Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans Regulation 26 requires that plans be prepared according to the guidelines developed by IMO and written in the working language of the ship's master and officers. Plans must consist at least of_ (1) The procedure to be followed by the master or other persons having charge of the ship to report an oil pollution incident, as required in article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78; (2) The list of authorities or persons to be contacted in the event of an oil pollution incident; (3) A detailed description of the actions to be taken immediately by persons on board to reduce or control the discharge of oil following the incident; and
