This week's program, which lasts 88 minutes, features five senior officials of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps [IRGC]: Brigadier General Seyyed Rahim Safavi, the deputy commander of the IRGC; Brigadier General Mohammad Baqer Zolqadr, the head of the IRGC's Joint Staff; Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Razini, deputy to Ayatollah Khamene'i's representative in the IRGC; Brigadier General Mohammad 'Ali Ja'fari, the commander of the IRGC's Ground Forces; and Brigadier General Amir 'Ali Amiri; head of the IRGC personnel office. The participants stress the instrumental role of the IRGC in defending the country and the revolution during the war with Iraq, and as well as its important contributions to Iran's post-war reconstruction and development. This is followed by interviews with members of the public who pay tribute to the IRGC and its important services, and ask for more information on the IRGC's involvement in development projects. In reply, Brigadier General Safavi enumerates a number of projects, such as construction of dams and gas pipe- lines. A relative of a martyr asks what assistance is given to the families of martyrs. Amiri says that part of the IRGC duties is to identify all IRGC martyrs, visit their families, and cooperate with the Martyrs Foundation to help these families. Zolqadr also talks about a university for sciences which is run by the IRGC. Razini is asked about the function of the representative of the leader in the IRGC. He says that the IRGC came into being to safeguard the gains of the revolution. The task of the leader's representative is to make sure that the original revolutionary spirit is maintained. His other roles are to ensure the guards' ideological suitability and supervise their promotion, and to conduct a general supervision of the IRGC to ensure that all its decisions and regulations are in keeping with religious norms. One of the guards asks if any attempts are being made to write a documentary history of the Iran-Iraq war. Ja'fari says that some cultural and artistic activities are under way to safeguard the memory of the gains of the war. Safavi adds that there is a great deal of audio recording about the events of the war, as well as about 100,000 pages of records about the history of the war. These will be useful in future for those who wish to write the history of the war. Then there are a number of questions about promotions, transfers, career development opportunities, and pensions and benefits for IRGC personnel. Amiri provides detailed answers to these questions. At the conclusion of the program, Zolqadr refers to the IRGC's contribution to the fight against terrorists attempting to hijack Iranian airplanes. He says: "I only wished to use this opportunity to mention the efforts of our dear brothers, the unknown guards who have the very important responsibility of protecting the aircraft of the country. I must say that during the period when on the orders of the late imam the IRGC was given the responsibility of protecting the aircraft of the country and the flights, 70 plots for aircraft hijacking were foiled by the dear guards and nothing went wrong during that period. I should just explain that the last case in which one of the Oil Ministry's private aircraft was hijacked to Iraq by the counterrevolutionaries -- that case happened by dint of the fact that there were no guards on board. The IRGC was not responsible for that flight, and the aircraft was not guarded by the IRGC. After that, as a result of the insistence of national officials, the IRGC was given the responsibility of providing protection for all flights. It was made responsible for their protection. I like to thank the brothers for this during these blessed days."
