Our correspondent covering the deliberations in Abuja reports that although there was no mention of the problems, this might not be unconnected with lack of necessary documents for the assignment. Delegates to the conference had earlier this morning at their sitting deplored the situation where many of them were not provided with the agenda and other necessary documents for the conference. The delegates also want the conference to be provided with standing orders that will govern proceedings or deliberations as well as business committees to look into the agenda to enhance easy deliberation on issues. Meanwhile, there has been a reshuffle at the National Constitutional Conference Commission. A statement from the commission announced the appointment of new chairmen to head various subcommittees. They include the constitutional drafting and documentation committee to be headed by Dr. Beshir Ahmed Ikara, Alhaji Shehu Malami for finance and administration, and the general purpose committee will now be headed by Dr. Tunji Otegbeye. The publicity committee will be chaired by the former civilian governor of Anambra State, Chief Jim Nwobodo. All appointments are with immediate effect.
