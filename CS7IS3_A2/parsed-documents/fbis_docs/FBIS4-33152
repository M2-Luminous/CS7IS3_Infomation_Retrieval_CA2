After lending their party's name to the maharajah hunter [Fernando Collor de Mello] -- who managed to reach the presidency in 1990 only to be impeached two years later on charges of deep involvement in corruption -- yesterday, 49 delegates of the PRN [National Reconstruction Party] nominated businessman Walter Carlos Gomes Queiroz as PRN candidate for replacing President Itamar Franco. Speaking at the end of the convention, Gomes Queiroz said: "I am going to win the election." He did not appear, however, anywhere near as obstinate as his predecessor, who was conspicuously absent at the convention. PRN President Daniel Tourinho said: "President Fernando Collor continues to remain in seclusion, but he will participate in all of our rallies." Gomes Queiroz employs 100 workers at his sunglass factory in Salvador, Bahia State. He is 38 years old, just as Fernando Collor was when he began his electoral campaign in 1989. PRN National Secretary Rivalinton Veloso da Silva said that Gomes Queiroz fits the profile obtained in a survey of voters: "a middle-aged man, clean, who is not a professional politician."
