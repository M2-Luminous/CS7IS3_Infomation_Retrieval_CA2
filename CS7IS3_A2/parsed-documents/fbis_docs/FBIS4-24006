Fumo, which will continue to unveil its government program during the election campaign, says its constitution proposal contains the principle of decentralizing public administration -- the introduction of local governments at "district and locality levels," elected by direct and secret universal suffrage. Fumo says it will reserve the right to hold a referendum "on federalism or other systems" in case there is "considerable" support for it from "political forces". Fumo says its constitution will contain, among other things, the principle of the "right to resist any illegal order or command" as well as the right "to use force to repel any act of aggression when it is impossible to resort to [words indistinct], and the "right of the consumer." At the request of the president of the Republic, there will be a "Council of State," which will include the chairman of the Assembly of the Republic, the prime minister, the president of the Constitutional Court, the attorney general, leaders of political parties with seats in Parliament, and the "(?whip)." This council will have the task of advising the president of the Republic. In Fumo's constitution, the prime minister is appointed by the president of the Republic "with advice from the most voted for party," while the remaining members of the government are also appointed by the president of the Republic "with advice from the prime minister."
