An official of the Ministry of Labour estimated that urban unemployment would reach three percent. Four reasons are seen as the cause of this rise. First, the supply of labourers surpasses the demand. Second, the growing number of bankrupt or closed enterprises, leading to the rising number of unemployed and the prolonging of unemployment. The unemployed this year are estimated to reach five million with 1.8 million of them needing financial relief. Third, surplus rural labourers have speeded up their migration and are now put at 20 million. Fourth, difficulties facing settlement of the unemployed have increased. Competition and profit-seeking has brought employment difficulties in forestry, mining, railway labour and the defence industry.
