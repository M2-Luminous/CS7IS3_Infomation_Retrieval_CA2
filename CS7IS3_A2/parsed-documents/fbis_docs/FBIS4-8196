Yesterday, at approximately 1445, the attack was repeated in the region of the Serbian village of Bare, which is 2 km from Gorazde, the command of the Herzegovina Corps has confirmed. However, it was not the tanks of the Srpska republic army that were hit, as NATO representatives claim, but ambulance vehicles of the Serbian forces. On that occasion two paramedics from Gacko were killed, while two ambulance vehicles were competely destroyed. Two Serbian homes, whose residents had fled from the Muslim onslaught nearly two years ago, were razed. The Americans fired rockets of the biggest caliber and dropped bombs of enormous weight. This conclusion is implied by the information that one of the rockets penetrated three 20-centimeter thick concrete plates. All this was most probably done in agreement with the Muslim side, as thick black smoke was rising from the houses in Gorazde directly prior to yesterday's bombing. In this way the Muslims marked the zone which the Americans should not pound. At the same time as the attack of the U.S. aircraft, an infantry attack of the Muslim formations from Gorazde at the Serbian positions started, supported substantially by recoilless guns, mortars, antiaircraft guns, and rocket launchers. Where the Muslims in Gorazde, which is a UN protected area, obtained all these arms and ammunition from, only they and NATO representatives know. However, they did not succeed in moving the Serbian positions. The details of the U.S. atttack in the region of Preljuca the day before yesterday are also known. That area is 15 km from Gorazde and is situated on the territory of Foca Commune. A logical question arises here: By bombing positions so distant, how were the Americans trying to protect the UN military observers in Gorazde. Preljuca has been Serbian territory since time immemorial, and precisely in the village of Crnetici, directly underneath it, the Muslims committed a terrible crime a year ago, killing more than 20 civilians, among whom were two preschool children. The American aircraft will most probably finish off their job, so it seems.
