She was addressing the 50th session of the commission on human rights in Geneva today. [Begin Bhutto recording] Two-thirds of Kashmir has remained under Indian occupation for the past 45 years. India first accepted but then refused to implement the UN Security Council resolution calling for a plebiscite under UN auspices. Over 40,000 -- 40,000 -- Kashmiri men, women, and children have died. The martyrs' graves in Srinagar are flowing over as are the tears of the Kashmiri mothers, wives, and daughters. Despite its repression, India has failed to impose its will on the indomitable people of Jammu and Kashmir. The intensity of the resistance has grown. The Kashmiri political leadership representing over 30 parties and groups has unanimously declared that it will not contemplate any solution which implies the continuation of Indian rule. Their demand is simple -- Azadi, freedom. People cannot be suppressed indefinitely, tyranny cannot long endure. That is the lesson of history. The situation in Kashmir is as intolerable as is the world silent. It is time for the world community to prevail upon India to remove the additional forces it has put into Kashmir to conduct its campaign of repression. It is time for the world community to demand that India leaves its draconian emergency laws which allow its Army to commit atrocities in Kashmir without being answerable to anyone. The settlement of the Kashmir dispute based on the wishes of its people is the key to peace and progress in South Asia, South Asia which is home to one-fifth of humanity. We cannot celebrate the triumph of the universal declaration on rights. These rights are being violated extensively often with impunity without compunction, or conscience or remorse in almost every part of the world. [end recording] About Bosnia, the prime minister urged the world community to help preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia. The consequences of ethnic cleansing must be reversed, she stressed.
