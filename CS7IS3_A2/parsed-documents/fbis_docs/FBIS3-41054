Plyushch has received Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Argentinian Republic in Ukraine L. Baqueriza. A friendly conversation took place. The ambassador asked about the course of discussion by the Ukrainian parliament of the Tripartite Agreement signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia and of the supplement on the elimination of nuclear weapons on the territory of our state. In the ambassador's opinion, these documents themselves and the decisions adopted by the Ukrainian parliament are historic. They, Baqueriza emphasized, have generated a lot of interest in Argentina. Plyushch pointed out that we regard the Tripartite Statement and the supplement to it as a step of good will and as a step of good intentions on the part of Russia and the United States with regard to resolving this problem. All the more so since, in the course of preparing, signing, and adopting these documents, Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk acted decisively and correctly. Touching upon bilateral Ukrainian-Argentinian ties, the two parties pointed out with satisfaction that the Argentinian president is expected to come to Ukraine on an official visit.
