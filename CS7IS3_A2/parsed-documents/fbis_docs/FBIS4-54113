A ministry official said the agreement was reached at the first joint task team meeting of the "Korea- Canada special partnership relations" held on Monday. At the meeting, delegates decided to map out concrete and tangible programs to better facilitate improved market approach, industrial cooperation and joint advancement to third countries with a view to helping form special partnership relations between the two countries. They also agreed to explore multi-pronged ways to ensure closer mutual cooperation at such multilateral organizations as the World Trade Organization (WTO), Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). During the meeting, Canada suggested Korea's tie-up with the North America Free Trade Area (NAFTA) or the conclusion of a Korea-Canada free trade agreement. But, Korean delegates expressed the view that this is no stage to review such matters under the present circumstance. Creation of the "Korea-Canada special partnership relations" was agreed on during the Korea-Canada summit held in Seattle last November during the APEC summit meeting. After another round of talks in Canada next month, the task team will prepare a joint report by the end of next month for final adoption before the next APEC ministerial conference in November. At the meeting, Korea was represented by Second Assistant Foreign Minister Sun Chon-yong and Canada by Barry Carim, assistnat minister of foreign affairs and trade.
