FR940628-0-00026 FR940628-0-00017 Changes: The definition has been revised to distinguish the monthly payments required to establish eligibility for rehabilitating, consolidating or reinstating a defaulted loan. Comments: Some commenters suggested that defining ``on-time'' to be making a payment within 15 days of the scheduled due date is a new condition that could not have been anticipated by guarantors, servicers and lenders making good faith efforts to program their systems to handle loan rehabilitation. Some commenters suggested that ``on-time'' be revised to mean a payment made within the calendar month. Other commenters suggested that ``on-time'' be revised to be a payment received by the guaranty agency or its agent within 15 days. The commenters suggested that a guaranty agency is aware of the date on which payments are received. Using the term ``made'' could be interpreted to mean the date on which the check was issued by the borrower, or the post-mark date, etc. Discussion: The Secretary believes that it is critically important for borrowers who have previously defaulted and who are entering into satisfactory repayment arrangements with a guaranty agency to establish a pattern of monthly payments that are made timely. For this reason, the Secretary does not agree that an ``on-time'' payment should be one that is made anytime during the calendar month. The Secretary also notes that the kind of latitude provided by a payment deadline that is anytime within the calendar month will not be available to the borrower if the loan is rehabilitated subsequently and is then serviced by a lender or lender servicer. The Secretary also believes there is sufficient time for guaranty agencies to reprogram their systems prior to the July 1, 1995 effective date of these regulations. The Secretary agrees with the commenters who suggest that the on-time standard should be based on when payments are ``received'' rather than ``made'' because a guaranty agency or its agency is aware of this date and the word ``made'' is open to several different interpretations. Changes: The definition has been revised to read that an on-time payment is one that is received by the guaranty agency or its agent within 15 days of the scheduled due date. Comments: Some commenters suggested that the addition of a definition of ``reasonable and affordable'' would impact the collection of defaulted loans. The commenters suggested that, based upon the definition provided, each time a guaranty agency changed the monthly payment amount the agency would have to go through the process of determining what is reasonable and affordable. The commenters further suggested that a guaranty agency's collection agents or attorneys will also be subject to conducting the same review whenever they attempt to reach a repayment arrangement. Discussion: The Secretary believes that this definition will not have an impact on the collection of defaulted loans. This provision applies to voluntary payments the borrower is making after the borrower specifically initiates voluntary payment to reinstate eligibility, rehabilitate, or consolidate a defaulted loan. These requirements do not relate to other routine changes the guaranty agency makes to monthly payment amounts. Changes: None. Comments: Commenters suggested that borrowers, whose loans are non-dischargeable and who have not filed a hardship petition, should be allowed to have their Chapter 12 or 13 plan payments count toward regaining eligibility for FFEL loans. The commenters suggested that these borrowers are not attempting to have the loan discharged and, as such, are making voluntary payments. Discussion: The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. The Secretary believes that if a defaulted loan has been included in a bankruptcy petition, then payments received under a court mandated bankruptcy plan are not voluntary payments as required for this purpose. Changes: None. Write-Off Comments: Some commenters expressed concern that the definition of ``write-off'' was unclear as to which applicable standards the definition incorporates. Some commenters suggested that the ``applicable standards'' could be easily read to include the closed school/false certification provision. Discussion: During negotiations, the Secretary agreed with certain negotiators that a uniform standard for ``write-off'' was desirable for guaranty agencies to use in determining what constitutes a ``write-off'' in determining whether a borrower has an adverse credit history. The applicable standards referenced in the definition refers to the Write-off and Compromise Procedures which the Department of Education is now developing in consultation with the Department of Treasury, in accordance with the Treasury financial manual and OMB A&hyph;129. The Secretary does not consider a loan that has been discharged under section 437(c) of the Act (language in the preamble incorrectly referred to 437(b)) to be considered a write-off nor does the Secretary intend to require borrowers to reaffirm those loans to receive additional aid under the FFEL program. Changes: None. Section 682.201‚ê£Eligible Borrowers Section 682.201(b) Comments: A few commenters suggested that the term ``endorser'' as used in the NPRM implies that an endorser on a PLUS loan application must be the other parent of the student for whom the loan is made. These commenters pointed out that the Secretary has issued policy guidance for the FFEL Program that would permit a creditworthy nonparent to be an endorser on the Federal PLUS application of a non-creditworthy parent borrower and that this would be in keeping with the provisions of the Federal Direct Loan Program. Discussion: The Secretary does not believe that the term ``endorser'' suggests such a restriction and believes that it is unnecessary to reflect this guidance in the regulations.
