One of the co-authors of the law on privatization, and most importantly--the author of many practical matters, Dmitriy Bednyakov, is running for the office of mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod, the third largest city in Russia. In the elections of 1991, the 39-year old Bednyakov did not get the majority of votes and was appointed acting mayor by edict of the president. The head of administration of Nizhegorod Oblast, Boris Nemtsov, despite his youth, is one of the most well-known Russian politicians. However, few pay attention to the fact that he would hardly have been able to achieve success in transforming the oblast had he not worked with like-minded people, among whom we should list primarily the city's mayor, Dmitriy Bednyakov, and the chairman of the oblast soviet, Aleksandr Krestyaninov... And today, Dmitriy Bednyakov answers the questions posed by NOVOYE VREMYA. [Correspondent] What are you taking to the elections? [Bednyakov] I am not a proponent of program statements, but I am in my third year of work now and clearly understand that only he who will be able to manage in the channel of interests of the common man can expect victory in the elections, regardless of the level at which these elections are held. [Correspondent] As far as I know, reforms in Nizhegorod Oblast have been implemented according to the conception: "First develop optimal economic mechanisms in the local areas, and then delegate rights to the center, based on the interests of the region." [Bednyakov] We have done many things independently and more quickly than others. This concerns both privatization and the support of enterprise. This also concerns the mutual relations with large industrialists, as well as the policy of social protection of the population. However, I would like to say that reforms generally depend on one very important thing--on the presence of political will. We may understand the goals of reform differently, perceive the tactics differently, and act differently. However, in order to have any kind of results, we must first have the desire for them. All our actions are subordinate to a dual task. On one hand, we are striving to reform the economy, and on the other hand we have combined reforms (and they, as is the case everywhere, are accompanied both by liberalization of prices and by demonopolization) with measures on social protection. For example, on 7 January 1992, seven days after liberalization of prices, we lifted price controls on milk. But at the same time we allocated budget funds to support certain categories of people. Every month these people got 70 rubles (R) each. Today this is a laughable sum of money. But in January 1992 it would buy one liter of milk a day for an entire month. And on the whole this measure allowed us to save considerable budget funds. On 24 March 1992, we lifted price controls on bread and gave a subsidy of R260 a month to some categories of people (only some!)--invalids, families with many children and pensioners. In May of 1992 we increased the subsidy, and then changed over to individual subsidies using the so-called application order. As of 1 October of last year, we introduced a poverty subsidy, which is paid to those whose level of income is below the minimum subsistence level. As of 1 January 1993, we have not had coupons for food products. The last ones I repealed were coupons for sugar. One may promise from the "soapbox": "I will never repeal coupons. I will retain prices at their former level. I guarantee each person 200 grams of carmel candy, and everything else." Yet all the while prices will still be increasing, and products will be disappearing from the shelves. Yet we have said firmly: "Yes, prices in different stores will be different, and perhaps will change in the course of the day." At first people could not get used to this. Yet now even pensioners, even war veterans who have become accustomed to buying their goods in specialized stores at fixed prices, ask only that the goods be closer to home. Here are some economic indicators. The number of state enterprises for 1993 is 4.5 percent of their overall number. The relative share of non-state enterprises in budget revenues for 1992 was 12 percent, while in 1993 it was already 73 percent. There are no social conflicts. In 1992 the decline in production in Russia comprised 19.9 percent. In Nizhegorod Oblast, which suffered all the ills of the Russian regions, it was 7.6 percent, while in Nizhniy Novgorod it was 2.4 percent. In 1993 the decline throughout Russia was once again 20 percent, while in Nizhegorod Oblast it was a little over 7 percent and in Nizhniy Novgorod it was around 4 percent. [Correspondent] Do you have any real competitors in the elections? [Bednyakov] There are several competitors with whom there are no principle ideological divergences. Those who speak out for slowing of reforms, I believe, are doomed. The LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia], for example, is submitting a candidate named Buslayev. A man by that name has already put all of Russia on its ear once. The communists are presenting their own man. But, it seems, they will not even be able to gather enough signatures. I have not yet seen or heard any distinct programs. [Correspondent] Will you be able to win the region in the case of some cardinal changes in the political course of the country? [Bednyakov] I am sure of that. There were R70 billion which settled in the Savings Bank for last year alone. The level of consumption has remained practically unchanged in two years. New stores have opened--around 700 of them. No efforts to resurrect state regulation will pass here.
