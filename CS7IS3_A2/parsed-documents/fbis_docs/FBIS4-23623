FBIS4-23623 "drafr113_d_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-113 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola Government, Namibia Accused of Planning Attacks Government, Namibia Accused of Planning Attacks MB1206153094 Jamba Voz da Resistencia do Galo Negro in Portuguese 0600 GMT 12 Jun 94 MB1206153094 Jamba Voz da Resistencia do Galo Negro Portuguese BFN [Text] The fortress government of Jamba, which includes areas under the control of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuando Cubango Province, today denounced the involvement of mercenaries whose nationalities have not been identified in an extended operation of the Government of the Republic of Angola jointly with the neighboring Republic of Namibia along the border, in the Caprivi-Mucusso strip. A press release issued by the fortress government says that Luanda was involved in the operations of various units led by Major Mario Antonio, an officer who had been part of the UN Transition Assistance Group during the Namibian elections. Major Mario Antonio has been assigned the mission of destabilizing Jamba, neutralizing Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel], UNITA's radio station, its leadership, and the governor of the fortress. A Cuban spy called Mariana Dirma, who had worked for the International Committee of the Red Cross during the Namibian elections, is also involved in the plot. The fortress government's document says that these personnel have assembled in the Mukwe area, which is located near Bagani, headquarters of the South African Army before Namibian independence. We hereby inform the Angolan and international community that clashes may resume in the southeast of Angola, because this is the wish of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] and the South-West African People's Organization [SWAPO]. The communique, which appeals to both governments to assume their responsibilities, warns that should the clashes resume, the consequences will not only be felt exclusively in areas controlled by UNITA, but in the entire southern African region. On the confused situation in the southeast of Angola, the press office of the fortress government based in Jamba yesterday once again accused the SWAPO-MPLA-PT of plotting to capture Angolan refugees residing in Namibia. The press office says that thousands of youths have been seized in Namibia and sent to training camps in Angola, in violation of internationally-recognized rights of the refugees. The fortress government urges the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to urgently inquiry about the situation which is still threatening thousands of Angolan families residing in Namibia and which puts at risk the constitution of that neighboring country. The seizures are being carried out by secret police agents assisted by elements of the Namibian Defense Forces who speak the local languages of Kwangar and Diriko. Vorgan contacted a source from the press office of the fortress government from whom it learned that UNITA has always favored and will continue favoring a policy of good neighborliness with all neighbors of Angola, searching to solve all differences which may subsequently emerge through dialogue. The source said UNITA will not fold its arms in case of aggression and that security measures have already been taken.
