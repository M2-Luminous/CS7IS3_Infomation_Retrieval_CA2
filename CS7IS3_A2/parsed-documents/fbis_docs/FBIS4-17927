Figuratively speaking, the field has been plowed and, in principle, it is possible to complete the Bosnian settlement process quickly enough," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev commented on the results of his working meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, which took place on 26 April in Geneva. The partnership is working, he told Russian journalists. Our Western colleagues are paying attention -- though, perhaps, not immediately -- to what we say to them. They realize that it is useless to rely on military solutions, and here, in Geneva, the secretary of state emphasized the priority of the political process. The Russian minister recalled that a contact group comprising Russia, United States, the European Union, and the United Nations had been set up and said it would become involved in shuttle diplomacy in the near future. At the same time, work at the level of ministers is also under way. The U.S. secretary of state held meetings with his counterparts from France and Britain on 25 April. "I have planned a meeting with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. I shall certainly be in touch with my British counterpart, Douglas Hurd, as well," Andrey Kozyrev said. "We are not starting from scratch; a very good foundation already exists.
