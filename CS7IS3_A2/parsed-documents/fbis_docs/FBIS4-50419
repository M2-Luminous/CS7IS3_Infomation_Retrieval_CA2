Lauding Sino-Danish friendship, the two leaders noted great potential and broad prospects for bilateral cooperation. Li Ruihuan spoke first, saying he was delighted to meet Prime Minister Rasmussen and thanking the Danish Government for warm hospitality. He told Rasmussen that China is very happy to see the two countries expanding cooperation in various fields and enjoying a deepened understanding in recent years as a result of expanded exchanges at senior levels, adding that rapid growth in bilateral trade and economic cooperation has brought about a big increase in trade volume. The Danish prime minister said that he was deeply impressed by China's economic development and described Danish-Chinese relations as very good, expressing his optimism about future cooperation. At Rasmussen's request, Li Ruihuan gave an outline of China's efforts to promote socialist democratic politics and the role of the CPPCC. He said: The CPPCC is an important organizational form of the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation led by the CPC. Different from Western parliaments, the CPPCC's main function is to conduct political consultation and democratic supervision and to take part in the administration and discussion of state affairs. It conducts consultations on the state's general political principles, important matters in the political life, and major issues related to economic and social development. Moreover, the CPPCC and its members exercise effective democratic supervision over the enforcement of the Constitution and other laws and regulations, the implementation of key policies, and the execution of duties by state organs and functionaries. All CPPCC members are empowered with the democratic right to make criticism and air dissent. By practicing democracy in such a way, the CPPCC enables the people to have full consultation on major issues while exercising their democratic rights through election and voting. It also enables the people to exercise extensive democratic supervision, as well as legal supervision. Such a way of practicing democracy can help the CPC bring into play its leadership role and the democratic parties take part in the administration of state affairs. It is conducive to ensuring respect for the majority's common aspiration while taking into account the minority's reasonable demand, thereby seeking maximum common understanding of the whole people and preserving the stability and harmony of the entire society. Li Ruihuan added: Over a long period of time, the CPPCC has made important contributions to consolidating and developing political stability and unity; to facilitating reform, opening up, and modernization construction; and to promoting the motherland's reunification and development, as well as friendship and cooperation with the peoples of various countries. In the future, it will further carry out its functions, actively develop exchange and cooperation with the peoples of various countries, and make unremitting efforts to promote world peace and development.
