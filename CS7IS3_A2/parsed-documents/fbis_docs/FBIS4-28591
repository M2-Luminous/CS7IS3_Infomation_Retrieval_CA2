FBIS4-28591 "dreas113_m_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-113 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Thailand Chuan Rules Out House Dissolution Chuan Rules Out House Dissolution BK1306082094 Bangkok THE NATION in English 13 Jun 94 p A1 BK1306082094 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Excerpt] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday ruled out a House dissolution, while government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa rejected the possibility of bringing the opposition Chat Phatthana Party into the coalition. A House dissolution and the inclusion of Chat Phatthana have been floated as possible solutions to the political impasse stemming from the hunger strike by political Chalat Worachat. Several newspapers yesterday reported that Chuan indicated he would dissolve the House of Representatives when he addressed a group of villagers in Nakhon Si Thammarat on Saturday. Chuan had told the villagers that a House dissolution was one of the "ordinary" solution available under the democratic system. Chuan, who was visiting his home province of Trang yesterday, said he was not planning a dissolution. "I don't have any plan to dissolve the House," Chuan said. "When I talked to the villagers yesterday (Saturday), I mentioned a House dissolution and no-confidence debates. I simply told the villagers that these two things could happen at any time under a democratic system." Aphisit said in a telephone interview the situation did not yet warrant the inclusion of the Chat Phatthana Party of former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan in the government. On Saturday, Seritham Party leader Athit Urairat suggested that Chuan bring in Chat Phatthana as a way out of the problem. [passage omitted]
