FBIS4-773 "drafr073_c_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP Youth Brigade Announces Start of Mass Action IFP Youth Brigade Announces Start of Mass Action MB1504135294 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1232 GMT 15 Apr 94 MB1504135294 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Kurt Swart] [Text] Johannesburg April 15 SAPA -- Prospects of further violence in central Johannesburg loomed large on Friday [15 April] when the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Youth Brigade vowed it would embark on "rolling mass action" in the city from Monday despite a magisterial ban. If police or the African National Congress attempted to stop planned marches to protest against the elections and the killing of Zulu marchers in the city on March 28, South Africa would become another Bosnia, the Youth Brigade warned at a news conference. The IFP's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Youth Chairman Charles Loliwe said the Youth Brigade called on "all peace- loving Africans" to observe Monday as a day of mourning "for the innocent Zulus massacred outside the ANC headquarters in Plein Street and in Library Gardens by the SA Police and MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] security guards". Mr Loliwe said the IFP was also calling for a stayaway from April 18 to 23 to demand the South African Government and the Transitional Executive Council lift the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal, which it regarded as "illegal". The stayaway applied to everybody, including people who were not IFP members. Only journalists, students and civil workers were exempted from the call. The IFP would "enforce" the stayaway. "Anyone who comes to town will do so at their own risk." The IFP would march at 10AM on Monday from Library Gardens to the ANC headquarters where wreaths would be laid in honour of members killed at the spot nearly three weeks ago. A commemorative service at the Library Gardens would end at 4PM. On Tuesday the IFP would march from George Goch Station to John Vorster Square police headquarters where it would demand the lifting of the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal and the withdrawal of troops from the townships. On Wednesday a sit-in would be staged at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange [JSE] "because the JSE is part of the government and can put pressure on them". On Thursday the IFP would march on the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] to protest against bias favouring the National Party and the ANC, and on Friday it would march on the offices of the Independent Electoral Commission. "The police have refused us permission to hold these marches, but we will take the law into our own hands to pay tribute to our members who lost their lives. We are going to march. If anything happens to us we warn the government it could lead to a Bosnia situation in Johannesburg," Mr Loliwe said. Asked whether the IFP was not concerned its campaign would lead to more loss of life, Mr Loliwe replied: "It is not the first time people have died in South Africa. We are going to march peacefully and it is the responsibility of the government and the police to see that we are protected." No arms would be carried by marchers as Monday was a day of mourning but the IFP could not prevent the carrying of traditional weapons. Asked whether the stayaway applied only to IFP members, IFP Youth Treasurer Mthandeni Mkhize said: "Non-IFP members are not free to come to work. The ANC has enforced stawyayas like this before. Journalists, students and civil workers are exempted. Everyone else has to stay at home." Asked how the IFP would enforce a stayaway by non-IFP members who wanted to come to work, Mr Loliwe said: "That is our secret. We will not tell you how we will make this stawayay successful, but it will be successful, I assure you. People come to work on Monday at their own risk. We are going to ensure people do not come to work." IFP media spokesman Sipho Magubane said Putco [Public Utility Transport Corporation] would be asked to stop its bus services during the stayaway. "It is well-known that taxis will not come to town and we do not believe people will take the trains." The campaign would show the`world, which had been led to believe that all South Africans wanted the elections, that this was not true. Angered by journalists' persistent questions on whether the IFP wanted war or peace and if its campaign was a declaration of war, Mr Mhikze snapped: "If the government or the ANC attack us, this country is going the same way as Bosnia." Mr Loliwe said there would be no free and fair elections until the government and the ANC met IFP demands. "From the end of the stayaway, rolling mass action will begin and continue until the election. This is the start off our struggle," said Mr Magubane. Within hours of the press conference, SAP [South African Police] Gen Koos Calitz banned marches and gatherings in various Witwatersrand magisterial districts, including the planned Library Garden gathering and the marches to the ANC headquarters and to John Vorster Square. "Members of the public as well as shopkeepers in the Johannesburg CBD [Central Business District] are apprehensive about the intended IFP march planned for April 18. The SAP will be out in force," said police spokesman Lt-Col Eugene Opperman.
