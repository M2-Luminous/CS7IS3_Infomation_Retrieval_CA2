What makes you think that nationalism has more of a chance of success in Bulgaria today? [Gelemenov] We lost because we did not manage to accomplish our task as we should have. Many other formations existed that called themselves nationalist, and I have the feeling that the election results were forged, anyway. Since, as you say, the nationalist idea is fading, I created a new theory that is actually an old one, namely the Nazi idea. I would like to introduce this idea to Bulgaria, and as its promoter, I shall propagate the theory of moderate racism. [Krusteva] What does your theory represent? [Gelemenov] I am planning to publish a pamphlet on the subject in the near future, so that people can see it in print. It is a theory that divides Bulgaria's population into three groups, according to their ethnic origins, namely: Bulgarians who are the indigenous residents of the country should represent the first category. The Gypsies who immigrated during the period of the great migration should represent the second category, while the third category should be composed of the Turks who were the invaders. The second and third categories of people should be subject to the first category, according to my moderate racial theory. This is so, because, we, the white people in Bulgaria, are the indigenous residents of this country. In this respect I include another subcategory that is not racial, but represents a social group, intent on dividing the Bulgarian nation and troubling the souls of Christians. I am talking of the religious sects. This is actually the lowest category of people on my list. [Krusteva] Do you realize that all your theories are in contradiction to the Bulgarian Constitution? [Gelemenov] Yes, but it does not bother me, because the Bulgarian Constitution is only a bunch of papers loosely bound together with glue and string. On the other hand, my theory is based on the natural moral code, which is deeply rooted in the souls and hearts of the Bulgarian people and calls for such a racial segregation. [Krusteva] You had some relations with the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] in the past. Why did you not join that formation? [Gelemenov] On 18 April 1990, when we, all the well-known dissidents, were supposed to gather and establish the grouping that should have guaranteed the country's progress.... [Krusteva] You were not admitted to the conference? [Gelemenov] Yes, indeed. The current president Zhelyu Zhelev slammed the door in front of my face, without any explanation. When I shook hands with him upon stepping down from the bus, he took my hand for one second, and then dropped it. It was suggested to him that he not work with me, as I later heard, and he is supposed to have called me a fascist. [Krusteva] Who suggested to him that he should not cooperate with you? [Gelemenov] It was that fellow Ivaylo Trifonov [one of Zhelev's current advisers], I think. I already had several interviews with Radio Free Europe [RFE]. Together with Khristofor Subev we founded the formation called "In Defense of Religious Rights, Freedom of Conscience, and Spiritual Values." Naturally, we separated, later on. My most important action was on 10 October 1989. I celebrated a requiem for the Polish priest Jerzy Popieluszko. Only a few people learned about it, but if you can find the GAZETA WYBORCZA of those days, you can see my picture with my hand raised in the victory sign, and wearing clerical robes. On that occasion RFE and BBC made a big fuss about me, which seems to have evoked President Zhelev's jealousy. [Krusteva] Do you feel insulted by the term "fascist?" [Gelemenov] I am not impressed. I am not a racist, this is a leftist doctrine that has no place in my ideology. I am a Nazi, which means an extreme right nationalist, and this is the exact meaning of the term Nazi. It is an updated, accessible form, aimed at introducing law and order, and discipline in our country, and guaranteeing employment for all Bulgarians, mainly for Bulgarians. [Krusteva] Father Gelemenov, is all this not in contradiction to your religion? [Gelemenov] No. Christ himself said: "I have not came to bring peace on earth, but the sword." When he saw the tradesmen who had turned the temple into a "change office," he chased them away with a whip. Hence, it is sometimes necessary to turn the other page of Christian religion, which is rather militant and even aggressive. The Bulgarian people were converted by force, as a matter of fact. [Krusteva] However, God said: "You must love your neighbor." [Gelemenov] I love him, but the Bulgarian is my neighbor. The Gypsy and the Turk are not my brothers, they are my enemies. [Krusteva] Nevertheless, the Bible preaches that one should love one's enemies.... [Gelemenov] Let us rid this divine commandment from our memory for a while, and turn to history instead. The priest Gruyo Banski is one of my favorite historical figures, a man for whom I have the greatest respect. I come from Banya Village, Panaguyrishte area, myself, a matter of fact. That man, when he used to take Turkish prisoners during the 19th century liberation war, had a peculiar method of converting them to Christianity, namely with bacon. Knowing that they could not stand pork meat, he used to stuff their mouths with a piece of bacon and tell them: "You were Hassan, from now on you shall be called Ivan." In this context, I advocate a new national rebirth process that would restore the Bulgarian names of Turks and Gypsies who have adopted Arab names. I have already contributed to such actions by sending a telegram to the headmaster of the local school in Kayaloba, Kurdzhali area, who dismissed the ethnic Bulgarian Ivan Stoychev and took over his post. I wrote to him the following letter: "The national rebirth process is under way, and your post should be immediately assigned to an ethnic Bulgarian." [Krusteva] But, this is a threat. [Gelemenov] Let them get a little frightened, it is only to our advantage. Let them be afraid of us, so as to remind them that we are the indigenous residents of this country. [Krusteva] Have you no respect whatsoever for an individual's right to self-identification [as published]? [Gelemenov] Whenever our national security is affected, there can be no question of human rights. All important local government functions in Bulgarian rural areas should be assigned to Bulgarians. [Krusteva] What about your participation in the establishment of armed units under the "United Bulgarian Soldiery" formation that we already reported? [Gelemenov] I am a cofounder of the formation, but the idea of establishing such militant units for the defense of Bulgaria's honor and national pride belongs to Krum Kumanov, chairman of the Bulgarian Fatherland Party. I had to participate in the establishment of the organization, because my ideas coincide with his. As long as the units we decided to establish yesterday are still unarmed, they shall act within the framework of the extreme rightwing "Vuzrazhdane" organization, namely, they will use force whenever necessary, applying methods of oriental martial art and other forms of physical assault. As far as the armed units are concerned, Mr. Kumanov expressly stated that we shall consult with the police forces and the Army, so as not to get involved with the law, which might cause us difficulties. [Krusteva] The police do not seem very enthusiastic about your initiative....Do you have a sufficient number of volunteers? [Gelemenov] This is something you should ask Mr. Kumanov. However, volunteers, ready to defend the Bulgarian citizens against the crimes of gangsters and Gypsy elements who are killing, raping, and robbing all over the place, and against those who are trying to split our motherland, namely the ethnic Turks, can be easily found. However, we should not lay the emphasis on the weapons of such units. In the first place, they should be regarded as people who evoke the respect of those who encroach upon discipline, and as people who are trying to introduce discipline in our country. [TRUD editorial note] TRUD is carrying the above interview in accordance with its principle of publishing all existing political views on the country's situation. In this special case we are apologizing to all our readers with more delicate sensibilities.
