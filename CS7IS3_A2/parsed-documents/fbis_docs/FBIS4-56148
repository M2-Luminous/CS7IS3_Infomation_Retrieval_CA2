Under the Constitution, the president of the Republic is to convene the founding session of the new parliament in 30 days after the elections. The session will mark the end of the mandate of the government in office. In the subsequent 40 days, parliament will pass a decision on the prime minister candidate proposed by the president of the republic and on the program of his government, Palffy said. Should the prime minister candidate and his program be accepted by a majority of deputies, the new prime minister will make proposals for the ministers, who will then be appointed by the president. This means that Hungary may have a new government by late July, she said.
