The SDP, which split from the coalition in April in protest at maneuverings by its partners to create a new Diet bloc excluding the party, is moving to rejoin the fold. The sources said the numbering system would facilitate fair combined taxation and plug tax loopholes. The SDP proposal, which also calls for increased contributions from the national treasury for basic pensions, gives more emphasis to fairer taxation and public welfare measures than similar proposals by the government's tax commission and a coalition panel. The proposal will be discussed at policy consultations on Friday morning between representatives of the SDP and member parties of the ruling coalition, the sources said. Sharp differences on tax reforms remain, however, between the SDP and the ruling parties over the extent of a raise in the consumption tax from the present 3 percent and other issues, they said.
