Officials at the Administration of Industry in suburban Shanghai said they have worked out a plan to foster the leading enterprises among rural industrial businesses. A rural enterprise must meet at least one of the following three requirements if it wants to be called a "dragon head enterprise": output value surpassing 500 million yuan and profits amounting to 20 million yuan; delivery of commodities for export totalling 10 million U.S. dollars a year; or experiencing a net increase of 100 million yuan in the output value of products for 1994. The municipality now has 15,000 rural and township industrial enterprises. Last year these enterprises generated 78.8 billion yuan in output value, accounting for a quarter of Shanghai's total industrial output value. Experts believe that such a program will bring about fundamental changes in the development of Shanghai's rural industry. The structure of technological products will be gradually adapted to the operation of the city's new economy, and a modern enterprise system is being introduced into rural industrial enterprises by way of takeover, share participation and joint operation.
