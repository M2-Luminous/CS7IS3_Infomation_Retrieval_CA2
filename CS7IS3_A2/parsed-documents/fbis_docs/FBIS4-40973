At the same time, he did not rule out that there have been instances of radioactive components being smuggled out. "Yes, such attempts have been made, and we have informed the public that we have put a stop to them," he said. "However, no enriched uranium or plutonium (apparently used to manufacture arms) has been taken out of Russia." Asked about the possibility of a leakage from former Soviet republics following the collapse of the USSR, none of the participants in the conversation could be equally certain. The KRIM-TASS correspondent requested a meeting with counterintelligence nuclear experts in connection with the noise raised by Western media around the false allegations that Russia helped North Korea develop a nuclear bomb and that Russian mafia-style groups have control over the nuclear potential of Russia itself. Regarding the apprehensions recently expressed by FBI Director Louis Freeh that "nuclear materials can be smuggled out of Russia into the United States for the purposes of terrorism" or that in Russia's black market "components of nuclear weapons and highly enriched nuclear materials suitable for the manufacture of weapons are being offered for sale," the counterintelligence experts said unanimously: "None of the world's special services has detected any leakage of any components used in the production of nuclear weapons. And even Freeh himself could not cite any specific examples. We would only thank anyone who could tell us specific facts, since this is a matter directly affecting the security of our country." "All these conjectures directly affect us counterintelligence men. Indeed, the export of strategic uranium and plutonium and also of nuclear components allegedly taking place cannot occur behind the back of the Federal Counterintelligence Service," the KRIM-TASS correspondent was told by a high-ranking official of the Russian Federation's Federal Counterintelligence Service. "Therefore, experts of the Federal Counterintelligence Service have deemed it necessary to provide a few explanations." "As for the problem of so-called assistance to North Korea in creating its own nuclear bomb, be it with technology or with experts, various officials of our country have repeatedly declared our loyalty to the international agreements. Cooperation in this field has been conducted exclusively for peaceful purposes and under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA]," said an operational worker of the Federal Counterintelligence Service who at the end of 1992 took part in measures to detain a group of Russian nuclear experts trying to fly to North Korea. "Thus far we have successfully thwarted all such attempts to `recruit' people with secret information in the said field, making use of the difficult economic situation of our country, and all attempts by secret services, including those of North Korea, to extract information from nuclear facilities and to steal nuclear technologies." "Summing up the conversation with experts from the Federal Counterintelligence Service, Aleksandr Mikhaylov told the KRIM-TASS correspondent that attempts to accuse Russia of being incapable of controlling the nonproliferation of its nuclear weapons, technology and materials are obviously being made in pursuit of political aims. They are aimed at preparing public opinion in the West for the idea of establishing political control over Russian nuclear weapons."
