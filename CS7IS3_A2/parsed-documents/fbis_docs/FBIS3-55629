The President's Eyes and Ears, or How the Missile Attack Early Warning System Operates Following the Breakup of the USSR"] [Text] The top-secret missile attack early warning system [MAEW] was certainly assigned a special role among the strategic deterrence systems developed in the USSR during the Cold War years. Why? It provided the president, the country's military-political leadership, and the command of the branches of the Armed Forces with the information needed to adopt a definitive decision regarding the use of nuclear missile forces. That is, it can be said to have been in the direct sense of the word the eyes and ears of the country's leadership. Today the Cold War is behind us. The Soviet Union does not exist. Many over the horizon [OTH] tracking stations, the basis of the MAEW, have ended up over the border. Furthermore, the geopolitical position of Russia itself has changed. How has all this affected the combat readiness of the system and the lives and service of the troops? Here were are on the outskirts of Moscow. The trees are covered with snow. Before us is an outwardly unremarkable building, which has so to speak been legendary for many years. This is an MAEW command post, and no journalist has set foot inside it in its entire existence. Inside the light is dim and the duty shift wear soft footwear. There are telephones to the defense minister and the chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff on the duty officer's desk.... Opposite stands a huge panel, the size of the screen at Moscow's "Rossiya" Movie Theater, indicating the operational situation, the movement of space objects, and the status and operation of OTH tracking stations tracking near-earth space, satellites in near-earth orbit, and all launches of carrier missiles that come within the zone of visibility.... Figuratively speaking, the key to our strategic security is here in this room.... It is here that the alarming inscription suddenly flashes from time to time (for training purposes): "Stand by. Launch. Missile Attack." Whereupon it gives the launch site, the number of missiles, and where they are targeted.... This information automatically enters the special "Krokus" device which is then used to activate the "nuclear attache case" held by the country's president. At the same time it is accompanied by an audio signal, which was said to have irritated M. Gorbachev a great deal. This is said to have ended in the "Krokus" being rapidly removed from his office. As for the people stationed at the command post day and night (the duty officer, the systems analysts, and officers in the analytical service...), throughout the Cold War they were destined to be the first to learn of the start of the nuclear apocalypse. Cynical as it sounds, their job is to anticipate nuclear war. Information comes into the multicolored command post panel today from eight MAEW stations, five of them located abroad: in Ukraine (Mukachevo and Sevastopol), Azerbaijan (Mingechaur), Kazakhstan (Balkhash), and Latvia (Skrunda). They are still providing information, but what guarantee is there that it will not suddenly stop one fine day? From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's file. The development and creation of OTH MAEW and space surveillance radars began in our country in the sixties at the USSR Academy of Sciences Radiotechnical Research Institute under the leadership of Academician A.L. Mints. The first "Dnepr" stations were deployed in Kazakhstan and Siberia, forming a tight radar barrier 5,000-km long ensuring the accurate detection and tracking of space objects. During the seventies it proved possible to expand the radar field by including stations in the polar region, Latvia, and Ukraine. A plan was then developed for total, continuous OTH coverage in the missile-vulnerable western, southwestern, southern, and northeastern sectors. At the same time work was also under way on a fundamentally new phased-array OTH radar station called "Daryal".... As we can see, the system was progressively built in missile-vulnerable areas. Needless to say, at the time no one thought that the Union would break up and that the radar field erected would be bisected by the national borders of sovereign states. Or that they would de facto end up under Russia's "nuclear umbrella." However, now the question is this: Do the republics need these services today? And, if so, on what terms? If not, what is to be done with the stations? Regrettably these are not idle questions, since there are still no clear accords in this sphere or clear prospects. Admittedly there is the Treaty on Collective Security signed by six CIS states. But "nothing is forever".... Remember the promises about the unified ruble, economic, and information area. What has happened to all that? Is it true that the future of these stations and maybe the future of the MAEW is today being decided not only in Moscow but also in the CIS nation states? ...The Balkhash area, where an MAEW unit is stationed, greeted us with cold gusts of wind and snow. A strange building like a gigantic hut rose above the wild semidesert. "Our new `Daryal' looks strange and, you'll agree, impressive," Colonel G. Kozlyuk, deputy commander for work with personnel, broke into my thoughts. "The only thing is that the construction workers and fitters are unable to hand it over. So at the moment we are working with a `Dnepr.'" Vast sums of money at the old prices have been invested in the station -- around 1 billion rubles. It is a reliable radar. It has triple-redundant technological apparatus, several independent power sources, and space, radio, and facsimile communications.... It provides highly important information about ballistic missile launches, identifies objects during the booster phase of their flight path, and can instantly compute warheads' launch and landing sites as well as their flight time.... "We provided backup for the `Soyuz-Apollo' flight and all flights from Baykonur and obtained information on `Ferret,' `Columbia,' and the shuttle," Colonel N. Buchuk, deputy commander for arms, said not without pride. The MAEW has never given a false alarm regarding a missile attack (unlike its U.S. counterpart). But the "Dnepr's" have virtually outlived their service life, working continuously throughout this period. It became clear that the almost complete new "Daryal" station is not at its best. "Everything is vague now," Deputy Chief Designer Yu. Konkin, who leads a wretched life here now with an uncertain future, told me. "So it is not surprising if the equipment gradually gets neglected...." Regrettably, signs of this neglect are already striking, to whit "explosive" old electric cable in the living quarters, empty shelves in the military trading store, the boarded-up windows of empty apartments, and the lack of clear guarantees for the officers that they will be provided with amenities in Russia.... Major General Yu. Kabakov, army deputy commander for rear services, involuntarily added to the picture by citing the following figure: "Compared with former conditions, supplies to our units in neighboring countries have dropped by around 40 percent, although the tasks have remained the same." The various restrictions on the movement of freight and property and the confusion over supplies represent another barrier. In terms of some categories the unit remains on Kazakhstan's payroll, whereas as far as others are concerned it has been transferred to the Ural Military District. Realistically at the moment the unit doesn't know whether it is coming or going. And virtually everything -- from uniform badges to pipes -- has to be brought by air from Moscow. You can imagine the kind of megabucks this costs, but there is evidently no choice at the moment. Needless to say all this cannot fail to affect the people, their mood, and ultimately their attitude to their work. It is becoming more and more difficult to get replacements for these units from Russia, Colonel Ye. Tokarev, head of the army cadre department, thinks. Nonetheless at the moment, we would stress, all this is only indirectly affecting the unit's combat readiness. A commission from the Center led by Major General V. Pronov, the formation's chief of staff, came here to work and pointed to the reliability of the whole complex. It investigated a great deal and set a great deal to rights, so to speak. The unit received good marks, but its status remains unchanged. "We have no future here...," one officer told me bluntly. Why is that happening in our country? The people who have to "pull" the strategic installation out of the mire without receiving proper pay, in many respects through personal initiative and self-restraint, should be rewarded, but they "have no future." Why did we make such a mess of the identical installation in Krasnoyarsk, owing to then Foreign Minister E.A. Shevardnadze's, so to speak, tractability and under pressure from the Americans, and why are we now turning it into...a furniture factory? At a time when the United States has not just failed to mothball its long-range tracking radar in Greenland but has even modernized it and has absolutely no intention of cutting back its other stations. From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file: The U.S. BMEWS ballistic missile early warning system is established and operating. It comprises three posts on Fylingdales Moor (Britain), in Thule (Greenland), and in Clear (Alaska), which have been modernized in recent years to enable the system to detect missiles at long range. This system uses a multifunctional Precision Approach Radar station comprising a "Safeguard" ABM defense system. During the eighties more powerful assemblies of the Pave Paws OTH stations were deployed on U.S. eastern and western seaboards and southern borders. The NORAD command post in Colorado Springs exercises operational control of the entire nuclear missile early warning system. There is also a first-echelon tracking missile launches and engaged in nuclear burst fix acquisition -- five "IMEWS-2" artificial earth satellites in orbit at distances of 30,000-40,000 km. This system still monitors the entire surface of our planet, including Russia and the CIS. And in spring 1993 during the Western European Union's military and scientific conference the question was raised of creating a European ABM defense system (EUROWISAT) combined with similar U.S. systems. Its deployment is scheduled for the year 2005. So the breakup of the Union cannot so far be said to have had any effect on the MAEW. But there are problems, as we can see. Above all, the question of the status of MAEW units abroad needs to be resolved most speedily. Regrettably, everything is not as easy as we would like. Kazakhstan, for instance, has a bone to pick with the Russian military over use of its airspace, fulfillment of customs regulations, etc. But that is not the main thing. Major General A. Kasymov, chief of the Main Staff of the Kazakhstan Armed Forces, gave his view of the problem as follows: "The question of the future of the MAEW unit is in my view linked to the question of Kazakhstan's accession to the 1972 ABM Treaty. We know the Russian Federation's stance: People say that Kazakhstan cannot be a party to the treaty because it does not have the status of a nuclear state.... But this treaty must be reviewed today to take account of the opinions of states with elements of the strategic nuclear forces stationed on their territory It is therefore necessary to lay down new conditions for the creation of the `nuclear club,' either on a multilateral basis or on a bilateral basis with Russia. And to record these in a corresponding protocol like the Lisbon Protocol...." S. Tyurin, Russian consul in Kazakhstan, is inclined to think that Russia should be quicker in making up its mind about the status of the MAEW military unit in Kazakhstan: "I am not a military man, but I believe that this unit is a very important installation, spearheading scientific and technical progress. And failure to pay attention to it will cause us a setback just like the earlier setback with Baykonur in terms of the space program. At the moment -- this is a fact -- the military are surviving here as best they can. You cannot describe them as occupiers, since their main weapon is radar equipment...." Everyday material and technical difficulties are a minor misfortune. It is their uncertain status that is causing discord among the officers and the personnel. The republic has after all adopted a law laying downm that anyone who does not apply for other citizenship by 1 March automatically becomes a citizen of Kazakhstan.... So you can understand their position. And, moreover, that of their wives and school-age children, who are not particularly enthusiastic about the need for mandatory study of the Kazakh language in local schools or about obtaining secondary education certificates here. Not to mention the fact that there are Kazakhstani security and prosecutor's office organs at the garrison.... Colonel General (Retired) Yu. Votintsev, one of the people who developed the MAEW system, believes that a sorry fate lies in store for these installations if the problems are not resolved. "The outdated `Dnepr' stations will be able to operate for another two or three years, six years at most, and then the whole Commonwealth will be left without some of the most accurate means of detecting attacking missiles." However, owing to the dismantling of the Krasnoyarsk radar a gap has already formed in our OTH tracking systems in the northeast of the country. Therefore logic itself suggests that it is necessary to at least preserve what is left. "The point is that the highly effective system only works when it receives information from all OTH tracking stations. It would therefore evidently be right for the MAEW to be not a national but a supranational system," Lieutenant General S. Sokolov, MAEW army commander, said. "And, naturally, it would have other CIS countries taking a shared financial part in running it." The Main Staff of the Air Defense Troops takes a similar view. "Whether we need this installation or not is not under discussion," Colonel General V. Smirnov, commander of the missile-space defense troops, said. "But, in order to resolve the problems arising there, an agreement is first needed on Russian-Kazakhstani military cooperation -- an agreement which is not yet in place." Well, this would evidently be the optimum solution to the very difficult situation that has developed since the breakup of the USSR as far as preserving the MAEW installations is concerned. It is after all easy to destroy things -- something that we have repeatedly seen over the last few years -- but it is hard to create them. The MAEW embodied the best achievements of many generations' intellectual potential. And, however stable the world may be today, it was, is, and remains a crucial deterrent against the unleashing of a nuclear missile war. A final point. A session of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Collegium was held recently. It analyzed the results of the Russian Federation's military cooperation with neighboring states and identified tasks for 1994. It was stressed that, as a result of joint work on the part of the Russian Federation Defense and Foreign Ministries, a normative-legal base has by and large been created for military-political and military-technical cooperation with the republics of the former USSR. It was pointed out at the same time that, in view of Russia's strategic interests in this sphere, there are still plenty of unresolved questions. It only remains to hope that the necessary decisions on strategic arms will not be shelved. After all, the fate of the military and their relatives and friends depends on them. And ultimately the reliability of Russia's defense itself.
