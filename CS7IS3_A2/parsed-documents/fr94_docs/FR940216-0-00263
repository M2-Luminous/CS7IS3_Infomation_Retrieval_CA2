FR940216-0-00263 FR940216-0-00010 (iii) Uses the total of the volumes of the batches of gasoline that comprise the composite sample, and the results of the analyses of the composite sample, for purposes of compliance calculations under paragraph (g) of this section; and (iv) Does not combine summer and winter gasoline, as specified under paragraphs (g) (5) and (6) of this section, in a composite sample. ยง80.102 Controls applicable to blendstocks. (a) For the purposes of this subpart E: (1) All of the following petroleum products that are produced by a refiner or imported by an importer shall be considered ``applicable blendstocks'': (i) Reformate; (ii) Light coker naphtha; (iii) FCC naphtha; (iv) Benzene/toluene/xylene; (v) Pyrolysis gas; (vi) Aromatics; (vii) Polygasoline; and (viii) Dimate; and (2) Any gasoline blendstock with properties such that, if oxygenate only is added to the blendstock the resulting blend meets the definition of gasoline under ยง80.2(c), shall be considered gasoline. (b)(1) Any refiner or importer of conventional gasoline or blendstocks shall determine the baseline blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for each calendar year 1990 through 1993 according to the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.024 Where: BG by =Blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for base year V bs =Volume of applicable blendstock produced or imported and transferred to others during the calendar year, and used in to produce gasoline V g =Volume of gasoline produced or imported during the calendar year (2)(i) Only those volumes of applicable blendstocks for which the refiner is able to demonstrate the blendstock was used in the production of gasoline may be included in baseline blendstock-to-gasoline ratios under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (ii) The baseline volume data for applicable blendstocks and gasoline shall be confirmed through the baseline audit requirements specified in ยง80.92 and submitted in accordance with the requirements of ยง80.93. (c) Any refiner or importer shall calculate the baseline cumulative blendstock-to-gasoline ratio according to the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.025 Where: BGC base =Baseline cumulative blendstock-to-gasoline ratio V bs, i =Volume of applicable blendstock produced or imported and transferred to others during calendar year i V g, i =Volume of gasoline produced or imported during calendar year i i=each year, 1990 through 1993, for which a blendstock-to-gasoline ratio is calculated under paragraph (b) of this section (d)(1) For each averaging period, any refiner or importer shall: (i) Determine the averaging period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio according to the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.026 Where: BG a =Blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for the current averaging period V bs =Volume of applicable blendstock produced or imported during the averaging period and subsequently transferred to others V g =Volume of conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline, and RBOB produced or imported during the averaging period
