At 10:00 a.m. local time, when the several-times delayed talks were scheduled to begin on Sunday, the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) delegation arrived headed by President Radovan Karadzic and military comander General Ratko Mladic. Karadzic told TANJUG that the Serb side is willing to sign a ceasefire. The spokesman of the special U.N. envoy for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on Sunday morning announced at a press conference that Akashi would meet for consultations with Moslem-Croat Federation Vice-President Ejup Ganic. Shortly afterward Ganic told journalists that the Serb forces had allegedly failed to withdraw from the 3-km exclusion zone in Gorazde and that the conditions for the start of the talks have still not been fulfilled. He thus tried to deny reports to the contrary by U.N. monitors from this Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. Akashi's spokesman Michael Williams could not say what the chances are for the talks starting on Sunday. At the U.N. Geneva headquarters there are many skeptics who doubt that the Bosnian Moslems are ready for serious peace talks. Some believe that the entire affair aims to undermine the authority of Japanese diplomat Akashi whom the Moslems persistently and unfoundedly accuse of siding with the Serbs. Williams also said that, according to his information, the first round of talks, sponsored by the "Contact Group," on a comprehensive political solution and territorial division in Bosnia, has been completed at the French U.N. mission. Sources in the Bosnian Serb delegation said that the Serbs are dissatisfied by the maps proposed by the "Contact Group" in Washington because they are a basis for a unitary Bosnia, as adovcated by Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic.
