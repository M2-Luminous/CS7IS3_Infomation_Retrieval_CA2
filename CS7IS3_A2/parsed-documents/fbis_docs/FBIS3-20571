Since the beginning of this year, especially since the announcement of the joint emergency circular by the two general offices on 19 March, the Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government have explicitly abolished, corrected, annulled and prohibited those documents, fee-collecting measures and erroneous practices which run counter to the provisions of the "Regulations" announced by the State Council. The State Council's policy on peasants' burdens (which should not exceed 5 percent of their per capita net income) is being basically implemented in Shanxi. According to an estimate, peasants' burdens were reduced by 261.739 million yuan this year and their per capita burden dropped by 11.69 yuan, representing 2.18 percent of their per capita net income in 1992. Measures have also been taken to reduce peasants' burdens in the 435 funding programs for the 1992 fiscal year, which had exceeded the 5 percent limit as specified by the State Council, accounting for 64.7 percent of the total amount to be reduced and amounting to 75.154 million yuan. Burdens Hurt Peasants' Feelings Are peasants' financial burdens in Shanxi Province heavy? To what extent do peasants suffer from such burdens? According to the 1992 annual statistic report on peasants' burdens, there were four prefectures and cities, 42 counties and 672 villages and townships where taxes and charges levied on peasants on a per capita basis exceeded the 5 percent limit specified by the "regulations." Those villages and townships where peasants' burdens exceeded the 5 percent limit were mainly in the farming areas in the grain-producing farming areas and remote mountainous districts in Xinzhou, Luliang, Jinzhong, Linfen, Yuncheng, Yanbei and Changzhi. The number of villages and townships in the Xinzhou Prefecture, where peasants' burdens exceeded the limit accounts for 72 percent of the total number of villages and townships in the prefecture. According to surveys conducted in various localities, there are more than 100 different funding programs in most of the prefectures and cities. A survey in 51 townships and 171 villages in Linfen prefecture shows that as many as 123 different types of charges and fees are being levied on peasants by 48 different departments. Peasants in some localities are unable to withstand the unreasonable apportions and excessive charges on them. Such apportions and charges have also affected the relationship between the party and the masses and shaken the people's confidence in the party. For example, the authorities in Hongzhiyi Township in Yuncheng City increased the agricultural tax and imposed unreasonable service charges on peasants. When peasants could not afford to pay, the authorities then organized public security personnel with handcuffs to collect fees and taxes. They had illegally assaulted peasants, and detained 10 peasants and students in six villages. Cases Are Investigated and Handled To Win People's Confidence The Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government have decided to regard their task in alleviating peasants' financial burdens and tackling the issue of peasants' heavy burdens as one of the two major tasks in rectifying the party style and building a clean and honest government. While organizing their staff members to screen all relative documents and carry out self-examination and correct their own errors, they have also investigated and handled several typical cases in which some authorities at the different levels have violated laws and discipline to increase peasants' financial burdens. An incident occurred at the end of 1992 in Shentangping township, Kelan County. The head of the township and a secretary of the township party committee, together with judicial and public security personnel with handcuffs and truncheons, broke into 30-odd peasants' houses in Kangjiahui Village to collect fees and charges. They took away peasants' television sets, sewing machines, bicycles, push carts, furniture and grain crops. The provincial, prefectural and county authorities jointly investigated the case and timely took disciplinary actions against those lawbreakers who were involved in the incident. The authorities also returned all the belongings taken away from peasants' houses and apologized to the peasants for the wrongdoing. Eight peasant families including one headed by Liu Hailian moved into the Zhaizi Village in Zhongyang County several years ago. This year, the villagers committee decided to impose another 1,000 yuan on each family for "moving into the village" in addition to the 1,000 yuan it had already collected, otherwise no farmland will be allocated to them to grow their grain crops. Peasants of these eight families appealed to the provincial authorities for help. After receiving the appeal, Secretary Hao Tianxi of the Zhongyang County CPC Committee, immediately assigned someone to look into this matter and solved the problem in three days. Peasants jubilantly said that the party and the government fully support us. We must work hard to carry out production in order to repay the leading comrades for what they did for us, they added. Unreasonable Charges Still Prevail Since the general offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Emergency Circular on Realistically Reducing Peasants' Burdens" on 19 March, especially after the telephone conference sponsored by the State Council on the work of alleviating peasants' burdens, the Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government have paid even greater attention to reducing peasants' financial burdens. Besides abolishing the "three advocation's and five consolidation's", they have stopped implementing all documents and regulations on collecting fees from peasants. Later, they screened all documents from the top level to the bottom level, while carefully examining all funding programs from the lower level to the higher level in various localities. According to statistics, 2,977 documents and 3,378 funding programs concerning peasants' financial burdens were screened, and a total of 449 erroneous practices which violated the "regulations" of the State Council were prohibited. When all documents on peasants' burdens were carefully examined, unreasonable charges were canceled and erroneous practices which violate the "regulations" of the State Council were prohibited. Normally no one should dare to impose any unreasonable charge on peasants. However, this was not true. Even in August 1993, there remained some departments and townships which still seriously violated the guideline laid down by the "Emergency Circular" of the two general offices. They defied the orders and the prohibitions, and continued to collect unreasonable fees from peasants. Our reporter cited the following examples during his tour: From May to September 1993, the Bureau of Electric Power, the Bureau of Land and the Bureau of Farm Machinery in Pianguan County continued to collect electric power maintenance fee, land registration fee and farm machinery administration fee at the township level. From April to July, 11 departments in Yangcheng County including the Bureau of Land, the Bureau of Farm Machinery, the Bureau of Electric Power and the Bureau of Communications still illegally collected fees of 28 types from peasants totaling 2.43 million yuan. Twenty of the 25 townships in Yangcheng County continued to illegally levy fees on peasants. The number of such illegal funding programs reached 27, totaling 2.74 million yuan. The Bureau of Communications in suburban Jincheng City laid down a rigid rule demanding that each of the 31 villages in the Jinmiaopu Township buy two sets of videotape called: "Eight Diagrams Specified by the Book of Changes [one of the "Six Confucian Classics"]. It collected 39 yuan for each set. From March to August, one township and six units in Qinshui County still violated the guideline laid down by the documents of the central, provincial and city authorities in this connection, and continued to illegally collect fees from peasants for the development of collective economy. The Bureau of Civic Affairs in Lingchuan County demands that all young people who wish to register for marriage must attend a "pre-marriage class," watch a videotape for the newly wed and buy a book, an audio cassette tape and two badges. It collected 40 yuan from each registrant for all this. After all the aforementioned problems were discovered, the Pianguan county and the various counties under the administration of the Jincheng county had seriously handled all these cases on time. Most of the fees collected had been returned. Peasants Still Dare Not Radiantly Smile Yet "After paying enough to the state and retaining enough for the collective, what is left belongs to peasants themselves." This is the people's general impression on their income from labor after the implementation of the system under which production groups assume full responsibility for the fulfillment of production plans in the rural areas in 1983. In fact, this has become the basis on which the collective collects money from peasants. During our reporter's surveying trip, many peasants said that there are figures based on which we make payments to the state, but there are no figures to show the exact amount of money which we need to pay to the collective. How much is "enough"? There is no definite figure. It has become a system under which we must pay what we are asked to pay. When our reporter mentioned the abolishment of the miscellaneous funding programs and the provision specified by the State Council that all the fees collected at the village and township levels "should not exceed 5 percent of the peasants' net income," they jubilantly said that now there is a highest limit and that the collective can no longer collect money beyond the limit. In order to effectively control peasants' financial burdens and prevent these erroneous practices on peasants' burdens from resurfacing, a card system on peasants' financial burdens has been set up on a provincial basis. The "Control Card for Peasants' Burdens" has been issued to 5.95 million farming households free of charge. When our reporter conducted his survey and called on peasants in Pianguan County, Pingyao County and Qinshui County, he saw these cards on several occasions. The portion of the peasant's total income for (budgeted) public accumulation at the village and township levels that the subject peasant must pay and the number of work days for community work that he or she must contribute for this year were clearly written out on the card which is often regarded as peasants' "amulet." "With this card on hand, we feel at ease. We know how much we should pay and how many work days of labor we should contribute," said peasants. The party committees and the governments at various levels have removed the shackles on peasants so that peasants can take a deep breath and straighten themselves. They are happy and smiling. However, they are still somewhat worried about the possibility to find their burdens once again increased after the autumn harvest and their hope dashed. Peasants are worried amidst their joy. What do the policy and law enforcing cadres at the county, township and village levels think about all this? Not long ago, the Law Enforcement and Inspection Team of the State Council on Peasants' Burdens distributed questionnaires among village and township cadres in 143 counties in Shanxi Province. Among the respondents, 9.1 percent of cadres said that they would follow the instructions of their superiors. When our reporter conducted his survey in the Nanyijian Township in Pingyao County, a township party committee secretary bluntly said: "We will collect more fees after the autumn harvest, if our expenses exceed our budget." Although there are not many cadres who belong to this category, their fuzzy legal concept and unhealthy work style in defying orders and prohibitions cannot but make peasants feel uneasy. We should no longer hurt peasants's feelings. Let us hope that there will be no relapse in the future.
