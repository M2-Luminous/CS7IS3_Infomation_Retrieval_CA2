Idigov said in an interview with Interfax today that he saw no connection between the dismissal of Shakhray and his tough position to Chechnya. "This policy is being defined either by more high-ranking officials or by the Russian legislative institutions," Idigov stated having concluded that the policy of Russia towards Chechnya could not be altered much after the dismissal of one politician. "If the Russian leadership wanted to alter its policy it would do this even without consulting Shakhray," Idigov suggested. "It is likely that his policy has just come to a deadlock and it was high time to dismiss him," Idigov concluded.
