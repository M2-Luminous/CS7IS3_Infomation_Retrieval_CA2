FBIS4-57771 "drlat100_m_94014" FBIS-LAT-94-100 Daily Report 22 May 1994 Brazil CUT Elects President, Executive Committee Members CUT Elects President, Executive Committee Members PY2305164394 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2135 GMT 22 May 94 PY2305164394 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO Portuguese BFN [By Liliana Pinheiro] [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 May (AE) -- The Fifth National CUT [Sole Workers Central] Congress, which ended in Sao Paulo today, became a big party in support of PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Officially, however, CUT will not support Lula, based on a vote by members from almost all the regions. Except for the "Workers Cause" faction, which accounted for less than 1 percent of representatives at the CUT Congress, the other leftist factions agreed to elect a single ticket, on which Vicente Paulo da Silva, also known as "Vicentinho," was elected CUT president. The slogan at the plenary session was "Lula president, CUT independent." At the end of the congress the approximately 2,000 delegates signed a statement of support for Lula. Lula will begin his campaign in the CUT grassroots on 23 May. Early in the morning, he will seek votes at the Volkswagen and Scania plants from a loudspeaker-fitted truck of the Union of Metalworkers of the Sao Paulo industrial belt. The CUT, as an organization, will not support him, but unions and leaders have been authorized to decide whether or not to use the CUT structure. Direct financial help was prohibited. The delegates did not approve the creation of a Pro-Lula Workers Fund, which was aimed at raising funds for the campaign, on behalf of the CUT. The last day of deliberations was devoted almost entirely to political affairs and the designation of members of the single ticket. The executive board, with 25 full members, will have 14 members of the Coordination faction, which is the most moderate sector, to which Vicentinho belongs. The other posts were filled by members of more radical leftist groups: four from the Union Class Movement, two from the CUT grassroots faction, and two from the Unified Social Workers Party. The Work, Marxist Trend, and Socialist Force factions won one position each. The Coordination faction increased its participation with respect to the previous CUT congress, when 13 of its members were designated to the executive board. This will make Vicentinho's job easier because he intends to negotiate agreements for several sectors, based on the agreement reached in the car manufacturing sector. Lula, who attended the closing reception, praised the new CUT president's willingness to negotiate. "The change has improved CUT," he said, adding that "Vicentinho conveys confidence to the public, and has the flexibility to negotiate and search for a consensus."
