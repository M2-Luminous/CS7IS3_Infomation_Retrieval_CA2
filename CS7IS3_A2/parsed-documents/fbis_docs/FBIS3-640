The police appear not to have intervened. Mr. Mangope's helicopter is reported to have left the capital, Mmabatho. Some reports say Mr. Mangope was aboard but this hasn't been confirmed. There have been several days of antigovernment protests in Bophuthatswana and earlier today, about 200 policemen said they supported calls for the homeland to be incorporated into South Africa. Mr. Mangope has been resisting demands that Bophuthatswana should take part in South Africa's first nonracial elections next month. The African National Congress [ANC] had called for the South African security forces to intervene to stop the unrest.
