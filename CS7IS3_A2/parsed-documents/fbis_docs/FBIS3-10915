The diplomat, who participated in a news conference held by the Colombian-Venezuelan Integration Chamber to announce the Binational Investors Conference to be held next week in Caracas, said: "The candidates with the best changes have already said they will more or less continue the same policies towards Venezuela." Colombian presidential elections will be held on 8 May, when the two leading candidates, Ernesto Samper, candidate of the ruling Liberal Party, and Andres Pastrana, candidate for the Conservative Party, will face each other. Meanwhile, parliamentary elections are scheduled for Sunday. Casas Santamaria said his government is also confident President Caldera will not change Venezuelan policy towards his country, which the president and the finance and foreign ministers have also confirmed. In fact, the ambassador also announced the possibility of a binational ministers' meeting to discuss the border issue, which he called "the most complicated problem in relations between Venezuela and Colombia." Concerning increased trade between the two countries, Casas Santamaria reaffirmed Colombia's pledge to continue the policies and norms that have encouraged a trade increase, and he appeared optimistic about the possibility that Colombian investments will increase significantly this year compared to 1992. In this regard, members of the Colombian-Venezuelan Integration Chamber estimated that $2 billion will be negotiated this year, which would represent a 25 percent increase compared to 1993, when $1.6 billion were negotiated. According to business estimates, this increase will be attributable to an increase in oil services and construction trade. Regarding oil services, Colombia is planning an aggressive oil production program which will allow the possibility of investment by Venezuelan companies. Therefore, the investment possibilities in Colombia will diversify. Colombia received $63 million in Venezuelan capital during 1993, primarily used in financial and insurance areas, metal-mechanics, marketing, and the distribution of Venezuelan products in Colombia. Moreover, the Colombian industry injected almost $6 million in Venezuela's computer, lumber, and automobile sectors. The main objective of the Colombian-Venezuelan Investors Conference will be to evaluate the results of two years of integration, as of this month, and to study new investment opportunities in the two countries, particularly joint ventures in some binational projects.
