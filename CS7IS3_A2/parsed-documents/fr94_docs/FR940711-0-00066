FR940711-0-00066 FR940711-0-00019 Utah proposed to revise recodified Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, to indicate that the Board will promulgate rules under the authority of UCA 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), and 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1). UCA 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, a provision of the Utah Oil and Gas Conservation Act, provides the statutory authority for jurisdiction of the Board over oil, gas, and mining operations. UCA 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), a provision of the Utah Mined Land Reclamation Act, provides that, in addition to the powers, functions, and duties provided to the Board in UCA 40&hyph;6, the Board has the power, function, and duty ``to enact rules according to the procedures and requirements of Title 63, Chapter 46a, that are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.'' UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1), a provision of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act, provides that, in addition to the powers, functions, and duties of the Board and Division provided in UCA 40&hyph;8, the Board and Division have the power, function and duty ``to make and promulgate in accordance with Title 63, Chapter 46a, the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, such rules as are specifically necessary for the regulation of coal mining operations and reclamation operations.'' The proposed references in Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112 to UCA 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), and 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1), which give the Board the necessary powers to enact rules regulating oil, gas and mining operations, are consistent with the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 732.15(b), which requires a State regulatory authority to possess the authority, under State law, to implement, administer, and enforce all of the applicable requirements of Subchapter K of the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed rule. 4. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, Petition to Initiate Rulemaking Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500 to provide that ``persons other than the Division or Board'' may petition to initiate rulemaking pursuant to the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Board at Utah Admin. R. 641 and the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act at UCA 63&hyph;46&hyph;8. Utah's definition of ``person'' at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;3(14) is substantively identical to the definition of ``person'' at section 701(19) of SMCRA. Also, Utah's definition of ``person'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 is substantively identical to the definition of ``person'' in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.5. Both definitions include units and instrumentalities ``of Federal, State, or local government,'' such as the Board and the Division.
