Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman told the Anatolian Agency that Turkey was one of the countries who received the highest number of requests for asylum because of the tension in neighboring countries over the last 15 years. "Without receiving assistance in many cases, Turkey has graciously extended help to these people, by going beyond its legislation," he said. Ataman stressed that the accusations of Amnesty International that those asking asylum in Turkey were harassed by the police, were untrue. "The policy of Turkey is not to send any person back, unless there are forcible reasons," he said. Ataman also stressed that claims that foreign delegations were treated badly in Turkey were a distortion. "The death threats of the separatist terror organization on voters and candidates in the southeast have created a serious terror and security problem in the region," he said. "Our security units have naturally taken into account the security of the so-called observer delegations and the risks posed by the provocations of some of these in the region," he said. Ataman stressed that it was very meaningful for Amnesty International to refrain from accepting terrorism as an activity which should be banned. He added that by calling terrorists "guerrillas" Amnesty was legitimizing the terror organization.
