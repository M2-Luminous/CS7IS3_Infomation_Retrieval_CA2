FBIS3-55704 "drsov007_r_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Jan 1994 Azerbaijan Karabakh Defense Chief on Conflict Issues LD1001221594 LD1001221594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 1915 GMT on 10 January carries its "Moment of Truth" program, hosted by Andrey Karaulov, who interviews Robert Kocharyan, chairman of the State Defense Committee of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The interview was recorded on 4 January 1994. Topics covered include Kocharyan's personal background, the danger of escalation of the war in Karabakh, the causes of the conflict, the Khodzhaly massacre in February 1992, whether anything has been gained since the conflict began, whether the Armenians' demands were realistic in 1988, how the Armenians obtained their weapons and whether they received aid from Armenia proper, and the state of the Karabakh economy. Asked by Karaulov whether he would be prepared to sit down together with Azerbaijani Leader Geydar Aliyev in another edition of "Moment of Truth," Kocharyan says: "Yes, I would. What's more, we have things to talk about; I am ready, of course. I think that in general terms, if it works out, maybe it will save a few lives. If it only saves one life, it is already an achievement." Pressed by Karaulov to confirm that Nagorno-Karabakh would never be prepared to be part of Azerbaijan, Kocharyan replies: "On 10 December 1991 a referendum was held in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the will of the people was expressed in the terms you have used. I believe that at the present time it would be more correct to freeze the war, if need be to bring in some disengaging forces which would simply take the heat out of the conflict between the two sides, and talks would be held, talks on status, talks on relations. Maybe some kind of mutually acceptable solutions would be found, some kind of treaty-based relations with Azerbaijan. It is not necessary at present, in the current situation, to touch on the subject of territorial integrity, the subject of independence, but simply to stop the war, and give people time to get their breath back. The people will decide what should then be done, it's their right, their business." At the end of the program, a caption states that news of the latest Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh came in just as the program was being prepared for broadcasting, and that a statement has just been received from Kocharyan by telephone specially for the program. The statement says: "Azerbaijan, having rejected the Russian initiatives for a cease-fire and the CSCE Minsk group's plan for a settlement to the conflict, began a major offensive in early December along the entire front. Continuous heavy fighting has been going on for more than a month. The situation is extremely difficult. On the southern section of the front the Azerbaijani army has managed, in spite of heavy losses, to make substantial headway. The territory of the adjoining state is being used in the offensive. The Azerbaijanis have prepared the offensive quite thoroughly. A large number of new tanks and armored personnel carriers have appeared, and troops are armed with 1993 model firearms, American anti-tank systems, American military radio sets and shells, and Turkish mortars. Artillery is constantly in action. All this testifies to major supplies of munitions and arms. And this is alongside the existence of a number of UN Security Council resolutions banning arms supplies to the region. Fighting in the Azerbaijani army are mojahedin from Afghanistan, specialist instructors from Turkey, and numerous mercenaries from Ukraine and Russia. It only remains to ponder on who pays for all this. It is very difficult for us to fight back with our limited human and material resources. We are too few to fight everyone. We are relying on the courage and will of our people."
