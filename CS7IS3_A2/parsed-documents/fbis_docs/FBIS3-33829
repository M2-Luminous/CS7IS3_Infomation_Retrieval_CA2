The French oil lobby has expressed dismay at this step on the part of the regime, since it had earlier promised French companies significant privileges. The regime even implied that it was willing to grant the Iraqi Majnun oilfields to French companies in return for billions of dollars, which these companies would have made up for in a matter of weeks through oil export sales. France is dissatisfied with the changes, which French security sources attribute to the regime's attempts to gain U.S. favor at the expense of the promises he made to the French oil lobbies. Political observers interpret the regime's conduct with France as a deliberate attempt to drag the United States into allying with it and negotiating an oil deal that would ease the oil embargo imposed on the regime and an attempt to restore normal bilateral ties with the United States. In this framework, the Kurdish opposition in Turkey has destroyed the Iraqi oil pipeline that passes through Turkey, wasting several millions of barrels of oil ready for export--the oil that remained in the pipes after the imposition of the oil embargo by the UN Security Council. This was reported by Turkish sources, but was not reported by any neutral international source. Political observers believe that the matter is nothing more than an attempt to settle accounts between the regime and Turkey concerning the oil that remained in the pipeline. Turkey demanded the lion's share with the excuse that it had been harmed by the Kuwait war. Saddam's regime, for its part, demanded half of the oil. However, visits among officials of the two sides, in addition to the Turkish political stance that recently has tended to demand a lifting of the embargo and the reinstatement of the regime to the international family, indicate that this is part of an economic deal to enable Turkey to get what it wants in exchange for political backing for Saddam's regime. To avoid embarrassment, the two sides preferred to accuse the Kurdish opposition in Turkey, thus achieving their collective objectives. This means that Saddam's regime pays no attention to the wealth, resources, and interests of the Iraqi people since its ultimate goal is to remain in office and commit the most horrible crimes against our kinsmen in Iraq.
