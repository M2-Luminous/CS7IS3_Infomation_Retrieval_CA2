Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Sarid denied allegations made by Nabil Sha'th, according to which inflexible instructions from Rabin foiled agreement. Sarid asserted that Sha'th had approved a document formulated by the delegations and only retracted his agreement after 'Arafat expressed dissatisfaction with the paper. Minister Sarid that an exchange of accusations between the two delegations would neither help nor promote the negotiations. Instead of continuing to analyze what happened in Davos, Sarid said, we must prepare for the meeting in Cairo in order to guarantee its success.
