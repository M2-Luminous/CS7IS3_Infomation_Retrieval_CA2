The Central Bank of Russia has recently spent around $1 billion to stabilize the ruble. The bank created its foreign currency reserves largely thanks to its vigorous purchases of foreign currency last year. According to preliminary Central Bank of Russia estimates, the surge of inflation in January 1994 reached approximately 20-25 percent.
