Admiral Martinez Busch said the Navy is always concerned about renewing "the old ships, those that are already obsolete." He indicated that the units to be purchased are large ones. He declined to indicate what type of units, although he mentioned they will be very useful to cover the long Chilean geography. According to EL MERCURIO, it has been learned that the units are two 8,000-metric ton ships for transporting the Marine infantry and its equipment. Martinez Busch added: "We will be able to provide support for isolated areas with large quantities of materiel. The naval units are not only war units but support units for all Chileans." Last week the Chilean Air Force announced the purchase from Belgium of 20 Mirages to replace the old Hawker Hunter.
