FR940830-1-00088 FR940830-1-00014 A tracking system can be used to provide a manifest of waste movement, track the waste from a waste source to the offloading facility, or serve any purpose deemed appropriate by the Administrator to track persistent violators. Enforcement Sections 4105 and 4108 of SPA give the Secretary of Transportation the authority to enforce the requirements of SPA and assess penalties. The Secretary has delegated this authority to the USCG. Under SPA, EPA also is provided authority under sections 4105 and 4104 to: (1) Conduct investigations of an owner or operator of a vessel or facility if the owner or operator has five or more separate violations during a six-month period; and (2) request that the Secretary of Transportation suspend or revoke a permit issued to a vessel for a violation of SPA or regulations promulgated under SPA. SPA section 4108 states that after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, a person found by the Secretary of Transportation to have violated the SPA or a regulation promulgated under it for which a civil penalty is provided is liable to the United States for the civil penalty so provided. 33 U.S.C. section 2608(a). Section 4109 of the SPA establishes that a person who violates SPA requirements is liable to the United States government for a civil penalty of not more than $25,000. 33 U.S.C. Section 2609(a). The Act specifies that each day of a continuing violation is a separate violation. Id. Proposed ยง237.7(a) codifies the notice and opportunity for a hearing provisions from the statutory language of SPA section 4108(a). The legislative history of SPA makes it clear that the assessment of civil penalties should not require an ``on the record'' hearing within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. H. Conf. Rep. No. 100&hyph;1090, at 46 (Oct. 18, 1988). As noted above, the USCG has been delegated the authority to enforce the requirements of SPA, and the legislative history specifically cites the USCG civil penalty procedural rules under 33 CFR 1.07 as providing the appropriate level of due process, notice, and opportunity to be heard. Id. Thus, ยง237.7(a) of the proposed rule specifies that prior to issuing a SPA civil penalty, notice and an opportunity for a hearing will be conducted in accordance with the Coast Guard's civil penalty procedures. The Coast Guard has indicated to EPA its intent to utilize the procedures in 33 CFR 1.07 for imposition of civil penalties under SPA. Section 237.7(b) provides the legal authority for the imposition of a civil penalty for any violation of the substantive provisions of part 237 by restating the statutory penalty level provided in section 4109(a) of SPA. With regard to the ``person'' liable for penalties, section 4104(c) broadly defines the term ``person'' to mean an ``individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation (including a government corporation), partnership, association, state, municipality, commission, political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body.'' 33 U.S.C. 2604(4). Under the terms of ยง237.3, any of such ``persons'' could qualify as an owner or operator of a regulated entity, and be subject to the assessment of civil penalties by the Secretary. EPA Review Procedures and Grounds for Denial Section 4102(e) provides that the Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator, shall issue or deny a permit, within 30 days of receiving a complete application. EPA and the USCG intend to establish the inter-agency permit and application review procedures in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). These inter-agency review procedures will be developed jointly with the USCG. III. Compliance With Other Acts and Orders A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), The Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or
