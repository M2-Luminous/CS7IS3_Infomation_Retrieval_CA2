We have offered political scientists, journalists, and deputies themselves a chance to comment on them. Readers will easily see for themselves that the first event preoccupies our respondents considerably more. And this is natural because with the release of the Lefortovo prisoners there has been a qualitative change in the political situation in the country. And not for the better, it would seem. Sergey Yushenkov, deputy of the State Duma (Russia's Choice): The Role of the Government in Both Matters Is Enigmatic The amnesty decree was adopted with numerous violations of the standing orders, serious ones at that. I will cite just some of them. Rybkin did not have the right to preside over the sitting of the State Duma since he had presented the report. But he employed the methods and means of the former Supreme Soviet produced under the leadership of Ruslan Khasbulatov. It may be said that Khasbulatov was set at liberty thanks to the methods he employed in the Supreme Soviet. A second most flagrant violation was that the decree was assumed as the basis, amendments were submitted, many amendments were rejected, but at least one amendment was adopted. That is, the decree should have been put to the vote one more time, not as the basis this time but as a whole. This was not done. The next violation was connected with the fact that representatives of Russia's Choice were not allowed to speak to the motion but supporters of the amnesty, on the other hand, were recognized repeatedly. Thus the decree, which was adopted with the most flagrant violations of the standing orders, has no legal validity. This was not, unfortunately, noticed by the representatives of the president, this was not noticed by the prosecutor general. Although we can agree with their interpretation of the Constitution, amnesty is, truly, the prerogative of the State Duma, not the president. Though in this case the content of the amnesty goes beyond the framework of amnesty proper, it was a pardon. And the latter is the prerogative of the president. The affiliation to the Communists, the Agrarians, and the Zhirinovskiyites of the Shakhray faction, New Regional Policy, and Women of Russia and their incantation to the effect that if we adopt the amnesty decree, peace will reign in the country, is at the least very naive and simply foolish. And it is surprising that such a shrewd politician as Shakhray does not understand this. It is most likely that he understands full well that it is extraordinarily important for him currently to score points before the presidential elections, but he has in this case lost considerable popularity. The amnesty decree testifies also that the pro-government grouping in parliament has strengthened. From a number of indirect indications it may be said with a great deal of confidence that Chernomyrdin's department was involved in the adoption of this decree. The president had to have noticed this, I believe. The ministers, except for the members of Russia's Choice, voted for the amnesty, as did the officials connected with the government. There is also indirect evidence that the document was looked over by the government's legal services. That is, the government has thrown the president, we may say, an open challenge. Whether he will take up the challenge or not it is hard to say, although the statements he made, all too late, it is true, testify that he has a very clear idea of the disastrous nature of the decision. It essentially takes us back to a state of, at best, uncertainty, at worst, the eve of civil war. The act of amnesty showed very clearly that the State Duma is, in effect, a second version of the Supreme Soviet, and this is making the world community very leery. For the act of amnesty is out-and-out antidemocratic. It is frightening to imagine what would happen had the State Duma retained the functions that had been assigned the Supreme Soviet. Now concerning the president's report. It contains a great deal that requires analysis. Certain things connected with a strengthening of the role of the state, for example, are incomprehensible to me. It is clear, of course, that in such spheres as the fight against crime and the problem of military security and security in general the role of the state should be increased. But when it is a question, say, of an increase in the role of the state in the economy and when the putative manifestation of this role is not deciphered, we could encounter exclusively administrative methods. In his report the president attempted to cover all aspects of life, but to be honest I did not see in the document an aspiration to achieve decisive changes, primarily in the sphere of the economy. And we have just two paths--either a return to the old, command methods or new steps forward, toward the market economy. Which one we choose will be shown by the prime minister's report. And we may then draw a conclusion as to what was, in fact, implied in the president's report. The fact that the opposition was quite well disposed toward the report puts us on our guard also. It is entirely to its liking. I by no means proceed from the principle that since this suits the enemy, it should not, consequently, suit us. Not at all. I have given the reasons why the report does not suit me or why, at least, it requires some additional clarification. In short, I personally can draw a final conclusion concerning the report only after the president's response to the government's program. Andrey Nuykin, Deputy of the State Duma (Russia's Choice): From Zhirinovskiy's `Falcons' to Shakhray's `Falconets' I have an ambivalent attitude toward the Duma's amnesty decree. First, the pompous statements it contains about "national reconciliation, peace, and harmony" are utterly hypocritical. You do not have to be a Seneca to understand that political intriguers, putschists, street toughs, firebrands, killers, and looters, set at liberty and absolved of responsibility for bloody crimes, will enthusiastically join in the struggle for the seizure of power, resorting to provocations, terror, mass unrest, and destabilization in all walks of life. The formation of a broad coalition of political forces--from Zhirinovskiy's "falcons" to Shakhray's "falconets"--which was revealed in the course of the preparation and adoption of the decree and which has been bolstered by the appearance in the dirty political kitchen of proven top-level intriguers and speculators with Malinovskiy-like dreams of "civil peace" will find few friends. Second, both the insipid response of the president to a situation that once again reeks strongly of civil war and the submissiveness with which our leaders of justice and law and order revealed a readiness to agree with the incompetent and criminal action of the State Duma are extremely surprising and disheartening. Amnesty is not practiced in respect to specific persons and crimes. It presupposes merely articles of the Criminal Code and nonindividualized categories of crimes (pregnant women, minors, and so forth). The Duma has in practice assumed the function of granting a pardon (prior to the judicial ascertainment of guilt, what is more). And a pardon, according to the Constitution, may be granted only by the president. A.M. Yakovlev, representative of the president in the Duma, together with our esteemed Prosecutor General A. Kazannik, should have known about such elementary legal "niceties." Third, the Duma has shown itself completely by this action to be a socially dangerous force bent on the incitement of civil war. Its basis is composed once again, alas, not of legislator professionals but irresponsible political intriguers concerned with struggle for their personal careers and party or clan interests. The small group of consistent democrats will hardly be in a position to neutralize their socially dangerous activity. At the first constitutional possibility this Duma must be dissolved. Otherwise we will once again have to get out of political crises with the help of tanks, Alphas, and other unconstitutional mechanisms. Viktor Sheynis, Deputy of the State Duma (`Yabloko' faction): Both a Thief and a Terrorist Are Equal? The amnesty decree is one of the most important decisions adopted by parliament since it started business. But it is fraught with serious complications and dangers. The "Yabloko" faction, of which I am a member, decided when preliminarily discussing this question that it could not support this decree, and not one member of our faction voted for it. We are for national reconciliation and a policy of compromise, of course. But it should be pursued between those who can, are capable of, and are prepared to agree to compromise. This is an essential condition, which in this case was not observed. It is significant that the speech of the leader of the Communist faction during discussion of this matter was of a clearly expressed peremptory nature. He interpreted national reconciliation as a form, virtually, of capitulation before the onslaught of quite aggressive forces close to the participants in those events. The mere principle of the unification of heterogeneous documents and heterogeneous groups of convicted persons in a single "package" evokes objections. Essentially, the decision was adopted in respect to three different groups of convicts. First, persons convicted of various criminal offenses, so to speak. I say "so to speak" because our Criminal Code does not draw a distinction between criminal offensives proper and crimes of this political aspect or the other. The point of departure for the decision was a draft that had been sent by the president. It was properly drawn up from both the formal and substantive viewpoints, incidentally. The Legislation Committee performed certain additional work, excluding from the list of those amnestied audacious hooligans and persons who had committed rape. In this form the document was perfectly satisfactory, and it should have been supported. The second group is composed of so-called economic crimes and persons convicted, in fact, for private entrepreneurial, commercial, and brokerage activity. Activity that is essentially now perfectly legal. These people should have been released long ago, and they are mentioned in the draft. And, finally, the most contentious section of those amnestied--the participants in the events of August 1991 and May and October 1993. Setting free and dropping the charges against people who destabilized the political situation evoke misgivings in themselves. But there is one further aspect making support for this document absolutely unacceptable. The part of it that pertained to political amnesty was compiled in a legally improper manner. For example, the list of persons to be amnestied was determined with insufficient precision. And there is for me a very considerable difference between, say, the political leaders who called from the White House balcony for an assault on Ostankino, city hall, and the Kremlin and the combatants. The call was undoubtedly criminal. But, nonetheless, an appeal in itself is a crime of one nature, and the organization of the gangs of toughs who carried out the attack on Ostankino and city hall and who were prepared to seize a number of official institutions is a crime of an entirely different sort. I refer to such ringleaders of the armed gangs as Messrs Anpilov, Barkashov, Terekhov, and certain others. In respect to these people the amnesty is, in my view, extremely dangerous. For these people will hardly be capable of appreciating the humanity of the action that was taken. They will, most likely, continue what they were doing in the days leading up to the event. Under these conditions we were put in a very difficult position. I could not support this political amnesty decision in the form in which it was presented, but nor could I vote against the president's amnesty draft or, most important, against the release of the people accused of economic crimes. It seems to me that the president's position on this matter is distinguished by somewhat of an uncertain and improper approach. He should have anticipated that in sending the bill to the Duma, other groups of people would obviously have been mixed in with his draft, and he should have responded to this not when the Duma had already adopted a decision. The most deplorable aspect in this event, perhaps, was the disconnection of the democratic forces in parliament and the role which the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction headed by Sergey Shakhray performed in the organization of this "package." I find totally unconvincing the belated explanations disseminated the next day by K. Zatulin, a leader of this faction. The problem of the unity of the democratic forces on matters of principle remains extraordinarily pertinent. For unless we find understanding among ourselves, at the 1966 presidential elections (or, God forbid, sooner) we will find ourselves in a situation similar to that in which the Germans found themselves at the 1932 presidential elections, choosing between Hindenburg and Hitler. Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, Deputy of the State Duma (`Yabloko': Yeltsin Could Have Determined Events Four documents were put to the vote in the Duma in a single package. It was against this that I, on behalf of our faction, spoke from the Duma rostrum. We can only agree with the call for civil reconciliation, but it is very important to ascertain: Who is reconciling with whom. Reconciliation between, say, nouveaux riches or embezzlers of state funds, who have plundered public money, and the humiliated and the insulted, who have been brought to the brink of destitution? It can only be a question, of course, of reconciliation between the opposition and the president. But watching the release of Anpilov and Makashov, it does not seem that these people, who have blood on their hands, aspire to such reconciliation. We are opposed to the release of people who besmirched themselves by criminal offenses during the tragic days at the start of last October. Mr. Zhirinovskiy himself declared that some have fled to neighboring republics, fearing criminal prosecution. In addition, there are no grounds for terminating the investigation of the events of September-October 1993, which has been sought also by such irreproachable public figures as Mikhail Gefter. This is why our faction did not support this package of documents and preferred either to vote against it or to abstain. I would like to add that not only is it unlikely that reconciliation, about which the general document speaks, will be achieved, the political struggle will merely intensify. The prospect of the tranquil cohabitation of the presidency and the legislature does not emerge, unfortunately. Several months ago, participating in the work of the so-called Krasavchenko group formed by the leader of the Office of the President, I proposed that the president himself release the political prisoners through an edict of his. The suggestion was rejected by my colleagues. A situation where this act has been accomplished by the Duma, not the president, has come about. Had this been done by the president, he would today be determining the development of the situation. At the same time accord could be achieved, although there is little chance of this, if parliament occupies its proper place and if there are no petty impediments in the way of its functioning like, for example, the unresolved problem of the location of the Duma. Ultimately it was the presidential structures that drew up the new Constitution, and did they not write that an act of amnesty was the prerogative of parliament? Nonetheless, I hope for the president's cooperation, as before. It is important that they not throw up obstacles to one another inasmuch as their new antagonism would have a baneful effect on the state of society. [passage omitted] Gennadiy Zyuganov, Deputy of the State Duma (Communist Party of Russia): Very Timely Decree The decree had a very difficult birth, but I consider its adoption exceptionally opportune for a number of reasons. The events of August 1991 and May and September-October 1993 were of a clearly expressed political nature. These events were primarily a consequence of the destructive and splittist policy that had been pursued by the national leadership in the person of Gorbachev and Yeltsin. If this ball unravels any more, there will be no end to it. There has been a mass stoppage of production, unemployment has in a number of places amounted to almost 30 percent, half the population is not being paid on time, merely 20 percent of the peasantry is ready for the sowing on account of the nonpayments to the peasants for the grain they have surrendered, and the mass strike movement of the miners, students, and lecturers is growing. It would seem to me that under these conditions the State Duma has taken the first step toward national reconciliation, without which we will not accomplish a single task. It seemed to me that the radical democrats, who are responsible for the policy of devastation of the country that has been pursued in recent years, the civil wars throughout the south of Russia, and the events that occurred in October in Russia, should have been satisfied with this decision the most. The president avoided a direct evaluation of it in his report. But Yeltsin's aides subjected the Duma's decision simply to outright ostracism. And as far as certain journalists are concerned, one has the impression that peace and harmony in Russia are absolutely not what they want. If they do not realize that this is for everyone the last peaceful way out of the situation, they will bring down on their heads troubles for which neither the country nor their nearest and dearest will forgive them. We have issued the appropriate statement: Hysteria is being deliberately incited and a provocation prepared in order to frustrate the first steps toward reconciliation. I am sure that both other factions and the leadership of the Duma will respond. The laws the Duma adopts cannot be treated this way. Concerning the president's report. It seems to me that those who prepared it and the president himself were out of the country for three years. Then they suddenly saw that Russia needs strong statehood, that crime is raging, that science and culture are in a dire state, that corruption has conquered all, and that the bureaucracy has grown incredibly. Yeltsin's report might have been deemed satisfactory had it been heard in February-March 1991. There would not then have been the collapse of the USSR, there would have been no Belovezha pact, there would have been no tragedy in the Caucasus even, there would have been no universal impoverishment. On the other hand, the report was delivered in a tone (tough-confrontational) which was untraditional for Yeltsin. It contains a recognition that he also is responsible for what has been done and that continuing the course of shock therapy to the point of total shock is impossible--the total destabilization of the situation would ensue. Thank God that this, at least, was heard. But any declaration needs to be bolstered by a specific program. [passage omitted]
