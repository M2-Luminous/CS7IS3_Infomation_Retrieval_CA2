The focal issue will now be what will come out of multilateral discussions at the UN Security Council, apart from how North Korea, which maintains a confrontational attitude toward the nuclear nonproliferation regime led by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will behave from now on. Will the UN discussions lead to a breakthrough in the situation or will they lead to an even more dangerous direction? Let us look at the structure of this crisis, including how Japan is coping with the situation. "Since June last year, we have carried on negotiations with the DPRK, with patience and flexibility. But the question was returned to the UN Security Council because the DPRK had destroyed the basis for the IAEA to determine how much plutonium had been diverted." On 3 June, the IAEA reported to the UN secretary general that the inspection of the fuel rods became impossible. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci (special envoy on North Korean nuclear matters) held a news conference and his face reflected fatigue and disappointment. He was on record only a week ago making public a prospect that the third-round of high level talks with the DPRK might be held in early June. It was going to be a successful overcoming of domestic hawks' criticism of "appeasement." At that third-round of talks, the assistant secretary of state said both countries were scheduled "to talk over the total settlement of the nuclear problem and the problems related to normalization of relations between the two countries." Was it not what the DPRK nuclear diplomacy intended -- bringing the U.S. Government to the negotiating table by declaring its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] in March last year? At this vital time, why did the DPRK dare to remove fuel rods from a reactor? Although what had happened behind the scenes was shrouded in mystery, the assistant secretary of state's words sounded as though he was greatly mortified. Well-informed people in the United States are now divided into two groups in their interpretation of the suspected DPRK nuclear arms development program with which the DPRK has been playing with the United States, a super power. One is the nuclear card theory that the DPRK is using the suspicion itself as an allurement to win the largest possible compromise out of the West. Another is an argument that the DPRK is attempting to establish military predominance in the region and to get economic as well as diplomatic compromises by eventually possessing a nuclear capability. The six policy options mentioned in a report titled "The North Korean Nuclear Program and U.S. Government Policy Options" published on 1 June by the Congressional Research Service strongly reflect polarization of views on the DPRK. While the first option says to await the collapse of the Pyongyang regime, which cannot survive until the DPRK's nuclear capability becomes a serious threat, the second option suggests a policy of making a package settlement of the problems pertaining to the Korean peninsula and it has become the basis of the foreign policy the Clinton administration has pursued so far. The third option is about the UN-imposed economic sanctions now under hot debate. These sanctions are anticipated when diplomatic efforts mentioned in the second option fail. The remaining choices are related to military options: the fourth suggests reinforcement of the U.S. military presence in the Korean peninsula, including redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons and the fifth contains a tough proposal to launch limited attacks on the suspected nuclear facilities. The fifth was exactly what hawkish Republican Senator John McCain had proposed in a letter to the President late last month. It may be difficult to get the support of Japan and the Republic of Korea, who do not in earnest wish to intensify tension in the Korean peninsula situation, for the fourth and fifth options. As a result, the report insists on a sixth option, a gradual withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK. It amounts to an abandonment of mission and the East Asian stability centered around the Korean peninsula will be greatly harmed. The congressional report that dared to mention "abandonment" as the last option most eloquently reflects the irritation and the state of running out in countermeasures on the U.S. Government's part. Now the situation is heading toward the third option -- UN imposed sanctions, but President Clinton on his European tour said: "There is still time to avoid UN sanctions," indicating his wish to avoid stepping into the unpredictable next phase. Since its start, the Clinton administration has pursued diplomacy based on three pillars -- human rights, economic security, and nuclear nonproliferation. But, the human rights diplomacy suffered a big setback by extending the most-favored-nation treatment to China and economic security has not yielded any conspicuous success. For Clinton's diplomacy, the last fortress is nuclear nonproliferation for which a talk is scheduled next spring to negotiate whether the NPT should be reexamined or unconditionally extended. There is no guarantee that the DPRK would make a compromise, even if the U.S. Government succeeded in getting support on imposing the UN sanctions. It will not be long before President Clinton has to make a painful decision whether to defend the last fortress or to pull back.
