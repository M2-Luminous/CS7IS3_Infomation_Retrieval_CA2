The move follows the international scrapping of Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control (Cocom) rules in March. The Western-bloc Cocom was set up in 1949 to prevent the transfer of military technology to communist countries but was disbanded in line with the demise of the communist bloc. Revisions to part of the foreign exchange control ordinance and the export trade control ordinance will be in effect until Japan and the 22 other former Cocom members work out a new international framework for checking exports of strategically-sensitive products around October, MITI said. The revisions will be approved by the cabinet Tuesday and to be enforced on July, the ministry said. Under the provisional rules, some of the former Cocom items regarded as especially strategically sensitive, will be subject to export controls for all destinations other than the 23 countries, MITI said. Among such items are cipher equipment and components for unmanned submarines, it said. Other former Cocom-designated products will be subject to export controls for the "watch-list" countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea. Export monitoring, less strict than controls, will be applied to exports of many former Cocom items to all nations except the 23 former Cocom members and the four watch-list countries. There are no Japanese export items that are immediately affected by the new provisional rules, a MITI official said.
