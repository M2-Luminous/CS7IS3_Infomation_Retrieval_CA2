Zaki said a PLO delegation will visit Damascus for talks with the Syrian officials and the Palestinian opposition. However, he did not say when the visit will take place. Zaki, a moderate opposer of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, arrived in Damascus yesterday and held talks today with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], and will also meet with George Habash, the secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. After meeting Zaki today, Hawatimah said the DFLP and all the other nationalist and democratic forces will pursue the struggle against the occupation and against the settlers who carry 120,000 weapons. Hawatimah said: That's why we rejected all calls seeking to disarm the sons of the intifada. Hawatimah warned the Palestinian police against crossing the red lines.
