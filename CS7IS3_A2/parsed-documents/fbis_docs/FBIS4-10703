I am going to read the whole communique. It is a bit long, but you should be informed in detail. Just when progress is being made, the communique states, to facilitate a return to dialogue, to the negotiations aimed at finding a political solution to the situation in Chiapas, the regrettable attack on the military checkpoint on the road to Chicoasen has been carried out. The message of concordance with facts [mensaje de concordia con hechos] of the past few days are: 1. The three branches of the Chiapas government, Manuel Camacho says, have given clear signs they are preparing the Chiapas State's response to the commitments for a worthy peace in the established terms and within the scheduled calendar of events. This paves the way for in-depth institutional changes that will provide answers to the problems you have presented. I repeat, this is the communique Manuel Camacho Solis sent to the EZLN General Command. 2. The National Human Rights Commission has recommended to the attorney general of the republic the charges against 16 of the 21 people being held at the Cerro Hueco Jail for their alleged participation in the early January 1994 incidents be dropped. Juan Carlos Santoyo reported on this yesterday. The third point in Manuel Camacho's communique to the EZLN states: 3. The Chiapas government and the indigenous and peasant organizations that form the COIC [expansion unknown], signed a very important commitment yesterday to suspend all illegal occupation of lands and to study the situation of each property until a fair and satisfactory solution for all parties involved is reached. 4. The Mexican Bishop's Conference has called on the mediator, commissioner, and the EZLN to immediately resume the dialogue. 5. Prominent citizens who are committed to peace and involved in nongovernmental and human rights organizations are demanding the resumption of dialogue as soon as possible. 6. In the past few hours additional efforts to reach agreements have been made in the hopes of finding a quick solution to the problem of those who were recently expelled from (San Juan Chamula). 7. The Mexican Army has strictly abided by its commitment to a cease-fire and has done all it has been asked to do to strengthen the political solution to the problem. In conclusion, Manuel Camacho Solis' communique states: We are keeping our word. Once again a strategy of messages of concordance with facts is being drafted to facilitate the return to the dialogue and negotiation. In this context, Camacho Solis adds in this communique to the EZLN it is very important that the EZLN clearly state its position regarding this morning's incident. Camacho is obviously referring to the incident that occurred just outside Tuxtla Gutierrez [words indistinct]. The Mexican Army, Camacho added, is still determined to cease all fire. This commissioner respectfully suggests: Within the current political situation, and after the decisions I have mentioned have been made, it is highly recommended you issue a statement that will leave no doubts on the EZLN's position in light of the attack on the military checkpoint. This is necessary, but I do not believe it is enough. What the people are demanding is the resumption of dialogue and negotiations to find a political solution to the conflict, Manuel Camacho states. Camacho concludes by stating: Despite the risk all of this represents, and even in light of a possible provocation, your decision favoring a dialogue will be a clear sign of your willingness to find a political solution and a worthy peace in Chiapas. [Signed] Sincerely yours, Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis [Date] 15 April 1994.
