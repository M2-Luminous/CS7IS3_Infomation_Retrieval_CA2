Hugo Carvajal, deputy and leader of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), said the troop movement is a measure "to intimidate citizens and prevent democratic demonstrations against the government's economic programs. He said that the government is desperate to apply measures such as the capitalization and popular participation plan, which together with the general budget, are not to the citizens' liking. Carvajal maintains that the government is wrong to think that it should apply the parliamentary-majority steamroller, without reaching a minimum of consensus or engaging in constructive dialogue. On his part, Eduardo Paz, a Conscience of the Fatherland (Condepa) congressman, said that Sanchez de Lozada is governing with a stick in his hand, not only "hitting at the stomachs of the poor," but also "repressing their democracy." He said that the government is attempting to scare the people, making military troops go out on the streets to face workers and provoke "hours and days of bloodshed and mourning." Meanwhile, Fernando Kieffer, a Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN) Party deputy, said the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada "adopted the easiest way to intimidate union leaders and repress workers." He noted that the Executive Branch "is acting illegally in dispersing workers, who were on a peaceful hunger strike, and ordering military troops to go out on the streets without declaring a state of siege."
