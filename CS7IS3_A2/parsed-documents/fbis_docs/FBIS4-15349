"16 soldiers had been killed during a year and half. During the same period, the peace keeping forces had confiscated from people who violated the security regime 38 guns, five machine guns, seven grenades, seven carbines, 12 pistols, nine shotguns, 200 grenades and 63,000 cartridges. As to weapons that people on the both banks possess on the basis of special licenses, both Tiraspol and Chisinau officials do not have any data." There are 41 posts in the security zone along the Dniester of which 13 are joint, 10 check points, nine posts near Tighina (Bender), five near Dubasari and four near the village of Chitcani. The 41 Russian offices and 358 soldiers serving at these posts have 400 guns and several tens of armored vehicles. "Colonel General Col. Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy defence minister and responsible for the peace keeping forces, stated that no one intends to retain the Russian peace keeping forces in Dniester for an undetermined period. Moreover, the reduced Russia military budget cannot afford this long presence. But, this does not depend on the general's wish," says the newspaper.
