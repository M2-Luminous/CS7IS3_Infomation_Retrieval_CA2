Notisiete has had access to the details of the document the delegates have issued: Purpose--To clarify, objectively, equitably, and impartially, the human rights violations and the deeds of violence related to the armed confrontation, all of which have inflicted suffering on the Guatemalan people. Composition--The commission will consist of three members, the current peace negotiations moderator, whose appointment will be requested from the UN secretary general, a trustworthy and upright person, designated by the mediator, and appointed by the parties by consensus, and a professor selected from a three-name list submitted by the university rectors and approved by the parties by consensus. The commission will have the necessary support personnel who must have the required qualifications to perform their duties. Installation and duration--The commission will be created, installed, and begin to function on the day an agreement for a firm and lasting peace is signed. The term of the commission will last six months, beginning from the installation of the commission. This period can be extended for six additional months if the commission so decides. Reports--The commission will prepare a report, a copy of which will be given to the parties and the UN secretary general, who will release it to the public. The fact it has been impossible to look into every case presented to the commission will not detract from the value of the report. The parties pledge to cooperate with the commission in everything necessary for the duties of the commission, particularly in creating, before the creation of the commission and during its term of operation, the essential conditions for the commission to meet the requirements established in this agreement. The commission shall prepare a report with the results of the investigations carried out during its term, including all factors, both internal and external. The commission shall make specific recommendations to pave the way for peace and national harmony in Guatemala. In particular, the commission shall recommend measures to preserve the memory of the victims to encourage mutual respect, preserve human rights, and reinforce the democratic process. The period that the commission will investigate will span from the beginning of the armed conflict to the signing of a firm and lasting peace agreement. Operation--The commission will receive reports and information from individuals or institutions that regard themselves as affected. The commission must clarify these situations, fully and in detail, and impartially study any factors and circumstances that played a role in these cases. The commission shall invite every person who might possess pertinent information to present his version of the facts. The absence of interested individuals shall not prevent the commission from making a pronouncement on cases. The commission's work, recommendations, and reports will not be the responsibility of the individual members and will not serve judicial purposes. The actions of the commission will protect the identities of the sources, as well as witnesses and informers. Once it is created, the commission will report on its composition and the location of its headquarters through every available means and will invite interested parties to present their reports and accounts. According to the Framework Agreement of 10 January 1994, the fulfillment of this agreement is subject to international UN verification. The parties agree to ask the UN secretary general to appoint the negotiations moderator, a member of the commission. After he is appointed, this person will be empowered to carry out all of the necessary procedures to ensure the smooth operation of the commission once the commission is created and installed according to this agreement. Signed in Oslo on 23 June 1994.
