FBIS4-8918 "dreeu076_i_94018" FBIS-EEU-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Karadzic To `Respond With Every Means' to NATO Karadzic To `Respond With Every Means' to NATO BR2004124094 Milan L'INDIPENDENTE in Italian 20 Apr 94 p 12 BR2004124094 Milan L'INDIPENDENTE Italian BFN [Interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by Fausto Biloslavo in Pale; date not given: "Karadzic: `It Will Be Total War'"] [Excerpt] Pale -- [passage omitted] Karadzic -- in a blue suit and sporting an unruly forelock -- started by saying: "The Gorazde crisis? UNPROFOR (the blue helmet contingent in the former Yugoslavia -- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) is entirely to blame, because Gorazde was not a safe area, but a Muslim stronghold which was never demilitarized. In addition, it was precisely from Gorazde that the Muslims launched a spring offensive, and we are absolutely determined to deal a blow for a blow, throughout Bosnia, in response to their attacks. The international community must cease supporting the Muslims." [Biloslavo] Will you conquer Gorazde? [Karadzic] We could do so, but our objective is simply to demilitarize the town and secure it by defending the area on the Drina river's right bank, which is traditionally a Serbian area. As a gesture of goodwill, we have allowed the United Nations to send about 100 blue helmets (Ukrainian volunteers -- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) to the river's left bank, three kilometers from the town center, in order to protect civilians only, not the Muslim soldiers. [Biloslavo] The Serbs are being accused of shelling civilian targets, and General Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, has defined Gorazde a humanitarian catastrophe. What is your reply to this? [Karadzic] You must not believe the Muslim sources, their amateur radio stations. They often exaggerate the situation in order to provoke Western intervention. We are trying to stabilize the cease-fire. [Biloslavo] What do you think of [UN Secretary General] Butrus-Ghali requesting NATO to prepare for massive bombing raids on the Serbs? [Karadzic] If this request were heeded, this could only mean war, and we will respond with every means at our disposal. NATO must be clear about this point, because our soldiers need to know whether or not the blue helmets are their enemies. [Biloslavo] Are you prepared to retaliate against Italy too? [Karadzic] The French, British, and Americans were once our allies, and we find it difficult to shoot on them. Italy was our enemy in the last war, but we always had a very good relationship with the Italian people. Italy would be well advised to cancel the hospitality that it is giving to NATO aircraft. If an escalation takes place, a terrible war will break out. For the time being, we have no intention of retaliating against your country, although we cannot rule out anything if the situation gets worse. [Biloslavo] Why did you recover 18 anti-aircraft weapons which were supposed to remain under UN control in Sarajevo? [Karadzic] The Serbs have no intention of passively awaiting possible air attacks. [Biloslavo] It looks as though the Russians have also turned their backs on you. Is this true? [Karadzic] Moscow envoy Churkin's critical remarks against us are due to the tension which has developed over the past few days. It was an emotional reaction, and we are prepared to forgive. [Biloslavo] Will you resume contacts with the UNPROFOR forces? [Karadzic] For the moment, contacts are suspended, and they can only be resumed if the United Nations decide to cancel the embargo against the Serbs. [Biloslavo] What do you think of the recent statement by Bosnian President Izetbegovic, inviting Muslims to fight "in order to obtain everything or nothing"? [Karadzic] We have gained our due. In one respect I agree with the Muslims: They will obtain nothing.
