FR941104-2-00036 FR941104-2-00025 15. In addition, we find AT&T's arguments that the $4.85 per call surcharge is in violation of the ISP to be inapposite. AT&T's arguments were based on the original $4.85 per call surcharge, not the amended $1.00 per call surcharge. Further, we note that AT&T's petition stated that a $1.00 surcharge would be consistent with industry practices. Finally, we have not received any additional pleadings from AT&T arguing that the amended operating agreements are in violation of our ISP. 16. We find that a grant of the above-captioned five applications will serve the public interest subject to the conditions set forth below. These applications are consistent with the Executive Branch's Policy Guidelines. The applicants state that they will initiate service within one year, and expect to initiate service shortly after all requisite regulatory approvals have been obtained. To the extent the applicants propose to use the INTELSAT, Intersputnick, and Columbia satellite facilities and appropriately authorized existing earth station facilities, we find these proposals satisfy the requirement that facilities already be in existence and be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba. 17. Accordingly, it is ordered that application File No. I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;94&hyph;227 is granted and WilTel is authorized to: a.

In lieu of the INTELSAT circuits, establish up to 120 64-kbps satellite circuits between an appropriately authorized U.S. international fixed-satellite earth station and an appropriate Intersputnik satellite, together with the necessary domestic connecting facilities between the earth station and WilTel's operating center, connecting with similar circuits between the satellite and an earth station in Cuba, furnished by EMTELCUBA; and c. Use the facilities in either (a) or (b) above to provide IMTS and other switched services (including facsimile, data and video transmission services), and international private line services, between the United States and Cuba. 18. It is further ordered that application File No. I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;94&hyph;228 is granted and MCI is authorized to: a.

Use the above facilities to provide all of MCI's authorized services, including IMTS, between the United States and Cuba. 19. It is further ordered that application File No. I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;94&hyph;299 is granted and LDDS is authorized to: a. Lease from Comsat and operate 150 64-kbps satellite circuits between an appropriately authorized U.S. international fixed-satellite earth station and an appropriate INTELSAT&hyph;AOR satellite, together with the necessary domestic connecting facilities between the earth station and LDDS's operating center, connecting with similar circuits between the satellite and an earth station in Cuba, furnished by EMTELCUBA; or b. In lieu of the INTELSAT circuits, establish up to 150 64-kbps satellite circuits, between an appropriately authorized U.S. international fixed-satellite earth station and an appropriate Intersputnik or Columbia satellite, together with the necessary domestic connecting facilities between the earth station and LDDS's operating center, connecting with similar circuits between the satellite and an earth station in Cuba, furnished by EMTELCUBA; and c. Use the facilities in either (a) or (b) above to provide IMTS and private line services between the United States and Cuba.
