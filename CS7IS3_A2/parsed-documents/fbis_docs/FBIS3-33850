About the Iranian Muslim people's concern in the wake of the [shooting] incident, the president said: [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] I am very grateful to the people and to you for taking measures to reassure the people so that they do not worry. In my opinion there is nothing to worry about. If the exact proceedings of the incident at that place [Khomeyni's shrine] were broadcast, the people would not worry. As the reporters present saw, the point from which the shot was fired was a long way away from the platform. I first thought a light bulb had exploded, but when I heard several more sounds it became clear, and I came to the conclusion that it was not a light bulb but gunfire. In my opinion there is no cause for concern at all. It was an incident in the corner of a huge gathering in the mosque. The proceedings of the meeting were not interrupted either. I am not certain whether it was being broadcast live or not. Everything continued as normal. I am very grateful to everyone for demonstrating such kindness. I ask you to inform the people somehow that there is no cause for concern at all and no one should worry. [end recording]
