A Strait-Jacket?"] [Text] The ambassadors of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States met on 14 February with President Leonid Kravchuk to hand him a joint declaration by their governments that cordially welcomed decisions made by the Ukrainian Supreme Council regarding the tripartite Declaration signed in Moscow by the Ukrainian, American, and Russian presidents and the START I Treaty. The above states expressed their intention to closely cooperate with Ukraine and to assist in the dismantling of nuclear weapons, the conversion program, environmental protection, retraining and alternative employment for those engaged in manufacturing and servicing the nuclear weapons, etc. Bilateral economic cooperation was also promised. However, no specific figures for the aid were given. As the diplomats explained at the press conference, specific projects are now in the works, though some governments have already devised their programs. The Japanese ambassador mentioned $100 million that his country intends to give to Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan for disarmament, while the German charge d'affaires said his government earmarked 10 million Deutschmarks for Ukraine, which were not paid because of conditions for START I put forward by the Ukrainian legislature. We will soon learn how much Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko will "bring" back from Bonn, where he went on an official visit. So, we will have a jacket of aid made by the whole world. A thin jacket. The same applies to the security guarantees -- nothing specific was proposed here except for the bright prospects opened by the "Partnership for Peace" program, contacts with NATO and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, etc. In general, however, all those solemn declarations are simply designed to give President Kravchuk moral support in his relations with the parliament, because Ukraine is expected to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state. But another press conference was held that same day, where they talked about projects for Ukraine estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars, and at their initial stage at that. The multinational ABB, whose president Percy Barnevick visited Ukraine on the invitation of Leonid Kravchuk, is one of the leading corporations in power engineering. It offered us projects directed at Ukraine's energy independence. They involve energy-saving technologies in chemical and petrochemical industries as well as modernization of our coal and atomic power stations, which for Percy Barnevick are the future of Ukrainian power engineering. They also provide for setting up a special international investment fund for atomic engineering and Ukrainian power engineering in general. ABB is planning soon to start up five or six joint ventures in Ukraine to implement its projects.
