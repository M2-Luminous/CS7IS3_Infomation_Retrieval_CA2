But for some reason the guests left for Yerevan instead of Khankendi. [Begin recording] [correspondent Mehmen Qayibov] The delegation left Baku airport for Yerevan. The guests were seen off by Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Afiaddin Dzhalilov, Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov, and other officials. Before the delegation's departure we interviewed its members. [passage omitted on Sherimkulov statement in Russian] [Qayibov] Mr. Afiaddin Dzhalilov, certain changes have been introduced into the delegation's program. What can you say on this? [Dzhalilov] As Mr. Sherimkulov said [words indistinct]. I want to state that at first the Armenian side accepted our program but later they opposed Mr. Sherimkulov's delegation going to Stepanakert, that is Khankendi, via Agdam. Thus, the Armenians disrupted the program unilaterally. However, Mr. Sherimkulov's personal peace mission is continuing. He will now be flying to Armenia. From there he will go to Tbilisi, then to Karabakh, and then to Baku again at the invitation of Geydar Aliyev. [end recording]
