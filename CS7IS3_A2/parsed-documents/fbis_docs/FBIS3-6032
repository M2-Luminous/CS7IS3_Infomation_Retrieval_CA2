Inoue, 69, is believed to be one of several Diet members that leading contractor Kajima Corp. asked to exercise their influence to help block an accusation by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) against a bid-rigging scheme involving Kajima in Saitama Prefecture. By questioning Inoue, prosecutors aim to prove a statement by Kajima's former vice president, Shinji Kiyoyama, 67. He claimed he asked several Diet members, including Inoue and former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, to help his company. Nakamura, 44, was arrested Friday on suspicion of taking a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima in January 1992. Nakamura is suspected of taking the money for exerting his influence as deputy head of an antimonopoly lobby to help block the possible accusation by the FTC. The sources said soon after the FTC made on-the-spot inspections on companies involving in the bid-rigging scheme in May 1991, Kiyoyama asked Inoue how to evade the accusations. Afterwards, Inoue met then-FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, 62, at his Tokyo office and asked whether the antimonopoly watchdog would file a criminal complaint over the bid-rigging scheme, the sources said. Inoue admitted he had met Kiyoyama but declined to comment on whether he was asked about ways to evade the FTC's accusations because investigations are still underway. The FTC announced in May 1992 that it would not file an accusation with prosecutors due to a lack of evidence and instead ordered the contractors to stop the collusive activities. The present chairman of the FTC, Masami Kogayu, told reporters Friday that the commission was never influenced by outside forces on decisions involving cases violating the antimonopoly law. Inoue, former vice construction minister, is known for his close ties with the construction industry. He became director general of the National Land Agency in December 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the LDP. Kiyoyama, who is now on trial on charges of sending bribes to former Ibaraki Governor Fujio Takeuchi, was rearrested Tuesday for allegedly sending the bribe to Nakamura. Meanwhile, attorneys who met Nakamura at the Tokyo Detention House told reporters that he had denied all the allegations against him when he was questioned by prosecutors. During a 20-minute meeting on Saturday morning, Nakamura was quoted by the two attorneys as saying he has no complaints about the treatment he has received and that he had slept well.
