To those who ask his country to talk with the Islamists, he had this to say: [Begin Sifi recording] I ask this of those who, far from the realities of the situation on the ground, advise us to negotiate: With whom? People tell us about the moderates all the time. There are many moderates in the National Transition Council. Who are the other moderates one hears about? Where are these moderates? Let them declare themselves, and let them condemn violence and terrorism. The doors of dialogue are wide open to them. Let them come. President Zeroual and my government are in favor of dialogue with all those who first unequivocally and without rhetoric condemn violence and terrorism. [end recording]
