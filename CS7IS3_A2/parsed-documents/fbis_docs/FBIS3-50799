During a news conference following a visit to Mexico, President Cristiani said: "Of course we discussed the Chiapas problems. President Salinas said it is a very delicate matter and that he is trying to solve it as quickly as possible without inflicting any suffering on the population." Salinas met with Cristiani and Honduran President Rafael Callejas in Mexico City and told them about the ongoing events in southern Mexico that began with an uprising led by the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN). Regarding reports by Mexican officials about the alleged presence of Salvadoran guerrillas fighting alongside the EZLN, Cristiani said the issue was not discussed during his meeting with Salinas. Cristiani did say that the consequences of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for Central America was among the main issues discussed during the meeting. The agreement signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada went into effect on 1 January. According to Cristiani, "Mexico is willing to continue negotiations for a free trade agreement with Central America. It would be a disadvantage for our products not to have access to the Mexican market."
