One half of the dilemma consists of the conviction that the former satellites of the Soviet Union need and deserve a safe home. The other half is that the West cannot offer them membership in the alliance. There are good and not so good reasons for the denial. The latter include consideration for Moscow's irritability, which is ultimately turning into a Russian right of veto over Western policies. The better reasons include the fear of a watered-down alliance and of the acceptance of states that would bring too many internal and external conflicts into the alliance. In fact, NATO has always drawn its strength from a solid foundation of identical interests and institutions (with the exception of Greece and Turkey). This dilemma explains the vague rhetoric, the "beautiful, mysterious formulas," as the Estonian president put it. They include neither dates nor obligations. Still, there is a better way to avoid the dilemma. Clinton outlined it when he appealed to the West to speak more about "trade than aid." "Trade barriers" must be removed quickly. There is no point in "applauding market reforms" while only "offering selective access to our markets." Markets mean growth, and prosperity legitimizes the democratic reform policy -- probably more than an abstract alliance membership. Moreover, this method has the advantage of really helping the East Europeans without offending the Russians.
