According to a statement issued by the Serbian president's office, Milosevic stressed that Serbia wholeheartedly supports the agreement on ending all hostilities in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The question of a political solution and territorial demarcation should, according to Milosevic, be discussed with representatives of the Serb people from Bosnia, who are directly concerned, in exactly the same way as are the Muslims and Croats in this former Yugoslav republic. Since all elements of the agreement on an overall end to hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed with UN and UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] delegations in Belgrade on 22 April, Milosevic believes that all obstacles and problems in reaching [as received] an agreement on ending the hostilities can only have been caused by the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. He believes that the international community is again facing a challenge -- either to behave in an impartial way or to apply a policy of double standards to the parties in the conflict. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic attended the talks.
