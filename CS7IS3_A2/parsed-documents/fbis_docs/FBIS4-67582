It Actually Exists On the Map of the Dnieper Region"] [Text] Geologists discovered it, by accident, five years ago. They explored a site for working an uranium ore deposit similar to that near the Devladove Station in Sofiyivskyy Rayon that functioned for 15 years. Ore began to be extracted there in 1965-68 by an original method developed by Moscow design institutes. What it really was did not became known to the general public until 1989, when the project was declassified. By that time, the deposit had not been worked for about six years, and it might have become a mystery forever if ecologists had not decided to find out more about some of the figures. There is a danger that the discovered lake will not remain "silent" forever, but may declare itself in a most terrible manner. If this does take place, Ukraine will have yet another Chernobyl, and this time it will be brought with water.... Here is what the chief ecologist of the Dnieper Research Center at Ukraine's Academy of Sciences, Hryhoriy Shmatkov, said, in particular, about the subsurface lake. The emergence of this affliction was brought about by... Ukraine's mineral wealth, particularly by its uranium ores. They usually occur under the earth's surface as compact layers in the form of a subsurface block. A borehole was drilled to a depth of between 50 and 70 meters, and, through it, concentrated acids were pumped into the layer. They completely dissolved the uranium ore, and the associated minerals transformed them into pulp. After that, a new borehole was drilled, the liquid was pumped out through it and taken for enrichment. The process was repeated every 25 meters. In the course of a single operation, a mixture made up of 205,000 tonnes of concentrated sulfuric acid, 66,000 tonnes of concentrated nitric acid, and 25,000 tonnes of concentrated nitric ammonium got underground. Such a mixture is capable of dissolving anything, it even turned soil into pulp--specially treated pumps and pipes could only withstand it for several months. After the substance was processed and enriched uranium was obtained, the radioactive waste was again pumped into the ground in the form of pulp. This process continued for at least 11 years and now, in accordance with estimates by specialists, there are between 6 million and 7 million tonnes of such radioactive acid waste under ground. It is in a semi-liquid state, and the lake, which will only cease to be radioactive in 200 or 300 years, is capable of drifting. In accordance with conclusions by specialists, the lake moves by approximately 20 meters a year. This is due to the fact that its front is somewhat inclined, since earth horizons are also not quite horizontal. If one multiplies 20 meters by 200 years, it will become obvious that, over that stretch of time, the lake will advance by kilometers. The most terrible thing, however, is the fact that, on its path, it may come across fissures, aquifers, or sandstones. Then the "water" from the subsurface lake of death may percolate into subsurface wells, from which the life-giving moisture is today supplied to the majority of populated areas in the region. People will become ill and will not know why.... It is true, though, that Moscow specialists, who were first to have detected that lake (it had not, obviously, been planned by the designers and not even foreseen), are trying to convince us that nothing "terrible" will happen. However, ecologists have reasons to doubt these reassuring conclusions. For example, one of their initial assertions to the effect that the lake, having come across clayey layers, will not penetrate them proved erroneous. Local geologists disprove this. Yet another circumstance is taken into account: The special geological team, which discovered the lake, did not arrive in the Dnieper Region for noble purposes. Its goal was to locate yet another deposit, similar to the one in Devladove, and only the social processes of 1989 thwarted this intention. However, is it in the interests of Moscow geologists to show their hand in full and make public what was done to Ukrainian land by other imperial "specialists"? The Moor has done his duty, and the Moor has left.... At the same time, Ukraine has remained with yet another headache and, who knows, it may become no less severe than that caused by Chernobyl. Today, ecologists raise the question of the most stringent control over the movement of the lake and over the quality of drinking water in the surrounding area. It is practically impossible to neutralize the lake, because huge sums of money will have to be invested in order to build a special plant, manufacture special substances, drill new boreholes, and pump these neutralizing substances into them. So, it is only realistic now to conduct permanent monitoring and research and open a laboratory or a station in the area of the lake for conducting the necessary studies, making forecasts, and so on. However, this is also capital, and it will fall as a burden upon our budget. However, this is the fate of all colonial countries, such as Ukraine was until recently. Those who want to see it within some "union" again must realize that they not only vote for the absence of a Customs officer at the Russian-Ukrainian border, but also for new Chernobyls and lakes of death on Ukrainian land. It is necessary to remember this.
