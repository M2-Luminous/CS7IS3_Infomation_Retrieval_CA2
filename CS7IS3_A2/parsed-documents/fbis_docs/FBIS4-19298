[passage omitted] Several hundred blue helmets, including many French soldiers, are still prisoners of the Bosnian Serbs. The French Foreign Ministry has said that it could not accept that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] should be taken hostage. [passage omitted] A moment ago in Madrid, the UN secretary general said he would not hesitate to order new air strikes: [Begin Butrus-Ghali recording, in French] We will go through to the end concerning the use of air power in former Yugoslavia. If we need air support, we will not hesitate to call on NATO to use force to protect the United Nations forces. This is a very clear warning which I would like to send from here in Madrid to those elements in Yugoslavia that are trying to oppose the action of the United Nations. The United Nations will not give in to any blackmail. The United Nations represents the international community and represents the will of the international community. If the international community decides to use force, the United Nations will decide to use force. In any case, the use of force must be decided taking account of the situation on the ground. The soldiers that we have on the ground advise us how, where, and when force should be used. [end recording]
