He is the first cabinet minister to face such charges, although a member of parliament has in the past. It said he faces three counts of accepting bribes, six of using his office for personal benefit, two counts of failing to disclose personal interests when participating in meetings, 14 counts of failing to declare his business interests to the commission and three of accepting benefits. The charges were laid after the commission carried out a lengthy investigation into Maina's conduct when he was commerce, employment and trade minister under former Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni. The commission said its investigations showed prima facie evidence to lay the charges. They have been submitted to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to commence proceedings in the High Court. The statement said Maina's conduct was regrettable because it was damaging to himself and the government. It demeaned his office and allowed his integrity to be called into question. It also endangered the respect and confidence in the integrity of the government which is contrary to the country's national constitution. Maina, from the Temopu Province in the Eastern Solomons, was widely known to have a number of company directorships here.
