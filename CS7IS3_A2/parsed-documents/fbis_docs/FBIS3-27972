Because our party has regarded the chuche-oriented party-building theory as the leading guideline, our party is displaying the pride of being an invincible revolutionary party. The chuche-oriented party-building theory, which the great leader [suryong] created and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has constantly developed and enriched, is a complete party building doctrine for the working class in our era. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: The chuche-oriented party-building theory is the completed party building doctrine for the working class of our era. Above all, the chuche-oriented party-building theory clearly elucidates the road to party building based on the unitary ideological system. Building the party based on the unitary ideological system is a basic principle for party building. The party's unitary ideological system is the leader's [suryong] ideological system and leadership system. The working class' party is the vanguard unit of the working class and the working popular masses, who are organizationally and ideologically rallied around the leader [suryong]. The mission of the working class party lies in implementing the leader's [suryong] ideology and leadership and in leading the working popular masses to realize their independence. For this reason, to discharge its missions as a political weapon for achieving the leader's [suryong] ideology and leadership, the party must establish the leader's [suryong] ideological and leadership system. Only when the party's unitary ideological system is established can the entire party be armed with the leader's [suryong] ideology; can it move as one under the leader's [suryong] unitary leadership; and can it thoroughly realize the leader's [suryong] leadership for the whole society. Also, the chuche-oriented party-building theory most clearly elucidates the road to masses-oriented party building. Building the party into a masses-oriented party is a basic policy in party building. In the past period, the party has been regarded as the class-oriented political organization and as the weapon for class struggle, which represented and defended the class interests. The party is the class' vanguard unit which struggles to meet the demand and interests of a certain class. However, if the party is built into the party only for certain class' interests, it cannot fully discharge its duty as the revolutionary party and cannot enjoy the support of the broad segments of the masses. Our era's historical conditions, in which the broad segments of popular masses emerged as the masters of their fate, demand that the working class' party be built into the party which represents the interests of the entire people and includes the leading elements of all working class circles. In the socialist society where the masses of all walks of life are turned into the socialist working people and where the social class composition is unified, building the working class's party into the masses-oriented party emerges as an urgent demand. By scientifically penetrating our era's demands and our revolution's concrete reality and by putting forward the masses- oriented party-building theory, our party has opened a new road for revolutionary party building. The masses-oriented party-building theory, which our party has put forth, is based on the chuche-oriented revolutionary principle that the masters of revolution and construction are the popular masses and that the might for promoting revolution and construction lies in the popular masses. The socialist cause is preciously the popular masses' cause. Today, with socialism the desire of broad segments of the popular masses and the social class' foundation for socialism greatly expanded, the party struggling for the socialist cause should be built into the masses-oriented party which represents the interests of the entire popular masses and takes its root in the broad segments of the working popular masses. Our party has been the strong bastion of the revolution because our party has been strengthened and developed into an invincible revolutionary party that enjoys the popular masses' absolute support and trust and because our party has been combined into one socio-political lifeline in which the party and the masses share the same fate of life or death. This is the brilliant fruition of the masses-oriented party-building line and the firm guarantee for our victory. The chuche-oriented party-building theory has correctly elucidated the road for building a militant party characterized by strong organization and discipline. Revolutionary organization and discipline are the life of the working class party. The working class party is the revolutionary general staff that breaks through the numerous ordeals and tribulations to organize and lead revolutionary struggle and construction work. In a nutshell, the working class party should not be a group which lacks standards and discipline but be a combat unit characterized by strong organization and discipline. Based on the party's firmly established unitary ideology system, our party has correctly embodied the democratic-centralistic principle; has strengthened and developed the party members' life and the party's organization and discipline; and, thereby, has been strengthened and developed into an invincible revolutionary party with strong organization and discipline in which the whole party moves as one under the leader's [suryong] unitary leadership. The chuche-oriented party-building theory is a valuable guideline capable of thoroughly embodying the basic party-building principle on basically adhering to the work conducted with people. The chuche-oriented party-building theory on basically adhering to the work conducted with people is based on the theory of the chuche idea. Because the main forces for promoting revolution and construction are people, the working class party should resolve all issues arising in party construction and activities through the work conducted with people. Our party has always given priority to the ideological indoctrination work of party members and working people, that is, the work conducted with people. By so doing, our party has greatly strengthened the main forces of the revolution and vigorously accelerated revolution and construction. The chuche-oriented party-building theory has elucidated the correct road to most brilliantly implement the party's political leadership for revolution and construction. Firmly implementing the political leadership for society is the basic mission of the working class party. In a socialist society, the mission of the working class revolutionary party is to responsibly lead the people's fate and to provide them with an independent and creative life. To discharge its missions, the party should firmly realize the political leadership in all national fields, including politics, economy, culture, and national defense. The party's responsibility and its leadership for the people's fate can never be separated. Enhancing the party's leadership and role in order to firmly realize the political leadership for the whole society is the basic direction in building the socialist ruling party. For the first time, the chuche-oriented party-building theory fully elucidates the essence, principle, and method of the party's leadership for revolution and construction. Our party has regulated party leadership for revolution and construction as the political guidance, that is, guidance based on politics, and has thoroughly checked the tendency for political guidance to fall into administrative ruts. Our party has thoroughly embodied the basic principle by raising it as the basic principle to combine the party's unitary leadership into the revolutionary masses-oriented line, thus correctly combining leadership with the masses and constantly enhancing the party's leadership role. Our party has regulated a party committee as the supreme guidance organization of the units concerned and has guaranteed collective guidance in the party committee's activities. By so doing, our party has correctly combined the unity of the political leadership into the masses' initiative. By closely combining the party's work into the administrative and economic work, our party has strengthened the main forces of the revolution and vigorously accelerated socialist construction. The chuche-oriented party-building theory is a powerful weapon capable of firmly establishing the revolutionary work method and people-minded work style in keeping with the inherent demand of the working class party. The issue concerning work method and style is one of the basic issues determining the success in strengthening the main forces of revolution and organizing and mobilizing the popular masses into the revolutionary struggle. In the whole process of the party building, our party has adhered to the chuche-oriented party-building theory, has constantly struggled to improve the party's work method and style, and has thereby fully established the revolutionary work method and people-minded work style in the whole party based on the revolutionary masses-oriented line. Our party's work method is the anti-Japanese guerrilla work method that the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song created early on amidst the flames of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. The Chongsan-ri method and Chongsan-ri spirit were deepened and developed in keeping with the realistic demand for socialist construction to become our party's work method. In a word, our party's work method is a work method in the manner of the great leader [suryong]. Our party's work method is the most revolutionary and people- minded work method and style, which strengthens the single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses by closely combining the leadership with the masses and which brings the creation of the masses into full play. Our party has put forward the slogan, "Serve the people," and led all functionaries to faithfully work for the people. By so doing, our party has thoroughly strengthened single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses to bring the unfathomable strength of the popular masses into full play. The chuche-oriented party-building theory fully elucidates the issue of firmly guaranteeing continuity in party building. Firmly guaranteeing continuity in party building is the most basic issue that arises in carrying out the party's cause and the working class' revolutionary cause. Because the working class' revolutionary cause is a protracted cause which should be conducted generation after generation, the cause of the working class party-building cause should be inherited generation after generation. The frustration of socialism in various countries in the world is a bitter lesson that if the working class party is not strengthened and developed generation after generation, the revolution is forced to undergo hardship and be stopped halfway. Based on the legitimate demand for developing the revolution in our era and on the historical lesson of the international communist movement, our party has raised the issue of inheriting the party's leadership as the most important issue arising in the completion of the working class revolutionary cause generation after generation. Our party has brilliantly resolved the issue theoretically and practically. As a result, a firm guarantee for completing the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause generation after generation can be secured in our country. This is the greatest victory which our party has gained in the process of embodying the chuche-oriented party-building theory. Indeed, chuche-oriented party-building theory is the most correct guideline and completed theory which elucidates the future road for working class party building in our era. We should take pride and confidence in having the most complete chuche-oriented party-building theory that was created by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and inherited and developed by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. By thoroughly embodying the chuche-oriented party-building theory, we should further strengthen and develop our party into an ever-victorious and invincible party.
