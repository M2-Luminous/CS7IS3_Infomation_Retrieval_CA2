Aware of the plan in advance, however, the NADK and the people were waiting for them. The NADK and the people jointly attacked and routed them with assorted primitive and modern weapons of every caliber. They killed a captain and seven Vietnamese communist puppet soldiers; wounded others; and seized two pistols, nine AK rifles, and a quantity of war materiel. The survivors retreated in disarray. Many puppet soldiers fled to their homes. Having been forcibly recruited, they were afraid of being killed and did not want to fight and die for a handful of warmongering Vietnamese communist puppets.
