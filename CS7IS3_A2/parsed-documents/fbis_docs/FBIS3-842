Ayu, speaking in Benin, capital of mid-west Edo State at the weekend, said that law abiding students and security agents would continue to "receive the full backing of government" in dealing with cultism. He did not elaborate, but urged parents and teachers to advise their wards against acts of indiscipline, saying that "beyond financing of facilities is the need for moral re-armament." "The nation is going through a despicable phenomenon in our school system. Our collective psyche has been assaulted by the tragic wave of secret cults on our campuses. Bizarre killings, intimidation, violence and indiscipline precipitated by activities of secret cults on our campuses is daily on the rise," the minister said. His statement came in the wake of the closure of University of Lagos (UNILAG) on Saturday [12 March] by the authorities because of alleged cult activities by the students. On 2 March, suspected student cult members clashed openly at UNILAG, incurring the wrath of the student union, which accused the university authorities of inaction and launched an anti-cult capaign that crippled academic actitives for two days. In closing the university, the authorities cited "arson and general breakdown of law and order", saying that while they "condemn cult activities, hoologanism and indiscipline" should not be condoned. The registrar, Dr. A.A. Omotosho, has also announced the proscription of the students' union. He said in a statement that "for the avoidance of doubt, all students union organisation by whichever name they are described, including students' union caretaker committee, are hereby proscribed." The registrar said that last Saturday, some 1,000 UNILAG students "raided" the Lagos home of the university's former lecturer, Idowu Sobowale, just as he addressed a press conference, alerting the nation on the "takeover of the institution by gangsters". The students were alleged to have destroyed household items and abducted the wife of Sobowale, who is now editor-in-chief of a metropolitan newspaper, THE REPUBLIC. Sobowale's wife reportedly escaped when the bus in which she was being conveyed by the students ran out of fuel. Cult activities, reminiscent of American-type campus fraternities in the 60s, assumed a worrying dimension in Nigerian institutions of higher learning in the 80s resulting in a government clamp down. Initially, the Nigerian campus societies were a varitable vanguard for anti-colonial campaigns in the country. But later day societies manifest violence and despicable tendencies. In the past months, security agents have reported the arrests of some 300 suspected student cult members in different parts of the country. Some of them were shown on national television in their strange dresses and carrying weapons, including matchetes, with which they reportedly terrorise the campus communities.
