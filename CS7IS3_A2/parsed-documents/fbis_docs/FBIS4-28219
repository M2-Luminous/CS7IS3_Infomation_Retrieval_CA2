FBIS4-28219 "dreas111_m_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Thailand Thousands Rally To Demand New Constitution Thousands Rally To Demand New Constitution BK0906090194 Bangkok THE NATION in English 9 Jun 94 pp A1, A4 BK0906090194 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Ecerpt] About 5,000 people converged outside Parliament yesterday to demand a new constitution as the coalition allies, including the reluctant Phalang Tham Party, displayed a fragile unity behind Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's stand against "political intimidation". Despite a common pledge not to push for the drafting of a new charter in the face of the biggest anti-government protest since 1992, a major rift within Phalang Tham threatened to tear the party apart and ruin the government's questionable stability. Parliament President Marut Bunnak was lobbying for a last-ditch option to end the political deadlock yesterday. After the coalition declared it would not sponsor any move to write a new constitution, Marut proposed that he exercise his parliamentary power to set up a committee to look into the possibility of drafting a new charter. It was not known whether political action groups leading the constitution reform campaign would accept Marut's proposal, which government politicians said was in line with the coalition's stand that the issue was a parliamentary affair. Clarifying Marut's proposal, Deputy House Speaker Thawin Phraison said the parliamentary president was empowered to set up an ad hoc committee to consider anything deemed a parliamentary issue. However, Thawin declined to comment on suggestions it was just a time-buying proposal since whatever such a committee produced would still have to be considered by the political parties. In an atmosphere that eerily resembled the anti-Suchinda protests before they exploded into the mass uprising leading to the 1992 bloodshed, demonstrators yesterday loudly cheered as speakers lambasted the Chuan government watched by lines of stern police commandos. Protest leaders said the turn-out was much larger than they had anticipated. "Today is not yet the day we will shout 'Chuan get out'," Wira Musikaphong, recalcitrant deputy leader of the New Aspiration Party, told the crowd. "We are just a group of democratic beggars who will remain here until we get a satisfactory answer from the government." Phalang Tham hardliner Chaiwat Sinsuwong praised two opposition leaders while strongly criticizing the government and even his own party. "I have met Chat Phattana leader Chatchai Chunhawan and Chat Thai leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha and I was sorry I had called them devils," Chaiwat said. "They understand us more than Chuan. What's happening in our country? Are devils becoming angels and vice versa -- including that damned Phalang Tham Party? I should have died in the (1992) May crisis." Other speakers picked on the ruling Democrat Party and Prime Minister Chuan, calling them "liars". A heavy downpour showered the protest site around 9 pm. The number of demonstrators then dwindled to about 1,000. The military and police said they were closely monitoring the rally, which is due to resume today in front of Parliament with additional support from members of provincial branches of the pressure groups. Deputy police chief Phong-amat Amattayakun said senior police officers yesterday met to discuss the political situation and prepare plans to cope with possible violence. Initially police believed some 1,500-2,000 people would gather yesterday. Despite the major turn-out, Pol Gen Phong-amat said the situation would not escalate into violence. "Many people attended the rally only because they wanted to see At Carabao sing. They had no political motivation," he said. Rock star At Carabao, or Yunyong Ophakun, has become a leading crusader in the campaign for a new charter. Deputy metropolitan police chief Somchai Wanitseni said about 155 policemen, both plain-clothed and uniformed, were stationed at the rally. Army spokesman Phalangkun Klahan said intelligence officers were monitoring the situation closely. Chuan refused to budge amid increasing pressure, saying his allies had reassured him that they would not submit a motion to seek a new charter if there was no co-sponsor. A flurry of meetings took place yesterday. After a Phalang Tham meeting in the morning, government whips huddled to discuss the Democrats' resolution not to bow to "political intimidation" -- the strongest term yet to describe the campaign for constitutional reform. It followed allegations that activist Chalat Worachat's hunger strike had been exploited and had snowballed into an all-out attempt to topple the government. After the whips' meeting, coalition leaders gathered for talks with Chuan. Their agreement to stick together was then conveyed to another tumultuous Phalang Tham meeting. The party reluctantly accepted the coalition's agreement, but as a consequence the meeting was rocked by dissent. Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasthian threatened to resign if the coalition's deal was not accepted, while pro-reform Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang became obviously upset, informed party sources said. Chamlong was quoted as saying it was not right for one party (the Democrats) to "impose its ideas" on its allies. He said he was waiting for more details on Marut's efforts before deciding on a new move. Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said the coalition parties backtracked on an earlier compromise deal with the pro-reform movement because "we don't want to cheat Chalad". On Monday, the government agreed to support the formation of a House of Representatives committee to "prepare" for the drafting of a new constitution. It also agreed to ask the joint House-Senate committee scrutinizing the opposition's charter amendment package to consider an additional change which would legitimize the promulgation of a brand new charter. Chuan summoned key Democrat leaders to an emergency meeting late last night.
