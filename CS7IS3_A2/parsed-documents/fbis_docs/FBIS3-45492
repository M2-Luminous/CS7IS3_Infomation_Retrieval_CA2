Chiang Wednesday [19 January] called on government agencies to help smooth Taiwan's admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO). WTO will be inaugurated in January 1995 to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Taiwan submitted its application for GATT membership in 1990. Taiwan must complete all preparatory work and map out a solid strategy for admission by the end of October, Chiang said during a report to the ruling Kuomintang's policy-making central Standing Committee. In his report, Chiang said concerned government agencies should review existing trade and economic practices, determine which are not compatible with GATT rules and make proper adjustments. In the mean time, the government must accelerate its plans to open Taiwan to foreign services and crystalize its economic and trade systems. Chiang said that GATT or WTO membership would inevitably harm the interests of certain sectors and communication between the parties concerned is a must. "A remedy, including even subsidies, should be considered for those hard hit," Chiang said.
