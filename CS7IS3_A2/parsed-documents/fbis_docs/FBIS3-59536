A Franco-German alliance presupposes changes in the European laws regulating competition. Parallel discussions with AT&T reportedly are under way... France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are discussing a possible strengthening of their strategic alliance. Charles Rozmaryn, France Telecom's general manager, told 01 INFORMATIQUE that relations with Germany are "the keystone of international growth strategy" for the French communications operator. But to intensify their cooperation and conclude alliances, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom must overcome several juridical obstacles. First of all, their charters must be reformed, with employee status and entitlements promising to present particularly thorny problems on both sides of the Rhine. Next, they will have to lobby to ensure their rapprochement is not blocked by current European legislation governing competition. Recently, top-level executives of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have held meetings at the European Commission with Commission President Jacques Delors. "The basic problem is to re-examine the framework of competition in the Community, which needs to be modernized," says a high-ranking official in Brussels, adding that "Europe needs large groups, of the sort that eventually could develop from partnerships between big enterprises such as these two [telecommunications] operators." Jacques Delors's activities in this area already represent the first informal steps toward rethinking that framework. The Franco-German duo also needs support outside Europe. In late 1991 the two partners created a joint subsidiary, Eunetcom, for LAN [local area network] outsourcing. But if Eunetcom is to offer services on a truly planetwide scale, it needs allies. Hence the rumors of discussions with AT&T. "Everyone is talking to everyone else. As we have already said, we're looking for a partner in the United States and another one in Southeast Asia. The BT-MCI alliance simply means there is one less partner for Eunetcom," Rozmaryn concludes.
