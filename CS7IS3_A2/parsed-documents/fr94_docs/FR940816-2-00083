ACTION: Emergency closure of certain public lands in the Juniper Flats Area of San Bernardino County, California for a period of up to five years or until rehabilitation of fire damage, whichever occurs first. SUMMARY: In accordance with title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, 8341.2, 8364.1 and 4110.3&hyph;3, notice is hereby given that lands and roads administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that were affected by the Devil Fire in the Juniper Flats/Grapevine and Arrastre Canyon area have been closed to all access and use until posting of signs and clearing of potentially dangerous hazards. When posting the area and marking and clearing of hazards has occurred, pedestrian use only will be permitted in the affected area until rehabilitation occurs to specified criteria. This closure applies to all motorized vehicle and nonmotorized use, including permitted uses, unless specifically excepted by the authorized officer; except for BLM operation and maintenance vehicles, law enforcement vehicles and other vehicles specifically authorized by an authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management. This closure affects ALL of the public lands and roads located within the following lands of the Arrastre Canyon and Grapevine Canyon area of San Bernardino County, located to the north of the San Bernardino National Forest, including and to the east of Coxey Truck Trail, including and to the west of Grapevine Canyon Road, and including and to the south of the powerline road: San Bernardino Meridian T. 3 N., R. 2 W. Secs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. T. 4 N., R. 2 W. Secs. 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35. A total of approximately 4,800 acres. This closure affects only public lands. Private lands are unaffected. The closed routes include the following: (1) Grapevine Canyon Road (4N16), through public lands in Sections 26 and 35 of T. 4 N., R. 2 W. and Section 2 of T. 3 N., R. 2 W. (2) ``Coxey'' Truck Road east of Arrastre Canyon, southeast off of Bowen Ranch Road, through public lands in Section 31 of T. 4 N., R. 2 W. and Section 5 of T. 3 N., R. 2 W. DATES: The emergency closure action goes into effect upon publication of this notice and will remain in effect for 5 years or until rehabilitation criteria for the area have been met, whichever comes first; or until the Authorized Officer determines it is no longer needed. This closure will be reevaluated on an annual basis. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This emergency closure is required to facilitate the rehabilitation of the area affected by the Devil Fire which burned out of control from July 3 through July 8, 1994, as specified in the fire rehabilitation plan. The affected area includes burned over potentially dangerous snags, shallow, highly erodible soils, and valuable riparian areas downstream of the fire area. Most of the transmountain vegetative regime normally present in the area has been eliminated by the fire and will need time to reestablish itself undisturbed by the activities of man. Criteria established to evaluate the rehabilitation effort specified in the fire rehabilitation plan will be used to determine the continuing need for the closure. PENALTIES: Failure to comply with this closure is punishable by a fine not to exceed $100,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Erika Schumacher of the Barstow Resource Area (619&hyph;256&hyph;2729). Maps of the closure area and affected roads will be posted at the closest Hesperia, Lucerne Valley, and Apple Valley Post Offices to the area, and may also be obtained from the Barstow Resource Area, 150 Coolwater Lane, Barstow, CA 92311. Dated: August 3, 1994 Karla K.H. Swanson, Area Manager. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20027 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;40&hyph;M
