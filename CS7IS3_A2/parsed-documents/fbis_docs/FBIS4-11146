The long-awaited time to begin this conference has arrived. On behalf of the committee in charge of preparing this conference, I wish to extend the warmest welcome to all. First of all, I would like to introduce the people who are here with us: Comrade Carlos Lage [applause], secretary of the Council of Ministers Executive Committee; Comrade Roberto Robaina, minister of Foreign Relations [applause]; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government [applause]; Abel Prieto, president of the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists [applause]; Miguel Alfonso, who will be the spokesman for this conference; Jose Cabanas, the secretary [applause]; and myself, Sergio Corrieri, president of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples [applause], who will be the moderator of this conference. I would like to add that a group of personalities from various sectors of Cuban society are here as guests of the conference. We feel that these personalities, because of their work, their experience, or the nature of the posts they are holding, can be useful and suitable for the work we are doing. They will participate in this conference, and if they wish, will also be able to express their opinions on the subjects discussed here. For the official opening of this meeting, we give the floor to Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina [applause]. [Robaina] Guests of this conference, on behalf of the government, I wish to extend a warm welcome to all. For those of us who for more than three decades have experienced pressures, threats, and aggressions, it is easy to understand the personal effort made by many and the merit of their decision not to allow themselves to be defeated by those who have threatened and applied pressure to prevent this meeting from taking place, nor by economic difficulties, the family, or other problems that have thwarted the attendance of many. We interpret your presence here today as a demonstration of attachment to and identification with the Cuban nation. We must also stress the courage of our government in calling for this conference immersed as it is in the country's unavoidable mandatory tasks. We are facing difficult circumstances for guaranteeing our future, when the actions seeking to destroy the projects undertaken by our people for more than 30 years not only prevail, but are intensifying and multiplying. This conference is taking place under the same abnormal conditions that stemmed from the hostile U.S. policy against Cuba since the revolutionary victory, conditions that have marked Cuban relations with the emigre community. The fact that we are here today in this room is not even remotely the result of a miracle or accident. It is above all the result of our maturity, strength, and independence, and also the result of a growing attitude of respect and understanding of a significant portion of the emigre community who identifies more each day with the vital interests of Cuba. You have arrived in Cuba in the midst of an exceptional period, when our people are making extraordinary efforts to heroically preserve the fatherland's independence and, and the gigantic accomplishments of the Revolution. If we commit to this conference, it is because the subject deserves to see the beginning of a joint discussion aimed at making progress along the road to normalize ties between the nation and its emigre community. As expected, the call for this conference has prompted mixed reactions. The name, and the seriousness of our intentions have been criticized. There were even those who expressed doubts that this conference would take place, without mentioning those who by all means tried to prevent it, thwart it, or frustrate it. Of course, there were also those who, knowing us better, realized from the very beginning that this endeavor was feasible, and supported it. Many people of goodwill have joined them in this task and they jointly managed to clean up the stains to appreciate the light. This conference has also become a reality because of the resoluteness and persistence of many who are present here, and of others who for different reasons are not present here today. Many have participated in this effort to achieve rapprochement, some silently, others openly. There are those who have been dedicated to this task for many difficult years, while others joined only recently. In spite of everything, various initiatives and contacts have been promoted, and several actions have been carried out. We are finally here to begin the meeting in accordance with the call made on 14 February 1994. The objectives have been established, but it would not hurt to repeat them here today. They are: to study possible measures to normalize relations between emigres and the nation, between institutions and the family; to promote stable exchange in the cultural, family, and social areas; to foment constructive actions of residents abroad, taking into account the current historical situation in which the country's destiny, the preservation of its sovereignty and independence, as well as the achievements of the people, represent a common platform for all Cubans of good will. We must therefore jointly identify those areas in which, through the participation of all, we can progress toward the establishment of normal relations to which we all have the right. Some have questioned the use of the word emigration in our call. You may interpret this, as some of you have already done publicly, and as is our intention, as referring strictly to those who live outside the fatherland. The participation in and representation at this meeting has also been questioned. The data can speak for itself. Here we have with us 204 emigres, residents of 27 countries. This number is increasing as the hours pass. Among them we can find professionals in various areas -- journalists, artists, writers, housewives, retired people, workers, employees, businessmen, teachers, social workers, religious people, and students. Moreover, we all know that the various political and ideological trends are represented at this conference, which does not prevent our willingness to work for the objective that has brought us together here today. This conference is the continuation of difficult, complex work that has been carried out over a long period. The first important result is the conference itself and the possibilities it offers to go on. The respect and intelligence with which we are to discuss each of the subjects that are worrying us within the nation-emigres conference, must characterize our current dialogue, and must represent essential premises for the future. It would be too ambitious to pretend that in only three days we will be able to resolve all existing problems, when some of the essential ones do not depend exclusively on us. The important thing is to keep up this common effort. With that spirit, let us begin then the work of our conference. Thank you very much. [applause]
