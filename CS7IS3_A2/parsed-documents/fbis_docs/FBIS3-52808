Let us begin with a statement made by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in which he says that the Taba talks are being conducted on the basis of an understanding reached in Cairo and on the basis of Dr. Nabil Sha'th's remarks on this, and not on the basis of the remarks sent by Yasir 'Arafat. ['Asfur] As a matter of fact, the joint statement issued by the Palestinian and Israeli sides to resume the negotiations in Taba states that the basis of negotiations is the Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September 1993 and the understandings reached in Cairo. Besides, the remarks sent by Dr. Nabil Sha'th to Amnon Shahaq were made by Yasir 'Arafat. Therefore, there are no personal remarks by Dr. Nabil Sha'th. These remarks represent the reservations of President Yasir 'Arafat. [Zaydani] There is an impression that the negotiations have been going on for months, and each time we go back to the same issues: the crossings, protection of roads, the size of the Jericho area, and the transfer of civil powers. Has there been no progress? ['Asfur] The truth is that the negotiations which have been going on for around three months did not only address these issues. They also addressed all issues pertaining to the Gaza agreement, the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the size of the Jericho area, in all their aspects. Discussions dealt with all details. There are understandings on several issues, but the recent differences over these three points -- which emerged as three major issues in the negotiations -- created this impression that there has been no progress on any aspects. The truth is that this is not an accurate picture of what is going on at the negotiations. There are major and minor differences, and we are trying to overcome all difficulties. We hope to make progress that will end this long process of negotiations, which started three months ago, and to implement the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. This is what we are seeking in the days ahead. [Zaydani] How do you explain the variation in optimism between you and the Israeli delegation? You are talking about two or three weeks while the Israelis are talking about two or three months? ['Asfur] It is not that we have determined how long things will go on. It is an expression of the nature of our understanding of the implementation of this agreement and the translation of the protocol of Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. We believe that with hard work and without wasting time and avoiding direct responsibility on both sides, we can reach agreement within two or three weeks maximum. This is what we will try to do, if we really want to end this long process of negotiations. [Zaydani] Do you think that the Taba talks will be clearer, given the recent crisis that happened with the Liaison Committee in Cairo? ['Asfur] What happened in Cairo was not a crisis. It was only a misunderstanding of some of the issues during the discussions and how each side dealt with these issues. Finally, an understanding was reached to overcome what happened in Cairo. We think that the Taba talks will produce clearer answers about what happened, especially since there are understandings about some issues. We have covered a considerable distance in areas of understanding, even regarding complicated issues. We can say that during the recent negotiations, the Palestinian side has offered perceptions that give practical solutions. We hope that the Israeli side will understand the Palestinian understandings without pushing in directions which express a unilateral vision of the negotiations -- something which we do not want as a negotiating party. [Zaydani] Do you agree with Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Yosi Beilin that the most important thing in the negotiations is the ability of the Israeli and Palestinian sides to overcome differences and reach an understanding? ['Asfur] No doubt the desire, ability, positive intentions, and abandoning the mentality of pressures to achieve instantaneous or personal gains by any party -- especially if this party believes itself to be the strongest party -- will make the negotiations take a positive course and achieve progress. However, if the other view prevails, using pressure through the logic of strength and weakness, then this will not enable the negotiations to achieve any results. This we do not want to happen. [Zaydani] Will the Taba talks continue uninterrupted until agreement is reached? ['Asfur] This is what we, as a Palestinian party, want. I believe there is initial understanding with the Israeli side. We will know for sure today. We want continuous negotiations until we reach an agreement. Perhaps, there might be technical halts, on Fridays and Saturdays for religious and practical reasons, but we will try to give as much of our time to the negotiations as we can. [Zaydani] Mr. Hasan 'Asfur, member of the Palestinian delegation to the Taba talks, thank you very much. ['Asfur] You are welcome.
