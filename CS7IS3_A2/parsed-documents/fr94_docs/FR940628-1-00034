ACTION: Extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is extending the public comment period from June 15, 1994, to July 15, 1994, for proposed amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 and a new rule, Rule 15c2&hyph;13, which would require brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers to make certain disclosures on their customer confirmations. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before July 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. All comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;6&hyph;94.

Dirk Peterson, Senior Counsel, (202) 942&hyph;0073, Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Market Regulation, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 9, 1994, the Commission proposed for public comment amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 and a new rule, Rule 15c2&hyph;13 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33743, 59 FR 12767). Those proposals expanded the information that brokers, dealers, and municipal securities would be required to disclose on a customer confirmation. The proposals are designed to aid investors in monitoring their securities transactions and update the Commission's confirmation requirements to reflect changes in the securities markets. At the time these proposals were published, the Commission established a 90-day comment period that expired on June 15, 1994. The Commission has received several requests from interested persons to extend the comment period. In light of the complex issues raised by these proposals and the need to solicit the views of as many persons who will be affected by the proposals as possible, the Commission is extending the comment period 30 days. Accordingly, the comment period is extended to July 15, 1994. Dated: June 22, 1994. By the Commission. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
