FR940318-1-00041 FR940318-1-00014 In support of its redesignation request, the State provided available 1989 to 1991 daily coal quality data for Ohio Valley Electric Corporation's Kyger Creek Station (in Gallia County), Ohio Power Company's Gavin Station (also in Gallia County) and Muskingham River Station (in Morgan and Washington Counties), and Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company's Conesville Station (in Coshocton County). The State also provided results of multiple stack tests at the Muskingham River Station, and committed to send results of recently completed stack tests for the other plants in the near future. Although three of the four counties also include at least one industrial source subject to source-specific emissions limits, these sources are not located in the portion of the county designated nonattainment and do not significantly affect nonattainment area air quality. The fuel quality data submitted by the State indicate no recent violations of air quality standards in the four counties. The Kyger Creek data showed no exceedances of the applicable limit on any day during the 3 years. The Gavin data showed exceedances for a single boiler on three occasions in 1989, but no exceedances in 1990 or 1991. The Muskingham River data showed numerous exceedances through May 1989, but then during the subsequent 21/2 years only one occasion of coal for one boiler exceeding the applicable limit. On this occasion the fuel quality for other boilers was enough below the applicable limit to compensate for the exceedance at the one boiler, such that use of the actual fuel qualities in the modeling analysis underlying the approved SIP would indicate attainment. Finally, the Conesville data indicated an exceedance at all boilers in April 1989, but no exceedances in the subsequent 21/2 years. These periods of compliance, reflecting the most recent available data, provide sufficient basis for USEPA to conclude that these areas are now attaining annual average and 24-hour average air quality standards. The fuel quality data, in conjunction with stack test data for the Muskingham River Station, also indicate attainment of the 3-hour average standard in Morgan and Washington Counties. USEPA has not received stack test data for Coshocton or Gallia Counties, and has not evaluated whether these counties are attaining the 3-hour standard. B. Fully Approved Implementation Plan The second criterion for redesignation to attainment, given in section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii), is that the plan be fully approved under section 110(k). The plan for the Morgan and Washington Counties nonattainment area was approved on May 20, 1988 (53 FR 18087). Although this approval was granted under section 110(a)(2) rather than section 110(k), section 110(a)(2) was the predecessor of and contained similar provisions as section 110(k) prior to the enactment of section 110(k) in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Thus, USEPA views approval of a SIP under section 110(a)(2) prior to the enactment of the 1990 amendments as sufficient to satisfy the criterion of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii). The key elements of the plans for Coshocton and Gallia Counties are Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) limits promulgated under section 110(c). Based on questions as to whether such plans satisfy the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii), USEPA is deferring action on Ohio's request for these two counties. C. Permanent and Enforceable Emission Reductions The third criterion for redesignation to attainment is that the improvement be attributable to permanent and enforceable emissions reductions. For SO 2 , this criterion could be satisfied, for example, by showing that the key sources have switched to fuels with sufficiently lower sulfur content to meet permanent, federally enforceable fuel quality limits that provide for attainment. For the four counties subject to the State's redesignation request, this criterion is met because the air quality improvement is due to sources switching to coal supplies with reduced sulfur content in order to meet enforceable limits. D. Maintenance Plan The fourth criterion is that USEPA has fully approved a maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A. Section 175A requires a plan that assures maintenance of the air quality standard for at least 10 years beyond the date of redesignation, and includes contingency measures as necessary to assure prompt correction of any violations. USEPA has published guidance that for SO 2 , contingency measure requirements under section 172(c)(9) (for SIPs) may be satisfied by a State having an aggressive program for identifying and resolving any instances of sources not complying with limits established to assure attainment. (See 57 FR 13547.) Such an enforcement program would also satisfy SO 2 contingency measure requirements under section 175A. Ohio submitted a maintenance plan in conjunction with its redesignation request. This action addresses Ohio's maintenance plan as well as its redesignation request.
