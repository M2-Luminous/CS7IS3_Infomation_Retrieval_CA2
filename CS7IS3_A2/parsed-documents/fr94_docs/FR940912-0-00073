FR940912-0-00073 FR940912-0-00016 40 CFR Part 52 [TX&hyph;23&hyph;1&hyph;6390; FRL&hyph;5063&hyph;6] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Texas; Revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) Addressing Carbon Monoxide (CO) for El Paso AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action approves a revision to the Texas SIP addressing CO for El Paso. Certain elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP were submitted by the Governor of Texas to the EPA in order to meet the November 15, 1992, deadline for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO. These elements satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area CO SIP for El Paso. This Federal Register (FR) action approves some of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, including the 1990 base year CO emissions inventory and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP have been or will be acted upon in separate FR actions. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective on October 12, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background A segment of El Paso, Texas, was designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value below 12.7 parts per million (ppm.) (specifically 12.6), under sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 Please reference 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991), 57 FR 13498, and 13529 (April 16, 1992). The air quality planning requirements for moderate CO nonattainment areas with a design value less than or equal to 12.7 ppm. are set out in subparts one and three of part D, title I of the CAA. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the CAA made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the CO NAAQS (see Public Law Number 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the CAA, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq . The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals containing moderate CO nonattainment area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992). Moderate CO nonattainment areas less than 12.7 ppm., such as El Paso, were required to submit SIPs to the EPA by November 15, 1992, containing specifically: (1) A comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of CO in the nonattainment area (sections 172(c)(3) and 187(a)(1) of the CAA); (2) no later than September 30, 1995, and no later than the end of each three year period thereafter, until the area is redesignated to attainment, a revised inventory meeting the requirements of sections 187(a)(1) and 187(a)(5) of the CAA; (3) a permit program to be submitted by November 15, 1993, which meets the requirements of section 173 for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of CO (section 172(c)(5)); (4) contingency measures due November 15, 1993, that are to be implemented if the EPA determines that the area has failed to attain the primary standards by the applicable date (section 172(c)(9)); (5) a commitment to upgrade the current I/M program and submit a SIP revision for the I/M program by November 15, 1993, (section 187(a)(4)); and (6) an oxygenated fuels program (section 211(m)).
