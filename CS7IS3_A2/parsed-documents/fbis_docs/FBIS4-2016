This is a major strategic decision. In order to let you have a deeper understanding of the meaning of this decision as well as the current situation and development prospects of our country's pillar industries, probe into issues encountered in developing and revitalizing our country's pillar industries, and seek solutions, the economic desk of this newspaper and the Research Office of the State Planning Commission are jointly opening a special discussion column called "Grasp the Opportunity and Revitalize the Pillar Industries." We hope you all will pay attention to it. [end editor's note] An important change in our country's economic development strategy for the 1990's is precisely to transform the extensive type of economic growth into an intensive one, to alter the current situation of industrial structure with a low level of processing, technology, and added value, and to speed up industrial modernization. Revitalizing pillar industries conforms precisely to this demand. The pillar industries are, in general, characterized as being technology-intensive and having a high degree of linkage with other industries and a high degree of income flexibility. The revitalization of pillar industries will definitely bring about the development of a number of interrelated industries and will help upgrade the overall quality of the national economy. Revitalizing pillar industries is also a historical demand in line with our country's economic development. The high-speed growth of our country's agriculture and consumables industry in the 1980's played a vital role in supporting and promoting the development of the economy as a whole. In the 1990's, we must continue to advance our economic development to a new stage and have a new target for economic growth while maintaining the steady growth of agricultural production. It is the inevitable trend of economic development to select pillar industries as the new target for economic growth. Comrade Jiang Zemin once said that the electronics industry is the multiplier of the national economy. More national income can be created under the situation of a nonexistent or limited increase in resources investment by utilizing electronics technology to transform traditional industries and to develop high-technology products that save energy and resources. The electronics, engineering, automobile, and petrochemical industries have greater growth potential than other industries, and thus play a greater role in promoting the national economy. As demonstrated by the experience of some rising industrialized countries and regions, during the period of accelerating industrial development, only when these industries maintain a higher rate of growth can we advance the process of industrialization and modernization in giant strides. The development of production must be in line with the changes in market demand. As far as consumption demand is concerned, our people now have adequate food and clothing and are moving toward having a relatively comfortable life. City and town dwellers' consumption of food, clothing, and durables has surpassed the average level of medium-income countries. However, our per capita consumption in transportation and communications makes us one of most backward countries in this area. In the 1990's, with constant economic growth, our people's standard of living will advance to another new stage. As consumption demand is becoming more and more diversified, and the field of consumption is constantly widening, the focus of consumption will gradually shift from the several major household appliances in the 1980's to a new generation of durables, including household communication products, household computers, houses, and cars. Due to such changes in consumption demand, the industries producing these commodities are being urged to speed up their development so that the industrial structure can adapt itself to changes in the consumption structure. As far as investment needs are concerned, with technological progress and the readjustment of the industrial structure, the demand for engineering and electronics products of high technical standards will maintain a high growth rate. In particular, integrated circuits, computers, program- controlled telephones, and other investment-type electronics products; cars, aircraft, ships, and other means of transport; and power-generating equipment, petrochemical facilities, ethylene, new building materials, and other industries of raw and processed materials have an extremely huge potential market. At present, our country's key productive technology for the auto industry still has hardly any competitive power; with the huge growth of imports of large electrical engineering equipment for domestic use, greater and greater foreign trade deficits in electrical engineering products are being incurred; petrochemical industrial enterprises lack a large economic scale without a strong capability for developing high value-added products, such as refined petrochemical products; and buildings completed are of low grade and poor benefit. Due to the existence of these problems, our economy, after linking up with the international economy, will be at a disadvantage in the competition. Hence, we must have a sense of urgency and of crisis in developing the pillar industries. To develop the pillar industries, we should attach importance to the role of industrial policy. The development of pillar industries has a number of prominent characteristics; that is, it proceeds in a centralized manner and on a large economic scale, and we cannot follow the beaten path of starting from primitive competition. All localities cannot "rush headlong into mass action" and develop these industries at the same time. The state must work according to the objective law of economic development, give play to the basic role of the market in resources distribution, and draw up long- and medium-term plans to coordinate the overall arrangements. We must treat the expansion of exports as an important strategy for developing the pillar industries. As far as the development level of our countries's pillar industries is concerned, we still do not have the capability to get into the international market. Most of our exports are products of low quality and have low added value, which only represent a small proportion of international trade. The state must formulate a policy to focus on bolstering enterprises which possess key products, which are oriented toward the international market, which have strong competitive power, and which operate on a large scale, The state needs to build up a number of key industrial projects, of a high standard and on a large scale, for the international market. Realizing an economy of scale in production and encouraging competition is an important link in developing the pillar industries. The scale of production and operation of our country's pillar industries falls short of international standards. Overall, the economy of scale has not taken shape. For example, international automobile production has reached the level of 2 million per year, whereas our country annual automobile production amounts to only 250,000. Due to defects in the system, enterprises in the realms of the pillar industries scatter and are engaged in production on a small scale, with a low degree of specialized supply of spare parts and a small output of low quality. Moreover, the phenomenon of repeated construction and production is quite serious. To develop the pillar industries, we must follow the law of large scale modernized production and insist on organizing our construction in accordance with the demand of economies of scale. To develop the pillar industries, we must also properly handle the relationship between the utilization of foreign investment and the development of nationality industries. An important measure for developing the pillar industries is to introduce foreign investment and technology with an emphasis on enhancing our capability of self- reliance. After all, the markets for automobiles, household appliances, and other products in China should be filled with Chinese commodities. We should group outstanding talent together and strive to digest, assimilate, and innovate the technology that is introduced. We must move to the path of independent study and self-development as soon as possible on the basis of introducing technology from the outside, running joint ventures, and cooperating with foreign investors. Making small profits with quick turnover should be an important principle of the development of our country's pillar industries. The prices of many mechanical and electronics products in our country are currently higher than those in the international market. It is true that costs are high, but the profit rate is also high, and this is one of the reasons behind blind and repeated construction. We must form a mechanism whereby prices are determined by the market through consolidating market competition, draw up a consumption policy in line with the new stage of economic development, abolish various unreasonable charges, and develop production while meeting market needs.
