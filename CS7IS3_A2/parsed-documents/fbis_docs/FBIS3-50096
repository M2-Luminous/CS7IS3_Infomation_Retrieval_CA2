An article published in the most recent issue of the weekly RESPEKT, which describes the talks between Skoda Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek and Iranian military representatives on modernizing the Soviet T-72 tank and supplying other weapons, provided the impetus for this discussion. Skoda Plzen is part of the RDP Group, a Czech arms consortium. The actual aim of the RDP Group, as put forward by its director general, Jan Vlcek, is very positive: to contribute by efficient organization to improving the ability to compete of our foremost heavy-industrial enterprises, which are affiliated in the RDP Group, and to make money to convert arms production. According to Vlcek, the production of weapons in the enterprises affiliated in the RDP Group should amount to only 20 percent of their production program. The hitch, however, lies elsewhere. It is not that Czech arms production should be abolished, as President Havel suggested after his election. It is impossible, of course, to abolish arms production immediately. The other side of the coin, however, is the offer to modernize tanks right on the spot in countries against which a UN arms embargo has been imposed. Even Director Soudek himself is not denying the talks on modernizing tanks and other arms supplies. Most startling, however, is the fact that these talks are taking place with the knowledge of our government. According to Vlcek, the appropriate deputy ministers regularly attend meetings of the RDP Group's board. It would perhaps be worth pointing out that the export of Czech and Slovak arms to high-risk countries has on more than one occasion been the cause of consternation in Western countries. If Iranian tanks ever really are modernized, this could be another major international faux pas by our country. Exporting arms or, rather, their spare parts to a country such as Iran is not much in keeping with our endeavor to attain the position of an exemplary candidate for entry into NATO. Let us hope that our government does not think that the process for converting the arms industry would be set in motion with the debut of the first modernized tank on Iran's borders. We can expect, therefore, that the government and, first and foremost, Minister Dlouhy, who is responsible for arms exports, will adopt as soon as possible a decisive stance on Director Soudek's Iranian activities and will, at the same time, consider not only the economic aspect but also our reputation in the civilized world.
