"Japan could not swallow any U.S. proposals that would lead to acceptance of numerical trade targets," Hata told a press conference. Hata was speaking ahead of the resumption Wednesday of sectoral talks on a new bilateral trade framework. Japan and the United States have agreed to restart the deadlocked trade talks on condition that Washington will not bring up the issue of numerical targets, Hata said. But "a source of contention" still exists between the two countries, he added. Recently, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the U.S. will pursue "result-oriented" accords in trade talks with Japan, including seeking a guarantee from the Japanese Government to expand the number of Japanese auto dealers handling U.S.-made models. Whether or not dealers will sell U.S. automobiles is a matter for the private sector, Hata said. He urged U.S. automakers to work harder to make their products attractive to Japanese consumers.
