Five statistics officials from Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture in Jilin Province, northeastern China, confirmed the report. The ethnic Koreans are visiting Seoul to receive training. According to the officials, the unidentified deputy chief bodyguard of Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of President Kim Il-song, fled to Guangzhou in southern China via Thailand in late March. Chinese authorities, at the request of North Korean officials, arrested the man while he was in hiding at a Guangzhou hotel. The man was then handcuffed and sent back to North Korea through the Chinese border city of Tumen near the Tumen River, and there is a strong possibility he has been executed, the officials said. The ethnic Korean officials, however, said they could not determine his identity and did not know how the man had come to visit Thailand.
