Bolkestein rejected a role in the opposition. "We are a party of government," he said. "The VVD was not set up to be in opposition," the VVD's leading candidate said in a nearly euphoric mood at the party meeting in Aalsmeer. "We are out to govern." Like other prominent party members, he did not say which coalition he would prefer. But like MP Erica Terpstra, second candidate on the list, the VVD leader attacked the PvdA [Labor Party] and was mild toward D66 [Democrats 66], which in his view had "performed terrifically" in doubling its number of seats. MP Dijkstal, the third candidate on the list, said the most eye- catching results were those of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and the PvdA, the coalition parties. "It is completely clear that another cabinet must be formed and we will talk about that from tomorrow onwards," he said. Terpstra regarded the chance of a "purple" coalition [consisting of the VVD, the PvdA, and the D66] as "not probable" because the PvdA was directly opposed to the VVD in the field of social security. Bolkestein emphasized that [PvdA] Kok would have to reorientate in that field. He called the position of the PvdA leader "eccentric, peculiar." Bolkestein said that after yesterday evening's election results, it was in no way certain "that the biggest party would also provide the prime minister." "The prime ministership cannot be claimed," he said. In the formation process, Kok and Brinkman would certainly have to "moderate their tone," the VVD's leading candidate said. "The time of the big power blocks in politics is past." The VVD achieved its second-best election result in the history of the party. "Who would have dared think a year ago that the difference with the CDA would only be four seats?" Bolkestein said. "The VVD could thank its success to a clear program, in his view. For the VVD, more than other parties, it was about policies," he said at the meeting in Aalsmeer. After the seats had been divided out, Bolkestein's initial analysis was that the present coalition of the CDA and the PvdA had "received an incredible beating from the electorate." From this it followed that "the Netherlands wants another cabinet with different policies." He rigorously rejected speculation that the VVD would prefer a strong role in the opposition to a small place in government. His party was certainly seeking to participate in government. "The electorate expects a cabinet where something will change," he said. "That is a cabinet including the VVD." He was angered by suggestions that the CDA and the PvdA could continue to govern with the addition of the senior citizens' parties, for example. "It would be unprecedented if a coalition which suffers such big losses is put in a position to continue its policies," he said. At first, Bolkestein was silent when asked about his own specific political future. However, after some seconds passed in the momentarily silent room, he repeated what he had already said before the elections: Even after yesterday evening's strong gain in seats, Bolkestein will continue to prefer leading his parliamentary party.
