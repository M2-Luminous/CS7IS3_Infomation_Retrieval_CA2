Deploying 1,000-2,000 soldiers is proving an extremely complicated issue and above all, a "hazardous" one, according to Alain Juppe. Nevertheless, President Francois Mitterrand insisted on French determination this weekend, even if it means that Paris has to act alone, he argued. The genocide that has been going on in Rwanda is no longer "tolerable." The following is a compendium of questions raised by the notion of such an intervention. [passage omitted] How Can This Intervention Be Carried Out? Several potential scenarios have been identified. It appears that the most likely one would entail establishing a rear base on the Zairian-Rwandan border. Initially 800 French soldiers would be stationed there. From this base, they would enter Rwanda, focusing exclusively on the regions held by government forces and militias. Their mission would be to protect dozens of areas containing Tutsi refugees "threatened by extermination" by militias and government forces. The whole operation would gradually unfold until French soldiers succeeded in protecting several such areas and saving thousands of people who may otherwise be killed at any moment. This scenario is dependent on President Mobutu's consent. Zaire's head of state has given no formal answer yet. However, Zairian diplomatic sources indicate a concern to "stop the slaughter." What Means Will Be Made Available to French Soldiers? They will be significant, and the operation will be quite a large one. The Americans, Belgians, and Italians are reportedly ready to provide logistical support. As for the French Government, it is willing to go quite far: 1,000 professional soldiers would be deployed initially, including 600 belonging to the ground forces and 400 men performing support tasks (logistical, air control, helicopter crews, etc.). A second wave comprising another 1,000 men would stand by, ready to act within 24 hours. Only professional soldiers will take part in the operation. Most elite units (paratroopers, the Foreign Legion, and marine troops) will be called upon. The first troops will be taken from permanent bases in Africa (Central African Republic, Gabon, Ivory Coast, and Djibouti). Bangui would be used as an "operational platform." When Would All This Happen? Shortly. President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Alain Juppe, [Rally for the Republic President] Jacques Chirac, and several political leaders have all agreed on the "urgency" of the situation. The first units will probably be deployed as soon as the United Nations has approved a resolution authorizing French soldiers to act under Chapter 7 ("possible use of force"). According to the Quai d'Orsay [French Foreign Ministry], it is "almost certain" that such a resolution will be passed. China, which is generally adamant about the principle of noninterference in a state's internal affairs, has reportedly agreed to abstain, considering there is "genocide" taking place.
