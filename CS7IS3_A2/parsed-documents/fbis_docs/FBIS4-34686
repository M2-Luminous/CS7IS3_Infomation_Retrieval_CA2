Sarney promptly accepted the invitation, which was extended personally by Franco. Sarney returned from France on 20 June. Today he stayed home recovering from labyrinthitis. At 1700 on 22 June, Sarney will meet with the members of the Brazilian delegation to discuss details of the trip, which is scheduled to start on 24 June. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has informed the Portuguese Government about the change. Franco said by asking Sarney to head the delegation he was paying tribute to the presidents of Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe because the first meeting aimed at creating the International Institute of the Portuguese Language with the attendance of the heads of state of these countries was held on 3 November [no year given] in Sao Luiz (Maranhao) and was organized by Ambassador de Oliveira, who was then culture minister of the Sarney government. In a communique released today at Planalto Palace, the president states that despite having postponed his trip to Portugal, he will visit that country before the end of his term to commemorate the creation of the CPLP and to resume bilateral talks with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco e Silva. The Brazilian delegation will include cabinet ministers, executives of state-owned companies, and private businessmen who will pay their own travel expenses. Presidential Spokesman Fernando Costa has said Franco's decision to postpone the trip was in no way related to the death of his nephew and private secretary Ariosto Franco, although the cancellation came after his death. "The president was shaken by Ariosto's death," Costa said, "but he has chosen to stay in Brazil because he considers his presence necessary on the eve of the implementation of the real."
