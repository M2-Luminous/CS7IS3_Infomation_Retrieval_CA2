Welcome to all the Palestinian hands that are rushing to build a beautiful, free, and auspicious homeland. These are glorious days, with the arrival of the vanguards of the Palestinian police force, the Palestinian administrations, and the groups of Palestinian deportees. As Palestinians, we must move toward hope instead of sorrow, toward work instead of self- flagellation, and away from the edge of illusion. We are addressing those who support and those who oppose the agreement. Why? Because what is appearing before us now is the Palestinian homeland. Who dares to reject the homeland? Who dares to escape from life into deplorable exile? Despite its advantages and disadvantages, the Palestinian-Israeli agreement has moved from paper articles into real national interaction on the ground. It has moved from endless pages of opinions -- some of which are right and some of which are wrong -- into a land where a homeland is being established. This homeland needs economic and administrative skills. It needs intensive efforts to extend housing, water, education, health, judiciary, customs services, and thousands of other details. This includes the upcoming elections in the homeland, which will baptize our democratic solidarity and our political life, based on pluralism and respect for human rights. As Palestinians, we must leave the waiting room and get involved in work, collective effort, and comprehensive participation. We must leave behind the sands of exile and the language of skepticism, loss, fear, and hesitation. We must use the dictionary of national presence. We all know the language of accusations and counter accusations was never our language. It was, instead, a barbaric language imposed on us by the authority of the diaspora, the dictatorship of geography and by coercive alliances we could not escape. One party or another wanted us to say (?no) in order to serve its personal interests and its special strategy. For some of the factions, forces, and trends, this word no was the only password. The homeland is being born again. It is rising before us. The license for entry to the homeland is the word yes: Yes to building, yes to participation, yes to positive contribution. This is everyone's responsibility. O brothers, many tasks are before us. Our burden is large. We must work hard, in keeping with our ambitions. Just as we built for others, it is now time for us to build for ourselves. Is there anything more sacred than having a homeland that we can build and a future for our children which we can maintain away from the pressures and haggling of others? Welcome to Palestine, which is returning to life, transformed from absence into reality, from idea into the revolution, and into the state. Welcome to Palestine -- the homeland, the state, and the entity. Welcome to Palestine, the call of the memory that never fades and the result of our effort that is not in vain. Everything we do for it is for us. Every tree we plant shelters us. Every house, every factory and farm, every school, university, hospital, and laboratory we build will testify to our everlasting presence. At the places of exile, everything was claimed by others. Welcome to Palestine. Welcome to all the hands that are united together to build this great edifice.
