Amid a jubilant atmosphere, the Central Military Commission [CMC] held a tea party for units stationed in Beijing and for veteran cadres in order to greet the Spring Festival. Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, and other leading comrades happily gathered with veteran generals and comrades to greet the Spring Festival. Jiang Zemin -- general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, president of the state, and chairman of the Central Military Commission -- delivered a warm and enthusiastic speech. On behalf of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, he extended cordial regards and expressed his high respects to veteran comrades, retired military cadres, commanders and fighters of the entire army, officers and soldiers of the armed police, and comrades of militia units and reserve forces! Jiang Zemin said: Over the past year, while under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, people of our country have grasped the opportune time to deepen reform and promote development, and have made new achievements. There has been political stability in our society, with rapid economic development, prosperity in the domestic market, thriving foreign trade, and continuous improvement of the people's standard of living. The publication of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" is a great event in the political life of our party and state. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping -- which is linked with Volume 2 published 10 years ago -- is a theoretical summation of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's abundant experience to guide us in carrying out reform, opening up to the outside world, and promoting socialist modernization; it is also scientific guidance to guide us in continuously making successful advancements. Since the party Central Committee decided to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the entire country has begun studying the works. According to the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee issued the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure." This is our program of action in carrying out reform of the economic structure in the 1990's, and will certainly have a profound influence on our country's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. We are firmly convinced that in the new year the entire party as well as people of the entire country will continue to advance successfully on the road of reform and development. Jiang Zemin made a report to veteran comrades on the achievements of army building over the past year. He stated: During the past year, we have made new progress in army building. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, commanders and fighters of the entire army have united as one, worked in a solid manner, and successfully accomplished various tasks. The broad mass of officers and soldiers have taken on a good mental outlook, various units have maintained a high degree of stability and centralized unity [ji zhong tong yi 7162 0022 4827 0001], and there has been stable development in army building. Jiang Zemin added: Members of the entire army have conscientiously studied the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the thinking of army building in the new period; have conducted education on the party's basic line in a penetrating manner; have organized cadres at and above regimental level to study the theory and attend training on a rotation basis; and have enhanced the consciousness and determination of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in implementing the party's line, principles, and policies. We have strengthened strategic guidance for national defense and army building. Various units have strengthened military training and have extensively promoted the study of high technologies. The situation for military training for the entire army has been good and has rarely been seen in many years. Units at various levels have attached importance to the training of cadres and to the building of leading groups. We have stressed the need to carry forward the fine tradition of our army and maintain the true color of the Red Army. We have also achieved relatively great results in improving the party's workstyle and in advocating honesty in performing official duties in army units. We have made new progress in scientific research and in the improvement of arms for national defense. We have strived to improve the units' material and cultural lives and living condition, and have strengthened the attractiveness and rallying power [ning ju li 0413 5112 0500] of military units. Jiang Zemin said emphatically: 1994 is a year of crucial importance to China's reform, opening up, and economic construction. We should steadfastly follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, pool the strength of all nationalities, mobilize all positive factors, closely rally around the central work of economic construction, and make efforts to constantly push forward the cause of the socialist modernization drive. Under the new conditions, our army is shouldering heavy historical responsibility; it is necessary to further improve army building and reform, and enhance the fighting capacity of troops in an all-round manner to provide a firm and powerful security guarantee for the state's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. We should vigorously intensify ideological and political construction; earnestly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; arm the broad masses of officers and men with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the concept of army-building in the new period; uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army; and adhere to the party's basic line and not waver in it for one hundred years. We should continue to comply with the demand of the Central Military Commission in further improving the quality of the army and in creating the best armed forces which our conditions permit. In accordance with the laws of developing a socialist market economy and army building, we should promote the reform of troops in an active and proper manner. As an important force for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our army should walk in the forefront of society in developing a spiritual civilization. We can have firm confidence that our great army will never fail to live up to the great trust of the party and the people, and will never let veteran comrades down. In this new year, they will make greater progress! Jiang Zemin praised veteran comrades who, during decades of long revolutionary service, had gone through fire and water, fought bravely, and made great contributions to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and the establishment of new China, as well as made indelible contributions to the growth and strengthening of the people's army -- this is the glory of our party and army. Veteran comrades have extraordinary fighting experience; they have shown concern over and support for army building, and have thrown a great deal of energy into such work. With respect to the achievements in army building, some credit should go to veteran comrades. Jiang Zemin expressed the hope that veteran comrades would continue to show their concern over the causes of the party and army, propose more ideas, and contribute more good policies. He asked commanders and fighters of the entire army -- particularly middle-aged and young leading cadres -- to emulate the veteran comrades' revolutionary spirit and sublime style, and carry forward and display the fine traditions of our party and army in order that the people's army will maintain the true qualities of Red Army veterans forever. Party committees and units at all levels should show their concern to veteran comrades from a political stand and take good care of them in their lives; they should further improve the leadership in the work for veteran cadres and do more actual and useful deeds for veteran comrades. Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the CMC, presided over the tea party. Attending the tea party were CMC members Chi Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, Fu Quanyou, Wang Ping, Li Desheng, Yang Dezhi, Xiao Ke, Chen Xilian, and Wang Enmao; Xue Ming, widow of Marshal He Long; Lin Yueqin, widow of Marshal Luo Ronghuan; and leading comrades of all general departments of the People's Liberation Army, various major units stationed in Beijing, and the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Armed Police Force. The troops' literary and art workers staged a brilliant theatrical performance at the party.
