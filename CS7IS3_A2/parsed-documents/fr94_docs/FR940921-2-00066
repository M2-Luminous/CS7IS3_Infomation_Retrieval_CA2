FR940921-2-00066 FR940921-2-00059 In the January 4, 1994 letter, the State also submitted State standards comparable to: Incorporation of General Industry Safety and Health Standards Applicable to Construction Work; 29 CFR 1926, Correction; as published in the Federal Register (58 FR 40468, dated July 28, 1993).

The standard was effective October 27, 1993; and notice of its adoption was published by the State on October 27, 1993. In the January 4, 1994 letter, the State also submitted State standards comparable to: Air Contaminants; 29 CFR 1910, Correction; as published in the Federal Register (58 FR 40191, dated July 27, 1993). This standard, which is contained in Chapter 88 of the Code of Iowa (1983), was promulgated after public comments requested September 1, 1993; hearing scheduled for September 23, 1993; (no comments were received); and resolution adopted by the Division of Labor Services on October 27, 1993, pursuant to Chapter 17a, of the Iowa Code. The standard was effective October 27, 1993; and notice of its adoption was published by the State on October 27, 1993. 2. Decision Having reviewed the State submission in comparison with the Federal standards, it has been determined that the State standards are identical to the comparable Federal standards and should therefore be approved. 3. Location of Supplement for Inspection and Copying A copy of the standard supplement, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the following locations: Directorate of Federal/State Operations, Office of State Programs, Room N3700, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20210; Office of the Regional Administrator, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 406 Federal Office Building, 911 Walnut Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; and Division of Labor Services, 1000 East Grand Avenue, Des Moines, Iowa 50319. 4. Public Participation Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c) of this Chapter, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause exists for not publishing the supplement to the Iowa State Plan as a proposed change and for making the Regional Administrator's approval effective upon publication for the following reasons: 1. The standards are identical to the comparable Federal standards and are therefore deemed to be at least as effective. 2. The standards were adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of State law and further public participation and notice would be unnecessary. This decision is effective September 21, 1994. (Section 18, Public Law 91&hyph;596, 84 Stat. 1608 [29 U.S.C. 667]). Signed at Kansas City, Missouri, this 20 day of June, 1994. John T. Phillips, Regional Administrator.
