Thus it was claimed that in the past 24 hours crack subunits of the Feliks Dzerzhinskiy Moscow Division of Russia's Internal Affairs troops had landed at the airport in the Tbilisi suburb of Vaziani and that as early as tomorrow they would, together with the republic's law enforcement bodies, start jointly patrolling the Georgian capital. Representatives of the command of the Russian force in the Transcausus, the press secretariat of the head of the Georgian State, and the press secretariat of the republic's competent bodies flatly denied this latest piece of news.
