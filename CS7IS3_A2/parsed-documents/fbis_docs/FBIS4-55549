They might not really want each other but they cannot live without each other. Can you accept this view? [Peto] [passage omitted] The MSZP has a chance to get an absolute majority. Therefore, technically, the Socialists do not need us. However, politically they do. A coalition government is more useful for the country in all respects than a one-party government. However, it is no use denying that a good number of MSZP members treat the dilemma of a coalition or a one-party arrangement as a simple technical matter and tend, for this reason, toward the former. [passage omitted] [Gador] In recent days, many guesses have surfaced about the MSZP's actual direction. Whether it will support the Bekesi-type social-liberal line -- this is actually the party's accepted program -- or follow a separate road in the hope of a large-scale victory. [Bekesi] Certain subjective intentions and ideas -- especially in the current situation -- obviously do emerge. However, what Attila Agh said is an objective necessity, however we look at it. To use the slogan of a well-known film: "You cannot do it on your own...." Especially because -- this might sound like a commonplace -- the country is in a difficult situation. This situation can be described in terms of three typical attributes: The economic crisis has become deeper, the etatist governing of the past four years has created nausea and much damage, and, according to 2.8 million voters -- the two parties together received this number of votes -- the way out of this can only be found by implementing a modernization program. A social-liberal economic policy is clearly required to restrain the economic crisis and establish the conditions for growth. This can only be implemented by a coalition government of this structure. In other words, it cannot indeed be done alone. The progressive political forces have to work together, otherwise the trust will be lost. A close cooperation is primarily in the interest of the party that receives the most votes. I do not think this need be further explained. In addition to this, we need not make very great efforts for our parties to cooperate. As Peto also mentioned, the major features of our programs can be harmonized even if experts have disagreements on minor issues. However, these can be bridged. We have complete agreement on the essential issues, for example that etatism has to be eliminated: The "withdrawal of the state," or deregulation is one of the most important tasks. [Gador] In other words, among other things, you agree that the citizens should be left in peace and they need not be told every day what to do. [Bekesi] Certainly. The state must not oppress people, their lives, or the economy. It might be naivete on my part but I believe that since 53 percent of the electors have voted for this program then they have only authorized us to implement this program. The electors believe that this program can successfully be implemented together. Therefore, their confidence does not only apply separately but it also obliges us to cooperate. If this is so, then it is our duty to overcome the mistrust that undoubtedly exists between our parties. This is in the interest of both parties. Bekesi: Realistically, Logically [Gador] However, the MSZP received almost twice as many votes as the SZDSZ. I very well remember that, from the first moment to the last, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] alluded to the fact that the majority of Hungarian society had voted for them: These votes meant that they were right. Are you sure that this false euphoria will not capture the MSZP? [Bekesi] If we are realistic and logical, we do not think in terms of parliamentary arithmetic and the party will not be overcome by the arrogance of power just because it got more votes than its partner. Overvaluing the numerical success of the elections can also be a very visible lesson for my party. I know that 1.8 million people voted for us in the first round, but even if I had never learned mathematics, I would know how little this is compared with the 10.5 million Hungarian citizens. We also have to recognize that, even together with the SZDSZ's 1 million votes, the two parties only have less than 28 percent of society's and 33 percent of the electors' confidence; therefore, we have no right to any kind of authoritarian behavior. We must cooperate with society and, to be able to do this, mainly with each other. [Gador] This recognition is respectable. However, does this mean that you will not use any "power" superiority when the probable coalition talks are started after the second round and the offices and ministerial positions are allocated? [Bekesi] Let me recall the agreement between Helmut Schmidt and Hans-Dietrich Genscher when the Social Democrats ended up with more than 40 percent at the elections while the Free Democrats did not get more than 7 or 8 percent. The allocation of ministerial positions was decided by sober consideration rather than by the proportion of the parliamentary representation. They governed successfully at the time. This is what is before our eyes! [passage omitted] [Gador] Politicians of two parties, who have very different backgrounds, are sitting here and are agreeing on all the important issues, and they might at most be politely and quietly debating each other's arguments and conclusions. I do not wish to be cynical: Hungarians have been dreaming about this. However, is this not only a case of what the conservative politicians and journalists accuse you of, namely that you want to achieve a two- third majority in parliament, and can then even legally rewrite the Constitution. Many people believe -- and the predecessors of the Socialists are an example of this -- that uncontrolled and uncontrollable power is bound to become distorted. [Peto] Every kind of power can be abused at any time; however, it might not be worth it. This kind of policy does not work in the long run, and not even in the short term nowadays.... [Bekesi] And we do not wish to fail. [Peto] A possible two-thirds majority can be used, rather than abused, because, for example, the parliamentary order of procedure can be changed in such a way that parliament will indeed be able to function. In the meantime, the rules that we are planning would significantly expand the rights of the opposition. This is what we have been saying for years, actually.... [Bekesi] A new law on local authorities and the media should be made.... [Peto] If I wanted to speak with pathos, I would say that the SZDSZ has not been fighting for basic democratic rights for years so as to become anti-democratic now that it may come to power. [passage omitted] [Bekesi] Uncontrolled and uncontrollable power is indeed frightening. It must not exist. The MSZP, just like any other party, only has a chance for successful governing in a coalition, otherwise it will fail. This will not change whether we get 48 or 52 percent after the second round. I repeat: The dominance and the ministerial seats have to be decided on the basis of rational consideration rather than in accordance with the parliamentary power relations after 29 May. The country -- and among others, to maintain its prestige, the MSZP -- needs a rational government that is able to operate and which is professionally impeccable. [passage omitted]
