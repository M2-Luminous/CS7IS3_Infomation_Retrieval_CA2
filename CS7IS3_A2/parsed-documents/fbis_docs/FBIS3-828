The forum, which put the final touches to the plan yesterday, said a subsidy policy would be in place for individual, collective and rental ownership. The plan would also provide for a mechanism to obtain mortgage and nonmortgage-based finance. The forum's decision to support the government's housing subsidy scheme has been welcomed by Housing Minister Louis Shill. Mr. Shill caused a stir several weeks ago by announcing the scheme while it was still under discussion. In a separate development, the government has approved the provision of funds to begin the construction of the flood attenuation [as heard] dam outside Ladysmith. The funds, which will form part of the department of water affairs and forestry budget, will become available on the first of next month.
