It is ruining production and reducing the working population to poverty, while concentrating wealth in the hands of speculators, usurers, and swindlers. nflation is an economic mechanism of the mass plunder of the people and the primary accumulation of capital. Recall, for example, how state enterprises were prohibited from establishing commercial banks under the guise of restricting commercial activity and were even forced to take out their shares after the banks had increased their starting capital many times over. And so they threw the pike into the river! No longer regulated, banks are growing rich on the usurious accumulation of capital. Every time that the need for regulating prices arises, the regulatory documents begin with provisions that benefit "liberalization." This is why the decrees on prices issued by the Cabinet of Ministers in December 1992 and in December 1993 led to sharp price rises. The banks and middleman dealers are making a fortune on inflation. As a result, they are pressing hard for the removal of anti-inflationary measures. The government is being subjected to harsh attacks in the mass media. The state is being reviled most harshly for regulating the currency exchange rate and instituting foreign trade controls. Any attempt to curb the all-permissive activity in this sphere is labelled as "antimarket." Despite the fact that both these forms of state regulation are applied now, and have been applied in the past, by many countries with market economies. Regulating the exchange rate of the national currency and foreign trade has a significant effect on the dynamics of domestic prices. The starting proportions for exchange of the currencies of different countries depends on the relations between the prices of goods that arrive as imports. Basically, the currency exchange rate should be such as to leave the seller indifferent in which currency he is paid for his goods. Thus, if the market price of a metric ton of oil is 100 dollars in one country and 10,000 rubles in another, the rate of exchange will be 100 rubles to the dollar. On the average, this ratio should be in effect for all goods. If you take the average correlation between U.S. and Ukrainian prices for a selection of 140 goods, the exchange rate (according to data for January 1993) should e 254 karbovantsi to the dollar. This is the real base proportion. Then why is the actual karbovanets exchange rate much lower: at the end of March, 40,000 karbovantsi to the dollar at banks and 43,000 on the black market? Because there is a growing, market-driven demand for the dollar. Market business fluctuations are natural in a normal situation and do not deviate very far from price parity. Central banks and states can do away with undesirable disparities by means of currency invervention, interest rates, and other economic measures. But if the market rate deviates very far from the parity described, it has an increasingly opposite effect on domestic prices. If the exchange rate of the national currency has fallen by a factor of 1.5 and the dollar costs 381 karbovantsi rather than 254, the price of all goods imported from abroad will increase by a factor of 1.5. If the government wants to lessen the effect of imports on domestic prices, it must act to stop the exchange rate of the national currency from dropping. When goods are scarce and production volumes drop, market conditions cause the exchange rate of the national currency to fall as a result of an increased demand for imports. With its clumsy (or perhaps deliberately inspired?) actions, the state can escalate the demand for imported goods and foreign currency. This has been precisely the effect of the internal convertibility introduced by the Kuchma-Pynzenyk government. Given the existing shortage of goods, it is causing the demand for foreign currency to grow. Should the government regard this play of exchange rates as inviolable if it wants to curb inflation? No, it should use every available means, including administrative measures, to halt the fall of the exchange rate of the national currency. In other words, it must regulate the exchange rate. To be sure, without disturbing the fundamental price parity and taking into account market conditions. A second important factor that sharply increases demand for foreign currency is the fact that it circulates in the form of cash. The owners of foreign currency do not suffer from inflation. Because it is more stable, demand for it is growing. As a result, the price of the national currency is falling at an accelerated rate. The dollarization of monetary circulation is another factor that contributes to inflation. In the year since the policy on foreign currency has been "liberalized" and the interbank currency exchange was opened, the rate at which the dollar is traded on the exchange has increased more than 90-fold (from 340 karbovantsi on 22 September 1992 to 31,150 karbovantsi on 5 November 1993). This has had a marked effect on the rise of prices. During this same period, enterprises raised prices 85-fold. The fact that the rate at which the currency exchange rate is falling exceeds the rate at which prices are rising indicates that the exchange rate is not dependent on price parity but the other way around. This being the case, the exchange rate is of an opportunistic, even speculative, nature. Russia raised the price of its energy supplies, setting itself the goal of bringing them up to world levels. The fall of the karbovanets exchange rate greatly intensified the effect of imported inflation. The steep jump in the exchange rate, which augurs catastrophe (from 5,970 to 19,050 karbovantsi to the dollar), occurred on 20 August 1993. In an attempt to neutralize this factor, the government and the National Bank of Ukraine established a fixed rate of exchange for the karbovanets. This was an inflexible decision that drew criticism. It was followed by the introduction of a regulated -- that is, deliberately fluctuating -- exchange rate, and the currency auctions were halted. Unfortunately, however, this measure designed to halt the continued fall of the exchange rate was not applied consistently. Instead of the interbank currency exchange, the commercial banks were permitted to trade in foreign currency. This created something like a decentralized exchange. The interests of exporting enterprises have been disregarded. They are obliged to sell half their export receipts at the official rate of exchange (12,610 karbovantsi), yet buy the currency they need to purchase raw materials, materials, and components at the bank rate of exchange (37,000-40,000 karbovantsi). When the Cabinet of Ministers was deliberating on the draft of the presidential decree, the recommendation was made to either establish individual quotas for enterprises for the sale of foreign currency (depending on the nature and structure of shipments of products under subcontracting arrangements), or sell hard currency to exporters at the same rate at which they had bought it. However, for some reason, there is no mention of this in the decree. The dual system of exchange rates creates losses for exporters and produces dissatisfaction among them. Some circles deliberately interpret this as dissatisfaction with the principle of state regulation of the exchange rate, even though this is not the case at all. Is this another mistake or a deliberate gap? I cannot state for certain, but I suspect that it is the worse of the two. In fact, it is not the regulation of the exchange rate that should be opposed, but the retention of two different rates (at least not for exporters). But it is precisely regulation that public opinion hotly opposes. Another inconsistency in the policy of regulating the exchange rate is the failure to make any attempt to put a stop to the circulation of foreign currency in Ukraine. The paramount task in the war against inflation is to use every available method to curb the rise of prices. The thing is that price increases are no longer the result of inflation and a feature of it, but the cause of rising inflation. The rise of prices increases costs, creates a shortage of working capital, and results in the chain of nonpayments. This leads to a decline and halt in production, which causes prices to climb even higher. Or it makes it necessary to supplement working capital with credits, which increase the money supply and also cause prices to rise. No matter what kind of anti-inflationary measures are applied, they are nullified by the momentum of price increases. That is why it is necessary to resort to direct administrative restrictions on price increases. Especially on the price of a specific commodity -- foreign convertible currency. The government has done precisely that. And it was right to do so. But this measure must be implemented in a comprehensive and consistent manner. Many countries resort to mandatory state regulation of foreign currency exchange rates. At present, 73 countries link the exchange rate of their own currencies to the exchange rate of one of the hard currencies, six rely on a flexible link using a number of indices (Ukraine could join this group), and eight countries regulate floating rates of exchange. As we can see, by far not all countries allow unregulated floating exchange rates. A country has to protect its economy. There needs to be a will to fight the crisis. If we indulge in theoretical whining, we will not overcome the problem. In all fairness, we have to admit that Yu. Zvyahilskyy is succeeding in curbing the rate of inflation by applying an aggregate of measures. In January, inflation measured 19 percent, in February, 13 percent. Estimates show that it should be down to nine percent in March as against 90 percent at the end of last year. And the regulation of the foreign exchange rate is a vital factor in this stabilization. Attacks on the egulation of currency exchange rates are organized by those who are living off inflation. This is an assault on the people by robbers. But the government, too, needs to correct the purchase and sale of foreign currency so as not to oppress exporters and not increase the demand for foreign currency.
