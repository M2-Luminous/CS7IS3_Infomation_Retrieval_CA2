Original reports are a specialty of Var deputy Arthur Paecht. Once again, the reporter for the National Assembly's Finance Committee has shaken the defense and aeronautics world by presenting a thorough and highly original report on "financing the European military transport plane," aka the FLA (future large aircraft) program. Besides providing a superb technical description of the project and its alternatives (see AIR & COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No 1447), the document analyzes the problems inherent in the program and, most important, offers original financial and industrial solutions to insure its success. The project is estimated to cost between 188 and 248 billion French francs [Fr] for 354 aircraft over 15 years. France alone, which reportedly has a 17.8 percent share in the program, will spend between Fr33.1 and 43.5 billion. Consequently, the difficulty of finding funds in the shrinking military budgets (see table) of most of our European partners threatens the program's credibility. Some of them -- such as Great Britain, which is tempted to go with the American C-130J -- are not fervent supporters of the FLA. Hence the recommendations in Arthur Paecht's report. The first proposal calls for drastic cuts in the cost of developing and mass manufacturing the European aircraft. The Var deputy has calculated that paring the cargo's specifications just slightly and optimizing the program's industrial organization would cut development costs 34.6 percent, to about Fr26 billion instead of Fr36 billion. This would also reduce the per unit "flyaway" cost 22 percent, to about Fr380 million. Suggested retrenchments include lowering operational specifications, by shortening the hold 2 meters (-4 percent) and slowing peak speed at low altitudes by 50 kt (-3 percent). Those two modifications would save about 12.6 percent. A different engine (propellor or THR instead of a jet) would trim 10 percent, and improved industrial organization another 12 percent. Many think the real key to the FLA program's success is an industrial or state organization that can insure good management. The Paecht report recommends "very lean and more efficient than usual state management," with "industrial management that is at least on par with Airbus's." It also recommends that "the aircraft's manufacturing design be based on the armed forces' stated needs, using an essentially economic approach." Such a strategy would involve a major shakeup in the way weapons programs are managed in France, and "could call into question the DGA's [General Weapons Delegation] role in this type of program." Thus, given the large number of participating countries (eight), the report recommends that Airbus Industrie or an ad hoc consortium modeled after it take the management lead. Moreover, to ensure tight technical control, the document talks about "a leadership team involving just two or three countries" and including a strong Franco-German axis. The other countries would be involved as manufacturing partners. The difficulty of the final problem -- how to scare up financing for the FLA -- has cast doubts on its future. The Germans have suggested that the companies provide the funds, which armed forces budgets can no longer do (unless those budgets are increased two percent or unless one or more weapons programs are eliminated). Arthur Paecht is asking governments to show more imagination. He has proposed original solutions that combine the use of corporate equity (backed by government purchase pledges), private capital, budget funds, and schemes analogous to the reimbursible loans of the civil construction industry. Another pervasive theme in the Paecht report is the program's industrial fallout in Europe and France. The construction of an estimated 300 to 350 aircraft is the financial and industrial equivalent of 500 Airbuses, and will create something like 20,000 industrial jobs in Europe over 15 years. "For France alone, about 4,000 jobs are at stake over the same period," the reporter calculates. Manufacture of the 1,500 engines -- not to mention the engineers and technicians needed to design the new model -- will create an equal number of positions over 10 years. When the FLA's estimated potential market of 700 aircraft is factored in, the number of highly-skilled jobs that are on the line is obvious. But more important, in the eyes of the reporter, than direct job creation is the FLA's capacity to keep the expertise of European design and engineering departments alive. Indeed, once the A330/340 programs are complete, those departments have little in the way of new projects for at least 10 years. Consequently, the FLA program "could prove vitally important to aeronautics industries." Finally, the report stresses the value of the program in fostering European defense collaboration. The FLA program fits perfectly within the framework of a joint European defense policy, consolidated by the WEU and the Franco-German Weapons Agency, for which it could serve as the impetus. The FLA is even described as an "emblematic" program, whose failure would signal the defeat of "any attempt to put together a European defense policy on weapons."
