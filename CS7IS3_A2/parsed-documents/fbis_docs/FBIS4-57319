Three veterans of the revolutionary struggle with ties to the agrarian sector -- Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, Jose Ramirez Cruz, and Conchita Fernandez -- today will receive the 17 May Order, the National Association of Small Farmers' [ANAP] top award, which is bestowed by the Council of State at the request of ANAP. The fact that to date only Commander in Chief Fidel Castro had received this order gives the presentation even greater importance, falling as it does on Peasants Day and the anniversary of the Agrarian Reform Law, especially since it is going to be presented during the closing session of the cooperative-peasant-scientific-technical meeting which began on 16 May at the Olo Pantojas Communist Party of Cuba School in Havana. On this occasion, 10 cooperative workers and farmers will receive the Romarico Cordero medal and the Antero Regalado award.
