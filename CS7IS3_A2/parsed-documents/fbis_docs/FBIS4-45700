Now, once again, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands are making a common cause to ban the sale of hazardous products - in this particular case creosote and chlorine-based solvents - while the other EU Member States are trying to find a compromise which will maintain the right of free movement for these products within the Union. Meanwhile, the ruling which the Court of Justice is expected to hand down in the next few weeks on the German ban on PCP [pentachlorophenol] is awaited with growing anxiety. In March, the European Commission put forward its amended proposal for a Directive "amending for the 13th time Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations." The new draft Directive basically aims to restrict sale and use of three types of substance which represent a health hazard to consumers: carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic substances, creosote and its derivatives and lastly solvents with a chlorine base. A first meeting of national experts within the Council of Ministers on the proposals has already taken place, but did not manage to settle all the problems, especially as regards creosote and its derivatives. These wood treatment products have a detrimental effect on human health and the environment, mainly due to the toxic ingredient BAP [benzyl-para-aminophenol]. The Commission has proposed limiting BAP in wood treatment in industrial installations to 500 ppm [parts per million], that is, about 0.05 percent. Denmark, however, wants nothing to do with setting limits on BAP. It simply wants to see a ban on sale and use of creosote. The stance of Germany and the Netherlands is rather less extreme: these two Member States are calling for a ban on creosote sales to the public at large. For treating wood within industrial installations, they are prepared to go along with a ceiling on BAP, but much lower than the Commission's proposal, at 50ppm, or 0.005 percent, and are demanding an even lower ceiling, at 5ppm BAP, for wood treatment in general. Whatever the case, Germany is calling for a total ban on BAP in tar-oil. The Dutch have given to understand that they see a reduction in BAP limits as a vital issue, given that their country makes massive use of treated wood in its canal and inland waterway installations. The Dutch are set to vote against the Directive if the ceiling is not brought down to the lower levels they recommend, and in any case have made it clear that if their concerns are not heeded they will invoke Article 100a 4 of the Maastricht Treaty, following the example set by Germany for PCP, which allows for derogations to the principle of free movement set in Article 100a on the grounds of environmental protection. This question, which is of prime importance for the future of free movement, and environmental protection within the European Union, is currently before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The Advocate-General has already given his Opinion, in January, on the individual case where the Commission authorised Germany to impose a ban on PCP, following notification procedures laid down in Article 100a4. He did not, however, pronounce on the underlying legal principle. Meanwhile, industrial circles waiting to see how much weight the European Court will give to environmental protection, which has the status of a mere ancillary policy area, as against the principle of free movement, which is one of the basic principles of the European Union. On the other side of the fence, the Greeks, French and Spanish, together with the UK and the Commission, are against any restrictions on free movement, and are taking up a stance diametrically opposed to that of the "Northern" bloc. As regards chlorine-based solvents (which have carcinogenic properties), the Commission is proposing a ban, except in the case of three substances for which substitutes are not readily available - methyl chlorate, perchlorethylene and trichloroethylene. But the same scenario presents itself here, with Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands calling for an outright ban, while the other Member States are prepared to go along with the Commission, which has undertaken to table proposals on these three substances within three years.
