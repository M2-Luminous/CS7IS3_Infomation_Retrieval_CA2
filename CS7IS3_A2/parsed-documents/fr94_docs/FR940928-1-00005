FR940928-1-00005 FR940928-1-00002 14 CFR Part 91 [Docket No. 26242, Notice No. 94&hyph;28A] RIN 2120&hyph;AF30 Suspension of Certain Aircraft Operations From the Transponder With Automatic Pressure Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM); extension of comment period. SUMMARY: This notice announces an extension of the comment period for Notice 94&hyph;28, ``Suspension of Certain Aircraft Operations From the Transponder With Automatic Pressure Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement'' (59 FR 43994; August 25, 1994). This comment period is extended from October 11, 1994 to November 25, 1994. The extension responds to a request from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) to allow additional time for specific comments responsive to Notice No. 94&hyph;28. DATES: The comment period is being extended from October 11, 1994 to November 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: As stated in Notice No. 94&hyph;28, comments should be mailed in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;200), Airspace Docket No. 26242, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington DC 20591. The official docket may be examined in the Rules Docket, Office of the Chief Counsel, Room 916, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington DC, weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Ellen Crum, Air Traffic Rules Branch (ATP&hyph;230), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;8783. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 25, 1994, the FAA published Notice No. 94&hyph;28, ``Suspension of Certain Aircraft Operations From the Transponder With Automatic Pressure Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement.'' This notice invites comments on issues related to the reinstatement and modification of the expired Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 62, which suspended certain provisions of the regulations that require the installation of use of automatic altitude reporting (Mode C) transponders. Because the comment period originally established in Notice 94&hyph;28 would not provide sufficient time for AOPA to notify its members before the close of the comment period, AOPA forwarded a written request to the FAA for a 45-day extension of the comment period. This extension would provide the required 45-day lead time for AOPA to publish this information in its magazine and provide sufficient time for the submission of meaningful comments from its members. In order to give all interested persons additional time to be notified of the issues, and submit their specific comments, the FAA finds that it is in the public interest to extend the comment period. Accordingly, the comment period for Notice No. 94&hyph;28 is extended to November 25, 1994. Issued in Washington, DC on September 23, 1994. Harold W. Becker, Manager, Airspace Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules & Procedures Service.
