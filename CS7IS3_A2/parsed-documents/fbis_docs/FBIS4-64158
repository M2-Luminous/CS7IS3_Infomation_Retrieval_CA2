The lawmakers resumed discussing the statement "on governmental policies," which was earlier submitted by a group of 42 deputies, at the morning plenary session. The statement has been discussed by the lawmakers to no avail for a week, because many of them opposed the extremely sharp criticisms of the cabinet contained in the statement. Today, however, majority of lawmakers (96 out of 177) came out in favour of the statement, the wording of which has been finalized by the parliamentary committees. First, leaders of the parliamentary committees, leaders of the four political factions which were legalized yesterday, and several legislators, who had signed the statement, took the floor. Next, a coordinating editing commission was formed to finalize the wording of the statement. It brought together representatives of all committees, factions and the initiators' group. Deputy parliament speaker Marat Ospanov chaired the commission. At the evening plenary session, the legislators gave a vote of no confidence to the socio-economic and legal policies of the government.
