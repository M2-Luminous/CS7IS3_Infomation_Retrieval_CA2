ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is revising it's approved State Public Water Supervision Primacy Program. Massachusetts has adopted (1) drinking water regulations for controlling lead and copper in drinking water that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for controlling lead and copper in drinking water requirements promulgated on June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26460). EPA has determined that the State program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations. Therefore, EPA has tentatively decided to approve these State program revisions. All interested parties are invited to request a public hearing. A request for a public hearing must be submitted by May 31, 1994 to the Regional Administrator at the address shown below. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. However, if a substantial request for a public hearing is made by May 31, 1994, a public hearing will be held. If no timely and appropriate request for a hearing is received and the Regional Administrator does not elect to hold a hearing on his own motion, this determination shall become effective May 31, 1994. Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual, organization or other entity requesting a hearing. (2) A brief statement of the requesting person's interest in the Regional Administrator's determination and of information that the requesting person intended to submit at such hearing.
