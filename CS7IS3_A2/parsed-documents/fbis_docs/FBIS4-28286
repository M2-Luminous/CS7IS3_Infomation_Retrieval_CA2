FBIS4-28286 "dreas111_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 North Korea Kim Yong-sam Group Leading Situation to `War' Kim Yong-sam Group Leading Situation to `War' SK0906103694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1023 GMT 9 Jun 94 SK0906103694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Ill-boding Move" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Puppet Prime Minister of South Korea Yi Yong-tok made "a check-up of emergency duty posture" of "major organs" and the director of the puppet police agency instructed police to "intensify the alert posture" against the North. The U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea staged "an evacuation exercise" to test "prompt departure preparations" of U.S. troops and their families in case of emergency. NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today says that such row can be seen only on the eve of a war and it suggests that the Kim Yong-sam group is leading the situation of the Korean peninsula nearer to the threshold of war in league with the outside forces. We urged a stop to such a criminal act as turning the country into a nuclear war theatre of foreign forces, warning the Kim Yong-sam group more than once that "sanctions" sought by the imperialists under the pretext of fictitious "nuclear suspicion" against the North mean a war and there is no mercy in a war, the analyst says, and continues: But the South Korean puppets, ignoring our warnings, are bringing clouds of a nuclear war by showing extra zeal in imposing "sanctions" on fellow countrymen. The "doctrine of inevitability of sanctions" peddled by the puppets is a doctrine of inevitability of war. The puppets must know that their provocative war move against the North may cause irrevocably grave consequences. We want peace, not war. But we will never allow anyone to provoke us.
