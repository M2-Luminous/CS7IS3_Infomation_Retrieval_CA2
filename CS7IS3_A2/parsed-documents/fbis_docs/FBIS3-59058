Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel addresses the three great goals of arms export policy and discusses the specific problems of arms exports that make efforts at harmonizing by the countries concerned so complicated: "German arms export policy has to fit in with German foreign and security policy, which aims at securing peace. This corresponds to values that have been firmly anchored in our country, throughout all political parties, ever since our constitution was proclaimed. "We do not want to, and we will not give up this all-party consensus on our restrictive export policy principles of 1982. "The Federal Government pursues three great objectives in its arms export policy: - "safeguarding national and European security interests; - "taking into account the justified interests of industry; - "preventing an unrestrained spread of mass destruction weapons, but also of conventional arms. "On the other hand, I am well aware of the economic problems this involves for a highly specialized industry in our country. The answer to these problems -- which are not restricted to Germany -- cannot be an export offensive for weapons. But we also need industrial capacities that guarantee our ability to defend ourselves, to form alliances and to cooperate within the alliance -- also as a basis for codetermination and influence. This means that German industry must remain able to cooperate in these areas. We want to contribute to this -- by simplifying procedures." [passage omitted]
