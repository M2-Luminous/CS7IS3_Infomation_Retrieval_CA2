However, leaders of the ruling coalition, attending the session without Hosokawa, said they have agreed in principle to form a new government within one week and pick a new leader. Hosokawa refused to predict who will be his successor, saying that it is imprudent to name the next premier, or even to take part in discussions to name him. Meanwhile, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, is widely viewed here as the most possible successor to Hosokawa. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party, who governed for nearly four decades until they were toppled by Hosokawa's coalition last year, were trying to determine if the unexpected turn of events would give them a chance to again seize control. There has also been speculation that former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe could defect from the Liberal Democrats, bringing his faction into the coalition and making a bid for its leadership and thus the prime ministership. Hosokawa, the 56-year-old prime minister who took office last August, stepped down amid mounting pressure over alleged past financial improprieties. Debate over the scandal has blocked parliamentary business for the past month, halting work on the budget for this fiscal year and other issues. During his eight-month term as premier, Hosokawa achieved political reform and helped conclude the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, he has yet not finished such jobs as tax and pension reforms, decentralization and greater transparency of government operations.
