The central government has set the growth rate of China's national economy in 1994 at nine percent, he said. In his 16,000-word report on government work he delivered today at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), the premier called for a good handling of relations among reform, economic development and social stability. Li's government work report consists of seven parts. They are: a review of 1993 domestic work and basic principles for work in 1994; maintaining a steady, rapid and sound development of the national economy; speeding up the establishment of a socialist market economy; expanding scientific and technological undertakings and promoting education and culture; strengthening socialist democracy and the legal system; actively promoting the peaceful reunification of China; and diplomatic work. The government work report devotes two-fifths of its length to economic work and reform in 1994. On economic work in 1994, according to Li Peng, the government will: deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, strengthen and improve macroeconomic controls, restructure the economy, promote technological progress, explore new markets, improve economic efficiency, keep inflation under control, and maintain a sustainable, rapid and [word indistinct] of the economy. Li Peng said that the planned 1994 growth rate of nine percent for the national economy is realistic given the fact that the country has seen a growth rate of 13 percent in the past two consecutive years. The premier reiterated the fundamental status of agriculture in the economy. He called for continued implementation of existing rural policies, deepening rural reform, solving problems that arise in the process of rural economic development, and trying every means possible to boost the income of farmers. Li emphasized the importance of improving transport and manufacturing industries, especially in terms of the management and production of large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, saying this is of vital importance for a sustained development of the national economy. Noting that some large- and medium-sized state enterprises have a rough time nowadays, Li called for all social quarters to take positive measures to help them solve their problems. Li stressed that investment should be maintained at a rational scale, urging all localities and government departments to devote their funds and materials preferentially to key projects now under construction in the sectors of transportation, telecommunications, energy, essential raw materials and the harnessing of large rivers and lakes. He said that the government encourages coastal areas to invest in central and western parts of the country. To rein in the investment scale, the premier said, the central government will not approve the establishment of any new economic development zones in 1994. On the country's open policy, Li said that attention should be paid to making existing open areas perform better, which include special economic zones, Shanghai's Pudong, open coastal cities and regions, and economic and technological development zones. Major cities along the country's borders, along the Chang Jiang River and in the country's hinterland should be opened wider to the rest of the world, he said. The premier in his report expounded China's reform measures in 1994, which have attracted wide attention at home and abroad. Li called the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) "a common program of action for continued in-depth reforms," which he said has served as an overall blueprint for the establishment of a socialist market economy in China. This year's reform, which will combine breakthroughs in key areas with overall progress, is expected to score substantial progress in restructuring the economy, he said. The government report dwells on taxation and finance reform, establishment of a modern enterprise system, rationalization of price relations and reform of the government structure. Talking about financial difficulties faced by the government, Li said that deficit of the central government will be made up by issuing bonds instead of overdrawing on the bank again; the central bank will regulate money supply and stabilize the value of the yuan; and the government will keep inflation for the whole of 1994 under ten percent. Li said that science and technology should be integrated closely with the economy and that reform of the education system should be accelerated with more fund to be put into education. He urged people to develop socialist culture and pay more attention to the social benefits and consequences of cultural products than to their economic returns. New achievements should be made in developing socialist democracy and strengthening the legal system so as to ensure a smooth progression of economic reform, a healthy economic development and an all-round social progress, he said. Li said that the most important task for public security, procuratorial and judicial organs this year is to maintain public order. He said that the government will continue to crack down on crimes and social evils. Fights against special types of crime will be combined with anti-crime campaigns, he said. The last two parts of Li's government work report deal with the principles of peaceful reunification of China and "one country, two systems," and China's independent diplomatic policy of peace.
