FR940513-0-00125 FR940513-0-00033 50 CFR Parts 672 and 675 [Docket No. 940225&hyph;4025; I.D. 050694F] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska, Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Emergency interim rule; extension of effective date. SUMMARY: An emergency rule is in effect through May 11, 1994, that: Revises regulations applicable to the management and monitoring of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) halibut bycatch limit established for trawl gear fisheries, revises directed fishing standards, and adjusts the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) flatfish seasons to provide for additional fishing opportunities in the BSAI early in the fishing year. NMFS is extending the portions of the emergency rule addressing the management of the GOA halibut trawl bycatch limit and directed fishing standards for an additional 90-day period (through August 9, 1994) to prevent overfishing of GOA thornyhead rockfish and Pacific ocean perch (POP) and to limit unnecessarily high bycatch amounts of these rockfish species and Pacific halibut in the trawl fisheries in a manner that will reduce the likelihood of premature fishery closures. This action is intended to further the goals and objectives contained in the fishery management plans for the groundfish fisheries off Alaska. EFFECTIVE DATES: The interim regulations published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6222), are extended from May 12, 1994, through August 9, 1994, except for amendments to §675.23, which are effective through May 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan J. Salveson, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 7, 1994, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) implemented an emergency interim rule (59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1855(c)) (Magnuson Act). The emergency rule implemented the following measures for a 90-day period (through May 11, 1994). A. Establishment of two GOA trawl fishery categories for purposes of apportioning the GOA halibut bycatch limit established for the trawl gear fisheries (§672.20(f)). These two categories are: (1) The shallow water fishery complex (the Alaska pollock, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel, shallow water flatfish, flathead sole, and ``other species'' trawl fisheries), and (2) the deep water fishery complex (the deepwater flatfish, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, and rockfish trawl fisheries). B. Revision of the method for calculating retainable amounts of groundfish species under directed fishing standards (§672.20 (h) and (i)). Revised methods prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder or groundfish species closed to directed fishing as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing. C. Adjustment of the opening date for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 20. As a result of this season adjustment, directed fishing standards governing retainable amounts of flatfish species at §675.20(h)(2) also were revised. NMFS has published a proposed rule for public review and comment (59 FR 23044, May 4, 1994) that would implement permanently the management measures implemented under the emergency rule. Pending approval by the Secretary, a final rule implementing these measures likely would not be effective before September 1994. With the exception of the interim adjustment of the BSAI flatfish fisheries, the conditions justifying the emergency action remain unchanged and warrant extension of the emergency rule until Secretarial action is taken on the proposed rule and the measures are implemented through a final rule. Under the emergency rule, regulations set out at §675.23 were amended to change the opening date of the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 20. This interim provision no longer is necessary to allow a BSAI flatfish fishery early in 1994. Therefore, with the exception of the portion of the emergency rule addressing the season change for the BSAI flatfish fisheries (§675.23), the Secretary, with the agreement of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, extends the effectiveness of the emergency rule for an additional 90 days under section 305(c)(3)(B) of the Magnuson Act. Details concerning the basis for this action and the classification of the rulemaking are contained in the initial emergency rule and are not repeated here. Dated: May 10, 1994.
