Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that this visit will be a good opportunity to confer with Syrian officials. He emphasized that current important developments make such exchanges of views necessary. 'Abd-al-Majid said he met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown yesterday, Thursday, and discussed with him several issues connected with the peace process, regional economic cooperation, and the Arab boycott of Israel. Asked if agreement was reached during his meeting with the U.S. commerce secretary to end this boycott, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid announced that the direct boycott will not be ended because the reasons for it still exist. He said he hoped these factors will soon disappear. He added that what happened was that the U.S. secretary of commerce asked him to consider the possibility of terminating the indirect Arab boycott of Israel in view of its effect on a large number of U.S. companies which are being boycotted by the Arab countries because they deal with Israel.
