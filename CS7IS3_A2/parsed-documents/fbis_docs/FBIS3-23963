Bobkov, RF VTsUZh director, and A. Razumov, RF VTsUZh deputy director: "Standard of Living for Russia and Its Regions"] [Text] The problem of the standard of living under conditions of radical transformations is at the center of society's attention. In complex scientific studies by the All-Russian Center for the Standard of Living [VTsUZh] under the Russian Federation [RF] Ministry of Labor, official statistics based on data from the RF Goskomstat (State Committee for Statistics) have been used along with the VTsUZh's own calculations, which are based on original methods that make it possible to obtain comparative estimates of the level and dynamics of real incomes and personal consumption for Russia's regions. The VTsUZh is also conducting selective sociological research among the population in order to determine the connections between the level of material provision of the members of the families studied, on the one hand, and their status (employment, behavioral motivation, and so on) in the labor market, on the other. The standard of living represents the degree of development and satisfaction of needs for the individual living in a society. In accordance with Article 25 of the ILO Convention "On the Basic Goals and Norms of Social Policy" No. 117, an individual has the right to the standard of living, including food, clothing, housing, medical care, and social services, necessary to maintain his own health and well-being and that of his family, as well as the right to provision in the event of unemployment, disability, widowhood, or other instance of the loss of the funds for existence due to circumstances beyond his control. According to a U.N. recommendation, the standard of living is measured by a system of indicators characterizing health, consumption level, employment, education, housing, and social provision. The most general measure of a population's standard of living is its real income as a monetary measure of all goods received in the course of a given period on a per capita basis. With inflationary processes, the necessity arises to assess these incomes, and above all salary, according to their purchasing capacity, i.e., corrected for the price index. Real monetary income for the Russian population at the end of 1992 was 96.4 rubles [R] (in 1983 prices) per capita per month. Analysis of the dynamics of real monetary income for Russia as a whole for the period 1992 to July 1993 attests to their vacillating nature due to the time lag between the dynamic of monetary income for the population and the dynamic of prices. According to our calculations, real monetary income for the Russian Federation in the third quarter of 1993 was less than two-fifths of what it was in the fourth quarter of 1991. One reason for this level of real monetary income lies in the fact that minimum levels for wages, pensions, stipends, subsidies, and other social outlays have been reviewed quarterly, resulting in a substantial lag behind price rises. With the increase in inflation, this has led to a growth in poverty. We see an obvious rift between the tendency of prices to approach the world level and the relative devaluation of Russian manpower. The lack of development of the labor market and the absence of objective price setting, including for manpower, encourage a specific and growing portion of the population to engage in activities in economically and socially ineffective spheres (the shadow economy, speculation, resale, and so forth). New strata of the population are being formed, including entrepreneurs, with high and super-high monetary incomes. On the other hand, the portion of the population doomed to poverty or at best to a low material sufficiency is mounting. The extremely difficult situation with real monetary incomes is partially alleviated by in-kind incomes and free services. At the present stage of the reforms, incomes are growing as a result of people holding more than one job or working private plots, as well as engaging in individual activity. From 1985 to 1992, gross output from private plots increased in comparable 1983 prices by a factor of 1.4, and their proportionate share in gross output for all of Russia's agricultural output for the same period increased by 23-33 percent. For the most part, free state services for health care, education, and housing have been maintained. Taking into consideration both the fact that the population obtains some of its goods as a hedge against future higher prices, and nonmonetary income, real income for the population as a whole in recent years declined from R138 per capita per month in 1991 on average by a factor of about 1.5, a decline that affected primarily the less well-off part of the population. The decline in real income has been expressed in the fact that in 1992 the population began to consume the most important food products and to buy nonfood goods to a significantly lesser extent than in 1990: consumption of meat and meat products fell from 68 kg to 58 kg per year; meat and dairy products from 386 kg to 295 kg; eggs from 296 to 256; sugar from 47.2 kg to 33.6 kg; vegetable oil from 10.0 kg to 6.5 kg; vegetables, melons, and gourds from 89 kg to 83 kg; and fruits and berries from 35 kg to 33 kg. Only the consumption of potatoes and grain products rose slightly, reaching 119 kg and 122 kg per capita per year, respectively. Fabric consumption for this period fell from 39.14 to 22.0 square meters, and shoes from 3.27 to 2.16 pairs per capita per year. At the present time, what is advancing ever more sharply to the fore is the task of studying the influence of the transition to a market economy on the standard of living in the various territory-subjects of the Russian Federation and the possibilities of comparing individual regions for standard of living achieved and its dynamic. In order to address this task, the VTsUZh is monitoring incomes and consumption for the regions of the RF. The dynamic of real incomes and personal consumption differs substantially for individual regions. These indicators are dropping most quickly in the Severo-Kavkazskiy and Tsentralnyi and Severo-Zapadnyi regions. Matters are slightly better in the Tsentralno-Chernozemnyy and Povolzhskiy regions, where the level of self-provision of consumer goods has always been relatively high, as well as in the Uralskiy and Volgo-Vyatskiy regions, that is, the regions where defense complex branches are concentrated and where the level of consumption is being supported by the state at the present time. The Tsentralnyy region has ceded first place for level of per capita consumption to the Dalnevostochnyy region. The average Russian level of per capita consumption for the Povolzhskiy and Severnyy regions has begun to rise tangibly. Meanwhile, the Zapadno-Sibirskiy and Vostochno-Sibirskiy regions, where previously the per capita consumption corresponded more or less to the average Russian level, have begun to lag behind it. We think that the subjects of the Russian Federation as well as the central economic organs would be interested in obtaining and utilizing this information in order to develop and fine-tune their own measures for implementing the social policy being carried out on the territorial level. To assess citizens' standard of living, the concept of a "minimum consumption budget" (MPB) is used. The MPB is calculated to provide for the full satisfaction of a person's reasonable requirements. The BPM (minimum subsistence budget) ensures the basic conditions for life at this stage in society's development so as to maintain both people's ability to work and their health. The BPM envisages average per capita consumption as follows: grain products 130.8 kg per year; potatoes 124.2; vegetables 94.0; fruits and berries 19.4; sugar 20.7, meat products 26.6, fish products 11.7; dairy products 212.4; vegetable oil and margarine 10 kg per year; and 151 eggs. The food basket used in calculating the subsistence minimum was developed by specialists at the Nutrition Institute of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. In accordance with their recommendations, the daily caloric value of foods included in the BPM comprises at least 2720.4 calories for working-age men, 2138.4 calories for working-age women, 1976.6 calories for pensioners, 1581.6 calories for children under 6 years of age, and 2385.6 calories for youths ages 7-15, or 2236.7 calories on average. The food basket underwent expert analysis in the World Health Organization and received a positive evaluation. The structure of the BPM includes, apart from expenditures for food, expenditures for nonfood goods, services, taxes, and other mandatory outlays. The minimum subsistence level varies according to regional characteristics in its monetary expression as well. Thus, its highest amount was in the Dalnevostochnyy region (R58,237 in October 1993), in Khanta-Mansiyskiy Autonomous Okrug (R87,244), and in Amurskaya Oblast (R69,126); its lowest was in the Tsentralno-Chernozemnyy regions of Russia (R18,864), the Republic of Tatarstan (R15,815), the Republic of Karelia (R10,970), and Rostovskaya Oblast (R17,123). If we compare conditions of current minimum-level consumption in October and with July, we discover the following tendencies. The minimum cost of life declined in comparison with the average Russian level in the Severo-Zapadnyy, Volgo-Vyatskiy, Tsentralno-Chernozemnyy, Povolzhskiy, and Uralskiy regions. It increased, and quite noticeably, in the Vostochno-Sibirskiy, Zapadno-Sibirskiy, and Dalnevostochnyy regions. In the remaining areas the correlation between the monetary assessment of minimum requirements and the average Russian level remained virtually unchanged. Contemporary reforms have significantly intensified the differentiation in the population by level of income and consumption. Usually for these indicators the 10 percent worst-off and best-off portions of the population are compared. According to data from budgetary research, in October 1993, the average level of monetary per capita income among the 10 percent best-off exceeded the corresponding level among the 10 percent worst-off by a factor of 6. Within a year, the degree of differentiation had nearly doubled. In October 1993, the share of income among the 10 percent best-off in the total income fund comprised 19.3 percent, whereas the share of the 10 percent worst-off in the total income fund comprised 3.2 percent. The data cited above must be evaluated critically, since budgetary statistics do not reflect sufficiently fully all strata of the population. The most well-provided, rich families get left out and thus the proportion of poor in the total numbers is greatly exaggerated. The VTsUZh differentiates the population by level of income and consumption in relation to consumption budgets. It has distinguished five population groups with various levels of material provision: --group I are the "poor" families, whose per capita income is less than or equal to the cost assessment of the minimum subsistence budget; --group II are the "low-income" families, whose per capita income falls between the cost assessment of the minimum subsistence budget and the cost assessment of the minimum consumption budget; --group III are the "middle-income" families, whose per capita income falls between the cost assessment of one and two MPBs (or varies around the average budget); --group IV are the "well-off" families, whose per capita income falls between double the MPB (or the average budget) and the per capita income level (or reasonable consumption budget) that conventionally characterizes "rich" families; and --group V are the "rich" families, whose per capita income is higher than the income conventionally characterizing "rich" families (or the reasonable consumption budget) and is defined by differentiated budgets (as of July 1993 this was accepted as being over R150,000 per family member). According to data from selective research, in July of this year, poor families made up 32 percent of the population, low-income 41 percent, middle-income 20 percent, well-off 5.5 percent, and 1.5 percent of the population lived in rich families. Special research indicates that the breaking down into extreme groups for per capita income levels is mounting at an increasing rate. In 1993, the incomes of "rich" families (group V) exceeded the per capita incomes of poor families (group I) by a factor of as much as 30. In world practice, the proportion of income used for food in the family budget is used as a general indicator for standard of living: the lower this proportion, the higher the standard of living. Selective research by the VTsUZh indicates that in the middle of this year for the 14 percent worst-off in the population, the share of expenditures for food in the budgets of their families was over 83.1 percent, for 31 percent 67.1-81.3 percent, for 34 percent 44.1-67.0 percent, and for 14 percent 23.0-44.0 percent. For the 8 percent best-off, the proportionate weight of expenses for food in families' budgets came to less than 23 percent. As analysis indicates, the poor include the greatest degree of broken families. Families with many children find themselves in the most difficult material position, up to 60 percent of them being concentrated in group I. Refugees and migrants, up to three quarters of whom fall into the category of poor families, are in an especially difficult situation. The level of family income rises in direct proportion to how much of that income is in the form of wages. The highest level and proportionate weight of wages in rich families is determined by additional employment. In these families, income from cooperative enterprises and from other labor activity comprises up to 30 percent of all sources of income, or about 30 times more than the corresponding income in poor families. Poor families are characterized by a higher proportion of income in the form of pensions, subsidies, and stipends. The proportionate weight of these incomes nonetheless declined in poor families by comparison with the initial period of reform in 1992. Among the poor able-bodied population, the proportionate weight of those working in state and municipal enterprises is approximately twice as high. At the same time, up to 40 percent of all those working from the rich income group work in individual (family) and private enterprises, while among the poor able-bodied population this indicator is 20 times or more lower. Among the rich, income from shares and other forms of property (other than private plots) reaches up to 10 percent of the total volume of income, while among the poor this income does not exceed 1.5 percent. As income rises, the commercial orientation of the private plot is increasingly manifested. If in poor families the overwhelming mass of output is used for personal consumption, in well-off and rich families up to 50 percent of all net output from private plots is sold. Poor families have been most affected by unemployment. Analysis indicates that up to half of those individuals who are able-bodied and who receive an unemployment subsidy are concentrated in poor families. Among poor families, the proportionate weight of the non-able-bodied is significantly higher than among rich families. According to VTsUZh assessments, at present more than two-fifths of the members of poor families are children or individuals older than working age. In rich families these social-demographic groups comprise about one-sixth. In several regions up to 40 percent and more of all children live in poor families. Among the dependents in these families, mothers raising young children are represented significantly more often than in others. In social programs to support the standard of living, it obviously makes sense to separate out the following blocs: --measures to provide guarantees to all population groups and strata (minimum social norms: salaries, pensions, stipends, other social payments, taking into consideration socioeconomic conditions in the regions; ecological conditions of survival, safety, and others); --measures for the social support of the able-bodied population (above all, the creation of conditions for the independent resolution of the problem of raising their families' standard of living); --measures for targeted social protection of the non-able-bodied population, measures to protect citizens who find themselves in difficult life situations, and marginal population groups; as well as resource, information, and organizational provision for the program. Such a structure for this type of social program makes it possible to isolate the most severe social problems, to lend a systematic nature to all envisaged measures, and to take into account specific local features. As a result, we can expect an increase in the efficiency of social policy and the approach of a turning point for inauspicious tendencies in the socioeconomic status of Russia's population.
