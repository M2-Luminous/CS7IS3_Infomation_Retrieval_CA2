The agreement was signed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic at a ceremony presided over by President Bill Clinton. "The agreement signed today offer one of the first clear signals that parties to this conflict are willing to end the violence and begin a process of reconstruction," said Clinton. But the accord was signed with the absence of the Serbs, who control 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Clinton said that he hoped "the Serbs will join in this process toward peace as well." Earlier, the two sides signed a proposed constitution of the federation and initiated the principles of confederation between the two republics.
