According to the reports, all other mainland hijackers are still under trial and they are prohibited to apply for permanent stay in Taiwan. Since the first mainland airliner was hijacked to Taiwan this year, the Taiwan public has showed deep concern, saying that all hijackers should be repatriated to the mainland and those who employed violent and coercive and other means to hijack aircraft should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without probation in accordance with relevant regulations. On December 18 this year, a vice-chairman of the "Mainland Affairs Council" of Taiwan had expressed the view that all 12 hijackers staying in Taiwan would be repatriated if the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits from the mainland and the Straits Exchange Foundation from Taiwan reached an agreement on this issue. It is also reported that Gao Jun, who hijacked a Chinese mainland airliner to Taiwan on December 8 this year, had attempted to kill himself on early December 23 in a jail. Local reports said he has been in low spirits there.
