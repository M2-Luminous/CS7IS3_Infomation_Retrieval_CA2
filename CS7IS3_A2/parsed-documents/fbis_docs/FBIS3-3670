Under a four-level supervisory and report-back system, thousands of agencies will be created within all levels of administrations to enforce labour laws and regulations. The agencies will be set up within counties, cities with prefecture status, provinces and central government. The move is the latest effort by the state to help build a healthy labour market while protecting the legal rights of workers, according to the Labour Ministry. Lawmakers at the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] have reported many cases of labour rights abuses. They have also expressed discontent over the labour ministry's apparent inability to act on these cases. In a written report, the ministry said the authorities were to launch a nationwide campaign to check the widespread violation of labour regulations by employers at the township [as published] and at privately-run and foreign-funded firms. The ministry said it would mobilise workers to report abuses. Labour sources said the Labour Ministry, anticipating the labour-related concerns of NPC delegates, only worked out these measures late last month. The ministry has issued an urgent notice to labour departments across the country, directing the four levels of the government to set up labour agencies that would form a national network to oversee labour issues. The ministry also urged local agencies to set up hotlines, letter boxes and information offices to receive complaints on labour rights abuses. The notice said the labour departments should publicly campaign to inform the workers about their rights and the government services available to them. The ministry has also assured workers they would have a freer hand in dealing with their employers, especially in negotiating for collective bargaining agreements. Such rights would be enshrined in the country's first labour law. Under the proposed law, for the first time, trades unions would be allowed to deal with employers on behalf of their members on matters of salary, working conditions, welfare and other concerns. And, also for the first time in China, the law gives employers the right to get rid of staff to cut losses, subject to approval by trades unions or the majority of the employees. The ministry's report said the labour law was aimed at maintaining harmony between employers and their workers in a socialist market economy while preventing abuses of labour rights.
