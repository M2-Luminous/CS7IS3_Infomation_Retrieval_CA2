Only the last of these problems seemed more or less significant, because establishing the lower limit for a deputy group's strength may give "Russia's Choice" extra advantages in the future: It is this faction that has so far managed to win over more deputies elected in majority districts as "independents" than anyone else. With the emergence of a number of groups "Russia's Choice" may see its replicas of sorts appear in parliament -- each of them with the rights of a full-blown party faction regarding a guaranteed representation in the State Duma's ruling bodies, the right to be given the floor in discussions, and so forth. A multistage voting procedure finally enabled the Duma to set the minimum number at 35 people. To make this decision, however, took nearly six hours of painful efforts (including two hours of consultations during the lunch break), when the State Duma posed as an entirely unprecedented farcical show both comical and absurd in nature. This came as no surprise to anyone, though. On the contrary, we should rather say that our preliminary expectations and suspicions were strikingly confirmed: Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] leader Zhirinovskiy was indeed obnoxiously scandalous and the deputy corps' doyen, Georgiy Lukava, who was elected on the LDPR ticket, actually appeared as a barely sane personality. Sprinkling his speech with thoughtful absurdities, like "developing the potential at the level of a factor" or "bringing addresses within the framework of collaboration," Mr. Lukava easily and quickly brought the Duma to a scandal bordering on collective hysterics with disorderly shouts into the microphone and a threateningly multitudinous babel in front of the presidium (where deputy Shabad was noticed a number of times). In the end, 190 deputies, threatening to refuse to register and to boycott the meeting, demanded that Lukava be relieved of the unbearable burden of chairmanship, because the Constitution calls for the first meeting only "to be opened" by the oldest deputy, not to be steered further. Mr. Zhirinovskiy, overstraining his voice, guided his subordinate from the audience, and in one moment demanded that "an order be given to switch off all microphones, to call security to protect those on the podium, and to continue the voting without any discussions." Mr. Lukava was willing to hand over his powers only to Anatoliy Ivanovich Lukyanov in person. In the end, the Duma managed to cut Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his comrades down to size. From now on, meetings will be chaired by members of the Council of Elders. The Duma took a timeout for forming factions until noon, 13 January. Aleksandr Kotenkov appears to have summed up the results of the first day of deliberations in the best possible way: "This brouhaha is unbearable. It cannot last for long. And it won't..."
