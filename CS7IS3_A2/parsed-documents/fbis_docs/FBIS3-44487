This is a major move by the CMC and the general departments for intensifying the army building of the grass-roots units in order to suit the new situation of establishing a socialist market economic structure and to meeting the demands of the Army's modernization. The leading CMC cadres take the building of the grass-roots units seriously. After the 14th National Party Congress, the CMC explicitly pointed out: In order to meet the requirements of the new situation, it is necessary to revise the "Outline" so as to raise the building of the grass-roots units to a new level. In line with the CMC instructions, the three general departments have conducted substantial work in investigation and demonstration and have fully heeded and assimilated opinions from various quarters. The revised "Outline" takes Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new period as guidance.It takes Chairman Jiang Zemin's overall requirement of being "qualified politically, proficient militarily, fine in style, strict in discipline, and adequate in maintenance and supplies" as a foundation; and the enhancement of the Army's combat capacity as the fundamental purpose to fully reflect the instructions and guidelines of the CMC and the 14th National Party Congress.It inherits and develops the fine tradition of our Army, maintains the strong points of the original "Outline," and sums up and absorbs the fresh experiences in army building at the grass-roots levels over the last few years. As a basic norm and foundation for the building, the revised "Outline" definitely standardizes its criteria, principal tasks, methods of examination and appraisal through comparison, as well as principal duties and requirements of organs at various levels which are responsible for the grass-roots units. The promulgation and trial implementation of the "Outline" will provide a more definite direction, clearer ideas of work, and a more perfect incentive mechanism for the building of the grass-roots units. It will also straighten out the relations between leading organs and grass-roots units. All this will play a major role in, and produce a momentous impact on the building of the grass-roots units in the new period. This will repeatedly push forward the building of a revolutionized, modernized, and regularized Army. Guiding and standardizing the building of the grass-roots units in line with the overall requirement of being "qualified politically, proficient militarily, fine in style, strict in discipline, and adequate in maintenance and supplies" as proposed by Chairman [zhu xi 0031 1598] Jiang Zemin, is the core substance and most striking characteristic of the revised "Outline." Chairman Jiang's requirement in five aspects is a summary of the major contents of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new period. It is a concentrated reflection of the objective laws governing army building in the new period. This is an overall requirement for army building as well as for the building of the grass-roots units. The building of the grass-roots units is systems engineering, which is complicated and difficult to put into effect. Hence, stress should be put on building in the above five aspects. If we guide and standardize the building of the grass-roots units with Chairman Jiang's instructions, we will be able to give impetus to all fields of endeavor in order to promote the comprehensive building. We should deeply understand the significance of guiding and standardizing this building with the above instructions in the areas including: the direction of the building, the formation of the Army's fighting capacity, and the performance of its basic functions. On this basis, we should command and standardize the building of the grass-roots units. The major content of the revised "Outline" stresses the seven principal regular missions for the grass-roots units, which are all basic and long-term tasks. If these tasks are well performed, we will be able to administer strict discipline to the Army, implement the principles of intensifying the comprehensive building of the grass-roots units, and provide a reliable guarantee for the fulfillment of Chairman Jiang's instructions, so that the Army will be able to stand the trials under various complex conditions. In a bid to intensify the building of the grass-roots units, it is necessary to always take firm, regular, and continuous control of the seven principal regular missions stipulated in the "Outline," with efforts really concentrated on the building of a basic and regular character. With regard to specific Army units, particular emphasis should be laid on a certain aspects of the tasks but, generally speaking, we should have in mind building in a comprehensive way and persistently hold fast to the seven principal missions so that they will coordinate with and promote one another in making advances. It is another major point of the revised "Outline" to universally strive to become advanced companies and excellent soldiers throughout the entire Army. Summing up the activities of appraisal through comparison previously conducted in the grass-roots units, the "Outline" stipulates that such activities be launched throughout the entire Army in a unified manner and determine their specific practices. These activities developed under the new situation, and reflect the aspirations of the vast number of officers and men in the grass-roots units of the entire Army and play an extremely inspiring role,developing into a vigorous and lively situation wherein everyone is emulating, learning from, catching up with, and helping one another striving to become an advanced element. In line with the requirements of the "Outline," we should straighten out our ideas, organize and guide our work in a scientific and meticulous manner, have the mobilization of positive factors, promotion of work, implementation, and intensification of the comprehensive building in mind. We must pay attention to overcoming and guarding against such problems as formalism, scholasticism, and so on, which were liable to emerge in the previous appraisals and contests, so that the activities will embark on a solid, effective, and healthy path of development from the very beginning. In carrying out the "Outline," leading organs should shoulder their major responsibilities. The "Outline" has made explicit stipulations on the principal duties and basic requirements of the leading organs at all levels in charge of the grass-roots units, as well as on the style of thinking and work style that they should adopt. Leading organs at all levels should comply with the requirements of the "Outline," intensify their self-building, and provide guidance and service to the grass-roots units. At present, they must first study the "Outline" seriously, acquire a good grasp of its main substance, increase their sense of responsibility, go into the midst of the troops to conduct propaganda, and give proper guidance to the study of the troops. Divisions, battalions, and regiments should train their grass-roots cadres and office workers with the "Outline" in a planned way. Units above army level should conscientiously hold fast to the selected sites for experiments and give proper guidance to the work in the pilot units. It is imperative to handle affairs strictly according to the stipulations and requirements of the "Outline," and, at the same time, combine implementation of the "Outline" with the pertinent rules and regulations. Leading cadres at all levels should conduct thorough investigations and studies, give concrete guidance and assistance to organs and grass-roots units in their implementation of the "Outline," keep abreast of the new situation and problems which emerge in the course of implementation, and sum up and acquaint themselves with the newly gained experiences. Through solid and effective work, a lively situation in which leading organs give guidance and assistance to grass-roots units and grass-roots units intensify their own building according to the "Outline" will certainly emerge. The building of the grass-roots units will be pushed forward constantly.
