Officers from half-a-dozen of the world's navies, more than 200 guests and thousands of spectators watched the grey-painted Type 23 frigate go down the slipway at Yarrow Shipbuilders into the Upper Clyde. HMS Somerset is the seventh Type 23, or "Duke" Class, frigate to be launched at Yarrow and will be delivered in spring 1996. She was launched by Lady Layard, wife of Admiral Sir Michael Layard, Second Sea Lord, and is the fourth Royal Navy ship to bear the name. HMS Somerset's primary role will be submarine detection and she will be equipped with the EH101 helicopter and torpedoes. Her surface armament consists of Harpoon missiles and a 4.5in gun. She will also be defended by the vertically-launched Seawolf anti-missile system and small calibre guns. The latest HMS Somerset, which is 440ft long and weighs 3,500 tonnes, was built in six months less than the first Type 23 frigate completed at Yarrow. Yarrow has five frigates to complete by 1997 -- three for the Royal Navy and two for Malaysia.
