On Monday [21 March] he will also present it to the SPD Executive Committee. By doing this, he is attempting to anticipate indiscretions and, at the same time, counter reports that the SPD is planning massive tax increases, Scharping said. He made it clear that, if the SPD wins the elections, he does not want to go beyond the tax quota of 1995. However, "redistributions" in the tax system at the cost of those who earn more are intended. The SPD chairman affirmed that his party wants to replace the solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent for all taxpayers, which has been in effect as of 1 January, with a 10-percent supplementary tax. This is to be levied as of an annual income of 50,000 German marks [DM] for singles and DM100,000 for married couples. According to calculations made by DIE WELT, this corresponds to a monthly net income of about DM2,500 for singles and DM5,000 for married couples (without deduction of health insurance contributions). According to the SPD, the bottom line is to be the same as in the case of the solidarity surcharge: DM27 billion per year. Scharping also recalled the assignment of the Federal Constitutional Court to exempt the subsistence minimum from taxes as of 1996 at the latest. The SPD will tackle this matter immediately. By easing the tax burden on lower and medium incomes, the party expects increased demand and thus a stimulation of the economic development. The SPD wants to find a basically new regulation for the equalization of burdens on families. The tax-free amount for children is to be abolished and replaced with a unified children's allowance of DM250 per child, which is to be deducted directly from the taxes owed. If someone is entitled to more children's allowance than he pays in taxes, he gets the difference directly from the financial authorities. On the other hand, a still unspecified upper limit is to be introduced for spouse's tax splitting. In order to abolish the "fairness gap" in financing German unification, which has developed over the past years, high private incomes and large fortunes are to make a greater contribution. This includes, among other things, a higher inheritance tax. The program also mentions the "ecological tax reform," but it does not speak of raising the petroleum tax. Scharping pointed to the planned unified energy tax of the European Union. Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel criticized that the supplementary tax will lead to serious disturbances in the economy. Finance Minister Theo Waigel called Scharping's proposals dubious. The supplementary tax, which already hits average wage-earners, does not yield one single mark to finance the other SPD projects.
