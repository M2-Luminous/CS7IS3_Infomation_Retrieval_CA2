SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Kansas City Support Office (KCSO) is soliciting grant proposals to pursue innovative concepts to develop a viable process for utilizing engineering students in a buildings analysis program. The program will focus on a integrated (holistic) systems analysis and development of a management/recommissioning plan to facilitate the implementation of recommendations. The analysis will include the operations, maintenance, and restoration needs of heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, lighting, domestic water systems, and the energy accounting procedures currently being used. The project team will also implement a utility accounting system in cooperation with the participating building owner/operators to analyze historic and future utility usage. The target facilities will be schools and other public institutional buildings in the four state KCSO region. The program will pattern certain aspects after the DOE's Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center (EADC) program but will emphasize measurement of results, institutional partnerships, funding mechanisms to perpetuate the process, training requirements and identification of public and private resources to assist clients in implementing the recommendations. The development of means to sustain the process, assurance of implementation of recommendations, and measurable results are key goals of the program. Projects shall be located in Federal Region VII consisting of the following states: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. The successful grantee will be expected to present the pilot program results in a round-table evaluation forum of appropriate stakeholders and governmental officials. Each proposal submitted will be reviewed and evaluated against established qualification and evaluation criteria. The DOE grant will not exceed $65,000. Cost sharing is not mandatory, but will be included in the evaluation criteria. Grant award is expected to be made by September 30, 1994.
