The commission included members of the State Duma Committee for Legislation and Judicial Reform, presidential representatives in the parliament, experts from the presidential state and law department and Constitutional Court judges. Yeltsin gave a positive assessment to the work done, noting that no one who could have done it better than the Constitutional Court. He stressed that from the very outset he had considered disputes about the Constitutional Court's right to initiate legislation as groundless. Yeltsin told Vitruk that he will instruct his representative in the State Duma to convey his assessment and proposals to the deputies. The president and Vitruk also discussed candidates for judges in the Constitutional Court. Yeltsin regretted that the suggested list practically does not represent subjects of the federation. He stressed that the final list to be approved by the Federation Council, upper house of Russia's new parliament, can be submitted only after the adoption of the law on the Constitutional Court which will determine the requirements for judges, including age limit, terms of office and others.
