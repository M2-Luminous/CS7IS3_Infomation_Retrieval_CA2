FR941102-2-00084 FR941102-2-00063 The PRA Implementation Plan The PRA Implementation Plan was developed in parallel with the Proposed PRA Policy Statement to ensure that the increased use of PRA methods and technology in nuclear regulatory activities would be implemented in a consistent and predictable manner that promotes regulatory stability and efficiency. This PRA Implementation Plan is a ``living'' document that provides the framework for NRC management oversight of the use of PRA methods and technology in regulatory activities. As previously discussed, PRA methods have been applied successfully in numerous nuclear regulatory activities and have proven to be a valuable complement to deterministic engineering approaches. However, the increased use of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities has broad implications and could result in changes in many areas associated with our current regulatory framework. These areas, considered by the staff in developing the draft PRA Implementation Plan, may include: Changes to regulations, guidance documents and inspection programs, a substantial shift in staff resources including recruiting and training programs to provide the necessary PRA expertise, an increased emphasis on continued development of PRA methods and decision-making tools, and enhanced reliability data collection. As discussed in SECY&hyph;94&hyph;218, the expanded use of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities may raise additional policy, technical, and legal issues that will be considered in subsequent modifications to the PRA Implementation Plan. Principal Issues Related to Increasing Use of Risk Assessment Four principal issues associated with applying risk assessment methods and techniques to regulatory applications are highlighted in the PRA Implementation Plan. These issues included development of regulatory decision-making criteria, collection and analysis of equipment and human performance data, development and use of consistent PRA models and methods, and development of a systemic PRA training program. To ensure consistent and appropriate decision-making that incorporates PRA methods and results, it is crucial that coherent and clear criteria are applied. As part of this plan, decision criteria will be established that address the interdependence of probabilistic risk and deterministic engineering principles. The process of developing these criteria will involve communications among the NRC, the nuclear industry, and the public to ensure an understanding by all parties of the role of PRA methods and results in NRC's risk management efforts. The NRC staff uses equipment performance data in the conduct of PRAs, reliability analyses, component failure studies, plant aging studies, identification and resolution of generic issues, preparation for inspections, and reviews of technical specifications change requests. For these purposes, the staff uses generic data supplemented with a limited amount of plant-specific data. The use of the generic data can be problematic because the data have not been verified or updated and do not differentiate between plant-to-plant variations in performance or changes in performance as reactor plants age. The ad hoc collection of plant-specific data is costly and inefficient.
