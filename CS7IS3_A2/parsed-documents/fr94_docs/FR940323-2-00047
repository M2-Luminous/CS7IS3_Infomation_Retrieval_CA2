FR940323-2-00047 FR940323-2-00031 Issuance of Proposed Decisions and Orders by the Office of Hearings and Appeals; Week of February 28 Through March 4, 1994 During the week of February 28 through March 4, 1994, the proposed decisions and orders summarized below were issued by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy with regard to applications for exception. Under the procedural regulations that apply to exception proceedings (10 CFR part 205, subpart D), any person who will be aggrieved by the issuance of a proposed decision and order in final form may file a written notice of objection within ten days of service. For purposes of the procedural regulations, the date of service of notice is deemed to be the date of publication of this Notice or the date an aggrieved person receives actual notice, whichever occurs first. The procedural regulations provide that an aggrieved party who fails to file a Notice of Objection within the time period specified in the regulations will be deemed to consent to the issuance of the proposed decision and order in final form. An aggrieved party who wishes to contest a determination made in a proposed decision and order must also file a detailed statement of objections within 30 days of the date of service of the proposed decision and order. In the statement of objections, the aggrieved party must specify each issue of fact or law that it intends to contest in any further proceeding involving the exception matter. Copies of the full text of these proposed decisions and orders are available in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, room 1E&hyph;234, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., except federal holidays.
