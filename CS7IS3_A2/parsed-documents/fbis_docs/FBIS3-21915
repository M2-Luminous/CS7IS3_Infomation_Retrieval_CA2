This was disclosed yesterday by Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio after she signed the Guyana/Colombia anti-drug joint agreement at the Foreign Ministry here. The agreement, proposed during her November 1993 visit to Guyana, provides for cooperation, assistance and exchange of information between the law enforcement agencies and judicial systems of the two countries. It also provides for the establishment of a Mixed Commission which will be responsible for the elaboration of programmes and plans to deal with the drug menace. Mixed Commission meetings are to be held alternately in the two countries annually. January 15 was the deadline fixed by the two countries for the signing of the joint agreement. Noting that drug use and trafficking are two of humanity's greatest problems, the visiting Foreign Minister said it is on this basis that the two states have agreed to combat the scourge. She added that Colombia expects President Cheddi Jagan and Foreign Minister Mr Clement Rohee to visit soon and hopes a "lot can be achieved" from that encounter in the area of drug eradication. And Foreign Minister Rohee said the signing of the agreement signals another milestone in the relations between the two countries. "It heralds a new thrust in the fight against drugs and commitment to this international scourge," he said. He has also pledged this country's support to collaborating "in all forms" to end the illicit trade and use of drugs. Guyana has entered into similar agreements with Venezuela, Cuba and Brazil. Minister Sanin de Rubio, who flew in yesterday morning to sign the agreement, also called on President Jagan and held talks with officials at the CARICOM Secretariat before leaving for Suriname in the afternoon.
