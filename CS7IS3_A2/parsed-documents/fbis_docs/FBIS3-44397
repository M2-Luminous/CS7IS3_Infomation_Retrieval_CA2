Later, before they left the prison, the warden gave each of the visitors including Frank Wolf five pairs of stockings as souvenirs. But several days later Wolf claimed that stockings produced by the Beijing prison had been exported to the U.S. After he returned home Wolf displayed the stockings at a hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate as "proof" that China had exported prison-made products. Despite the fact that the Chinese side immediately clarified the truth of the matter, Wolf closed his eyes to the facts and continued to spread his allegations on many occasions. Two years later, in March 1993, the U.S. Embassy to China made a request to the Chinese department concerned for embassy officials to be allowed to visit the Beijing Number One Prison. On March 30, 1993 the Chinese department concerned arranged a visit by three U.S. Embassy officials to the prison. During their visit the embassy officials said that they had made a detailed inquiry about Wolf's allegation and they would report their conclusion to the American government. Later, in the summer of 1993, Wolf again spread his lies at a press conference held in the U.S. and accused China groundlessly. After repeated requests by the Chinese department concerned, the U.S. Government published the investigation conclusion in "FEDERAL REGISTER" on December 13, 1993, which conforms to the facts. Speaking about reform-through-labor products, a Chinese Government spokesman said that the policy of the Chinese Government is very clear. "Reform-through-labor enterprises have no right to conduct foreign trade," he said. "Since China and U.S. reached an understanding about banning imports and exports of prison labor products, the Chinese side has always abided by the agreement. And facts are the best proof," the official added.
