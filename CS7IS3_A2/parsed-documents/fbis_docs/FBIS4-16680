"We cannot keep going from crisis to crisis," he pointed out at a meeting with journalists today. "We knew even earlier that Serb words and actions did not always mean the same. Within the context of the present situation it is necessary to take steps to diminish rather than increase this difference," Kozyrev remarked when commenting on the developments in Bosnia. He said contradictory information was coming from there which hampered the decision-making. Kozyrev admitted that Russia had influence on Serbs. However, he stressed pressure must also be exerted on other parties, including the Moslems. Kozyrev suggested that Moslems had considered the NATO air attacks on the Serb positions as a carte blanche. "They continue to provoke Serbs and show no interest in an agreement on settlement of the conflict," Kozyrev said. Kozyrev believes that the situation must not be simplified and it was not reasonable to mark everybody as "good and bad guys" as in a Western. "It is not a Western but an ethnically-colored civil war with no right no wrong, no angels no devils," he said. Kozyrev called on Russia's Western partners to exercise pressure on Moslems in order to conclude a peace agreement. Kozyrev confirmed that the Russian position remained the same stating that any means could be used for defense of the peacekeeping forces, including the military ones. "The problem is that there has been no such need in Gorazde. The further confrontation between Moslems and Serbs and the blockade of a part of the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina were the consequences, not the reason for the NATO air attacks which had not been coordinated with Russia although their results could have been predicted," Kozyrev said. Kozyrev believes that now there are three possible ways of developing the situation. "The first one is to lose patience and to resort to air attacks. This will result in a full-scale war as occurred in Vietnam and Afghanistan. However, in this case, infantry forces and an expedition corps must be brought to Bosnia and Herzegovina with an order to kill if necessary. Otherwise, this will remain vain words. The second option is to leave Bosnia and Herzegovina completely as it now happens in Somalia. The third option, the final one, is to try to negotiate and to proceed to a peace agreement on settlement of the conflict," Kozyrev clarified. He said he supported the third option. Kozyrev stressed that Serbs must be sure that their positive steps would be appreciated. "These steps must be conditioned with lessening and later with lifting of the sanctions against Belgrade," he pointed out. Kozyrev spoke in favor of giving a real sense to the NATO program Partnership for Peace. "They propose us just a flirt but we want a firm marriage in order to prevent such situations when nobody consults us while making important decisions, as occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina," Kozyrev said. Asked by Interfax whether it was certain that NATO would not deal a third strike against the Serbs without consulting Russia, Kozyrev said is was not reasonable to anticipate the developments.
