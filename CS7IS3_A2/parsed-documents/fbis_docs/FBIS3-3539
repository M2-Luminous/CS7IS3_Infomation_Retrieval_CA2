The decision--which seemingly contradicts China's basic policy of banning foreign currency from circulation in China--is to facilitate the increasing number of economic transactions between border-based businesses, said deputy governor of the People's Bank of China Zhou Zhengqing. Mr Zhou did not give details of the proposals. According to Chinese sources, the decision was made last year, but was not disclosed due to the sensitive nature of the plan. The People's Bank of China will work out measures to ease problems faced by businesses in Shenzhen and Zhuhai SEZ, when following the policy of allowing no foreign currency to circulate in China, Mr Zhou said. He reiterated that Beijing could not allow circulation, pricing, settlement and transition of foreign currency in its territory. However, Shenzhen SEZ may be an exception, he said, pointing to the fact that circulation of the Hong Kong dollar existed, following rapid development of business exchanges between the neighbouring communities. "As for the SEZ of Shenzhen it has carried out a lot of economic exchanges with Hong Kong and Macao. When implementing the policy it has come across some specific problems and for those specific problems, we will work out specific measures to find solutions to them," Mr Zhou told a press conference convened by the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress yesterday. He said the basic principle for such measures was to facilitate economic development in Hong Kong. Another senior central bank official said Beijing was against China-funded companies in Hong Kong speculating on the property markets. "China is a country short of foreign exchanges and funds, so we are against the practice by some companies who are carrying out speculative activities in the real estate industry in Hong Kong," deputy governor Chen Yuan, the son of powerful party elder Chen Yun, said at the conference.
