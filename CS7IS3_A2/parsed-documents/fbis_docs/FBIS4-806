The two sides have been negotiating in the Zambian capital of Lusaka for five months. UNITA secretary for information, Jorge Valentim, said although general principles for a ceasefire had been agreed upon, the war in Angola continued to escalate. "Nobody is supporting the war officially. It's against the wishes of mediators, observers, and the international community, particularly the United Nations Security Council," said Mr Valentim.
