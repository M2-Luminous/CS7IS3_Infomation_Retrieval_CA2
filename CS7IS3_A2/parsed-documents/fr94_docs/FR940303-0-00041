FR940303-0-00041 FR940303-0-00011 (7) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. In each example, X is the taxpayer, Agency is the state housing credit agency, and the carryover allocations meet the requirements of ยง1.42&hyph;6 and are otherwise valid. Example 1. (i) In August 1993, X and Agency enter into an agreement that Agency will allocate $100,000 of housing credit dollar amount for the low-income housing building X is constructing. The agreement is binding and meets all the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The agreement is a reservation of credit, not an allocation, and therefore, has no effect on the state housing credit ceiling. On or before September 5, 1993, X signs and has notarized a written election statement that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The applicable percentage for the building is the appropriate percentage for the month of August 1993. (ii) Agency makes a carryover allocation of $100,000 of housing credit dollar amount for the building on October 2, 1993. The carryover allocation reduces Agency's state housing credit ceiling for 1993. Due to unexpectedly high construction costs, when X places the building in service in July 1994, the product of the building's qualified basis and the applicable percentage for the building (the appropriate percentage for the month of August 1993) is $150,000, rather than $100,000. Notwithstanding that only $100,000 of credit was allocated for the building in 1993, Agency may allocate an additional $50,000 of housing credit dollar amount for the building from its state housing credit ceiling for 1994. The appropriate percentage for the month of August 1993 is the applicable percentage for the building for the entire $150,000 of credit allocated for the building, even though separate allocations were made in 1993 and 1994. Because allocations were made for the building in two separate calendar years, Agency must issue two Forms 8609 to X. One Form 8609 must reflect the $100,000 allocation made in 1993, and the other Form 8609 must reflect the $50,000 allocation made in 1994. (iii) X gives the original notarized statement to Agency on or before September 5, 1993, and retains a copy of the binding agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation document. X files a copy of the binding agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation document with X's Form 8609 for the first taxable year in which X claims credit for the building. (iv) Agency files the original of the binding agreement, election statement, and 1993 carryover allocation document with its 1993 Form 8610. Agency retains a copy of the binding agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation document. After the building is placed in service in 1994, Agency issues to X a copy of the Form 8609 reflecting the 1993 carryover allocation of $100,000 and files the original of that form with its 1994 Form 8610. Agency also files the original of the 1994 Form 8609 reflecting the $50,000 allocation with its 1994 Form 8610 and issues to X a copy of the 1994 Form 8609. Agency retains copies of the Forms 8609 that are issued to X. Example 2. (i) In September 1993, X and Agency enter into an agreement that Agency will allocate $70,000 of housing credit dollar amount for rehabilitation expenditures that X is incurring and that X will treat as a new low-income housing building under section 42(e)(1). The agreement is binding and meets all the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The agreement is a reservation of credit, not an allocation, and therefore, has no effect on Agency's state housing credit ceiling. On or before October 5, 1993, X signs and has notarized a written election statement that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The applicable percentage for the building is the appropriate percentage for the month of September 1993. Agency makes a carryover allocation of $70,000 of housing credit dollar amount for the building on November 15, 1993. The carryover allocation reduces by $70,000 Agency's state housing credit ceiling for 1993. (ii) In October 1994, X and Agency enter into another binding agreement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Under the agreement, Agency will allocate $50,000 of housing credit dollar amount for additional rehabilitation expenditures by X that qualify as a second separate new building under section 42(e)(1). On or before November 5, 1994, X signs and has notarized a written election statement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. On December 1, 1994, X receives a carryover allocation under section 42(h)(1)(E) for $50,000. The carryover allocation reduces by $50,000 Agency's state housing credit ceiling for 1994. The applicable percentage for the rehabilitation expenditures treated as the second separate new building is the appropriate percentage for the month of October 1994, not September 1993. The appropriate percentage for the month of September 1993 still applies to the allocation of $70,000 for the rehabilitation expenditures treated as the first separate new building. Because allocations were made for the building in two separate calendar years, Agency must issue two Forms 8609 to X. One Form 8609 must reflect the $70,000 allocation made in 1993, and the other Form 8609 must reflect the $50,000 allocation made in 1994. (iii) X gives the first original notarized statement to Agency on or before October 5, 1993, and retains a copy of the first binding agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation document issued in 1993. X gives the second original notarized statement to Agency on or before November 5, 1994, and retains a copy of the second binding agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation document issued in 1994. X files a copy of the binding agreements, election statements, and carryover allocation documents with X's Forms 8609 for the first taxable year in which X claims credit for the buildings. (iv) Agency retains a copy of the binding agreements, election statements, and carryover allocation documents. Agency files the original of the first binding agreement, election statement, and 1993 carryover allocation document with its 1993 Form 8610. Agency files the original of the second binding agreement, election statement, and 1994 carryover allocation document with its 1994 Form 8610. After X notifies Agency of the date each building is placed in service, the Agency will issue copies of the respective Forms 8609 to X, and file the originals of those forms with the Agency's Form 8610 that reflects the year each form is issued. The Agency also retains copies of the Forms 8609.
