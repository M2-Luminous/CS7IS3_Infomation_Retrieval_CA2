He said that following the signing of the final act of the Uruguay Round trade talks, Indonesia and other developing countries hoped their export products could gain more market access in the developed countries. According to the minister, it is important for developed countries to open their markets to goods from developing countries considering that Indonesia, one of the developing countries, had already adopted a liberal trade policy in line with the outcome of the Uruguay Round talks. He said that apart from that, the developed countries should provide technical assistance to developing countries instead of attaching other conditional clauses to the trade agreement. It is hoped that the Uruguay Round trade talks on textiles and agriculture could create a trade policy that is not contradictory to the agreement reached at Uruguay Round talks and that trade discrimination against developing countries will be eliminated.
