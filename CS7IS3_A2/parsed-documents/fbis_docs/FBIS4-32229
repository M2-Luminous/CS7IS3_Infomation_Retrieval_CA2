Envoy Yasushi Akashi's statement, in which he said that the U.N. would pursue a "stick and carrot" policy towards the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, confirmed that some members of the world organization were pursuing a partial policy. The countries represented on the Contact Group for Bosnia-Herzegovina have a great responsibility not to allow to be drawn again into the trap of partiality and belief that they could achieve something by pursuing the "stick and carrot" policy, Jovanovic said in a radio interview broadcast from Kragujevac in central Serbia. Referring to hints that the new maps for Bosnia-Herzegovina's territorial division would be submitted to the warring sides as an ultimatum, Jovanovic said that this was not yet clear and that everybody should wait. However, if it would be merely a continuation of the earlier policy of favouring the Bosnian Moslems and Croats and punishing the Serbs, then it would obviously not lead to any results, Jovanovic said. The Contact Group is soon expected to present the maps for Bosnia's division, according to which 51 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina would go to the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs.
