(d) When required, performance reports must generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following: (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, this quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis, and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.

(a) The following forms or other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients. (1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A_Financial Status Report. (i) Recipients are required to use the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. The Secretary may not require the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when, the Secretary determines that SF&hyph;270_Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272_Report of Federal Cash Transactions_provides adequate information to meet the Department's needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A is required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. (ii) The Secretary prescribes whether the report is on a cash or accrual basis. If the Secretary requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient is not required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand. (iii) The Secretary determines the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report is not required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report is required at the completion of the agreement.
