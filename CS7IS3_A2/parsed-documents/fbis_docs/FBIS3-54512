Let us now talk about other important articles in the document that still concern the presidential body. Article 8 says that the head of state will be sworn in before the higher institutions of the nation, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 72 and 73 of the Constitution. The head of state will have to declare his commitment to devoting himself to the implementation of the contents of this document. Article 9 says that the duty of the head of state is incompatible with the exercise of any public or private functions, even if they were electoral. [sentence as heard] This duty is also incompatible with any responsibility within a political party or association. The other important article concerns the powers and prerogatives of the head of state. These remain almost as they appear in the Constitution: He is the supreme commander of all the Armed Forces of the republic; he is in charge of national defense; he decides and steers the country's foreign policy; he chairs the Council of Ministers [the prime minister chairs the council of government]; he appoints and dismisses the head of government -- this is also a very important point -- he signs presidential decrees and appoints people to civilian and military posts in the state apparatus, and so on. The other article that has been heavily amended concerns the transitional National Assembly. The participants have unanimously endorsed these amendments, particularly with regard to the membership and number of seats. Thus, the number of seats in the transitional National Assembly has been increased from 180 to 200. These seats will be divided among the groups that had been invited to the national conference of consensus according to the following proportions: 15 percent will be reserved for representatives of state institutions and the remaining 75 percent [as heard] will be equally divided among the political parties and the other social forces, including associations and economic organizations. The installation of the transitional National Assembly will take place within three months. I apologize for my mistake: I meant the remaining 85 percent. [Announcer] There is also the issue of the commitments, which had appeared in the preliminary documents and which now seem to have been changed into "the general policy resolution." [Correspondent] Yes, these commitments, as they had appeared in the text of the document, have been incorporated into a general policy resolution. Among these commitments, which have now appeared in a general policy resolution, the participants pledge and call for the preservation and consolidation of national unity, by respecting the republican and democratic character of the state; respecting the principles of Islam, which is the religion of the Algerian state, the pillar of society, and the basis of the personality of the Algerian people; respecting the Arabic language and promoting it since it is the national and official language of the Algerian nation; entrenching multiparty politics as a method of organization and political expression and a framework for alternating power; respecting individual and collective liberties and promoting and consecrating these liberties; respecting the Amazighi [Berber language and culture] and promoting it since it is an integral part of the national identity, alongside Islam and Arabism; rejecting violence as a means of political expression or a means to come to power or stay in power; refraining from using religion for party propaganda purposes; and refraining from using state resources, official institutions, and places of worship for party purposes. These commitments have remained almost as they were. The only change is that they have been removed from the text of the document, i.e. the document on national consensus, to be incorporated into a general policy resolution. I would like to remind the listeners that the parties that boycotted the conference have boycotted it because they have declared their readiness to contribute and take part in the dialogue which, they are saying, will be starting soon. This dialogue is supposed to really start at the beginning of the transition period, according to the resolution issued by this conference. As regards the parties that initially took part and later pulled out, they have said that they will participate in the dialogue when it starts. However, in the light of the changes introduced to the presidential body, public opinion would like to know who the next head of state is going to be. The amendment introduced to the presidential body is somewhat an indication. But the question remains very important and public opinion is waiting for a reply because time is running out and the end of the month is near [when the term of office of the Higher State Council ends].
