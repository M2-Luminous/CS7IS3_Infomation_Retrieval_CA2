At the end of their five-year legislative period, the 518 deputies are presenting a report on their work to the public. We would have expected that this parliament, as the second budget authority after the Council of Ministers, would report on the development of spending and the most important points of the budget. However, the budget does not play a role in the deputies' report on their activities. Rather, a table catches our eye which says by how many millions the budget was increased above the finance ministers' drafts at the instigation of the Strasbourg parliamentarians. In 1990, the Strasbourg people fought for, and got, the equivalent of 1 billion German marks [DM] for the young reforming states of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. A year later, they made sure that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's promise materialized that German reunification would not take away a single mark from the member states that traditionally receive subsidies from the Community. The parliamentarians made use of the Gulf war to secure additional funds, used their influence on behalf of refugees from Kurdistan, and increased aid for the Israeli occupied territories. On balance, they increased the budget by the equivalent of DM6.6 billion. It should be noted that the additional means were not only used for the current year, but had to be distributed over the rest of medium-term financial planning. In its profit and loss account last year, the parliament frankly admitted that it believed it should "counter" on principle the Council of Ministers' draft following the first reading, because it was nothing but "a statistical operation of the finance ministers to reduce the preliminary draft of the Brussels Commission." So the deputies allowed their imagination to roam, and in so doing, finally detected the program "Konver" for the conversion of arms factories to civilian production. There simply is nothing with which the Strasbourg people would not deal. Their profit and loss accounting for 1993 amounts to DM6.8 billion. In view of European Community budgets that clearly exceeded DM100 billion, this was not much. The scope of action that the parliament has been granted is not larger, however, and so the parliament creates the impression that taxpayers had no alternative but to flee, if its reins were loosened. Would it be better from the taxpayers' viewpoint if the European Parliament did not exist? This conclusion suggests itself, and yet is basically wrong. The experts of EC Budget Commissioner Peter Schmidhuber believe they know why the parliament is so ready to spend money -- because it lacks one of the basic parliamentary rights, namely fiscal jurisdiction. They say that within the scope of its limited authority, it can hardly do anything but call for higher expenditures and increase the budget in accordance with its leeway of action. A competent parliament that would have to justify its spending policy to the voters would, in all probability, for instance, not reserve half the Community budget for an agricultural policy that is judged favorably only by large farmers. We cannot contradict this. Therefore, taxpayers in particular should be interested in a parliament that would be equal with, not subordinate to, the Council of Ministers. In the first years of its existence, parliamentarism justified itself with the need to control those who govern. In this sense, all parliaments in Europe have somewhat degenerated. Moreover, the European Parliament feels bound to the idea of redistribution to a larger extent than national parliaments. It shares this idea with the Commission and pursues it, without considering whether it is politically wise. In the report on their work, the Strasbourg people note with pride that they "succeeded in getting doubled, in real terms, the structural fund accepted." The structural fund includes all subsidies with the exception of agriculture, research, and social policies. In the five-year period from 1988 to 1992, it had been increased by 100 percent in real terms. The capital endowment, including the rate of inflation, increased from DM16 billion to DM37 billion. At that time, the generous donor countries obviously did not consider that receivers could declare the five-year doubling a political entitlement and demand a repetition for the next five years. This may sound like a joke to the thrifty budgeter. For the Strasbourg people, it was a foregone conclusion. They pursue redistribution deliberately and, if necessary, in an insidious way. In the research budget of the 1995 draft budget, they reduced subsidies for specific projects in favor of general titles such as "spreading of scientific knowledge." In this way, they wanted to make sure that economically strong member states with good laboratories receive less, whereas the poor neighbors on the periphery, where there is less research, receive more. The fact that German citizens must eat more expensive and worse bananas than before, because banana producers in France's overseas territories are to be subsidized, is no problem to the Strasbourg people. In 1999, the structural fund will have been increased to approximately DM70 billion. Then the receivers will probably apply for doubling the fund again. The very parliament that has taken up the cause of European integration does not see that it will prevent integration through its bad policy of subsidies and redistribution.
