With a value of 108.0, the previous month's level was exceeded by 1.2 percent; compared to the corresponding month last year, the growth amounted to 8 percent. With the exception of the FAZ share index, which again went down slightly following the speedy increase at the end of 1993, all individual elements included in the indicator were clearly pointing upward. Thus, the economic recovery, which has been noted by the FAZ indicator for almost a year now, is spreading further. The opportunities for economic recovery in the course of this year have thus improved further. The increase confidence is particularly obvious in industry; the Ifo business climate index once again improved tangibly. After a temporary period of weakness at the turn of the year, orders received are clearly pointing upward, too. Particularly gratifying is the fact that domestic orders have, for the first time, clearly increased again. The positive development of foreign demand has continued. In addition to the economic improvement in important trading partner countries, the real external value of the German mark has declined further. A positive effect on the economic development is also exerted by the fact that the interest structure, which has been largely inverse since the turn of the year, has meanwhile disappeared almost completely. In total, the prospects are good that the Bundesbank will continue its policy of a cautious reduction of short-term interests over the next few months. The number of FAZ job offers seems to have overcome its low point, even though recovery is still very moderate in this field.
