O nation of Islam: Look at the sedition in the ranks of the Muslim nation. There is sedition as well as wars, internecine fighting and mutual destruction in a number of Muslim countries. Sedition which has led to loss of life, property and the destruction of the country. But who benefits from all this? Muslims should fear God and their religion; they should spare the destruction of their people and should remember that God will be questioning them on the sedition and the wars and He will be judging them on that sedition. O nation of Islam, you should fear God. Let us go back to the teachings of our true religion. Let us make God's teachings an arbiter in our problems. Let us think and contemplate that such sedition will not bring any good to our nation. It will only bring destruction to property and people. And it will only sow the seeds of hatred between members of the nation. It will make it less united and it will destroy its resources. You should, O nation of Islam, fear God, use your wisdom and try to avoid sedition. Nothing good will ever come from sedition. [passage omitted] O nation of Islam, nation of Islam: The enemies of the nation have been trying to discredit it by claiming that Islam has ignored human rights and that the latter has been ignored in Muslim faith. This is a lie and a fallacy. Anyone who cares to examine our faith will find out that it is the faith which has guaranteed the true meaning of human rights. God has said to his messenger: We have sent thee, save as a mercy unto all beings. [passage omitted] Human rights have been guaranteed under our faith. Creeds before Islam used to fight each other. Whenever a creed triumphed over another one it tried to annihilate it as much as it could. But once God sent Muhammad, may God's prayers and benedictions be upon him, as a mercy to the nation and to humanity... Hence, human rights are respected by our shari'ah and by the Muslim faith. Believers must, however, obey the shari'ah; they must obey its divine ordinance on what is permitted and what is not. Their religion has urged them to do so. The true Muslim is someone who would not harm other Muslims by words or deeds. [last sentence from the hadith] [passage omitted] Our religion has protected human rights for everybody and those who claim respect for human rights are the ones who are the enemies of mankind, the ones whose societies gave birth to racial and ethnic discrimination, the ones who are making weapons of destruction so that the Islamic nations use them to eliminate one another. They are the ones who ignite sedition. Islam, with its tenets, is innocent of the terrible events and horrible massacres which one sees around. [passage omitted: Islam is against dishonesty and treacherous behavior; giving examples from the prophet's behaviour] Islam is a religion of mercy, justice, and equity, and those who (?allege) that Islam relinquishes the human rights of Muslims and non-Muslims are deceiving people. Islam protects the very meaning of human rights. [passage omitted: the ummah and its leaders are abiding by the Islamic law as dictated by the Holy Book] Muslims should not listen to the ideas, deceptions, and calumnies of the enemies of Islam. They must trust their religion and know that their Islam is God's religion, which Allah chose and entrusted his messenger to convey. [passage omitted]
