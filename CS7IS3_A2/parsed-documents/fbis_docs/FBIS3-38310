At a meeting of chairpersons heading member groups belonging to the Central Federation of Women's Organizations, support was given to Rehn. The Central Federation is politically independent. It represents 400,000 women in 52 different organizations. Constituent groups include the women's auxiliaries of the Center Party, Conservative Party, the Christian Party, and the Rural Party, as well as the Martha Confederation, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Kindergarten Teachers' Union, Wives of Engineers, Zonta International [Finnish chapter], and, for example, the wives of foreign service officers. The leftist women's organizations do not belong to the Central Federation. Also supporting Rehn is the Women's Party, [which said in a statement]: "As a women, wife, mother, and grandmother, she has new groups of people with her and is bringing a human dimension to the highest realm of politics."
