In the midst of this, the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] put forth a proposal that Japan should rethink the industrial centering on exports and should aim at the establishment of Japan on the basis of the creation of technology--a country that can contribute to the growth of the world through the creation of new technology. A NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN staffer asked Canon Chairman Ryuzaburo Kaku, who is also vice secretary general of Keizai Doyukai, about the technological policy issues and the management of enterprises in the future. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is the problem behind the proposal? [Kaku] In the economy and various social aspects, Japan has already attained the goal set up in the Meiji era -- "Catch up and pass the advanced European countries and the United States." The export industry, which has been Japan's strong point, will increasingly find it difficult to maintain itself not only because of industrialization in Asian countries where labor costs are low, but also because of trade friction. In order for Japan to become a country acceptable to the international community in the future, it must contribute to it through science and technology. However, a glance at Japan's technology shows that it has nothing worth mentioning except for the technology of mass production. It should discontinue free riding in the use of basic technology of countries in Europe and the United States, and must immediately establish a system whereby it can develop new technology on its own initiative. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Have you ever felt the necessity of requesting the government to rethink its technological policy through your experience in managing Canon Inc.? [Kaku] Yes, I have felt that necessity through the supply of our office machines to the U.S. Hewlett Packard Co. and Apple Computer, Inc. through OEM [original equipment manufacturing]. Because of the strong yen during the past year or two, the cost of procurement has become lower if those companies manufacture products by themselves within the United States or import them from Asian or Southeast Asian countries than if they resort to supply through OEM. I have strongly felt that unless Japan seriously undertakes the development of creative technology, it will have no products that can be supplied through OEM. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The proposal claims that the amount of reesearch and development investment, which is currently 0.5 percent of the gross national product, should be increased to 2 percent at the lowest in the next few years. Is Japan's investment in research and development smaller than those of the United States and advanced countries in Europe? [Kaku] The U.S. Government's investment in research and development accounts for 1.1 percent of the gross national product and 1.0 percent each in France and Germany respectively. The Japanese Government has strived for the promotion of domestic industries through protection and various regulations, but it has been negligent of its technological policy. It is true that in the case of the United States and France, national defense research expenditure forms a larger proportion of the government expenditure, but compared with Japan, the difference is great nevertheless. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The total research expenditure of Japan, including the research expenditure of private enterprises, accounts for 3 percent of gross national product, which is higher than 2.6 percent for the United States and 2.7 percent for Germany. It seems that Japan's private enterprises are active in research and development. [Kaku] Japan is prominent in private research expenditure, but private enterprises do not conduct creative research. They are just following the technology for manufacturing epoch-making products developed by rival makers inside and outside Japan and are striving for research and development to fight successfully through the war against their competitors. Since each company makes an investment in the same technological field in a group, the efficiency of research investment is poor from a macro point of view, incurring a decline of profit rates. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is the problem of public administration? [Kaku] Since sectarian ministries and agencies just imitate each other in the distribution of research budgets, concentrated investment in priority sectors becomes almost impossible. Although the cabinet has the Council for Science and Technology which examines comprehensive technological policies, the council has no authority over research budgets. It is necessary for the council to have research budgets, to increase its members from the business community, and to become the central organization of technological policies. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The export ratio of Canon Inc. is very high, amounting to 79 percent. However, Canon has also a pressing need to overhaul itself, does it not? [Kaku] Canon has been conducting its business with "creation of technology" in mind for more than 10 years. It has not been dependent solely upon the technology of other companies, but has been pursuing new technology. Typical examples in recent years are laser beam printers and strong current liquid crystals with memory function. As a result, it has strengthened its international competitiveness and has increased its export ratio. Due to the increased appreciation of the yen these days, it has become increasingly important for Canon to shift its base of operation overseas as much as possible and to manufacture high value-added products at home through creative technology. Canon has not only to protect itself from being imitated by other companies, but also prevent itself from being caught up in excessive competition. For this purpose, each company should supplement each other with technology each is good at and should strive for "symbiosis" free from excessive competition.
