At first the story was put about that the tragedy occurred as the result of mortar fire, allegedly from positions held by Serbian armed formations. Later, when the real scale of this inhuman carnage began to become apparent, people started saying that the fire might not have come from Serbian positions but from some others. Then they started saying that the series of explosions occurred right on the spot as the result of charges which had been laid earlier and which someone (but who?!) set off. It is beyond doubt that, whoever was to blame for this tragedy, this killer (or killers) must be punished and appear before a court. Is this not the reason why the international tribunal in The Hague for crimes against the person on territory in the former Yugoslavia was set up? Only I believe that this killer will never be found. There are several points which cause me to think along these lines. Right after the tragedy, the Serbian side in Bosnia issued a statement in which it urged the holding of an international investigation into the crime that had been committed and guaranteed unimpeded access to the site for international experts. Why would it do this if some people accuse precisely it of the tragedy? There are other disconcerting points. This is not the first such instance, you know. More than a year ago, also in Sarajevo, a shell allegedly fired from a tank gun killed 20 people and injured dozens of peaceful residents at a bus stop close to the market in the Muslim districts. Then too there were demands for the Serb tankman who allegedly drove up to that spot and fired the shot to be called to account. There were calls for NATO aircraft to start bombing Serbian positions without delay. Then it turned out that neither the tank nor the mythical Serbian tankman had existed. The author of that tragedy was never found. It cannot escape your notice that both these events occurred on the eve of the conclusion of peace talks among the three warring sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At that time the talks were wrecked. By the beginning of 1994 the Serbs and Croats had virtually completely agreed their positions and displayed readiness to end hostilities. The Muslim side had also begun to voice satisfaction with the talks. The very dangerous military conflict at the center of Europe seemed to be finally approaching a peaceful outcome. But suddenly (suddenly?) the position of the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership hardened, and it demanded territorial concessions from the Serbs and Croats. In the end, the concessions were made. The talks were led out of the impasse. But the Muslim side again, for the umpteenth time, pulled out of the talks process and left Geneva virtually without advancing any new terms at all, but demanding that the West make bombing strikes against Serbian positions. Once again the impasse was being surmounted, and the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims were to meet once again in Geneva 10 February to continue the peace talks process. The tragedy in Sarajevo could prevent that meeting. But who would benefit from wrecking the peace talks even at the cost of spilling a lot of blood of Sarajevo's peaceful residents? This is the hardest question. In any case it is perfectly obvious that neither the Serbs, nor the Croats, nor the Muslim leadership itself benefit from the talks being wrecked. There is evidently still someone who cannot stomach the possible peaceful outcome of the Balkan conflict. It is this "someone" who is resorting to provocations, not afraid of blood. It seems to me that he must be sought not among those who are already tired of fighting and shedding their blood. The shortest way to find him could be to ascertain just who is constantly pressuring the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership and compelling it to walk out of the talks time after time. But this, so it seems to me, is a matter for the international tribunal in The Hague.
