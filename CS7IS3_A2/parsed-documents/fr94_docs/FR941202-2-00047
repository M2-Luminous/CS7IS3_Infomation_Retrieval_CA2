FR941202-2-00047 FR941202-2-00029 [Docket No. GP95&hyph;1&hyph;000] State of California, Division of Oil and Gas Tight Formation Area Determination FERC No. JD93&hyph;00528T (California&hyph;2); Notice of Preliminary Finding Issued November 18, 1994 On October 26, 1992, the State of California, Division of Oil and Gas (California) determined that three zones (the Lower Reef Ridge, Antelope and McDonald Zones) in the Lost Hills Field, in Kern County, California, qualify as tight formations under Section 107(c)(5) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). 1 Chevron USA Inc. (Chevron) is the applicant before California. 1 The determination covers approximately 2,530 acres. The recommended area, which is the same for all three zones, includes the indicated portions of Sections 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, and 23 in T27S, R21E. By letter dated December 10, 1992, staff tolled the Commission's 45-day review period and requested additional support for California's conclusion that the three zones meet the Commission's tight formation guidelines in §271.703(c)(2) of the Commission's regulations. 2 Staff requested additional information, in part, because an article entitled `` Diagenetically Enhanced Entrapment of Hydrocarbons_Southeastern Lost Hills Fractured Shale Pool, Kern County, California '' indicates that part of the recommended area is considered to be the productive heart of both the Upper Antelope shale and Lower Reef Ridge shale pools, and that wells in this area exhibit excellent prestimulation oil and gas production rates (and/or oil and gas shows) that are indicative of effective permeability due natural fractures. 3 Staff also stated that, since Commission records indicate that the Antelope and McDonald Zones in the Lost Hills Field have been water flooded, staff is unable to ascertain whether the current oil and gas flow rates represent the initial in situ permeability and prestimulation flow rare characteristics of the subject zones, or represent conditions resulting from the production and partial depletion of undersaturated oil reservoirs in the Lost Hills Field. 2 Section 271.703(c)(2) requires a jurisdictional agency's tight formation area determination to show that: (1) The estimated average in situ gas permeability, throughout the pay section, is expected to be 0.1 millidarcy or less; (2) the average prestimulation stabilized natural gas flow rate (against atmospheric pressure) of wells completed for production in the formation does not exceed the applicable maximum allowable flow rate; and (3) wells in the recommended area is expected to produce, without stimulation, more than 5 barrels of crude oil per day. 3 The article was published in Volume 6 of the Selected Papers to the San Joaquin Geological Society (January 1984). California responded to the tolling letter on June 29, 1993. However, the response did not include all the information requested in the December 10, 1992 tolling letter and did not contain some enclosures that Chevron submitted to California. In addition, staff review showed several discrepancies between California's response and the history of the development of the Lost Hills Field, as described in the 1983 Article. Accordingly, staff's August 13, 1993 letter requested the missing enclosures, plus additional information to resolve the discrepancies and retolled the Commission's 45-day review. To date, neither California nor Chevron has responded to the August 13, 1993 letter. Without the requested information, we are unable to find that California's determination is supported by substantial evidence. Under §275.202(a) of the regulations, the Commission may make a preliminary finding, before any determination becomes final, that the determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Therefore, the Commission hereby makes a preliminary finding that California's determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record upon which it was made. 4 California or Chevron may, within 30 days from the date of this preliminary finding, submit written comments and request an informal conference with the Commission, pursuant to §275.202(f) of the regulations. A final Commission order will be issued within 120 days after the issuance of this preliminary finding. 4 The Commission notes that California's affirmative area determination in California-5 includes some of the same acreage covered by California-2. The issuance of a preliminary finding in California-2 does not affect the determination in California-5. By Direction of the Commission. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
