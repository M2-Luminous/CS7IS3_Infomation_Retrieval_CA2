ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The City of Bakersfield and the County of Kern (co-applicants) have applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The permit application and accompanying Metropolitan Bakersfield Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) cover a 408-square mile area of Metropolitan Bakersfield. The HCP would result in incidental take of several federally listed endangered or threatened animal species presently occupying the conservation plan area. The Service announces the availability of an Environmental Assessment (EA), HCP, application for incidental take, and Implementing Agreement (IA). This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(a) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). DATES: Written comments on these documents should be received on or before July 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review these documents may obtain a copy by writing to the Service's Sacramento Field Office (SFO). Documents will be available by written request for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the SFO. Written data or comments concerning the documents should be submitted to the SFO. Please reference permit number PRT&hyph;786634 in your comments. Address comments or questions to: Field Supervisor, Sacramento Field Office, U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, 2800 Cottage Way, room E&hyph;1823 Sacramento, California 95825&hyph;1846 (Telephone: 916&hyph;978&hyph;4866). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Peter Cross at the Service's Sacramento Field Office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Service must determine that the criteria identified in section 10(a)(2)(B) of the Act have been met in order to issue an incidental take permit under section 10(a)(2)(B). The criteria are: (1) The taking will be incidental; (2) the applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize and mitigate the impacts of taking; (3) the applicant will ensure that adequate funding for the plan will be provided and procedures are available to deal with unforeseen circumstances; (4) the taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild; and (5) other measures which may be necessary, if any, are met. The public is invited to comment on the applicability of those criteria to this permit application. Background Existing conflicts among federally protected species and urban development have prompted City of Bakersfield (City) and County of Kern (County) to pursue an HCP and incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act. The HCP is designed to offset impacts resulting from loss of habitat incurred through land use development activities in the Metropolitan Bakersfield area. The goal of the HCP is to acquire, preserve, and enhance native habitats which support endangered and threatened species and other species of concern, while allowing urban development to proceed within the Metropolitan Bakersfield area. The area covered by the HCP contains land within the jurisdiction of the City and County. The HCP is the product of a 7-year planning process involving the city, county, representatives of the environmental community and the building industry, and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). The HCP will result in incidental take of several endangered and threatened species within the 408-square mile area of Metropolitan Bakersfield. The Federal permit would make this take lawful so long as it is in accordance with the conditions of the permit as described in the HCP and its IA. The permit issued would cover the species formally listed by the Service at the time of issuance. Other species of concern could be added by amendment in the event that they are subsequently listed as an endangered species or threatened species. The section 10(a)(1)(B) permit would permit the incidental take of the following listed species: San Joaquin kit fox, blunt-nosed leopard lizard, Tipton kangaroo rat, and giant kangaroo rat.
