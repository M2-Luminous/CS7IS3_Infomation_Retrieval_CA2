Of this total, ECU17.7 billion went to the EU member states -- France ranked third among the beneficiaries, with 12.4 percent of the loans granted -- while ECU1.9 billion went to third countries in the framework of the cooperation policy. EIB's French vice-president, Alain Prate, agreed to be interviewed by LE FIG-ECO. [Bollaert] How far have we got with the European growth initiative and the white paper's promises in the areas of growth, competition, and employment? [Prate] In the depths of a crisis and at a time of serious unemployment it really was the time to establish major intra-European infrastructures, open to both East and southern Europe. The first stage consisted of accelerating the financing by the EIB of major projects that already had been defined and were almost complete. Of the ECU5-billion budget agreed on at the Edinburgh summit, to which we should add the ECU2 billion from the Copenhagen summit, ECU5.1 billion has already been poured into 100 or so specific projects. I could mention the Paris-Brussels high-speed train link from the Belgian border to Brussels, the Chamoise tunnel, or various environmental protection projects, for example at Nancy, Nantes, or Belfort. We really are ahead of schedule! [Bollaert] We could also mention the ECU1 billion, which includes various government low-interest loans, set aside to finance investments by small- and medium-sized companies.... [Prate] Of course, this project is currently being implemented. However, we need to go further and enter a second stage with the emergence of new projects. This is why the Brussels summit decided to create, along the lines of the white paper, a group composed of the personal representatives of the heads of state and government of the Twelve -- the Christophersen Group -- with the mission of identifying new trans-European projects that should take priority. We are actively cooperating in the work of this group, and 26 projects are currently being examined. However, it is a difficult task and the problems sometimes go beyond merely finding the money.... [Bollaert] For example? [Prate] Take the high-speed rail link between Paris and Strasbourg: It should become the Paris-Frankfurt link. The French part is almost certain to be completed, but not the German part. The low profitability of the project implies a high rate of subsidy and, as a result, major public aid. This had led to a degree of reticence on the part of the Germans. That is why we have great expectations of the Christophersen Group. Through its advice and with the urging of the heads of state and government, we think that a certain number of projects that cannot be normally financed could benefit from the major support of the political authorities. [Bollaert] But it will be difficult.... [Prate] Yes. Take two other major projects, like the Brussels-Amsterdam-Cologne high-speed rail link, or the high-speed Eurotunnel train to London. In both cases, the high population density creates major environmental problems. In addition, the British Government would like a share of the money to come from the private sector. Fundamental Criteria [Bollaert] Maybe we now understand better what [Prime Minister] Balladur meant when he said on the "Hour of Thruth" TV show that nothing much seemed to have come out of the Brussels summit.... [Prate] The Christophersen Group has only met twice. We must give it time to work. [Bollaert] In December, the Twelve were talking about ECU120 over six years to accelerate the creation of the major networks (transport, energy, and telecommunications) and about giving the EU "information highways." That is a fine program, but is it not too ambitious? [Prate] For credits at normal rates, the EIB is quite capable of increasing its aid since our current ceiling is ECU144 billion, of which only ECU98 billion have been used. We therefore have a large financial margin, all the more so since the ratification procedures for the European Investment Fund (EIF), the instrument guaranteeing the financing of major infrastructures and assisting small- and medium-sized companies, are almost completed. The EIF will therefore be an additional and useful way of easing the financing of major projects. However, these projects -- which vary in their profitability -- still have to meet certain criteria which we consider to be fundamental: They must be well prepared technically; they must respect the environment; they must be economically viable; and they must be financially balanced. I repeat: We do not lack the resources. We do, however, need more good projects. [Bollaert] The Commission in Brussels would nevertheless still like to issue "Union Bonds" -- bonds issued in the name of the EU -- to accelerate the movement.... [Prate] It takes more than "Union Bonds" to create new projects. We all know that most finance ministers consider that the EU should not get too heavily into debt. There is still a difference between the approach of those who want to go ahead with new projects first and talk about the finances later, and those who want to do things the other way round. [Bollaert] What about cooperation with East Europe and the countries of the Mediterranean basin? [Prate] This made good progress in 1993, when we doubled the amount of financing. I could mention, among other things, the construction of the Algerian section of the Maghreb-Spain gas pipeline; the modernization of the Warsaw-Berlin rail link; and the action of the METAP (Technical Aid for the Environment in the Mediterranean), in which the World Bank, the European Commission, and the EIB have pooled their resources, in particular in the area of water management.
