We accommodate their wishes. An analysis of the material connected with the confirmation of the first military doctrine in the history of the Ukrainian state shows that in the discussion of the draft the people's deputies of Ukraine constantly raised two attendant questions--on the content of foreign policy and on the attitude toward weapons of mass destruction, since without a determination of the position on these two principal issues, adopting the Military Doctrine was practically impossible. This is why the members of parliament approved in a relatively short period of time three important documents: "Guidelines of the Foreign Policy of Ukraine" (2 July 1993), the Military Doctrine of Ukraine (19 October 1993), and the decree of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "Ratification of the Treaty Between the USSR and the United States on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms Signed in Moscow on 31 July 1991 and the Protocol Thereto Signed in Lisbon on Behalf of Ukraine on 23 May 1992" (18 November 1993). That is, while still in draft form, the Military Doctrine accelerated confirmation of base documents determining the content of the holy of holies of national security of our fatherland--the strategy of Ukraine's military security. It would be perfectly correct to call the "Guidelines of the Foreign Policy of Ukraine," therefore, the doctrine of the foreign policy of our state, which is of importance in an understanding of the theory and practice of our organizational development for defense. The qualitative state of contemporary military theory is reason to believe that the military scientists of the former Soviet Army have to their credit in the sphere of the theory of military doctrine output of a world standard. This permits the expectation in the future of the adoption of national military doctrines by many states of the former Union. The adoption of military doctrines by the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation are confirmation of this. I would like to emphasize particularly here that, as distinct from the said doctrines of the contiguous states, only the Military Doctrine of Ukraine has an open content. This is practical realization not only of the principle of a strengthening of trust in the military sphere but also the mentality of our people, which have throughout their history fought only defensive wars. This fundamental fact predetermined the defensive nature of the Military Doctrine of Ukraine. But the defensive focus of military organizational development does not simplify the creation of the military organization of a state which has embarked on the path of independent development. The sum total of objective and subjective factors that have determined the complexity of the organizational development of the army and navy of Ukraine is without counterpart in world practice. The assertion that there is a simple version of the transformation of the groupings of the troops and forces of the former Soviet Army located on our territory into the armed forces of Ukraine is from the scientific viewpoint absurd, and from the professional viewpoint, not serious. The organizational development of the armed forces of Ukraine is a problem of many levels requiring a comprehensive solution. If there is at all an unambiguous resolution of it, one word may be used to describe this path--intellectual. After all, only professionals with in-depth theoretical knowledge and firm practical skills can create a mechanism of effective military organizational development. It is essential for this to know not only the content of our national military doctrine but also the general approaches to its formation. Considering the phenomenon of the disintegration of superpowers and the complexity of military organizational development, military science toward the end of the 20th century has formulated its recommendations for states that have embarked on the path of independent development. In sum, these recommendations amount to the fact that it is expedient to build the military organization of a sovereign state in stages, on the principles of scientific content and legality. There is reason to believe that, despite perfectly permissible digressions, such recommendations of military science have been taken into consideration in Ukraine. At the first stage (from 16 July 1990 through 24 August 1991) Ukraine was determining its position with regard to its statehood. At the second stage (from 24 August 1991 through 3 January 1992) the Supreme Council of Ukraine had in anticipation prepared the prescriptive-legal base for the organizational development of its own armed forces. At the third stage (from 3 January 1992 through 19 October 1993) the organizational development of the army and navy began and the Military Doctrine was prepared and confirmed. Confirmation of the individual concepts of the organizational development of branches of the service, arms of the troops (forces), and headquarters components ensuing from the Military Doctrine is to be expected at the fourth stage, and at the fifth stage, confirmation of the official program of the organizational development of the armed forces and the official program of the development of arms and military equipment drawn up on the basis of these concepts. Today, being at the start of the fourth stage, it is not hard to anticipate that, first, the elaboration of the concepts and official programs will require tremendous input and that, second, the organizational development of the armed forces is a process of higher-than-usual research-intensiveness, which will require fundamentally new knowledge and abilities of military scientists and military specialists. The progressive nature of the future laws on military matters is expressed not only in the fact that the armed forces of Ukraine are authorized forces and resources for operations in all four environments--in space, in the air, on land, and at sea--but also in the fact that it is prescribed that the state have its own military doctrine. Military doctrine is a scientific category. Realized in the form of an official constitutional-level document, it negotiates two stages of opposition. The first--on the part of military scientists and military specialists in the period of elaboration of the draft, and the second, on the part of members of parliament at the time of confirmation. This fact makes permits the belief that ultimately military doctrine represents the sum total of victorious ideas in the sphere of assurance of military security and the organizational development of the armed forces and their use. The military doctrine of the state is commissioned by legislative mechanisms, but its draft is prepared mainly by scientific methods. In accordance with this principle, substantiation of the structure and content of the military doctrine is the main mission of military science. But, negotiating the procedure of confirmation, the military doctrine undergoes certain revisions, and, after its approval, military science begins to experience the influence of the doctrine. That is, there is quite a strict direct connection and feedback between military science and military doctrine. This is the first fundamental point. The second is as follows. There is every reason to believe that the latest knowledge has been taught in the military educational institutions in respect to the theory of military doctrine. But a comparison of the material of the debate in the journals VOYENNAYA MYSL and VOYENNYY VESTNIK of the Association of Independent Publications permits the conclusion that at the present time the theory of military doctrine is incomplete and cannot count on universality. The studies that have been conducted permit two conclusions. The first is that military doctrine should contain the sum total of precepts which permit its conjugation with the economic doctrine of the state. Otherwise there is a danger of the conversion of military doctrine into a military declaration divorced from the material basis of its state. The second is that it is essential that military doctrine have two groups of doctrinal precepts--classical (general) and specific (particular)--characteristic of the specific state. With this approach the theory of military doctrine may lay claim to universality. The classical doctrinal precepts in the Military Doctrine of Ukraine, therefore, are the causes of a possible war; the sources of military danger; the attitude of the state toward war; the basic tasks of the state in peacetime and wartime; ways of ensuring military security; the missions of the armed forces; the principles of the organizational development of the army and navy; qualitative indicators of the organizational development of the armed forces; focus of the training of the army and navy; the role and place of other structures of the military organization of the state; preparation of the state and society for defense; opportune preparation of the economy for support of the armed forces; and ways of realizing the military doctrine. Given such precepts, the military doctrine may be conjugal with the military doctrines of contiguous and other states and thus be the basis of the assurance of military security. The doctrinal precepts of the specific content ensue from the particular features of the geostrategic location of the state, the state of its economy, and the quantitative-qualitative indicators of the armed forces. For Ukraine such particular features might be as follows: The first--the state and its armed forces are built in organizational unity. Dividing these two processes into independent processes is practically impossible. By virtue of this fact, the crisis state of the economy is reflected with particular gravity in the combat capability of the army and navy. The second particular feature ensues from the specific character of the disposition of the groupings of troops and forces stationed on the territory of Ukraine. It has come about historically such that they were created in a different military-political situation, were built according to different strategic plans, and provided for different versions of military operations. In the course of the organizational development of the armed forces of Ukraine it will be necessary to transform the troops and forces of the former two strategic axes of the Union into groupings of troops and forces capable of warding off aggression on any axis. The third particular feature is expressed in the fact that there are no chemical, biological, or tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine. The process of the elimination of the strategic nuclear forces has begun. This factor predetermines the need for the creation in the process of organizational development of the army and navy of an equivalent capable of ensuring the military security of Ukraine as a nuclear-free and neutral state. The fourth particular feature consists of the existence of an intrinsic contradiction in the process of the organizational development of the armed forces. On the one hand it is essential to form full-fledged organs of command and control and large formations and units and, on the other, to reduce the quantity of the combat equipment to the quotas established by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, to which Ukraine is a subscriber. The fifth particular feature is connected with the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, which may be resolved only politically. Applying the methods of military science is very difficult here. The sixth particular feature is determined by the priority need for the formalization in a treaty and legal respect of the land border of Ukraine as a sovereign state. The seventh particular feature has sociopolitical roots. Even quite recently, from the start of the 1940's through the start of the 1950's, there were on the territory of Ukraine the elements of four wars: world, patriotic, civil, and national liberation. This phenomenon signified the enhanced role of the subjective factor, which is expressed in the fact that individual social strata continue to settle historical scores between themselves instead of seeking ways of consolidating society and building the state and armed forces of the future. Considering these particular features, the Military Doctrine of Ukraine realizes the following specific precepts: the strategic mission of the state; the role and place of Ukraine in Europe and the world; the content of military security; the role and place of military doctrine; the main military-political goal; the content of the foreign policy and military-political course; participation in the building of the structures of regional and international security; the attitude of the state toward weapons of mass destruction; the purpose of military-economic policy; scientific and technological priorities; ways of providing the army and navy with equipment; the procedure of the funding of programs of material and social support for the servicemen.
