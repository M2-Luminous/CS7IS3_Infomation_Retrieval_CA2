Elections-94": "Right, Left--Which Side?"] [Text] The weekly TSARA published in its 23 November issue a report from the press bureau of the Khynshet division of the KhDNF [Christian Democratic People's Front]. It says: "On 17 November the chairman of the Khynshet ispolkom [executive committee], Ion Donica, called together a limited number of individuals with leadership (and influential) functions in the rayon and also leaders of a number of villages and called for them to do everything within their power along with their relatives, loved ones, friends, and subordinates to block the Alliance of the KhDNF in this campaign. Following the example of the rayon "head," the village mayor Mindzhir, a lawyer by profession, in violation of Article 14 of the Law on Elections to Parliament, arbitrarily, without convening a village council for this purpose, formed local electoral commissions which included a good part of the brigade leaders of the farms--the most conservative elements, including the last secretary of the local party organization. On 18 November early in the morning, at a meeting of workers of the Mindzhir agricultural firm, he made public a list of members of precinct electoral commissions. When the violation of the Law on Elections to Parliament was pointed out to him, the mayor responded that the workers of the agricultural firm had been informed of them by way of a discussion. Violations of this kind were committed by the mayor of the village of Serata Galbene as well. The same newspaper printed an article by the candidate from the Alliance KhDNF electoral block, Eugeniu Garla. The author presents the main aspects of Moldovan-Romanian integration: The strategic basis of economic integration of the Republic of Moldova and Romania is the existence of a common economic space, which will provide for: free movement of the work force, capital, goods, and services; functioning of the financial-currency complex because of the unification of financial-currency, tax, banking, pricing, and rate system; and simultaneous implementation of economic reforms and joint implementation of the economic and social policy. The achievement of this goal will create the conditions for stable development of the economies of the two Romanian states based on market relations. * * * The chairman of the Democratic Labor Party, Aleksandr Arseni, also thinks that "relations with Romania must be strengthened and deepened." This is how he responded to a question from a DELOVAYA GAZETA correspondent: "We do not think that the Sangheli cabinet has done anything to introduce our country into the world community. Moreover, the leaders of Moldova have an especially kindly attitude toward the CIS. This is the only place where they can see the republic's salvation. They frequently cry on our shoulder and ask for things. But our party thinks that too much significance is being attached to the role of the CIS in the life of Moldova. With a different policy we could quite easily change our economic orientation and achieve success in economic management. "Unfortunately, the present prime minister of Moldova is not distinguished by his new thinking and is not prepared for this kind of dialogue with the world community. We are looking exclusively to the East. Yet there are people in the republic who have assimilated this thinking. Including in our party. The future is with them!" * * * A well-known deputy, a member of the ADPN [Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova], Nicolae Andronic, granted an interview to the weekly ZEMLYA I LYUDI. Here is how he views the situation that has developed in the republic: "Of course, I attribute all problems--economic, political, and others--to the fact that we do not now have unity of all political forces regarding the question of statehood. When all political forces are sincerely striving to create and strengthen the independence of one republic or another, when there is understanding of the fact that it is possible to maneuver, it is possible to join one bloc or another and then leave, but the main goal is to preserve independence. Take, for example, the Baltics. Regardless of their leanings--slants--all political parties of the Baltic region have the same center. And this center is independence. It is from here that the spiral develops. But what do we have here? Some see a panacea in one thing, some in another, and still others in something else. The political forces of the republic are fragmented and dispersed. Some are afraid of strong influence from the East, others--of strong influence from Romania. And all this is solely because of political skirmishes, for the republic's independence is seen by various people and various political parties from various angles." * * * A preelection address was delivered by the Socialist Party and the Unity Movement for Equal Rights, who are forming an electoral bloc: "PRESERVE AND DEVELOP the historically formed COMMON VALUES of our society--interethnic peace and harmony, territorial integrity, fraternal cooperation among people of various nationalities, national public ownership of the land, natural resources, large basic branches of industrial and agricultural production, efficient centralized administration of the national economic complex, mutually advantageous cooperation with all fraternal republics of the former USSR. "Our most important COMMON VALUE is the MOLDOVAN LANGUAGE and we must do everything possible to make sure that it is voluntarily mastered by all citizens of Moldova. A no less important COMMON VALUE is the bilingualism that has developed, especially in the cities, and extensive use of the RUSSIAN LANGUAGE, which almost all people living in Moldova have mastered. "Still an indisputable COMMON VALUE is the worker, the person employed in socially useful labor in the spheres of material and nonmaterial production and the sphere of labor itself. Thoughtless, hasty reform in this sphere on the basis of neocapitalistic ideas is a crime. "An enduring COMMON VALUE has been and will be the history of Moldova, including its Soviet period, which is characterized by rapid, historically unprecedented rates of socioeconomic development, the creation of the industrial and agrarian complexes, and the establishment of its science and systems of education, public health, and culture. "To RESTORE and DEVELOP these unjustifiably lost COMMON VALUES, and above all those such as full, universal employment without degrading the human dignity of unemployment, which entire generations of workers have not known, a guarantee of job placement for all graduates of schools, vocational and technical schools, and secondary and higher educational institutions, unconditional and effective social protection of pensioners, children, and youth, large families and disabled persons, free education and medical service, legal protection, a state program for housing construction and provision of housing, representation of all social groups in legislative organs at all levels, public monitoring of the activity of the executive power, and elections of judges and people's assessors."
