The station will broadcast colorful locally-made or translated Chinese and foreign films, TV plays and other artistic programs in the Kazak language to about 500,000 viewers all over the Asia- Pacific region who have waved farewell to nomadic lives. The 1.1-million Kazak population is mainly scattered in Xinjiang and Gansu Province. Traditionally the Kazaks have lived on horseback, spending their whole lives moving about seeking pasture and water for their herds, totally cut off from basic education and health care facilities, not to mention advanced culture. In recent years state and local governments have encouraged and helped more and more nomadic Kazaks to settle down and engage in the processing of livestock products instead of their single traditional pursuit of animal husbandry. Along with efforts to stimulate local economy, governments at all levels have attached great importance to promoting traditional Kazak culture to satisfaction of the Kazak people's spiritual needs. Broadcast and television have been cited to perform the task, having the advantages of being rapid, popular and vivid. In 1989 the first Kazak-language TV news programs were beamed to the whole autonomous region, enabling Kazaks along both sides of the Tianshan Mountains to be well informed and entertain through a product of modern civilization for the first time in their lives. Moreover, 24-hour Kazak-language TV broadcasting programs have been offered since the end of last year by the local regional TV station. Traditional Khazak culture, including ancient poems, fairy tales, proverbs and mottoes, which used to be transmitted mainly by storytellers, has spread even wider among the Kazak people thanks to TV and radio broadcasts with distinct local flavors.
