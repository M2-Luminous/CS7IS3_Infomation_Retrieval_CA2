He arrived on a three-day official visit to Russia on Sunday. Sharing his impressions of his trip in the Kola peninsula, the British diplomat noted that this region has great prospects. They are linked with the development of the Murmansk port, vast natural resources and talent of the people living here. Upon return to Great Britain Hurd is expected to meet with representatives of business circles and tell them about the results of his journey. He stressed that it is necessary to pay a special attention to humanitarian cooperation. Great Britain plans to finance a blood cancer treatment project and to provide necessary equipment to one of the Murmansk hospitals, the British foreign minister pointed out. Head of the British Foreign Office Douglas Hurd and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev offered flowers at the memorial in honour of British and U.S. navy personnel who were killed while conducting sea convoys with allied aid to Murmansk. The heads of foreign departments visited the navy museum. They had conversation with commander of the Northern Sea Fleet Admiral Oleg Yerofeyev on board the cruiser "Admiral Nakhimov". The day before the talks Andrey Kozyrev had noted that as of today Russian nuclear force rockets are no longer targeted at Great Britain, similarly British missiles are also no longer aimed at Russia. This symbolises new relations of trust between the two countries, Kozyrev said. Douglas Hurd and Andrey Kozyrev left by a special plane for Moscow the same day. The British foreign minister will continue discussing bilateral cooperation. In particular, he is to meet with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Then he will leave Moscow for Kiev. Replying to a question about the aim of this visit to Kiev, the British diplomat said that during his one-day visit to Ukraine he will meet with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Great Britain wants to assist democratic reforms and Ukraine's movement towards the market economy as well as to see Ukraine live in peace with its neighbours, especially with Russia, Douglas Hurd added.
