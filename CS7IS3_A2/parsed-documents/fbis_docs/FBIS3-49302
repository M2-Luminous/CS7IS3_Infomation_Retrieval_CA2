It seems that its focal point lies in the preparation for the incorporation into NATO of the Czech Republic, and also of other postcommunist states. After all, this is confirmed by the visit of Madeleine Albright and General John Shalikashvili. They are coming with the "Partnership for Peace" plan. Or am I mistaken? Are there other important matters related to this visit? [Havel] I consider it a privilege for our republic that President Clinton will stop here during his important European tour and that it is here that he will be meeting representatives of neighboring countries. I myself consider this to be an expression of respect for the successes of the Czech Republic, an expression of recognition of the traditionally good U.S.-Czech relations. The main, although certainly not the only, subject of our talks will probably be our position in the newly shaping European order, which will relate not only to security. President Clinton will arrive from Brussels, where the NATO summit is taking place, and he will probably interpret the "Partnership for Peace" plan to us. We will expound our attitude toward it. At the same time, however, there are more things at stake here. What this is really about is where we belong and what values of civilization we acknowledge. I am sure that there will be an opportunity to raise this because I know that President Clinton is a man capable of listening to others. I myself was surprised when I visited him in Washington to find how little he talked himself and how much he asked. He is a man who is curious about the other person's opinion, who is open to knowledge, who wants to be informed, and I think these are also the prerequisites for our being able to express our views. [Pavrovsky] Mr. President, you have undoubtedly very good memories of President Bush, President Clinton's predecessor. If you were to recall all this and if you were to comment on the differences between these two administrations or in U.S. policy, what would you say? It is in effect a change of party in the U.S. Government. [Havel] [passage omitted] My personal relationship with President Bush was excellent, and my cooperation with the Republican administration was good. We certainly have not forgotten what the previous administration did to boost our good relations. It was at the time when we got rid of communism, and the United States treated us in a very accommodating manner. The situation has changed, however. There is a new administration, and we shall naturally be seeking good relations with this administration. In the spiritual ethos of a Democratic administration, there is something that is close to my heart. I mentioned this on more than one occasion in our previous conversations. I hope that this will have a favorable impact on the serious political negotiations we shall have. [Pavrovsky] Slovakia and other postcommunist countries think that they should enter NATO or make joint moves leading to their entering NATO. Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said on behalf of the Czech Republic that this should happen on an individual basis. [Havel] Czech policy lays correct emphasis on the fact that we are independent countries that have to act on their own and that have to follow their own interests. We cannot forever be tarred with the same brush of being postcommunist countries, or former Warsaw Pact members, and so on and so forth. However, that does not at all mean that we should not maintain the best possible relations with our immediate neighbors. I believe we will have an opportunity to emphasize on behalf of the Czech Republic that our position does not at all mean that we do not want to cooperate on all levels where it is advantageous for all the participants, or that we wish to elevate ourselves above others. We shall be able to emphasize that we are independent states. The world will have to get used to this fact and will have to shed the tendency to tar certain countries with the same brush and make life easier by inadvertently pushing them into forming a bloc because it is quicker to negotiate with a bloc than separately with each of the countries. [Pavrovsky] Attempts by postcommunist countries to join NATO are very strongly opposed by the Russian leadership. Mr. President, what do you think about Mr. Zhirinovskiy's actions and behavior? [Havel] To be honest, I am not very much interested in Mr. Zhirinovskiy's rather wild pronouncements. What I am interested in is to what extent he voices openly and harshly something that has lain dormant in the consciousness of Russian society and whether others do not express such cruel harshness just because it is inappropriate to do so. That is a matter that would be worth exploring, rather than exploring Mr. Zhirinovskiy as a phenomenon. [passage omitted] [Pavrovsky] Mrs. Rita Klimova, the first envoy of our state to the United States, has died. I know you were friends. [Havel] I ought to say that her death was quite painful for me. I held her in high esteem as a very frank, courageous, and wise woman. She was a splendid ambassador of our country to the United States and did a great deal for our republic. [passage omitted]
