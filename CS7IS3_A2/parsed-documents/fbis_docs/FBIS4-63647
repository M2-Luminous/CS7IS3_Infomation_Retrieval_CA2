The international community, alarmed by a negative development of events possible in the Crimea, voices its unequivocal support for the position expressed in the letter by the Ukrainian foreign minister. Anatoliy Zlenko today received William Miller, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, at his request. The American diplomat handed over to Mr. Zlenko a personal message from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher which, in particular, noted that the United States recognizes and highly praises Ukraine's responsible and peaceful position on the developments in the Crimea. In response to destabilizing processes in the Crimea, Ukraine acts according to high principles of the CSCE, with which all of us seek to comply. Any other actions could lead to confrontation, which would not suit the interests of all sides. The United States, the message emphasized, supports the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine in its present borders. The United States seeks to expand and deepen relations with Ukraine, and would like to move forward quickly in assisting Ukraine through economic incentive programs that would be useful for the whole country, including the Crimea.
