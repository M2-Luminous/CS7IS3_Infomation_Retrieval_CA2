He said the strikes would negatively influence a plan for a peaceful settlement because they would make the Bosnian Serbs more hostile and the Moslems more irreconcilable. The diplomat said that the special envoy of the Russian President, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, currently in the Balkan countries, left Zagreb Wednesday for Belgrade to again meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The diplomat preferred not to provide the details of the trip. He only said that it was dictated by "supreme interests." He confirmed that recently the command of the UN protection force in the former Yugoslavia attempted, ignoring Moscow, to send part of the Russian servicemen from the battalion stationed in Slavonia (Croatia), to Sarajevo. "We reacted with a demarche, after which the command of the UN Protection Force apologized and said that in the future the decision on the location of the Russian servicemen will be taken after preliminary consultations with Moscow, said the diplomat. He, however, did not deny that the Russian "blue helmets" may be deployed near the Bosnian capital. He said, however, that this would only happen if the conflicting sides agree to such a measure, in which case the question of the NATO bombing would be crossed out from the agenda and reinforcements will be needed to back up the UN troops deployed around Sarajevo. But even in such a case, the last word would be Moscow's, he concluded. Sources in the State Duma told Interfax that members of the parliamentary committee for geopolitics, which on Tuesday considered the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, decided, after the consultations with Russian Foreign Ministry experts, to give up the appeal to restore the former Yugoslavia. According to one deputy, the new wording of the committee's resolution will contain an appeal to all Bosnian factions to halt, as early as possible, bloodshed and to forgive the offences of the past.
