The project, approved by the State Council, is scheduled to start late next year and be completed in three years. The network will be centered in Yima city, a key coal production base in the province. It will consist of a gasification plant and a pipeline network. Pithead coal gasification plants will be built at the Yima coal mines. The first phase of the construction will be aimed at producing 1.2 million cu m of coal gas a day, 290,000 cu m of which will be used to make petrochemical products and the rest supplied to Luoyang and Zhengzhou cities for household use. The second phase aims at a daily output of 2.4 million cu m of gas to ensure supplies to the other key cities of Kaifeng, Sanmenxia, Xuchang and Xinxiang. Local officials predict that the construction of the network will also help improve pollution control and spur local economic development. The province plans to use foreign funds and import advanced technologies and equipment from other countries for the project.
