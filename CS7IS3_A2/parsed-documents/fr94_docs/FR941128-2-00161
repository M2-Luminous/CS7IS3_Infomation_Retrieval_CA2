FR941128-2-00161 FR941128-2-00085 With respect to AEP equity financing, AEP proposes to issue and sell up to 10 million additional shares (``Shares'') of its common stock, par value $6.50 per share, which are authorized but unissued or held by AEP, provided that the gross proceeds from such sale will not exceed $300 million. AEP proposes to effect the issuance and sale by competitive bidding, negotiations with underwriters or agents, or agents at market prices. The Commission is requested to reserve jurisdiction over the issuance and sale by AEP of the Shares pending completion of the record. With respect to long-term debt financing, AEP and Resources also request authorization to issue and sell through June 30, 1997 promissory notes (``Long-term Notes'') in the aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million to one or more commercial banks, financial institutions or other institutions or other investors pursuant to one or more loan agreements (``Proposed Agreement''). The Proposed Agreement and the Long-term Notes thereunder would be for a term of not less than nine months nor more than twenty years. The Proposed Agreement would provide that the Long-term Notes bear interest at either a fixed rate, a fluctuating rate or some combination of fixed and fluctuating rates. Any fixed rate of interest of the Long-term Notes will not be greater than 250 basis points above the yield at the time of issuance of the Long-term Notes of United States Treasury obligations (``Applicable Treasury Rate''). Any fluctuating rate will not be greater than 200 basis points above the rate of interest announced publicly by a major bank as its base or prime rate (``Prime Rate''). If the indebtedness is denominated in the currency of a country other than the United States, the fixed or floating rate, when adjusted for inflation in such country, will not be greater than 700 basis points over the Applicable Treasury Rate or Prime Rate. With respect to short-term debt financing, AEP and Resources request authorization to incur such indebtedness through June 30, 1997 through the issuance and sale of notes to banks and, in the case of AEP, commercial paper to dealers in commercial paper in an aggregate amount not to exceed $300 million. Borrowings under the lines of credit would generally bear interest at an annual rate not greater than the prime commercial rate in effect from time to time. The total annual cost of borrowings under all such bank lines is estimated to be not greater than the effective rate for borrowings bearing interest at the prime commercial rate with compensating balances of up to 10% of the line of credit. The effective annual interest cost under any of the above arrangements, assuming full use of the line of credit, will not exceed 125% of the prime commercial rate in effect from time to time, or not more than 10.625% on the basis of a prime commercial rate of 8.50%. Commercial paper will be sold directly by AEP to dealers in commercial paper. The commercial paper will be in the form of promissory notes in denominations of not less than $50,000, and of varying maturities, with no maturity more than 270 days after the date of issue. Such notes will not be prepayable prior to maturity and will be sold at a discount rate not to excess of the discount rate per annum prevailing at the time of issuance for commercial paper of comparable quality and maturity. The application-declaration states that it may be necessary from time to time for AEP to guarantee certain indebtedness or other financial commitments of Resources, for AEP or Resources to guarantee certain indebtedness or financial commitments of a Project Parent or Power Project in which they may invest, or for a Project Parent to guarantee certain indebtedness or financial commitments of a FUCO or EWG in which it may invest. The terms and conditions of such guarantees would be negotiated in individual cases, would vary in duration, and may be contingent and conditional or absolute and unconditional. AEP and Resources request authority to issue, or have Project Parents issue, from time to time through June 30, 1997, up to $300 million in guarantees provided that any guarantee outstanding on June 30, 1997 would expire or terminate in accordance with its terms. AEP will not sell any Shares and neither AEP nor Resources will incur any indebtedness or issue, or have a Project Parent issue, any guarantee if the gross proceeds of all Shares and the principal amount of all indebtedness and all guarantees authorized hereunder would exceed $300 million. AEP intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares or the short-term or long-term indebtedness to make additional investments in Resources and direct or indirect investments in Power Projects. Resources intends to use such funds from AEP and the net proceeds from any short-term or long-term indebtedness to make direct or indirect investments in Power Projects. Investments in Resources by AEP would be by acquisitions of common stock, capital contributions, open account advances and/or loans. Open account advances or loans would bear interest at a rate based on the cost of funds to AEP in effect on the date of issue. If AEP uses the proceeds of long-term indebtedness to fund such investment, then the interest rate will be the same as that of the term loan. If AEP uses the proceeds of short-term borrowings to fund such investment, then the cost of such funds will be the interest rate of short-term borrowings_that is, would generally bear interest at an annual rate not greater than the prime commercial rate in effect from time to time. AEP and Resources request authority to make direct or indirect investments in Project Parents in an aggregate amount not to exceed $300 million. It is proposed that investments by AEP and Resources in any Project Parent may take the form of (i) purchases of capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing, (ii) open account advances or loans, and/or (iii) guarantees by AEP or Resources. Open account advances or loans to a Project Parent would bear interest at a rate based on cost of funds to AEP or Resources on the date of issue. Any open account advance or loan may be converted to a capital contribution to such Project Parent. Funds for any open account advances or loans by AEP or Resources in any Project Parent will be derived from the sale of common stock and/or the issuance of short-term and long-term indebtedness or guarantees and from available cash. Approval is requested for Project Parents to issue short-term and long-term indebtedness to persons other than AEP or Resources which would be guaranteed by AEP or Resources (``Recourse Debt''). Recourse Debt would be subject to the same terms and conditions as indebtedness of AEP and Resources. Approval is also requested for any Project Parent to issue equity securities and debt securities to persons other than AEP or Resources (``Non-Recourse Securities'') exclusively for the purpose of financing investments in Exempt Subsidiaries. It is proposed that the aggregate principal amount of non-recourse debt securities issued by Project Parents to persons other than AEP and Resources will not exceed $800 million provided that no more than $200 million principal amount may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.
