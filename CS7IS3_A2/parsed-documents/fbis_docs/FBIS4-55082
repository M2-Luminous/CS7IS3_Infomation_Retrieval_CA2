This took place at a session of a WEU consultative forum which was attended by Foreign Affairs Minister Josef Zieleniec and Defense Minister Antonin Baudys. Our special correspondent Klara Stejskalova reports from Luxembourg: [Stejskalova] The WEU is the only European organization with authority on security questions. It brings together 10 countries of the European Twelve. The countries of eastern and central Europe -- that is, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and the three Baltic republics, apart from the Czech Republic -- have so far had observer status only. Associate partner status means, according to Jozef Zieleniec, that our contact with the WEU will cease to be diplomatic and will become a working one. This means that we are becoming more and more a part of the mechanism of European integration. He said the WEU will now become an organization that will gradually take over the role of security guarantor in Europe. Today can be marked as significant. At last we can participate, by our vote, in formulating various aspects of policy; for example, a center for planning European identity has been formed, among other things. [passage omitted] On the other hand one has to admit that the associate countries can take part in discussions, but cannot block decisions. Associate status is thus, to some extent, a mere formality which certainly does not mean an increase in our security.
