FBIS4-54106 "dreas101_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 South Korea Dailies View Chongnyon Money Flow, Power Struggle Dailies View Chongnyon Money Flow, Power Struggle SK2305140194 SK2305140194 BFN [Editorial Report] On 23 May, ROK vernacular newspapers carry articles on the current situation of the money flow to North Korea by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and its power struggle. On page 23, the moderate HANGUK ILBO carries an 800-word article by reporter Hong Yun-o on the 39th anniversary of the founding of Chongnyon which is 25 May. The article starts off by noting that there are moves in Chongnyon's organization because of the fact that the work to repatriate Korean residents in Japan to North Korea has failed, that North Korea is falling into isolation, and that moves are being made for sanctions against North Korea by the international community. Citing NAEWOE News Agency, the article notes that celebrations of the 39th anniversary of Chongnyon's founding will be held without its chairman, Han Tok-su, who is currently in Pyongyang amid various rumors. It notes that currently the responsible Vice Chairman Ho Chong-man is actually leading the group since it changed its organization in 1992 to a one-man chairman and a nine-men vice chairmen system. The article concludes by saying that a stumbling block in normalizing Japan-North Korean relations stems from the fact that North Korea has even prohibited Japanese women married to Chongnyon members from visiting Japan freely. On page 8, the pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries a 900-word article by reporter Ku Pon-yong from the "North Korea Today" column on the intense power struggle within Chongnyon. The article begins by noting that since Chongnyon Chairman Han Tok-su returned to Pyongyang, internal discord has intensified. The article continues to speculate why Han Tok-su, who has diverted Chongnyon's assets to his aides and under his name, returned to Pyongyang, noting that since he has a hold of Chongnyon's assets, he must not be irritated. It notes that there are signs that Ho Chong-man, who emerged as Chongnyon's responsible vice chairman, is being supported by Kim Chong-il, and his opposing forces will be at odds with each other for power within Chongnyon. It notes that originally First Vice Chairman Yi Chin-kyu was to take Han Tok-su's place, but rather Ho Chong-man, who is well versed in Chongnyon's money flow, was appointed. The article says Chongnyon's businessmen speculate that the appointment of Ho Chong-man is an advance measure to shelter Chongnyon's assets for North Korea, thus some Chongnyon businessmen are filing lawsuits to recover real estate which they donated to Chongnyon. The article concludes by saying that movements to urge to guarantee human rights within North Korea and others which are being promoted centering on human rights organizations in Japan are other elements that are accelerating unrest within Chongnyon. On page 4, the moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries a 1,200-word article by reporter No Ung-kun on the scale of Japan's remittance of money to North Korea. The article introduces an article carried by Japan's contemporary economic journal, NIKKEI BUSINESS, on how much money is actually being sent to North Korea by Japan. It notes that no one knows the exact amount of money being remitted, but experts predict it to be around $1.8 billion annually. The article continues to cite NIKKEI BUSINESS saying that the money sent to North Korea by Chongnyon is about $600-700 million, and that a larger amount of money is remitted to North Korea through a third country. On page 20, KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries a 1,400-word article by reporter Kim Pung-son from the "North Korean News" column on why Han Tok-su, Chongnyon's number one man, was returned to North Korea. The article starts off by saying that the reason for his return may be to bring in Chongnyon's assets to North Korea. The article carries an analysis made by NAEWOE News Agency on why Han Tok-su returned to North Korea. The first analysis is that if Han Tok-su remains in Japan, it may have a bad influence in consolidating the Kim Chong-il succession system. The second analysis is that it is to restructure Chongnyon's organization and return Han Tok-su's enormous assets to North Korea. The analysis then writes about Han Tok-su's influence and about appointing Ho Chong-man as Chongnyon's responsible vice chairman. It continues to write about Ho Chong-man's ambition, his position at Chongnyon, and his faithfulness to Chongnyon.
