He said the procedures for determining the country's political leadership had long been in place and had been implemented at presidential elections every five years since 1968. Speaking to Religious Affairs Minister Tarmizi Taher at the Istana yesterday, Mr Suharto said he was a man who abided by the constitution and its provisions, which include one which states that a President is elected to serve a five-year term. Mr Suharto, 72, pointed out that having been entrusted with the position by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) last year, he would end his term "in accordance with the Constitution". The provisions also say that a candidate can be re-elected and no limit is stipulated. In keeping with his long-held position on the leadership succession issue, Mr Suharto did not say whether he intended to seek re-election for a new term in 1998, but said he intended to serve out the current term. The closest he had come to saying that he might step down was in a biography released in 1989. But in view of the support given to him by political parties and the military in late 1992, he said that such endorsement and support was a call to duty and service which he could not dismiss. He then went on to accept the nomination and was elected last March to his sixth straight five-year term. Mr Suharto has maintained at each occasion that it is the people, through their representatives in the MPR -- the country's highest legislative body -- who decide every five years who their future leader should be. Mr Tarmizi, who met the President to report on his visits to Saudi Arabia and Malaysia recently, used the occasion to raise the succession question on behalf of a number of local religious leaders. These leaders had questioned Mr Tarmizi about Mr Suharto's earlier remarks that he would not be President for life and that he knew when to step down. Mr Suharto responded by pointing out that procedures for determining the country's political leaders were in place. He also urged against too uninhibited a discussion on the issue. Political scientist Amien Rais first suggested last December that the succession issue should be discussed openly. After some initial reaction, the move died down when the ruling Golkar [Functional Group] party, of which Mr Suharto is de facto leader, rejected the idea. It resurfaced last week after American academic Donald Wilson told reporters after meeting Mr Suharto that the Indonesian leader had said he did not intend to be President for life and that "I will step down right on time".
