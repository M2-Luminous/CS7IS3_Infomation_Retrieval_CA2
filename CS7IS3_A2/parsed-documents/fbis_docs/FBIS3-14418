The team reported on the progress made -- although no agreements were reached -- on what is called security in the territories, or more to the point, the observers and Palestinian police force in Hebron. The following agreements are being worked on: About 100 Norwegians will be deployed as an observer force. They will be armed with revolvers. The Palestinian force will apparently be made up of several dozen policemen, which will belong to the Hebron Municipality and be linked to the Palestinian police force to be set up in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, while operationally it will be subordinate to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. This is the deal being worked out. One of those who participated in this morning's meeting is Minister Yosi Sarid who is on the telephone with us. [Raz] There is talk of restrained optimism. Can you tell us on what we should be optimistic and on what pessimistic? [Sarid] Not only can I not expand, but I do not want to. In fact, I even wish to minimize. I think all the figures being mentioned are very imprecise, and I do not think it is proper to make a commitment about a figure. There are still differences between our position and that of the Palestinians. We will now try to bridge the gaps, but I would not like to mention a figure. I recommend treating any figure mentioned with circumspection. [Raz] Minister Sarid, is the problem one of figures, since I believe that the understandings being worked out refer to about 100 Norwegian observers and several dozen Palestinian policemen. [Sarid] I do not want to go into that because I do not think we should go into numbers, since as I have already said that figure is so imprecise. [Raz] Is the problem one of numbers while the principle of deploying observers and a Palestinian police in Hebron has been agreed on? [Sarid] I think Israel has already agreed to a Palestinian urban police force. We still have many problems relating to its size, powers, and to whom it will report, that still have to be resolved. The same is true about the international presence. I think that in principle the matter is agreed on, but there are issues which still have to be resolved. [Raz] What was the mood of the Palestinians you met? Are they still trying to dictate to us terms for the resumption of the autonomy talks? [Sarid] First, I did not meet them, therefore I cannot say, but I think that based on the report we received from the Israeli delegation, we got the impression that there were deep deliberations. I do not think that any ultimatum was issued. What is perhaps important to note is that both sides appear committed to continuing the process and that they want to make progress since both understand it is vital in the present situation. [Raz] Was it hinted to them in some, as reported by one of the newspapers, that the Jewish settlement in Tall al-Rumaythah will be uprooted immediately after Passover? [Sarid] Nothing like that was hinted to them. I reiterate, if the Israeli Government one day makes a decision on the relocation of the Jewish settlement in Hebron it will do so totally unrelated to the negotiations with the PLO and to any PLO demands. It will be an independent decision by the Israeli Government based on clear-cut security reasons. [Raz] Minister Sarid, this morning Foreign Minister Peres said that assuming the Gaza-Jericho talks open in Cairo, they can be completed within two to three weeks. Does that assumption remain intact following the consultations at the prime minister's bureau? [Sarid] I usually support the foreign minister's evaluation. I believe that in addition to both sides being committed to the negotiations, there is also a desire by both to speed them up and complete them as soon as possible while remaining as loyal as possible to the original dates in the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. As is known, due to what happened in Hebron, time was lost, therefore it is difficult to assume we will totally meet the original dates, but they will hopefully be as close as possible to the date in the DOP. [Raz] Does that means that the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will start in the first third of April? [Sarid] I do not want to make a commitment about any specific date; I think that would be wrong. We always know there can be unanticipated events. I said, and I am prepared to say so again, that whoever views late May as the date when the implementation of the DOP can take place, will not be far off, but that is merely an assumption. [Raz] One more question. Minister Sarid, after Sunday's cabinet meeting you said that the time is drawing near when a decision will have to be made about evacuating Hebron since otherwise the whole country will go up in flames. Are we drawing close to that date? [Sarid] That is my personal view. I do not think we can put off for long decisions which have to be made, but they have to be made independently irrespective of the negotiations since the situation calls for them.
