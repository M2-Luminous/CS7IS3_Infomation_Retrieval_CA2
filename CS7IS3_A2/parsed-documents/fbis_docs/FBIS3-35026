[Al-Majali] Very regrettably and unfortunately Israel has succeeded in convincing the U.S. decisionmakers that the only road to peace lies in giving it the upper hand. This is wrong. When you give people more power they become obstinate in the quest for peace. The balance is currently largely tilted in favor of Israel. We feel uneasy when Israel obtains sophisticated weapons at a time when we do not have even the basic requirements to defend ourselves. Peace is for all and not for one single state. [Finnigan] Do you think Israel is still the main danger threatening Jordan? [Al-Majali] Yes, indeed, only because it forced out all those Palestinian refugees and evacuees and imposed them on us. Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have not at all felt that way. [Finnigan] You mean that Israel's threat to Jordan stems from the activities which might lead to instability in Jordan rather than from a direct attack on Jordan. [Al-Majali] Quite right. I do not think the world will allow any state to attack Jordan, but there are no guarantees and you do not know everything. [Finnigan] I know that Israel raised one issue at the peace talks, that is, holding joint exercises with Jordan. [Al-Majali] How can we hold joint exercises with them while they are still occupying our land? What shall I do if I have problems regarding water resources that were seized by Israel? This is premature. You have to be very friendly with another state before you can conduct exercises, and exercises with Israel against who, Saudi Arabia or Egypt? One has to be realistic. Time will come, as was the case with France and Germany, when we can work together for the creation of one army. However, one should not jump to this subject all of a sudden. [Finnigan] What about confidence-building measures like aerial reconnaissance sorties? [Al-Majali] Why should we fly over Israel or vice versa? Trust should come first. When the basic problems are solved, normalization will follow. The basic problems should first be solved. [Finnigan] What will peace mean for Jordan militarily? [Al-Majali] The number of our Armed Forces personnel, compared with the population, is one of the highest in the world due to our location. This creates financial problems and burdens. This is partly due to the fact that we have not only protected Jordan, but maintained stability in the region for a long time. Peace does not mean that you get rid of the army; peace requires guards and people to protect it. [Finnigan] Obviously you will need to purchase or procure new capabilities designed specifically to improve your ability to combat terrorism. Does this mean you will be forced to spend more on armament? [Al-Majali] Dangers after peace are not less than the post-war dangers. People's expectations will rise and will have an impact on security. Therefore, you have to have a strong and well-trained army to deal with this situation. Some tasks should be changed as necessary, and this does not last for ever. When peace prevails and is firmly entrenched in the region, there will be no need for large armed forces. [Finnigan] What should the United States do to support your armed forces? [Al-Majali] I hope the United States will care for us as it does for other states and create a sound balance of power. We need the United States' assistance to refurbish the armed forces and provide training as it is doing for other states. [Finnigan] What sort of military hardware does Jordan need from the United States? [Al-Majali] Basic things to defend ourselves like ammunition for training and spare parts. [Finnigan] What is the importance of relieving Jordan of its debts, particularly the military debts? [Al-Majali] We owe debts, mostly military, to the United States, Britain, France, and other European countries. We hope to be treated in the same way as other states. We expect a balanced consideration of these matters in order to write off these debts. We do not conceive a stable peace between Israel and Jordan or Israel and the neighboring states in the presence of debts. [Finnigan] Should Jordan be treated the way Israel and Egypt are treated? [Al-Majali] I think so. We are peace partners. The matter is not one of size, but geographic location. It is a matter of confidence. Jordan has built confidence throughout the past years. [Finnigan] How can the U.S. reponse be described thus far? [Al-Majali] Unfortunately, what is given to Jordan is a drop in the ocean when compared with what is given to Israel. It is very little, less than 5 percent of what is given to Israel. [Finnigan] Is there a relaxation in ties with some Gulf states? [Al-Majali] Yes, there has been a change in ties with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar although such a change is still difficult with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. We still say we were misunderstood during the Gulf crisis. We are against occupation by any party, but we sought to end this occupation through the Arabs themselves without any foreign assistance. We were misunderstood and were depicted as if we stood beside the attacking forces although we did not do so. [Finnigan] Saudi Arabia has asked for a public apology. Is this acceptable to Jordan? [Al-Majali] The Jordanian Government would have to make a mistake before it could apologize. We did not undertake any action to harm Saudi Arabia or the other Gulf states. [Finnigan] The Kuwaiti officials say Jordan has not accepted the Kuwait-Iraq borders as delineated by the United Nations. [Al-Majali] We have not at all accepted borders between any other two states. The issue of borders is their own affair. Have we recognized the old borders? This is an issue between two neighbors. [Finnigan] Do the cool relations with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait place considerable hurdles in the way of creating Jordanian rapid deployment forces? [Al-Majali] Yes, indeed. How can rapid deployment forces operate if these two states are closed to them. We believe that Arab reconciliation should come as soon as possible. The absence of reconciliation will harm us all. If Jordan was unstable, the entire region would be unstable. [Finnigan] This means the formation of Jordanian rapid forces will need more years? [Al-Majali] Yes, we are prepared and we continue to train our forces. We hope that these forces will be formed in good time once reconciliation is realized.
