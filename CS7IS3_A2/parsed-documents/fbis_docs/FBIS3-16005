Two other people were hurt and more could be buried under the ruins of the headquarters of the Mkhedrioni (knights), a former militia now part of the regular armed forces, where the strongest blast occurred, the ministry said. Three smaller explosions occurred at the main tax department in the city. Georgia, which in two years has seen a coup and two civil wars, is currently the theatre of a power struggle between the Security and Defence Ministries as well as uncontrolled banditry. The Mkhedrioni, loyal to the president of the Georgian emergency committee, Djaba Iosseliani, had one of their regional officers killed at the end of January. On February 3, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in Tbilisi, Deputy Defence Minister Nikolai Kekelidze was killed by a bomb at his home, and Defence Minister Georgi Karkarashvili was wounded by a second blast while visiting the scene.
