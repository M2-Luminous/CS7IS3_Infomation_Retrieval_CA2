The minister told the press before his meeting with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the Russian Far East city of Vladivostok that both Russia and the United States have no other choice but to enter into relations of partnership. However, such a relationship does not mean that one party should restrain its actions while the other enjoys much freedom. He also rejected the idea that the U.S. is the senior partner while Russia is junior. Russia-U.S. relations fell back in the past two months due to their different positions on the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict and the espionage issue. The meeting between the two ministers is expected to focus on "mending bilateral relations" and on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Middle East issue. Kozyrev said this meeting will provide a change for the two countries to establish their relations of strategic partnership on a mature basis. He suggested that in establishing relations of partnership, Russia should not follow every step of the West and Russians should not have the idea that partnership means no conflict or problem between the two countries. He noted that every pragmatic politician must understand two basic facts. Firstly, Russian is a big nation. Therefore, it should not be treated as a small brother but as an equal partner. Secondly, relations of partnership should not sacrifice Russia's policies of national interest. The Russian foreign minister criticized the "wild fantasy" by some people of regarding the United States as "the sole leader of the present world." He said in the present world the U.S is not able to solve every problem by its own. Russia, though is facing many difficulties, is still a big power in that it has nuclear weapons as well as a strong military force, he added.
