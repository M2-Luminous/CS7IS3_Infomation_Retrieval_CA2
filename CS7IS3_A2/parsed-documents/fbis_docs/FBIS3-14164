Could you tell us about the foundations of the Palestinian position on the negotiations during the coming stage? [Ghawshah] As of this moment, no decision has been made by the PLO Executive Committee or by the Palestinian leadership to resume the negotiations. After the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, a decision was made to suspend the negotiations until the Security Council adopted a resolution. The Security Council has now passed Resolution 904, which includes a series of measures for Israel to carry out--such as disarming the settlers and providing for an international presence--and some other steps that concern the United States and Russia, the cosponsors of the Madrid Conference, to ensure the implementation of these measures. As of this moment, nothing has been implemented. During the recent talks held in Tunis with the Israelis, the U.S. envoy and his delegation, the Russian envoy, and Norwegian envoy Mr. Larsen, the discussion focused on the need to set up a mechanism for implementing Security Council Resolution 904. [Al-Jundi] So it is clear that the Palestinian side is eager to secure international protection for the Palestinians inside the occupied territories so that such massacre will not recur? [Ghawshah] Yes. Thus, the PLO leadership has underlined a number of issues, including the question of international protection and the need for the presence of international observers as stipulated under the Security Council resolution, and the disarming of settlers and confiscation of their weapons, which is also specified under the Security Council resolution. The PLO leadership has reiterated a number of demands: namely, international protection, the entry of a Palestinian police force into Hebron, the formation of tripartite patrols made up of international observers, Palestinian police, and Israeli police to ensure security in Hebron, and the need to ensure that the settlers leave the city. [Al-Jundi] But how can the Palestinians benefit from the Israeli offer to expedite the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [DOP]? [Ghawshah] Before we talk about implementing the DOP we must first talk about a delicate and more urgent issue than the DOP, and that is the question of the settlers. How can the DOP be implemented when Israel continues to procrastinate over pulling the settlers out of Hebron? The urgent and basic question on which the Palestinian people want to see practical and tangible measures is the Security Council resolution, the withdrawal of the settlers from Hebron, and the banning of the settlers from carrying their weapons around among the defenseless Palestinians, who are being murdered and annihilated by the settlers and the Israeli Army. The Palestinian leadership will study the situation and make appropriate decisions in light of Israel's answers and practical measures, either deciding to resume the talks or to continue their suspension because of Israeli procrastination and failure to implement tangible and practical measures after the Hebron massacre. [Al-Jundi] Do you believe that a high-level Palestinian-Israeli meeting could contribute to straightening things out and narrowing the differences between the two sides? [Ghawshah] I do not think so. Several meetings have previously been held, both with Prime Minister Rabin, Peres, and other envoys. The main issue is the need for the Israeli Government to make a serious decision--that is, what are the measures that will be taken to end the murders by the settlers and pull them out from the Palestinian cities? Failing that, the cosponsors of the conference will have to take measures. [Al-Jundi] Thank you Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee member and secretary general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, who is on the line with us from Tunis. Thank you and welcome to Voice of the Arabs. [Ghawshah] You are welcome.
