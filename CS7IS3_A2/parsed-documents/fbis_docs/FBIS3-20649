Two years of safe and stable operations of this plant demonstrates that China is fully capable of self-development in nuclear power. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Corporation which runs the plant, has adhered a strict policy of "quality and safety first," and has been persistent in scientific management, and in multi-level training of its personnel. It fully completed every aspect of its debugging mission in two years, getting an excellent high rate of operational efficiency out of its 300MW units. The daily output of its units is now 7.2 million kWh, and the plant has entered full operational test stage. The latest statistics from the environmental monitoring department shows that the radiation level from particles in waste water discharge is 0.015 Curies, less than the nationally specified limit (20 Curies) of one to one-thousand parts; chimney discharge of inert gases totalled 0.70 Curies, or just at the state-set limit (70,000 Curies) of one to 100,000 parts.
