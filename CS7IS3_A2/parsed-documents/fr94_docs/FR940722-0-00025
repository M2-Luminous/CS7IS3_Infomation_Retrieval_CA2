SUMMARY: The Small Business Administration (SBA) is extending its delegations of authority for guaranteeing sureties against a portion of the losses resulting from the breach of bid, payment or performance bonds on contracts to include the District Director and the Assistant District Director for Economic Development in certain specified district offices. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective on July 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dorothy D. Kleeschulte, Associate Administrator, Office of Surety Guarantees, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street SW., Washington, DC 20416, (202) 205&hyph;6540. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: SBA is expanding its delegations of authority for guaranteeing sureties against a portion of the losses resulting from the breach of bid, payment or performance bonds on contracts. Under the amendment the District Director and the Assistant District Director for Economic Development in the following District Offices have been delegated such authority for contracts not to exceed $1,250,000: Boston, MA; New York, NY; Philadelphia (King of Prussia), PA; Atlanta, GA; Chicago, IL; Dallas, TX; Kansas City, MO; Denver, CO; San Francisco, CA; and Seattle, WA. Because this final rule governs matters of agency organization, management and personnel and makes no substantive change in SBA's regulations, SBA is not required to determine if these changes constitute a major or significant rule for purposes of Executive Order 12866, to determine if they have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), or to perform a Federalism assessment pursuant to Executive Order 12612. SBA certifies that these changes will not impose a new recordkeeping or reporting requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. CH 35). SBA is publishing this regulation governing agency organization, procedure and practice as a final rule without opportunity for notice and public comment pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The rule will be effective upon publication to expedite the more efficient processing of applications for surety guarantees.
