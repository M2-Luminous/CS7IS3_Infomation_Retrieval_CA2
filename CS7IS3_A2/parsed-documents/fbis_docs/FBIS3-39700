Aizpeolea report: "Alfonso Guerra Will Agree To Stay on New Socialist Executive Committee Only If It Is `Balanced'"] [Text] Madrid -- PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] Deputy Secretary General Alfonso Guerra yesterday laid down his ideological territory, his rules of the game, and the conditions for peace in the PSOE. He will not agree to sit on an Executive Committee which is not "balanced," and which, on the contrary, is exclusive. Alfonso Guerra trusts that at the 33d congress in March there will be talk not only of seats but also of the political and ideological substance characteristic of a social democratic party. Guerra claimed for himself and his supporters "a certain degree of nonconformism, utopianism, and a zeal to transform society." The PSOE number two stated that there is no Guerraism but rather a left wing, estimated at 40 percent of the party, which he represents. He conceded to the renewalists, "with a more social liberal stance," another 40 percent, and, last, another 20 percent who opt "for an intermediate stance." However, the deputy secretary general mentioned another small group, which he also called renewalist, whose aim is solely to "kill Guerra." Renewalists and Guerraists were awaiting Guerra's appearance on "The Radio 1 Breakfasts" with anticipation yesterday, in view of his silence over the past three months. Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez made a move by stating last month that he is counting on Guerra for the party's deputy secretary generalship. Many renewalists have insistently called for a response by Guerra. The renewalists have received Guerra's political line with satisfaction because of its "constructive" nature, since it currently seems that the idea of integration must prevail in view of the prospect of the abyss opening up for the Socialists if they head for open confrontation. Nevertheless, various renewalists expressed their disagreement in the Congress [of Deputies] yesterday with one of the fundamental aspects of Guerra's line, which is to seize the banner of the PSOE left wing. For their part, the Guerraists received their leader's appearance with satisfaction, in view of their conviction that he would be moderate and conciliatory. The fact is that Guerra dealt fully in his well-considered replies with all the questions which have remained open for months. Everybody was wondering whether Guerra would wish to be on an Executive Committee in which his stances would be glaringly in a minority. "The leadership which emerges from the next congress should be balanced, without excluding anybody, and, if it were not so, I would not wish to be in it." He then developed somewhat further his idea for the new Executive Committee. "Balanced means that the party feels satisfied, that there is no frustration, that society perceives that there are no fanatics or people who wish to divide." Guerra set further terms for feeling part of the Executive Committee which will emerge from the next congress, which have to do with the course of that Socialist assembly. "The important thing is what will happen at the congress; whether or not a program with a desire for transformation emerges; whether it has some degree of nonconformity; whether it has some degree of utopianism, which is not madness but a premature truth, a search for the improvement of society." Guerra wants solutions or indications of disagreement with the situations of injustice which Spain still experiences to emerge from the congress, and he expatiated on the weakest sections of society. This does not mean that Guerra rejects the task of the government of which he was deputy prime minister for 10 years, since, in his opinion, that decade's work "was impressive." He did make it clear for the first time that a left wing which he represents has taken shape in his party, since he rejects the term "Guerraist" because he does not feel that he is a distributor of membership cards bearing that name. Although, in terms of the percentage of delegates to the congress, the Guerraists have won just over 30 percent, Guerra asserted that, in terms of the number of votes, they total 40 percent. He did not neglect to mention that through the allocation system the minority obtains 25 percent, even if there is only one vote between it and the majority. Guerra specified that he was not the inventor of this allocation system, and even declared himself opposed to it. Alfonso Guerra did not forget to mention those who have been calling for him to speak out over the past few weeks. "I have kept silent because I did not wish to contribute to the tendency toward division, and perhaps I have upset the strategy of some people who were expecting an angry response; well, no, I did not wish to inflame matters." There Are No Rifts Here Alfonso Guerra bore up as best he could yesterday in order not to give the impression of being beset. He appeared not to be surprised by the trickle of defections by supporters. "Those were no friends, and so there is no betrayal; they have simply removed their masks. I was already saying that those who praised me so highly were untrustworthy." Guerra showed signs of rejecting his position as a minority accustomed to holding "the truth" and power in the PSOE. He deemed it "crazy" to believe that the parliamentary group members supporting him could take the path of the mixed group. "Whoever says that must be somebody new, who does not know the PSOE's culture and strength." Although he declined to seem to disagree with the government doctrine, he also did not appear enthusiastic about the current government policies. When speaking of the 27 January strike and the reform of the labor market, he tried to please everybody. He said the reform is absolutely necessary, although he warned of the need to improve working conditions: "The employers must accept this." He did not neglect to hit out at People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar, "gored," according to him, by Cantabrian premier Juan Hormaechea: "He will know where, but it seems to hurt him."
