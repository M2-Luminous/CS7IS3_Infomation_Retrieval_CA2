Law on the Agricultural Income Tax: The Constitutional Court noted that the dispositions of Article 22 of the law, which are to become valid as of 1994, are unconstitutional, since they violate the constitutional principle of the retroactive nature of the law. Consequently, it was decided that, within the procedure of reexamining the law, one should correlate the deadlines envisaged by Article 5 and Article 9 of the law with the actual date of the law's validation, in case Parliament decides that the law should be implemented this year. Regarding the uncultivated fields referred to in Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the law, the text was declared constitutional only to the extent that it does not apply to uncultivable fields. The stipulations of Article 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, and Article 16 of the same law were declared constitutional. Law on War Veterans and Certain Rights of War Invalids and Widows: In view of the provisions of Article 16 Paragraph 1 of the Constitution regarding the equal rights of citizens, the Court declared Article 2, Letter B -- dealing with the requirement that the claimant should not have fought against the Romanian Army -- as unconstitutional, since the recruiting and mobilization of the individuals mentioned by the text of the law were compulsorily done in the Romanian territories temporarily occupied during the 1940-1945 period. By virtue of the same principle of all the country's citizens being equal before the law, the Constitutional Court declared Article 2, Letters A and C as well as Article 7, Letter B, Thesis 1 -- which define the quality as war veteran -- as unconstitutional. In the same session, the Constitutional Court put the final touches to the examination of the constitutionality of the rules of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate and pointed out the provisions that run counter to the Constitution. After the Court's decisions are edited, they will be published in MONITORUL OFICIAL, Part 1.
