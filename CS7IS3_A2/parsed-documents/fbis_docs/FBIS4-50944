Among his priorities: To collaborate with the Chinese in the space industry field. "We must have a greater presence and convince the Chinese authorities and companies that we are in China for the long run," insisted the French manufacturer. With 43 Airbus ordered by China, of which only 12 are already in operation (compared with 225 Boeings and 100 or so McDonnell Douglas aircraft), Aerospatiale's share of the Chinese market is far below its world market share of 30 percent. There are various reasons for France's aerospace industry's poor performance in China. The sale of Dassault Mirage 2000-5 fighters to Taiwan precipitated political sanctions which affected several sectors. U.S. manufacturers, supported by their government and by procurement policy guidelines of the Chinese authorities, managed to generate "purchasing habits" in China. Pilot Training Center "We can no longer use the political situation as an excuse; we must make substantial efforts to achieve a share that we consider just," Louis Gallois notes. The Chinese authorities are getting ready to welcome "in a few days" a technical mission sent by Aerospatiale to explore potential areas for cooperation with Chinese industrials, including satellites. "Long March" rockets are "competitors equipped with modern technologies, but here, too, we can find a way to collaborate, through technical exchange and concept adjustment," Louis Gallois explains. "China is important as a market, but also because of its existing technological know-how." Other goals of the group include the projected Airbus' training center for civilian and possibly military pilots and technicians to be set up near Beijing Airport, as well as a storehouse for spare parts. The European Union is currently considering lifting the ban on military cooperation it imposed after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. Also in progress is the development of a light helicopter in partnership with China (25 percent), Singapore (16 percent), and Eurocopter. Beside Airbus, Louis Gallois has been pushing the French-Italian ATR 42 [Regional Transport Plane] turboprop. So far, the Chinese authorities' interest has been nonexistent. For political reasons, no doubt, but also due to a kind of snobbishness: They think turboprops are "backward." As a result, regional airlines have purchased jets, which epitomize "modernity." However, they now complain that they cannot fill them to capacity.
