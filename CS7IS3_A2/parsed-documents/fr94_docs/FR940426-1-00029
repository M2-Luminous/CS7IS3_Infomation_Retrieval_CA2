FR940426-1-00029 FR940426-1-00004 Question 6.2. Could the Trading Practices Rules be restructured so as to provide a ``safe harbor'' from charges of manipulation under the Exchange Act? How and why should such a safe harbor approach be implemented? What difficulties would be associated with such an approach? 120 120 In the dynamic area covered by the Trading Practices Rules, the views of the Commission's staff are frequently sought as to the appropriateness of specific transactions. In general, the staff does not provide similar advice regarding the scope of safe harbors from antimanipulation provisions. B. Evidentiary Alternative Under the Trading Practices Rules, it is unlawful for a distribution participant to bid for or purchase the securities that are the subject of a distribution (or related securities) until his or her participation is completed, absent an exception or exemption. Some market participants have voiced concerns that certain violations of Rule 10b&hyph;6 are ``inadvertent'' or ``technical'' in nature and do not evince an intent to artificially influence the price of a security in distribution. A possible alternative would be to adopt a presumption that a distribution participant or its affiliated purchaser who engages in proscribed activity during a distribution has done so with manipulative intent, and place the burden on that person to prove that the conduct was not done with manipulative intent. 121 121 This approach would be analogous to the inference that is drawn under the case law regarding section 9(a)(2). E.g., Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 419 F.2d 787, 795 (2d Cir. 1969); The Federal Corp., 25 SEC 227, 230 (1947). Question 6.3. Should distribution participants be permitted to rebut findings of violations of the Trading Practices Rules by establishing the absence of manipulative intent? How and why should such an approach be implemented? What difficulties would be associated with such an approach? What should be the evidentiary requirement for rebutting such a presumption? C. Definitional Approach ```Manipulation' is `virtually a term of art when used in connection with the securities markets.''' 122 Various sections of the Exchange Act authorize the Commission to prohibit activities that it deems or defines to be manipulative. 123 The Trading Practices Rules are among the antimanipulation rules that the Commission has adopted pursuant to this authority. 124 122 Santa Fe Indus., Inc. v. Green, 430 U.S. 462, 476 (1977), quoting Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 199 (1976). 123 E.g., Exchange Act Section 10(b), 15(c)(1)(D), 15(c)(2)(D), 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), 78o(c)(1)(D), 78o(c)(2)(D). For example, Rules 15c1&hyph;1 through 15c1&hyph;9 under the Exchange Act define the term ``manipulative, deceptive, or other fraudulent device or contrivance'' as used in Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act by enumerating various acts and practices. 17 CFR 240.15c1&hyph;1_240.15c1&hyph;9. 124 Cf. Santa Fe, supra note 122, at 476&hyph;477. Question 6.4. Should the Commission expressly define activities that are manipulative in the context of offerings? How and why should such an approach be implemented? What is the scope of activities that should be covered by a definitional rule? What difficulties would be associated with such an approach? D. ALI Code Alternative In 1978, the American Law Institute (``ALI'') proposed a comprehensive codification of the federal securities laws (``ALI Code''). 125 The ALI Code retains many of the fundamental concepts of Rules 10b&hyph;6 and 10b&hyph;7. 126 For example, the ALI Code would codify the basic principles of Rule 10b&hyph;6, but leave it to successor rules to provide the details and exemptions. The code does not recommend the repeal of any of the exceptions in Rule 10b&hyph;6. Additionally, the proposed definition of ``distribution'' would permit the Commission to define the term in light of a number of factors, including the size of the offering, number of sellers and buyers, selling methods, characteristics of the market used, and compensation. 127 125 ALI, Federal Securities Code (Proposed Official Draft, 1978). The ALI Code was endorsed by the American Bar Association in 1979. The Commission published a ``Statement of Position'' on the 1978 version of the ALI Code essentially supporting the code, with revisions. Securities Act Release No. 6242 (September 18, 1980), [1980] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¶82,655. 126 ALI Code Section 1609&hyph;1611 (Official Draft, 1980). 127 ALI Code Section 202(41); see also ALI Code Section 1609(d)(3). The proscriptions would apply to ``the issuer, a secondary distributor, an underwriter, a prospective underwriter, or any other person who has agreed to participate or is participating or otherwise financially interested in a distribution.'' 128 The prohibitions would stay in place until the completion of the person's participation or the termination of his or her financial interest. The stabilization provision of the ALI Code closely mirrors Rule 10b-7, and would retain the Commission's authority to regulate or prohibit stabilization conducted for any purpose. 129 128 ALI Code Section 1609(d)(1). 129 ALI Code Section 1610 & Comment (1). Question 6.5. Does the proposed ALI Code provide a preferable alternative structure to dealing with manipulation during offerings? How and why should such an approach be implemented? What difficulties would be associated with such an approach?
