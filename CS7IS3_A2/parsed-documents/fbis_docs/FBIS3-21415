The northern part of Sudan would consider neglecting the south to be an unforgivable crime, even though the north's area is equal to that of France and Italy together. Sudan must also remain a united and nonfragmented country. In the past, in Europe wars broke out between the nations there, but today Europe is a single entity. Perhaps the day will come when Africa will be united as a single entity. We Africans need unity more than Europe does, and we must overcome nationalisms that are based on the mentality of the existence of borders." He said that there are wars going on in the south between competing rebel groups and that this is making it difficult for the inhabitants to freely vote for their future during elections. He added: "We must also consult the inhabitants of the south who have fled to the north in order to take refuge there. And we do not know whether or not the federal solution for the three provinces in the south would be the best way to put a stop to the violence." [passage omitted] In response to a question regarding Sudan's isolation due to allegations of terrorist connections to Iran, al-Turabi replied: "We have no dealings with Iran, not even one dollar's worth." He went on to say: "There are no Iranian tourists in Sudan, nor is there a single [Iranian] soldier or military attache [in Sudan]. The majority of Iranians are Shiites, whereas the majority of the Sudanese are Sunnis. The two nations are Islamic nations on the political level. We in Sudan are concerned about Islamic values in our education, economy, and politics, whereas in Iran, Islamic values are utilized as slogans for a revolution. Sudan has no tradition of terrorism, and no one has ever been a victim of a political attack." In reply to a question about whether or not his country would accept political refugees such as members of the banned Algerian terrorist groups, al-Turabi replied: "There are four or five Algerians in Sudan who came to our country from Libya. They actually are refugees, but not political refugees. There are also other refugees in our country: 750,000 refugees from Ethiopia, a million refugees from Nigeria and Uganda, and about 250,000 Palestinian refugees, of whom some are from the Hamas movement and others are supporters of 'Arafat. We also have 200,000 Egyptians, some of whom work here." Al-Turabi wondered: "If Sudan is, for example, more Islamic on the political level than Egypt is, does that make it more suspect?" He also asserted that he does not consider himself to be basically a fundamentalist or an Islamic extremist. He said: "The implementation of Islam in Sudan is not just a cultural movement, but is also an intellectual movement, which has the goal of creating a new expression of Islamic values in order to solve contemporary problems. The goal of our efforts is to achieve what is best for our country's economy and agriculture and to eliminate political corruption. Our goal is to have moral values and unity among our tribes and religious groups in a single society. We do not have expansionist or military goals, nor do we have any goals that are financial or connected with the media." What about Sudan's relations with Egypt and Algeria, who are experiencing a wave of terrorist attacks waged by Islamic extremists and whose governments assert that foreign elements are responsible for this? Al-Turabi replies: "Any modern movement in a given society has to know how to conduct itself vis-a-vis the government in power. If the government dominates it, then this will generate resistance, and a revolution might be necessary. This is why the French revolution occurred. But if there is freedom, even to a limited degree, then it is better if there is normal progress in the direction of Islam instead of revolution. Islam is a religion, and there must take place the occurrence of real and gradual progress toward it. In Algeria, the majority voted for the Islamic movement in its elections, but the army prevented its taking power. The Algerians are a mountain people and thus reject any form of coercion, just as they did when resisting French `imperialism.' Unfortunately, the struggle between the goverment and the opposition is something that is squandering all the energy of the people and the country. I hope that Algeria will have at least a minimum of freedom and equilibrium. However, the imposition of Islam by force would not do any good." In conclusion, al-Turabi said: "The jihad means defending oneself, not waging a war. We cannot win people's hearts by means of imposing Islam by force. If belief [in Islam] is something superficial, then Islam will attract only hypocrites and not [true] Muslims. I am a religious person and do not like the use of force."
