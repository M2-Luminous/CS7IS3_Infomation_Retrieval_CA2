That is the finding of a special commission formed by the Russian president, which investigated whether laws and legal enactments adopted in the republic conform to the Constitution. According to our Saransk correspondent, Nikolay Vechkayev, the commission found among other things that the Mordovian parliament's decision to abolish the republican constitutional court was a breach of the constitution. It also ruled that the Mordovian Government had no right to carry out the [Mordovian] Supreme Soviet's decision to provide the heads of urban and district administrations with powers to call local elections on their own initiative. This is the responsibility of the republic's supreme body of power.
