The government has already decided not to pay its employees for days not worked. Strikes are provoking losses everywhere. Losses have been reported in Santa Catarina State, where ships loaded with cargo cannot load or unload due to a strike by Federal Revenue Secretariat [SRF] inspectors, who are only allowing the unloading of perishable or dangerous commodities, such as explosives and fuels. Nearly 300 trucks -- most of which are taking cargo to Paraguay -- are standing in a long line outside the customs office in Foz do Iguacu, Parana State. Clearance through customs is slow owing to the sit-down strike observed by SRF inspectors. Some 13,000 tonnes of cargo is sitting in the Cumbica international airport of Sao Paulo awaiting customs clearance. A court order has ruled that the cargo must be released. The striking workers are obeying the court order, but they are also observing a sit-down strike, which means the cargo will be delayed for at least another month. In Brasilia, the SRF strike has also interrupted the reception of tax statements on diskettes. Pensioners and retired citizens are making unsuccessful trips to collect their checks from social security offices. Even labor accident cases are not being processed. In April alone, 30,000 checks were not issued and beneficiaries failed to receive 160 billion real cruzeiros. The Federal Police strike completed two months today. Strikers commemorated the occasion with a cake and with a protest rally outside the Justice Ministry. Returning from Rio de Janeiro, President Itamar Franco met briefly with Justice Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat and the federal administration and social security ministers at the Brasilia air base to discuss the wave of strikes by public servants. It has been decided that the government will not pay for days not worked. Late this afternoon the STF ruled that public servants cannot exercise the right of strike. Eight of the 11 justices ruled that, although the Constitution guarantees the right of strike to civilian public servants, the right cannot be exercised until it is regulated by Congress. Hence, any strike by public servants is illegal.
