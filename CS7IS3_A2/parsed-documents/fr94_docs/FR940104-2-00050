FR940104-2-00050 FR940104-2-00033 [OR&hyph;050&hyph;4410&hyph;10:GP3&hyph;286] Intent To Amend Resource Management Plan; Realty Action, Grant County, Oregon AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior, Prineville District. ACTION: Notice of intent to amend the John Day Resource Management Plan; notice of realty action_exchange of public land in Grant County, Oregon. In accordance with 43 CFR 1601.3, notice is hereby given that the Bureau of Land Management in the State of Oregon, Prineville District, intends to amend that portion of the John Day Resource Management Plan (RMP) within the Prineville District. The existing RMP was approved in August 1985 and provides management direction and resource allocations for all BLM-managed lands in Grant County located in central and northeastern Oregon. The amendment is to specifically identify public lands in the Central Oregon Resource Area located in Grant County for retention or disposal and to identify, generally, private land that may be suitable for acquisition through exchange, purchase or donation. All acquisitions will be on a ``willing buyer_willing seller'' basis. Presently, there are over 180,000 acres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in Grant County, which contains a total of approximately 3,000,000 acres of land. While the John Day RMP does identify public land suitable for sale, it does not specifically identify public lands suitable for exchange or other realty actions. It also does not identify which of the BLM-managed public lands should be retained for multiple use or what privately-owned lands may be suitable for acquisition. Additionally, this notice serves as the Notice of Realty Action as required by 43 CFR part 2200. The Prineville District is considering five exchange proposals affecting 8,340 acres of public land described as follows: Exchange 1 ␣ 1␣ 1Acres T. 10 S., R. 27 E., Sec. 21: W1/2NW1/4 80 22: S1/2SW1/4 80 26: NW1/4SW1/4 40 27: SW1/4NW1/4, W1/2SW1/4, NE1/4SE1/4 160 28: NW1/4NE1/4, SE1/4NE1/4 80 29: SW1/4SW1/4 40 30: NW1/4NE1/4, SE1/4SE1/4 80 32: NW1/4NW1/4, E1/2SW1/4, SW1/4SW1/4, NW1/4SE1/4 200 33: E1/2SE1/4, SW1/4SE1/4 120 34: W1/2NE1/4, NE1/4NW1/4, SE1/4SW1/4 160 T. 11 S., R. 27 E., Sec. ␣4: NE1/4, W1/2NW1/4, NW1/4 SW1/4, SE1/4SW1/4, W1/2SE1/4, SE1/4SE1/4 440 ␣5: SW1/4NE1/4, S1/2SW1/4, NE1/4SE1/4 160 ␣6: SE1/4NE1/4, SE1/4NW1/4, SW1/4,SW1/4 120 ␣7: S1/2NE1/4 80 ␣8: E1/2SE1/4 80 11: N1/2NE1/4 80 21: NE1/4, SW1/4NW1/4, N1/2SE1/4 280 22: N1/2NE1/4, S1/2NW1/4 160 23: NE1/4 160 25: NW1/4NW1/4, NE1/4SW1/4, N1/2SE1/4 160 27: NW1/4NW1/4 40 34: E1/2NW1/4, SW1/4SW1/4 120 36: N1/2NE1/4, NE1/4NW1/4 120 T. 11 S., R. 28 E., Sec. ␣5: SE1/4SW1/4 40 ␣6: E1/2NE1/4, SW1/4SE1/4 120 17: SW1/4SW1/4 40 18: N1/2NE1/4, SW1/4NE1/4, NE1/4NW1/4, N1/2SE1/4, SW1/4SE1/4 280 20: W1/2NW1/4 80 21: NE1/4NE1/4 40 30: S1/2SW1/4, SE1/4SE1/4 120 31: N1/2NW1/4, SW1/4NW1/4 120 32: N1/2NE1/4 80 T. 12 S., R. 27 E., Sec. ␣1: NW1/4NW1/4 40 ␣2: N1/2 320 n,s Approximately 4,220 Exchange 2 ␣ 1␣ 1Acres T. 7 S., R. 27 E., Sec. 13: SE1/4NW1/4 40 21: SE1/4 160 22: S1/2SW1/4, SW1/4SE1/4 120 23: N1/2NW1/4 80 24: NW1/4SE1/4 40 26: SW1/4NW1/4 40 28: E1/2NE1/4 80 T. 7 S., R. 28 E., Sec. ␣1: NE1/4SW1/4 40 ␣7: N1/2NE1/4, SW1/4NE1/4, NW1/4SE1/4 160 ␣8: NW1/4SW1/4 40 10: SW1/4SE1/4 40 12: NE1/4NE1/4 40 15: SE1/4SE1/4 40 17: SE1/4NE1/4, E1/2NW1/4, E1/2SE1/4 200 26: SE1/4NW1/4 40 29: SW1/4SW1/4 40 30: NE1/4SW1/4, SE1/4SE1/4 80 n,s Approximately 1,280 Exchange 3 ␣ 1␣ 1Acres T. 7 S., R. 29 E., Sec. ␣3: W1/2NW1/4 40 ␣9: SW1/4NW1/4 40 10: W1/2SE1/4 80 14: S1/2NW1/4 80 15: SE1/4NE1/4 40 T. 7 S., R. 30 E., Sec. ␣1: NW1/4NW1/4, SE1/4SW1/4, S1/2SE1/4 160 ␣2: NE1/4NE1/4, W1/2NE1/4 120 ␣5: SE1/4SE1/4 40 ␣8: NE1/4, NE1/4NW1/4 200 ␣9: NE1/4NW1/4 40 12: NE1/4, NE1/4NW1/4 200 15: NW1/4NE1/4 40 23: SE1/4SW1/4, NE1/4SE1/4 80 24: NE1/4NE1/4 40 n,s Approximately 1,200 Exchange 4 ␣ 1␣ 1Acres T. 14 S., R. 31 E., Sec. 28: SE1/4NW1/4, SE1/4 200 n,s Approximately 200
