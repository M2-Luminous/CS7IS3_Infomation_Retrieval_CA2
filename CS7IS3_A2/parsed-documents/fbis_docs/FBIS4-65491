"Rest assured," he said, "you can expect a European Germany rather than a German Europe." Does anyone now remember that pledge? Only weeks before Germany takes over the presidency of the European Union [EU], it is threatening to flout European law by banning British beef imports for fear of mad cow disease. Its politicians are grumbling loudly about Germany's budget contribution. Inside the country the mood is at its most Eurosceptical for four decades; all the major and minor parties are contesting the European elections with hard-nosed, nationally centred rhetoric. There is no sign of Herr Genscher's "European Germany." Instead, the political class seems to have opted for a German Europe. The naked assertion of power abroad is replacing the frothy vision of Europa. Bonn has been quietly subverting the Greek EU presidency for months. It was the Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, who threatened to break the spine of his Spanish colleagues unless they allowed the Scandinavian states into the Union. (Explanations for this rugged phrasing include: "a mistranslation", "just a joke" and "the minister's robust Swabian manner".) It was Germany, not Greece, which engineered the compromise on voting rights for the extended Union. And it was Chancellor Kohl who leaned most heavily on the European Parliament to admit the new boys from Scandinavia and Austria. Germany, in short, has taken charge. In July, it takes the job formally. The French have noticeably lost ground in the past nine months. But Britain, which could have profited from these rifts, fumbled the issue of European voting rights, and the beneficiary was Germany, which is now the unchallenged protector of Central Europe within the Union. This steady assertion of German power comes at a time when the country is relatively disadvantaged. It is hamstrung by elections, its economy is still in recession, its constitution limits its military posture abroad. By 1996, the economy should have recovered. The constitution will have been amended, or be open to more flexible interpretation about German missions abroad. The European Parliament will be more powerful, more federally inclined -- and more German. The driving force behind this new definition of Germany within Europe is Chancellor Kohl. There are times when his physical bulk seems to be a metaphor for his country: not just big, but complicated, thin-skinned, slightly uncoordinated, capable of sitting out crises, perpetually tired yet capable of sudden bursts of energy. The Chancellor's Christian Democrats are catching up in the polls, gaining a second wind after lagging for months behind the Social Democrats. His room for electoral manoeuvre is limited, however. On most issues, there are no clear differences between the two parties. Increasingly, all seems to depend not on Kohl's utterances but on the success or failure of his small coalition partner, the Free Democrats, who may fail to capture the 5 per cent of votes needed for parliamentary representation. So the battlefield has shifted to foreign grounds. Herr Kinkel, the Foreign Minister, is the Free Democrats' chairman. Herr Kohl is the supreme foreign policy maker. Together they can make a powerful point by running Europe. The federal European dream barely enters this calculation partly because it might scare away voters. Instead, Herr Kohl treats Europe as his personal playground, where he disports with "Dear John" and "My Friend Felipe," and of course "Cher Francois." Herr Kohl's message is clear: I am not only the Chancellor of reunification, but the fixed point around which Europe revolves. Remove me and this small universe collapses. But what would happen to Europe if Herr Kohl were turfed out in October? The current betting is that either the Christian Democrat/Free Democrat alllance will survive, or that the Free Democrats will flounder and Herr Kohl will have to make common cause with the Social Democrats. Neither outcome would derail Germany's European policies. Only a Red-Green government could do that. British Eurosceptic calculations about a changed European environment helping to bail out the Conservative Party are misplaced. Yes, Spain and Italy appear to be more sceptical than in the past; even Bavaria is striking different notes. But German interests are now clear: to build Europe into a bulwark of security against future buffeting; to expand the range of Europe and consolidate its institutions; and to create layers and layers of cushions between Germany and an unstable Russia. For the German political class, much more than in Britain, the Bosnian war has been a profound shock. Helplessness in the face of a European war has contributed far more to the current cynicism than the protracted debate about Maastricht. Fear of a collapsing Russia, rather than expansionism, is directing much of Germany's behaviour. So this new assertiveness in Europe should not worry Germanys partners. Better that the Continent has a strong heart than a weak stomach.
