Through local press, the Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight authorities are constantly expanding the ``assortment'' of the infection threatening the health and life of the citizens of Don. Izvestiya have already reported an outbreak of Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Reports are being received from Neklinovskiy, Myasnikovskiy, and Matveyevo-Kurganskiy rayons about large-scale infection of tularemia--a very serious disease transmitted by rodents and mosquitoes. More than 150 patients have already been recorded. In the last several days, 11 children in Rostov have been infected with salmonellosis. And finally, the last alarm signal was sounded about diphtheria. Last year, this disease afflicted 93 persons in Rostov oblast, three of whom have already died. This summer, the incidence of diphtheria in Rostov's Voroshilovskiy borough alone increased by sixfold. ``Why did this new misfortune befall us?'' say poor Rostovites shaking their heads. Some especially nervous citizens are already hinting about ``splitting'' to some safe location for a month or two. Most likely, this infection phobia is being hyped by the reports which for the past two weeks have continued to appear on the pages of Rostov newspapers. What is interesting is that nothing like that happened before--during censorship, the press was strictly warned ``not to hype horrors.'' And I have been told that today, frequent information about danger is only one of the elements of public concerns about health and vigilance which cannot hurt in today's situation. Thus, there is no reason for panic--the best thing would be to get immunized. Yet in expert estimates, if there is a threat of a tularemia and diphtheria epidemic, more than 80% of the oblast residents must undergo this procedure. The local authorities developed a mass population immunization program, and resources were allocated to the public health administration for purchasing the necessary immunization preparations. And a simple precaution could not hurt.
