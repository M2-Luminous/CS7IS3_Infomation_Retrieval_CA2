FBIS4-51632 "dreas084_d_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 South Korea Nations Disagree on Beef Purchases Nations Disagree on Beef Purchases SK1904033594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0300 GMT 19 Apr 94 SK1904033594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Australia met Monday for their quarterly beef talks, but failed to strike a deal due to disagreements over the volume listed in the wholesale market and carry-over of excess imports. Seoul proposed to increase the listed volume of common meat at the wholesale market to 1,000 tons this year from 1993's 800 tons, but canberra was opposed, calling the amount too small compared with this year's beef imports of 106,000 tons. Australia again refused Korea's request to have the volume exceeding the import quota be carried forward to next year because it predicted actual imports to be more than the designated quota in view of current consumption. The two will take up the issue at the next quarterly meeting.
