Whether President Bill Clinton will score a success during his European trip will depend on whether he manages to convince the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary about his "Partnership for Peace" proposal--that, according to the Tuesday [4 January] edition of THE NEW YORK TIMES. If he does manage to convince them, everyone will be satisfied; if not, then, according to THE WASHINGTON POST, the U.S. President will find himself in a troublesome situation. THE WASHINGTON POST also pointed to Walesa's and Havel's skepticism with regard to "Partnership for Peace." "There is nothing good about it," the Polish president said, and he also announced that he will demand security guarantees from NATO within the next six months. THE NEW YORK TIMES pointed to a precondition set by Foreign Minister Olechowski that has to be met before Poland joins "Partnership for Peace": a clear expression of the goal--that is, acceptance by NATO of new members and also of the criteria the candidate countries must meet. According to U.S. Ambassador to NATO Robert Hunter, Olechowski's preconditions will be met. At the same time, U.S. diplomats have been making assurances that "Partnership for Peace" does not mean a "new Yalta." In the same issue of THE WASHINGTON POST, commentator Jim Hoagland notes that, even though during the Brussels summit the United States should redefine its leadership role with regard to its NATO partners, which was so clear during the Cold War, one should not require that the United States solve European problems, such as the conflict in Bosnia, for example. But, after all, what could one expect from Washington if Marshal Tito himself said that Yugoslavia would fall apart after his death? Richard Cohen writes in an article right next to the previous one. The message from both articles is unanimous: U.S. leadership will never be a cure-all for all of the problems of Europe and the world. Is the United States turning its back on the Old Continent and heading toward Asia? The administration denies that, while stressing that President Clinton will visit Europe as many as four times this year: during the NATO summit, on the 50th anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy, during the July G-7 summit in Naples, and, in the fall, on the occasion of the summit of the CSCE, which will take place in Hungary. Europe is waiting to see what kind of a vision of its future and of U.S. involvement on the Old Continent Bill Clinton will suggest, Jim Hoagland says at the end. Meeting in Milwaukee This coming Thursday, President Bill Clinton will meet Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and Slovak Americans in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Members of the White House Security Council scheduled a dinner with so-called leaders of ethnic communities for Wednesday. The highlight of the Milwaukee events will be the president's speech on the occasion of his European trip. According to White House Spokesperson Dee Dee Myers, Clinton will be trying to convince the American nation about the need for continued active involvement in European security issues. The "Partnership for Peace" proposal aroused great anxiety among Americans from Central Europe. A flood of phone calls to the White House and letters to the president were initiated as part of a Coalition of Central European Countries, in which appeals are being made to the President to take into account the security requirements of Central European countries. The appeals point to potential dangers stemming from leaving Central Europe in a gray area. A special phone line was launched in mid-December, through which one can send a telegram to the White House with a ready-made text, in which a postulate is made of accepting Poland as a NATO member. The Polish community availed itself of this modern type of lobbying. It seems that the meeting in Milwaukee is a result of the campaign and also a victory by the Polish ethnic group, which, up to now, was regarded as politically passive. Walesa: West's Desertion In an interview with BBC Radio, President Lech Walesa accused Western countries of having left Central Europe to its own fate. He said the West acted in a hesitant manner and rescinded its earlier promises of accepting Central European countries into NATO because Russia had spoken out against it. "Boris Yeltsin sensed the West's indecision and selfishness, and that is why he set preconditions," the president said. "But he set these preconditions not on Poland at all but on NATO. Meanwhile, the West is acting as if it could not see that at all. What are Western countries afraid of when Russia approves of the principles of pluralism and democracy and wants to establish them?" Lech Walesa asks. "Are they afraid of a vacuum being created? That is not just a simple fear; that is desertion." Markus Meckel: Need for Binding Commitment "We need a binding commitment and a time frame for Polish membership in NATO," Markus Meckel told RZECZPOSPOLITA. He is the leader of the Polish group in the Social Democratic Party faction in the German Bundestag and the last foreign minister of the German Democratic Republic. According to Meckel, the democratic and stable development of the countries of Central and East Europe and their integration into Western organizations--into the European Union and NATO, among others--is in the interest of the West and all of Europe. Meckel said the desire by Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to be members of NATO is understandable and logical, especially against the backdrop of the dangers that have recently emerged in Russia. The way the West should respond to the Russian events is to link the countries of Central and East Europe to the West as soon as possible, including in the area of security policy. Meckel also said that fears expressed by Poland and other countries of the region of the vacuum of a buffer zone or even of a "new Yalta" are realistic, while the way the West has been handling Russia is questionable. He thinks that NATO should present Russia with an offer of cooperation, but, at the same time, it should provide security guarantees to countries in Central Europe. Meckel perceives a danger of returning to the division of the world and thinks that the danger can only be eliminated through the West's decisive action, including accepting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into Western security organizations. When could that happen? Not as soon as the countries concerned would like to see it, Meckel repeated what Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said during a visit to Bonn by Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. What does that mean? "If Germans say: `Not so fast,'" Meckel said, "that means we will need quite some time in which to convince our West European and U.S. friends that integration by Poland and other countries is in our mutual interest and that it will contribute to the stabilization of Europe." According to Meckel, a specific promise or a time frame for Poland and its partners (or an offer of cooperation for Russia) will not be decided at the next NATO summit mainly because of the position adopted by the Americans, but also due to the British position. What is more realistic--and the Germans should insist on accomplishing that--is that an unambiguous declaration will be made that "Partnership for Peace" not only does not exclude Polish, Hungarian, and Czech membership in NATO, but it also constitutes a first and binding step toward integrating these countries. Nobody Isolates Russia On Tuesday, which was a day after Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski's visit to Bonn and a few days before the NATO summit meeting in Brussels, an article appeared in DIE WELT entitled "NATO and a New East" and written by three well-known political scientists--Timothy Garton Ash of Oxford University; Michael Mertes, who is an associate of the Chancellor's Office; and Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the Paris-based International Relations Institute and deputy editor in chief of the POLITIQUE ETRANGERE ("Foreign Policy") journal. The authors express their conviction that, despite the success by the Russian extreme right wing, there are still chances for democratic transformations. This is even more reason for the West to support the democratic camp against the fascist forces. The results of the Russian elections spurred a debate on the efforts of the countries of Central Europe toward integration. There are views that accepting Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, and Hungary as NATO members could cause a negative response by Russia and, as a result, could lead to a weakening of the pro-Western and democratic front present in Russia. Ash, Mertes, and Moisi regard these arguments as not very convincing. Russia's uncertain future makes its neighbors' nervousness completely understandable. But could acceptance of the democratic countries of Central Europe be falsely interpreted as designed to isolate Russia? The article says no, on the condition that these countries' membership in NATO will take place at the same time as some efforts aimed at establishing a special "security partnership" with Russia. The article's authors think that the countries of Central Europe should be offered an "engagement" to NATO, which would open up the prospect of a subsequent marriage. They suggested three stages: During the first stage, countries of Central Europe would participate in political consultations and in NATO's parliamentary meetings; in the second stage, the countries' Armed Forces would participate in NATO peace missions under the protectorate of the United Nations or the CSCE; and, in the third and final stage, they would receive complete security guarantees in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington treaty. On Tuesday, the German press issued extensive reports on the talks in Bonn between Ministers Olechowski and Kinkel. Particular emphasis was placed on Poland's justified concern over the developments in Russia. The papers cited a statement made by Friedbert Pfluger, a defense expert from Germany's Christian Democratic Union, who demands an associate membership in NATO for countries of Central Europe.
