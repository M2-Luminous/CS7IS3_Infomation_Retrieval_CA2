The full text of the document will be published in the local mass media on Tuesday. The news agency said that the document does not bury the idea of the Commonwealth of Independent States and offers yet another scheme of integration which will function alongside the CIS. The union is expected to bring together only those republics of the former Soviet Union which are ready for this kind of cooperation and integration. The principles of and mechanism for establishing the union must be based on their results of "national referendums or parliamentary decisions on joining the Eurasian union" as well as "equality, non-interference in internal affairs of each other, territorial integrity and inviolability of state borders." All this will "provide the legal and organisational framework for furthering integration in order to set up an economic, currency, and political union." The draft does not provide for associative membership. Decisions will be considered adopted if they are supported by four-fifths of the total number of member countries. The admission to the union is strictly conditioned. The terms include "strict observance of the signed inter-state agreements, mutual recognition of the existing political and state institutions in the union member states, recognition of territorial integrity and inviolability of borders, denunciation of economic, political and other pressure in inter-state relations, as well as cessation of fighting with each other." For the union to function effectively, Nazarbayev suggests setting up a number of supranational bodies, including the council of heads of state and heads of government which will have the supreme authority. Each country will preside in the council for six months and will take turns in alphabetical order. The union's parliament will be the highest consultative body. The council of foreign ministers will coordinate foreign policies of the member countries. Nazarbayev believes that Russian should be made the official language of the union, which will be headquartered in a city lying on the border of Europe and Asia, for example Kazan or Samara. The idea of a Eurasian union proposed by the Kazakh president is not the return to the past. It draws on the experience of the European Union, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other international alliances, which have proved viable. This opinion featured prominently at a news conference in the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata on Monday. The participants in the press conference said that Nazarbayev's idea is often distorted by the mass media, which causes inadequate reaction from some political circles considering the union as the return to Soviet rule. The idea is based on world experience, the existing economic ties between the CIS countries and the effective use of their economic potential, they said.
