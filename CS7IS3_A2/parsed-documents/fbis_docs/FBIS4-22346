Yakovlev, by GOLOS correspondent A. Nadzharov: "Ostankino Counting Money"] [Text] Three months ago, as he was coming to television, Aleksandr Yakovlev heard many worrisome reports about mercenary crimes at Ostankino. [GOLOS] Were they confirmed, Aleksandr Nikolaevich? [Yakovlev] Not entirely. For instance, one of the cameramen, or so I had been told, was not averse to accepting a "consideration" for showing the thoughtful face of a businessman who had placed a "private order" during, say, a hockey match. [GOLOS] Possibly. Only this is completely unpunishable, in my opinion. [Yakovlev] Correct. However, there is also the concept of one's reputation. And when it develops in a certain manner it necessarily excludes the possibility of that kind of operator continuing to work in any serious institution. [GOLOS] Did you discover any more serious violations, though? [Yakovlev] I didn't. At my request, however, the president has ordered his administration's control commission to arrange a special investigation. It has just completed its work and apparently has not uncovered any truly serious crimes. It is true, there are some suspicions concerning the economic activities of Ostankino's former deputy general director, Bandura, but it is still too soon to draw any conclusions: we recently submitted the documents that were gathered to the court for them to sort out. [GOLOS] By the way, about criminal activity. Lately rumors have been going around about the president's alleged ill health or about another putsch being readied. During Yeltsin's vacation, your channel broadcast an alarming report from one of the new agencies about Chernomyrdin's sudden Sunday visit to Sochi and about the telephones being out of order at the White House. [Yakovlev] That's all nonsense, and it was pointless to put out an unverified report. Chernomyrdin did fly to see the president, but not on Sunday or on Monday, and not on the subject of any "coup being readied," but to settle on some corrections to the budget, and certainly not because of how Yeltsin was feeling. I should have his health. [GOLOS] So, it's like the joke about the man who didn't win a car but lost, not the lottery but solitaire, and not a car but a hundred rubles? [Yakovlev] Something like that. Only I think someone is organizing these campaigns regularly. Previously, a special subdivision of Kryuchkov's KGB did this kind of thing. He's gone now, but his nasty business seems to have survived. [GOLOS] To be honest, I was somewhat uncomfortable about talking with Aleksandr Nikolaevich about any criminal activity. Especially since in the final analysis none of us is all that interested in the TV "kitchen." What lacks does Ostankino's director see in the activities of state channel No. 1, and how does he plan to overcome them? [Yakovlev] I will say straight away that we are going to be airing the multi-series Mexican melodramas. No matter how much I dislike them, they rate very high for viewer interest. [GOLOS] But what about our own, Russian cinema? After all, there are so many films made in recent years that the viewer has never seen! [Yakovlev] I agree, only the filmmakers are demanding 15 million rubles [R] for each showing, and where is that kind of money to be got if the state is only paying for 30 percent of the state channel's work? After all, besides paying for the showing, we also have to pay the Communications Ministry R35 million per signal hour. No advertising money is enough here. In short, we and the film people have to sit down and count the money. Count it together. [GOLOS] From time to time certain shows disappear from the airwaves. Individual leaders drop out of sight. By what criteria do you determine their right to air? [Yakovlev] Generally speaking, I'm not involved in that. There are editorial offices and television associations, and what you're talking about is in their hands. So that I am not reckoned as a censor or benevolent granddad in television. I will say, however, that if I were one of the editorial directors, I would simply fire those journalists who are clarifying their relations in the collective through the press. I'm an old newspaper man myself. I started out on the district paper, and I have no memory, say, of our newspaper reporters ever complaining about their bosses on "Sportloto." [GOLOS] Would you please say a few words about Ostankino's new TV shows? [Yakovlev] There are lots of them. We are trying to emphasize the information and the nearly vanished current affairs programs. Meanwhile, some leaders are mad at me because there's no room for moralizing within the framework for putting out the news. And it's right that they don't. Give the viewer the facts; he'll draw his own conclusions. Which, actually, by no means excludes intelligent analysis or expert commentary. This is a neglected area among us, unfortunately. After all, the childish kick given in passing to the president, who, in the opinion of the story's young author, supposedly missed or overlooked something, cannot be considered analysis. By the way, about the young. It was in their milieu--I have in mind MGU (Moscow State University)--that a pretty good idea was born for a series of broadcasts on "hot topics." Ostankino is starting to prepare another series on the provincial cities on which, as the saying goes, Russia stands. [GOLOS] But what are your personal television plans, Aleksandr Nikolaevich? [Yakovlev] I will leave Ostankino after a while. By the president's edict I, speaking generally, have been appointed chairman of Gosteleradio (State Television and Radio). Channel No. 1 is temporary. This business of holding more than one job will come to an end, and, along with my colleagues, I will be involved in issuing broadcast licenses, which will go, I am certain, to the best programs, films, directors, and journalists.
