Presiding Justice Ryohei Kizaki said the doctor, Takako Nobuhara, had worked in Palestinian refugee camps after going to Lebanon in 1971. Nobuhara lost her passport and applied for a new one in 1982 at the Japanese embassy in Syria. But the Foreign Ministry refused to issue the document and she filed suit in 1993, demanding a new one. The Tokyo District Court accepted her demand in December 1989 and ruled that the ministry's refusal was illegal since her alleged close relationship with the Red Army was not acknowledged. The ministry then appealed to the Tokyo High Court and the court ruled May 19, 1992, that based on the ministry's evidence, Nobuhara had been a liaison agent in Beirut for the Red Army's leader Fusako Shigenobu. Japanese police have placed Shigenobu on an international wanted list. The Red Army, formed in 1971, is responsible for a series of hijackings and armed attacks in the 1970s. It is reportedly based in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and has close ties with radical Palestinian groups.
