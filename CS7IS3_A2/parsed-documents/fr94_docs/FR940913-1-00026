FR940913-1-00026 FR940913-1-00012 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 582 [Docket No. 94&hyph;73; Notice 1] RIN 2127&hyph;AF44 Insurance Cost Information Regulation AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: In this document, NHTSA proposes technical amendments to the insurance cost information regulations. Among the proposed changes are revising the term ``passenger motor vehicles'' to read ``passenger cars, utility vehicles, light duty trucks, and vans,'' and revising from January to March, the availability date of the insurance information. NHTSA also proposes making more explicit the limitations of the collision loss data, and proposes recommending that prospective purchasers contact insurance agents for more information. The technical amendments are proposed to make the insurance cost information more accurate. DATES: Comments on this notice of proposed rulemaking must be received by this agency not later than November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket number referenced in the heading of this notice, and be submitted to: Docket Section, NHTSA, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. (Docket hours are 9:30 am to 4:00 pm, Monday through Friday.) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Orron Kee, Office of Market Incentives, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Mr. Kee's telephone number is (202) 366&hyph;4936. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Insurance Cost Information Regulation 49 U.S.C. 32302(c) states that the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) shall prescribe regulations that require passenger motor vehicle dealers to distribute to prospective purchasers information developed by the Secretary and provided to the dealer which compares differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger motor vehicles based upon differences in damage susceptibility and crashworthiness. By delegation from the Secretary, NHTSA has been authorized to carry out the statute. On January 31, 1975, NHTSA published 49 CFR part 582, Insurance Cost Information Regulation (40 FR 4918). Part 582, as then promulgated, required that automobile dealers ``make available to prospective purchasers information reflecting differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger motor vehicles based upon differences in damage susceptibility and crashworthiness.'' Part 582, however, did not specify information that dealers must provide. On March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12545), NHTSA published a final rule amending part 582. The rule complemented the 1975 rulemaking, and completed implementation of section 32302(c). The March 1993 final rule, which became effective April 5, 1993, requires dealers of new automobiles to make collision loss experience data available in booklets to prospective purchasers. The information to be provided in the booklet is specified in section 582.5, which requires inclusion of a complete explanatory text and updated data on auto insurance costs published annually by NHTSA. The mandatory text specified by part 582 relates to, among other topics, the limitations of the auto insurance cost data as a predictor of differences in insurance premiums. Essentially, those limitations result from the fact that most of the factors that insurance companies use to establish premiums relate to driver characteristics and, except for the vehicle's value, are not directly related to the vehicle itself. Thus, as the text explains, the fact that a vehicle's historical claims experience is somewhat better or worse than that of other vehicles in its class may not be reflected in the premium that an insurance company establishes for that vehicle. If the claims experience is reflected, it is likely to have only a small impact on the premium.
