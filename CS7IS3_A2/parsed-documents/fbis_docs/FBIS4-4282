A reporter asked: According to a report, China recently sent additional 30,000 troops into Tibet and deployed them along the Sino-Indian border areas. Please confirm and comment. The spokesman said: The report is sheer fabrication. Last year the Chinese and Indian Governments signed an accord on maintaining peace and tranquility in areas along the Line of Actual Control, and the two countries have also started discussing issues about reducing troops in areas along the line. Spreading the lie that China has sent an additional 30,000 troops to the Sino-Indian border areas is obviously out of ulterior motives.
