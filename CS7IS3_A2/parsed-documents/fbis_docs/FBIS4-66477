During a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN press interview on the 13th, he disclosed that Russia is planning to request Japanese cooperation in the development of an advanced reactor. Russia wants to use the plutonium obtained through dismantling nuclear weapons for fuel. Russia soon will propose a cooperative arrangement through formal channels of the Japan-Russia Atomic Energy Agreement. The cooperation request includes development of the 800,000kW output ``BN-800'' fast breeder reactor. At present, its construction is temporarily on hold. They want to modify the existing core originally designed for fuel breeding to that for burning plutonium and long-life transuranium. They intend to process the plutonium produced through dismantling nuclear weapons in a way that will destroy it as it is burned as fuel. Bureau Director Ermakov said, `They would like to promote development of the reactor as an international project along the lines of the International Tokamak Experimental Research.'
