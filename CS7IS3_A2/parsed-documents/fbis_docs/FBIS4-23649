FBIS4-23649 "drafr113_c_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-113 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Buthelezi on ANC Overtures to Zulu King Buthelezi on ANC Overtures to Zulu King MB1106161894 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1405 GMT 11 Jun 94 MB1106161894 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Durban June 11 SAPA -- Home Affairs Minister and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he's vexed by alleged African National Congress attempts to drive a wedge between himself and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Addressing thousands of IFP supporters at a "peace and victory" rally in Durban's Umlazi Township on Saturday [11 June], Mr Buthelezi said in spite of this there was no rift between himself and the monarch. But, he said, referring to recent ANC attempts to court the king, members of the Zulu royal family had succeeded in "step by step making the king beholden to the ANC". And he warned opponents and elements in the royal household that the IFP controlled the king's purse strings. Mr Buthelezi said since the IFP election victory in KwaZulu/Natal, the ANC was determined to break Inkatha in its strongholds, and had tried to "ingratiate itself with his majesty". "One of the ways in which they are attempting to do so is to worm their way into the confidence of his majesty the king and the royal house." The IFP leader claimed that wherever he went he heard rumblings from Zulu people about the extent to which members of the royal family had succeeded in assisting ANC attempts to woo the king, including "clandestine meetings" between the monarch and KwaZulu/Natal ANC leaders. "There are members of the royal family who are working hard to give the ANC what it wants -- an entry to the royal family and access to his majesty." Among the "successes" of certain members of royalty, was to have King Zwelithini's bodyguards replaced by SA [South African] National Defence Force members, including perceived ANC soldiers. "No Zulu could ever have predicted, even a year ago, that it would be people perceived as MK (Umkhonto We Sizwe) [Spear of the Nation; ANC armed wing] who guard his majesty's safety in Nongoma." Mr Buthelezi also said the ANC had "bandied about" promises to the king, but didn't specify them. He said he had spent his political life committed to the Zulu king, and was responsible for "fighting the battles for his majesty to gain the elevated position that history has bequeathed to Zulu kings". Recently, he added, close to R7 million [rand] had been spent on royal palaces, over R2 million on labourers, and R500,000 given to the king in farming assistance. "To date we have actually spent over R4 million on securing his majesty's personal position and on supplementary requirements around his person," he said. Mr Buthelezi said this was "the people's money...gladly spent", in favour of funding for schools, hospitals and health, because "Zulu people live for their king". But, he warned: "In future the very large budgets that his majesty will need for the maintenance of his courts and his kingly way of life, can only come from the KwaZulu/Natal Provincial Legislature, which the IFP controls". The IFP leader emphasised there was no rift between himself and the king, but added that "from the looks of things, there are some mischief makers who are trying to brew something". "I find it very vexing," Mr Buthelezi said, "and difficult to accept the fact that Natal leaders of the ANC are engaged in a game of creating a rift between me and his majesty. It is difficult for me to understand exactly what these ANC leaders in Natal are up to." ANC leaders in KwaZulu/Natal could not immediately be reached to comment on the allegations. It is understood that King Zwelithini recently missed an IFP election victory celebration in favour of a meeting with provincial ANC leaders. Informed sources say that despite Mr Buthelezi's veiled threats, the king's budget is apparently controlled by President Nelson Mandela's office until provincial powers have been worked out, and even afterwards, the budget may still come from the national government. Earlier on Saturday Mr Buthelezi congratulated about 4,000 IFP supporters, gathered at Umlazi's King Zwelithini Stadium, for their election victory. But, he urged them to immediately press ahead and strengthen the IFP. He said the party should be prepared to fight an election before the government's five-year tenure was up. He predicted the ANC wouldn't be able to deliver its election promises and would "resort to calling a new election before the rot sets in too deeply to discredit them and to prejudice their chances of winning another election".
