FBIS4-36250 "drnes110_c_94005" FBIS-NES-94-110 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 Egypt Opposition Parties Demand More Consultations Opposition Parties Demand More Consultations NC0806102694 Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic 3 Jun 94 p 7 NC0806102694 Cairo AL-SHA'B Arabic BFN [Text] The leaders of the Wafd, National Progressive Unionist Grouping, and the Liberal parties have issued the following statement explaining their stand on the formation of a committee to prepare for the national dialogue: The leaders of the parties signed this statement; Out of their concern to continue the national dialogue on a sound and correct basis capable of achieving the hopes that the Egyptian masses have pinned on it; Out of their commitment to the homeland's interests that require us to work together toward a real understanding established on the basis of free and equal expression and on the basis of the various political forces' direct and equal participation in setting out its agenda, basis, and the rules that govern it; While noting that the committee to prepare for the national dialogue was not formed in the right manner; both in form -- as the committee was imposed by one party without consultations -- and in substance -- as the majority of the committee members were chosen from the ranks of the ruling party [National Democratic Party]; While noting that the choice of the rapporteur was successful, and despite our respect for the rapporteur, we believe that it would have been better if consultations were held on the choice of the rapporteur, his role, whether he is the chairman of the conferees, their sole spokesman, or whether he is just the organizer of the sessions; While reviewing the decision of the Wafd and the Democratic Nasirite parties not to participate in the dialogue so as to record their objections, most of which can be said to be objective and should be taken into account; They believe that it is necessary to review the issue and to attempt to try to reach a common understanding over the committee's form and composition, the rapporteur and his role, the system of expressing views, and the various parties' right to voice their opinions. This might make it incumbent upon us all to participate directly in a common and constant dialogue until we reach an understanding that will ensure that the national dialogue will start properly and achieve equality and which can achieve the desired outcome. Hence, the signatories of this appeal call on all the parties to seek to hold collective and bilateral dialogues with the aim of reaching a common agreement before the start of the national dialogue committee's sessions. There is a period of time between today and 12 June -- the date set for the committee's second session -- during which an attempt can be made to achieve an understanding on the needed bases and avoid the mistakes which have invoked our observations. While these consultations require more time, we believe there is a need to give them ample opportunity for unifying our views and uniting all the political forces within the framework of the national dialogue for the sake of achieving the desired national interest. Hence, being committed to a fixed date might not be necessary. What is necessary is to find an ample opportunity for real consultations and for reaching new agreements. Our objective from all this is the homeland's interest and ensuring the success of the dialogue on a basis that achieves equality and sufficient respect for all its parties. God is our witness.
