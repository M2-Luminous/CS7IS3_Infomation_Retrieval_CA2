How can we solve these problems? In an interview with this magazine, Chen Jiyuan, expressed the following viewpoints. 1. We should thoroughly change our basic attitude toward agriculture and the peasants. For a long time, the peasants have been required to contribute grain and various kinds of farm produce. All the more, the agricultural accumulation fund has been turned into an industrial accumulation fund and rural accumulation fund has been turned into an industrial development fund by means of scissors differences. Now that we have put forward the "grain sack project" and the "vegetable basket project," our starting point is to take them as key moves to ensure supply and curb inflation. Our starting point is still on how to stabilize the cities and solve the "grain sack" and "vegetable basket" problems of urban residents. It is of course necessary to raise this issue. However, if we only think of solving the problems of the urban residents without taking into consideration the peasants' benefits and their "money bag" problem, i.e. their income problem, then the "grain sack" and "vegetable basket" problems will not be solved once and for all. For a long time, there has actually been a sharp contradiction in rural work, that is, the state needs grain while the peasants need income. The peasants are required to fulfill the task of supplying grain but the problem of their income is often neglected. We can say that this is the most deep-seated problem facing China's agriculture. If we only think of urban needs, urban stability, and the interests of urban residents; keep asking the peasants for supplies without thinking of giving them anything; and if we do not set to work to solve this problem but let things continue like this, it will be difficult for agriculture to continue to grow steadily. Although we can practice the responsibility system for leaders at all levels and make it the obligation and duty of the peasants to grow grain, it can only help solve the problem for the time being and cannot solve the fundamental problems facing China's agriculture. 2. We should raise our understanding of the strategical position of agriculture in the national economy. We should say our leaders at all levels have talked enough about the importance of agriculture. They have talked about it for decades from the 1950's till now. However, the guiding principle and policies of the central authorities have not been implemented. So, there is a deep-seated problem here, i.e. for a long time we have overlooked the strategy for agricultural development. The practice of using the goal of quadrupling the GNP by the end of this century as a principal index for assessing the achievements made by local governments and cadres is worth discussing. It is a main factor in causing the tendency to neglect agriculture because agriculture has the lowest comparative advantage and its total output value is also the lowest as compared with other industries. To achieve a lot and to be successful, localities and cadres, of course, will take firm hold of the industry having high output value. Agriculture is undoubtedly put in a negligible position because of its low output value. In the past, we always published the growth rate of the total output value of all provinces and cities in newspapers at the end of each year. Those cadres whose province or city fell behind would feel the pressure. When this pressure changed into action, these cadres would neglect agriculture. So, we must change the practice of assessing the achievements of localities and cadres by means of quotas and break away from the assessment method of using growth rate of total output value as a key indicator and an important basis. If we do not proceed from this, it will not be possible to solve the problem of neglecting agriculture. Besides the abovementioned reason, there is also a structural aspect. For a long time past we practiced the policy that localities were responsible for their finances. As a result, the localities paid attention to whichever industry yielded high profits. However, agriculture was not on their list for consideration. That is why we should gradually solve the structural aspect by deepening the reform. 3. It is necessary to consider whether we should change from the practice of nurturing industry with agriculture into the practice of supporting agriculture with industry. We should consider whether China's economy has reached such a stage, namely, the stage of changing from the practice of nurturing industry with agriculture into one of supporting agriculture with industry. In other words, we should consider whether the time for such a change has come. It is a problem worthy of our consideration. In the course of its development, a developing country usually will have to go through the stage in which agriculture nurtures industry. As industry develops and grows, in due course it will become strong enough to support agriculture. Then it will change into another stage. As for the development of China, it is very clear that industrial development has depended on and been nurtured by agricultural accumulation for a long time. At the beginning of our industrialization it was necessary and a way that we had to take. Now it is time for us to take into consideration the question whether China's economy should change into the stage of industry supporting agriculture as our industry has grown through decades of development. Viewed from the following three points, the condition for such a change has initially matured. First, fundamental changes have taken place in the structure of industrial and agricultural output value. At the beginning of socialist construction, industrial output value accounted for 30 percent while agricultural output value accounted for 70 percent. Having gone through several decades of construction and development, industrial output value now accounts for over 70 percent while agricultural output value accounts for only 20-plus percent. Second, the income disparity between urban and rural residents has grown bigger. During the more than 10 years of reform, the disparity was once reduced; now, however, not only has it returned to the previous situation but it is bigger than the disparity at the beginning of the reform, growing from over two times to over three times. Generally, in the course of modernization of developing countries, the disparity between cities and countryside is around 40 percent. In the ROK, where the disparity is the biggest, it is only around 60 percent. If we allow the situation of undermining agriculture to go on and fail to support agriculture with industry, it will lead to the intensification of social contradictions. Third, we are now in a stage of comprehensive restructuring, changing from the system of planned economy into one of market economy. As agriculture is an industry with a weak constitution, its contradictions are becoming more prominent. Under the condition of market economy, agriculture needs support and aid from the state. Covered up by the planned economy, the contradictions of agriculture as an industry with a weak constitution did not manifest themselves sharply. Since the practice of market economy, the low comparative advantage of agriculture has been sharply reflected through the peasants themselves. It does not mean that there were no contradictions in the past. At that time, under the system of everybody eating from the same big pot, this contradiction did not manifest itself. Now, under such a new situation, if we do not shift the economy to the stage of industry supporting agriculture in a timely fashion, we shall not be able to meet the requirement of making a switch-over. In terms of the abovementioned three points, the conditions for making a switch-over have matured. However, this is a very big issue and, therefore, we should study and explore it well at theoretical level in conjunction with China's reality. Naturally, this change will be a gradual process and cannot be completed overnight. It is now time to raise this problem as our economy cannot always stay at the stage of agriculture supporting industry but should move forward. I think our understanding of this stage should be the basic starting point for us to formulate a series of rural polices. If we still think that we are still at the stage of agriculture supporting industry, then we will go on developing industry at the expense of agriculture. On the other hand, we are required to adopt a series of measures to support agriculture if we think that the stage of industry supporting agriculture has come. Fourth, given the market economy, we should practice a protective policy on agriculture and particularly on grain production. The reason why agriculture needs protection is that it is an industry with a weak constitution. There are two reasons for this: 1. Agriculture mainly uses biological type technology and, to a large extent, is subject to natural elements. So it is difficult for it to compete with mechanical industries which are less subject to natural elements. 2. Agriculture is run on a small scale with a low level of socialization. Usually, its operational units are based on households. It is difficult for it to compete with industries which have a high level of socialization and are managed in an enterprise style. Therefore, under the condition of market economy, those countries practicing market economy adopt, with exceptions, a protective policy toward agriculture. China should not be an exception either. There now exists a different viewpoint which holds that agriculture, including grain production, should be arranged in accordance with the principle of comparative advantage. That is, China will grow whichever crop has a high comparative advantage and will abandon growing those crops with a low comparative advantage. Instead, it will depend on imports. This is not realistic. In China, grain is not an ordinary farm product but a product of strategical significance. Therefore, our basic standpoint is to be basically self-sufficient. Of course, we can import for the sake of variety. There are two reasons for us to say it is not realistic: 1. It is not realistic from the economical point of view. The annual world trade of grain amounts to 100 million tonnes. If China imports a large amount of grain, it will make grain prices rocket on the world market. 2. As a strategic product, grain has its political significance. It is dangerous to depend on others to feed our nation. So it is highly necessary to adopt a protective policy toward agriculture and especially grain. Currently, the biggest problem is that the prices of grain and other farm produce cannot catch up with the prices of agricultural factors of production. The peasants do not increase their income while increasing agricultural production. Under such circumstances, if we do not take protective measures, it is certain that the peasants will not use, or use less, agricultural factors of production. Enterprises producing agricultural factors will also vent their grievances endlessly. Chemical fertilizer plants complain about their losses and so do agricultural machinery plants. Even though they lose money, the peasants still cannot afford to buy them. How can they buy if the prices of the agricultural factors of production are raised again? A dilemma then presents itself: Who to protect? To protect both the peasants and enterprises or just one of them is a serious policy choice. It is difficult to protect both. If we set limits on the prices of the agricultural factors of production, the maximum price limit actually turns out to be the minimum limit. All the more, the peasants should be subsidized. The correct choice is to liberalize one, that is, to liberalize the prices of agricultural factors of production. Let them follow market development and enter the market economy. Those good enterprises will survive while the poor ones will be eliminated through competition in the market economy. The peasants should be subsidized for the use of machines and diesel. Moreover, we can adopt the method of raising prices and bring into play the price leverage. In recent years, the prices of farm produce have increased quite a bit but, despite the present price level, they cannot offset the cost of production. The current price of rice has risen to 0.8 to 1 yuan, which is equal to O.5 yuan in 1989 when inflation is taken into consideration. However, it rose to 1.5 yuan in Guangdong in 1989. It seems necessary to raise the prices of farm produce to protect agriculture but the effects are limited because prices cannot be raised endlessly. The prices of our farm produce are already near the prices in international markets. It is very difficult to raise them higher than the prices in international markets so more consideration should be given to the subsidy method. Another way is to offer loans. The loans provided for the peasants should be preferential ones. We cannot offer them loans with ordinary interest rates. Industries can accept loans with ordinary interest rates but not the peasants. Fifth, we should enlarge the operational scale of agriculture. The operational scale of our agriculture is too small. When compared with Japan and Taiwan, let alone with those countries with a vast territory and a sparse population, it still has a long way to go. In Japan, it is 1.5 hectare while in China, with households as a basic unit, it is 0.43 hectare. It is not possible to increase agricultural labor productivity with such an operational scale. To enlarge the operational scale of agriculture, we need to solve the problem of transferring the surplus labor in agriculture. If we fail to do so, it will be impossible to enlarge the scale. Without developed nonagricultural industries and without developed township and town enterprises, it will be difficult to enlarge the scale. To develop township and town enterprises, we should support labor-intensive industries and strengthen their competitive strength. In short, we will never solve the problems facing China's agriculture only through emphasizing the leader responsibility system and defining grain production as the peasants' obligation and duty. Instead, we should give the abovementioned problems comprehensive consideration and make a great change in our general way of thinking and the whole policy decision. This is an urgent demand of agriculture under the condition of market economy. It is also a new way of thinking for tackling the deep-seated problems facing our agriculture.
