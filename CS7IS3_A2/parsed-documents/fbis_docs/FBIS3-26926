Mr. Hong, also vice chairman of the Jiu San society (one of the eight democratic parties in China) and in charge of this project, said that there were three methods for teaching farmers agricultural technology. The first is to train a contingent of laborers with technology through popularizing agricultural science and technology among farmers. The second is to give 160 million farmers who now have middle school education a qualifying certificate in the "Green Project" after its implementation, enabling them to take a lead in agricultural production, and the third is to develop a contingent of agricultural management cadres and technicians for townships and villages by giving them technical secondary education. According to Mr. Hong, the "Green Project" was now being implemented in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities with more than 300 trial counties and over 200,000 participants taking part while over 60,000 have already been awarded the certificate of the "Green Project". By the year 2000, farmers receiving this kind of education will number 8 million to 10 million, enabling every 20 farming households to have one backbone farmer amongst them with the practical rate of agricultural scientific and technological results raised to between 60 percent to 70 percent, up from the present 30 percent to 40 percent. In addition to the implementation of this project, another important measure for the reform of agriculture in the country is to practice ecological agriculture. Agriculture in China is now facing a number of problems such as increasing environmental pollution, the worsening of water quality in coastal areas, the deteriorating ecological environment, the shortage of resources, the increasing of population and the increasing of the burden placed on agriculture. Regarding this situation, seven ministries and commissions under the State Council will, together with relevant provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, engage in the construction of ecological agriculture in 50 counties from this year to 1997, in order to create ecological agriculture with Chinese characteristics in the country.
