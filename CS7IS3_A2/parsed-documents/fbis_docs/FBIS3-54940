Summing up the results of his work in 1993, in an interview to INTERFAX, he stressed that he sees in this one of the guarantees for the unity and integrity of Russia. Kazannik also said that the General Procuracy has dismissed all cases involving charges of economic crimes which were instigated for political reasons so as to compromise political figures. Touching on his predecessor Valentin Stepankov, the general procurator told journalists that on 24 December he signed an edict sacking him from the bodies of the procuracy. After his resignation, Stepankov was offered various fields of work, including the post of trade counsellor at the Russian Embassy in Malta. Aleksey Kazannik also said that criminal proceedings on charges of corruption are soon to be instituted against Viktor Barannikov and Andrey Dunayev. In conclusion Russia's general procurator gave the assurance that he will not allow the examination of the case concerning the Moscow events of early October 1993 to be spun out over a long period.
