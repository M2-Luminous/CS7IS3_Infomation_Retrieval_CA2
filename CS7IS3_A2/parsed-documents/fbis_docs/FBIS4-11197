First I want to thank [words indistinct] the huge challenge that is the [word indistinct] challenge of my life. I want to thank Salvadorans and tell them that we will not let them down in the historic challenge of bringing the nation closer every day to achieve the social peace that will help consolidate peace, democracy, freedom, and justice in El Salvador. We [words indistinct] of this clear and [word indistinct] Salvadorans have bestowed upon us in these historic elections. We commit ourselves to serve all Salvadorans. We want to thank ARENA's rank and file, our supporters, all our collaborators, and the thousands and thousands of volunteers nationwide who worked hard for this civic event and made possible this great and extraordinary victory, this victory for Salvadorans, this victory for all. I want to thank and congratulate our opponent, Dr. Ruben Zamora, who has already publicly acknowledged our victory, thus showing political stature and refinement. I want to thank him for his acknowledgement and also to assure our political adversaries that we will govern for all Salvadorans. I want our adversaries to be confident from now on that we the president-elect and vice president-elect will govern for all Salvadorans. We believe our great task, our great mission is to consolidate peace, ensure political stability, and make El Salvador a better country for all Salvadorans. We will seek better standards of living for thousands and thousands of Salvadorans who need human progress and development. We must face the problems of underdevelopment and poverty together. I would like to thank you all for this news coverage and the way you have followed the Salvadoran democratic process. I reiterate: Long live El Salvador! This victory belongs to El Salvador and its democratic system, which is growing stronger every day. I would like to tell all Salvadorans that we are going to work hand in hand with you for the next five years. I thank you all very much. [Borgo] First we would like to express our gratitude to all those Salvadoran brothers who trusted us and placed an enormous responsibility in our hands. Among those people, I would like to give special thanks to the ARENA members [words indistinct] and all those Salvadorans who voted for us. We must now ask God for help to attain the goals we have set and for strength to work for the Salvadoran people. I would like to thank the media [words indistinct], which has given us coverage throughout the presidential campaign. We hope you can project the true image of what we Salvadorans are all about: A nation which loves democracy and freedom and is convinced that the only road to progress is through social peace. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] As you know, we do not have any official results from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]. Our computer center shows a significant trend. We would rather not give any figures at this time because the TSE has not approved them. We do know that this is a stunning and undeniable victory with a difference of more than two to one. I believe, however, that the TSE must report the numbers, because ours are not official. It would be better to wait for the TSE's official information. Our democracy guarantees participation for Ruben Zamora and the opposition forces. A specific and significant portion of the Salvadoran population has trusted them and given them an unquestionable political place in the Legislative Assembly [words indistinct]. In our democratic life, we seek participation for everyone. We seek the right degree of consensus and acceptance. We seek agreement. Parliamentary debate is precisely that. The government will respect and encourage participation. It will listen to whatever proposals a constructive opposition can offer. We are sure that this is the way it will work, and we are sure all Salvadorans will have a say in the country's future. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] We will deal with poverty as it has been dealt with so far, with a series of social programs that we have already defined in our government plan. I think it would take too long to get into that matter during this news conference. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Borgo] Our government will be made up of Salvadorans who love El Salvador and who have the capability and honesty to occupy a public post efficiently to bring the country forward. When we start putting our government team together, I am sure we will seek out the most capable people so we can face the country's problems together as a real team. There will be a truly effective combination of specialists and politicians. I believe we have the enormous responsibility to find the most capable individuals in our society. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] We have a commitment and a mandate to form an ARENA administration. That does not mean the administration wants to exclude the opposition. They have a specific role in the democratic system. [words indistinct] My first step will be to ensure [words indistinct] of the peace agreements, which constitute a national commitment, a commitment by all organizations that guarantee peace and security in the country. That is why as president-elect I will go to New York to meet with the UN secretary general to ensure that the future of the peace agreements and the country's political stability [words indistinct]. I want to dedicate our victory to Salvadorans, because it is a victory for El Salvador. This victory commits us to God, and we ask him to give us humility; humility in our triumph, strength, sovereignty, and wisdom in this difficult struggle that awaits us in the coming five years. Our mission will be to improve the standard of living for Salvadorans. I offer this victory to Salvadorans because it belongs to them. It is a victory for all Salvadorans. We believe this election will serve as an historic example in the life of a nation that perseveres. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] Political, labor, and social forces and productive small and intermediate business sectors joined in these run-off elections. I would say that, on the contrary, these run-off elections strengthened our party. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] Our commitment to the nation will be to keep [word indistinct] and to comply with the peace agreements. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] I believe [words indistinct] the acceptance of governability. I am confident that with my untiring effort -- because I will not stop -- we will achieve better levels of development, progress, and social stability for Salvadorans. We will achieve the objectives you mentioned. That will be the greatest satisfaction of my life; to have accomplished the mission with which Salvadorans have entrusted me. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] [Words indistinct] won a political place in El Salvador. This has been confirmed by the peace agreements [words indistinct]. We Salvadorans have achieved peace [words indistinct]. Now we must achieve social peace, the reorganization and development of our motherland. This is a huge and profound challenge that involves not just me but all Salvadorans. [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. [Calderon] It is a commitment, especially for all Central Americans, to work and strive for regional integration. We will use our work and willingness to seek greater levels of integration, not only in economic aspects but also in political and social aspects. Central America is one, and we will translate our will as Salvadorans -- a unified people -- into doing all we can to work toward true integration, especially in Central America. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] We are willing to negotiate. We are willing to seek the truth, regardless of who is affected. We will strictly apply the law and seek to strengthen [words indistinct], whoever it might be -- the joint commission or any other group -- in search of any solution to implement the law. We will be there because only then will we achieve justice and have the nation we all want. This is the only way we can gradually consolidate the state of law we all want in El Salvador. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] Look, there is no reason for anyone to point fingers at me. I am sure of all of my actions and I know my political career is a true example, which is why the Salvadoran people have given me their support and their trust on this wonderful day. Today the entire Salvadoran nation has seen, spoken to, and trusted this humble servant of yours. I think this is a reward for my continuing efforts on the political scene. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] There is only one ARENA project. I also believe there are valuable people in the government already, and I will surely take some of the present government's people into account. They will be the most capable people; those who can contribute the most to the country and the project. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] I believe the political campaign is over now. We must enforce the law and consolidate the state of law in El Salvador. Separating the powers of state will help guarantee that. We will have a judicial branch, which we already have. We have a legislative branch, the first authority, and an executive branch. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Calderon] We have an appointment in New York on 15 May before the inauguration ceremonies, when we will meet with [words indistinct]. [Announcer] President-elect Armando Calderon Sol and Vice President-elect Enrique Borgo Bustamante have concluded their news conference.
