Several personalities, in particular Prime Minister Jean-Luc Mandaba, the speaker of the National Assembly, members of the government and the presidential staff went to welcome him at Bangui airport. [passage omitted] Soon after his arrival at the Palais de la Renaissance, the president reviewed the Ndjamena summit. He recalled the signing of the treaty and agreements establishing the Economic and Monetary Community of Central African States [CEMAC], the Monetary Union of Central Africa, and the Economic Union of Central Africa. The quality of discussions held by the UDEAC heads of state was very much appreciated. In fact, they did not merely content themselves with approving the reports drawn up by experts and ministers. On the contrary, they carried out a detailed examination of the documents submitted to them. The issues discussed at the summit consisted of economic and regional integration, the situation of the Bank of Central African States, and a report on the opening up of the region, presented by the Central African Republic. President Ange Felix Patasse also appealed for reconciliation between the Chadian Government and Moise Kette's movement operating in southern Chad, the National Awakening Committee for Peace and Democracy. Alain-George Ngatoua has given us a full report on President Patasse's Ndjamena trip: [Begin Patasse recording] I would like to tell you how happy I feel to be among you this 17 March, for, within days, we will be marking the anniversary of the tragic death of President Barthelemy Boganda. In Ndjamena, we contributed much to the success of the UDEAC summit. We have remained faithful to its spirit and I am happy to announce that at long last Central Africa is coming out of its deep slumber. We have understood that our destinies are linked together. Central Africa is lagging far behind the others because of national chauvinism. At the same time that we held our summit in Ndjamena, West Africa was also holding its summit. While all the West African heads of state were present at their summit, some leaders in our subregion were absent. You will understand the anguish we felt some time ago. So if we left Bangui for Ndjamena, it was not simply to accept the UDEAC secretary general's report, but because we wanted to breathe new life into this institution by taking a decisive step. It was a choice between continuing to tread the same well-trodden paths or to carry out a radical restructuring. We opted for the latter solution. Yes, Central Africa is coming out of its long sleep and those who want to remain within this general dymamic awakening movement will do so, but those who do not want to do so -- and it is a question of state sovereignty -- are free not to go along with the others. As far as we are concerned, we have stated that the treaty establishing the economic and monetary community in Central Africa must be signed at all costs. We have also said that it was not obligatory to sign the treaty on the same day and at the same place. Each country can do so within the framework of its peculiar institutions. On this score, the host country submitted the draft treaty for signature. Chad, Congo, and the Central African Republic have signed the treaty. The president of Equatorial Guinea could not be present at Ndjamena and delegated this responsiblity to his deputy prime minister, so Equatorial Guinea has also signed. Cameroon sent only the president of its Economic and Social Council, who did not even have a mandate to initial the document. However, since the current chairmanship of the UDEAC has fallen to Cameroon, the ball is in that country's court. We have decided to walk hand in hand, and that is the determining factor. The community has been born. [passage omitted] [end recording]
