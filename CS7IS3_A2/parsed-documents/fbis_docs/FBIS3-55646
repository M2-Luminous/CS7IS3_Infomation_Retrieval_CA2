Right after the tragic developments of October 3 and 4 he decided to use up his annual leave for the past two years. After his vacation he resigned. The new Prosecutor General, Aleksey Kazannik, signed his request for resignation without even interviewing him. "I resigned because the present office of prosecutor general with its new functions and powers does not conform to the model I had created," Stepankov stressed. According to him, he has not been summoned yet as a witness in the legal proceedings connected with the October events, though he participated in them on both sides. Beginning with September 21, Stepankov explained, he visited the parliament building more than once, where the congress of people's deputies was taking place, and attended sessions held at the headquarters led by First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets. As Stepankov said, he is still out of work. He declined the only offer he received: the Foreign Trade Minister, Oleg Davydov, offered him a job abroad. When asked by INTERFAX's correspondent why he had taken no part in the race for parliament, Stepankov said that his former work as a member of the Supreme Soviet had not satisfied him, and so he was not prepared to join the new parliament. "I belonged to no faction in the previous legislature, and now I have no wish to represent the interests of any party in the new parliament," Stepankov pointed out. With reference to the case of those who plotted the failed August 1991 coup, the former prosecutor general said: "Now, looking back, some charges against myself could be revoked." According to Stepankov, at one time he was accused of procrastinating with investigations. "But those investigations began only four and a half months previously, and 9 months more were spent on acquainting the defendants and their lawyers with the materials. The trial has been in progress for over a year now, but only one defendant has been questioned so far."
