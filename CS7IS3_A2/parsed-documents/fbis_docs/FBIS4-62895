He said that his country would welcome wider activities of Japanese businessmen and that a Japanese business center would be set up in the capital Bishkek shortly. Akayev emphasized that Japan's aid in reconstructing the republic's economy, in particular in reforming the banking system was invaluable. Akayev thought that Japan could be involved in structural changes now underway in Kyrgyzstan. He supported the Japan-proposed, long-term Silk Route of the 21st Century project of developing telecommunication and airlines between Eastern Europe, Russia and South East and Central Asia. The project would turn Kyrgyzstan into a center of transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia, Akayev thought.
