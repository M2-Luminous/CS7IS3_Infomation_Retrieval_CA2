Foreword With the increase in computer applications concerned with three- dimensions, the necessity for a three-dimensional HI is increasing more and more. For example, in many three-dimensional CAD, though the functions of modeling and form presentation are becoming complete, there are many commands and input items and the operation is complicated. These problems will be resolved if the technology to display the form as a three-dimensional image and to operate as is thought is established. Also, the results of three-dimensional physical simulation are visualized and the use of three-dimensional images becomes more effective in the case of constructing and displaying three-dimensional images for medical use from ultrasonic diagnostic equipment and CT (Computed Tomography) equipment as well. In order to realize such a three-dimensional HI, a display is necessary which not only displays the three-dimensional data simply, but also gives the sense as an object in the real world to the user. Visually, the sense of an object is produced by the user actively changing the viewpoint. For example, when we see an actual object, we change our viewpoint and look at it from various directions. In other words, for the perception of the three-dimensional form accurately, the change in the way of seeing following the change in viewpoint is used in addition to the stereoscopic perception from both eyes. In current virtual reality (VR), such a sense is artificially formed with the change in the display according to the movements of the head. However, since there is always a time lag between the head movements and the change in the display with this method, the user easily gets motion sickness.[.sup]1[/] Also, in order for the measurement of the head movements, it is necessary to wear a device in the form of special goggles which is inconvenient in practical application. For the display of data as a three-dimensional object in a more natural form, it is most simple to display it as a three- dimensional image in real space. At Toshiba, a display for this type of display system which uses the afterimage of the eye was developed.[.sup]2[/] Called the volumetric scanning system, this display has the following characteristics which are not found in other display systems; it is thought to be appropriate for various fields. 1. A natural three-dimensional sense is attained in order for the image to unite completely with real space. 2. The field of vision is very wide and the image can be viewed by many people around the display. 3. Volume data can be directly displayed. Below, an outline of the display and examples of its applications are discussed from the perceptive of HI. 2. Outline of the display Figure 1 shows the principle for the volumetric scanning display developed. While the panel of LED arranged in a matrix form is moved up and down, sectional images of the object corresponding to the position of the panel are displayed. When the LED panel moves at high speeds, each image appears connected with the effect of the afterimage in the eye and this is perceived as a three-dimensional image. In other words, the effect attained by moving the two-dimensional display surface is the same as if picture elements were positioned in real space. Moreover, the round trip movement of the LED panel is produced by mechanical conversion of the rotary movement of a motor. Figure 1. Principle of three-dimensional array. The three-dimensional image is made by the display of cross sectional images corresponding to the position of the LED panel which is moving up and down. <annot> Key: 1. LED panel (96x96mm dot), 2.

Also, Figure 3 shows the hardware configuration of the display and Table 1 shows a summary of the specifications. Figure 2. External view of displayFigure 3. Hardware structure of display. Figure 3.

Specifications of three-dimensional display | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Display range |95x95x100mm | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Number of picture elements |96x96x100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Display frequency (Average) |20 Hz | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Color tone |Red, one shade | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The two technical points here are as follows. 1. Display of clear image. The brightness of the image is determined by the illumination time per unit time and the properties of the LED. Here, as the display is made twice in one round trip of the LED panel, the illumination time of each LED is operated by the parallelization of the display processing. Also, red high brightness type elements with high emission strength and fast response are used as the LED. 2. Homogenization of image brightness. Since the speed of the LED panel is fast in the center of the display zone and slow at the ends, the LED illumination density and time may be made independent of the panel speed in order to homogenize the brightness of the image. Here, while the initial display position of each cross section is made at regular intervals with the linear encoder, all the LEDs are controlled to illuminate at a time with the standard being the maximum speed time of the panel. Moreover, so a moving picture can be displayed, an AS4000 series workstation is used for the computer and an S bus is used for data transmission from the computer to the display memory. Also, the display memory has a 2 bank configuration and isolates and performs the writing of data from the computer and the reading of data to the display section. Meanwhile, in this display, since the image is expressed as an assemblage of monochromatic bright points, the expression of shading is not possible. Also, the processing of hidden surface is not possible since all the cross sections are seen in principle. Consequently, when it is displayed as a solid and its interior is filled with bright points, the edges become indefinite and only individual lumps of light can be seen. Also, the image of the rear which originally could not be seen appears transparent. Therefore, in the case of displaying a solid form, only the surface or edge of the form becomes filled with bright points. 3. Applications of Display 3.1 Display of Form and Operation The following two issues are considered in direct three-dimensional form modeling. 1. The method to indicate points in space and link these with a line 2. The method according to a combination of the basic form For the first method, an HI pointing to an image of points and lines directly is desirable. However, in this display, since the image is displayed in space where an LED panel is moving, it cannot be directly pointed out. Therefore, with the prototype system as shown in Figure 4, the image on the display is transferred in three dimensions to another space with an optical system using a concave mirror and the transferred image is operated with a pointer. In this case, direct pointing is performed easily since the transferred image is also a three-dimensional real image. Figure 4. Image transfer using optical system. By using an optical system employing a concave mirror, the image on the display is transferred to a space where it can be freely operated. <annot> Key: 1. Volume scanning display, 2. Image before transfer, 3. Concave mirror, 4. Image after transfer, 5. Three-dimensional pointer, 6. Viewpoint</graphic> On the other hand, for the second method, an HI in which the desired form is prepared while the combination among forms is confirmed is desirable. Therefore, it is necessary for the set operations among the forms to be performed and displayed in real time. Here, this HI is realized as the form is developed in the form of volume data in the computer memory and this display is used to display the results of the set operations. The set operations in the memory are at a high speed for the quantity of data to the extent of this display; moreover the volume data can be directly displayed with this display. Consequently, while the form is moved with a three-dimensional mouse, the state of this combination can be seen as a three-dimensional real image in real time. Figure 5 shows an example of a mechanical part produced with this method. This can be precisely called the ultimate three-dimensional CAD environment which directly prepares a three-dimensional form in real space. Figure 5. Mechanical part modeled by set operations. An example of a three-dimensional form (mechanical part) made directly in real space. 3.2 Visualization of simulation results The results of three-dimensional simulations usually are shown as spatially distributed numerical data, in other words volume data. In the case of visualizing this using prior CRT (Image display equipment), it is necessary to project all data in two dimensions in theory and the display processing is difficult. On the other hand, with this display, processing such as two-dimensional projection is unnecessary since the points in three-dimensional space correspond directly to the display memory as discussed above. The volume data can be directly visualized. Also, since the image can really be observed from various directions, it is easy to understand such data with a high degree of geometrical abstraction. Figure 6 shows air flow simulation results of an air conditioner in a heated room. The outer frame of the diagram shows the room, the small rectangle inside is the air conditioner, the box on the floor is an obstruction and the points are the tracers to express the flow. The position at each time of each tracer is calculated from the speed vector in advance and put in the form of volume data. As this volume data is continuously transmitted and displayed to the display, the simulation results can e displayed as a moving image. Furthermore, the understanding of the phenomena is increased since it is possible to change the display speed or stop at or return to a point which one wants to observe. Moreover, tracers are displayed in this example, but it works the same in the case of showing equivalent surfaces or boundary surfaces. 3.3 Display of three-dimensional images for medical use and operation Three-dimensional images for medical use are basically made by accumulating continuous sectional layered images from X-ray CT equipment and ultrasonic diagnostic equipment. In other words, this is volume data and can be directly displayed as a three-dimensional image if this display is used in the same way as in the previous section. Here, bones and organs are brought out and isolated with the key of differences from previous CT values; the system to combine them as necessary at the display time was constructed.[.sup]3[/] Figure 7 is a display example of a three-dimensional CT image of the head; the form and position of the afflicted section can be clearly seen.

Bones and organs are brought out and isolated with previous CT values; they are combined and displayed as necessary.</graphic> Moreover, support for surgical planning and surgical simulation as in Figure 8 become possible by developing the image on a computer and performing layering, removal, and transfer as set operations in memory in real time. Figure 9 shows an example of layering the afflicted section and hypothetical sphere in real time and measuring its size and central position. The precision of actual surgery is expected to be improved with this. Figure 8. Concept of surgical simulation.

Conclusion A volumetric scanning three-dimensional display using an LED, the preparation and display of its form, and its application to the visualization of flow analysis results and the display and operation of three-dimensional images for medical use were discussed. In the future, we would like for it to be appropriate for various areas when the display is made multicolored.
