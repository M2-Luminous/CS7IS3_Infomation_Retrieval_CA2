"This decision is unlikely to be carried out," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told INTERFAX on Friday. According to him, "prior to becoming a law, the Senate's decision must be supported by the House of Representatives." "And this is very problematic. But even if this happens, the U.S. President might use his right to veto," the diplomat said. American legislators, he noted, had already decided to lift the embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian Muslims previously. "As at that time, this may be a political declaration, rather than instructions for action. Under American legislation the international law has priority over national, and therefore the U.N. embargo on arms supplies to the Muslims will remain in force till the U.N. Security Council makes its own decision," he said. Nevertheless, the diplomat conceded that the U.S. Senate's decision is not the "best gift" for the conference of the heads of Russian, American, British, French, Belgian, German and Greek diplomacies on a settlement in Bosnia which opens in Geneva on Friday. "The U.S. secretary of state will have to reckon with the senators' decision in one way or another. The only question is to what extent," he added. According to INTERFAX's interviewee, "the political declaration of the U.S. Senate might give rise to some response in Russia's State Duma." "As regards emotions our legislators are not second to the American. They can be expected to decide to lift the sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia in the near future. If this happens, the State Duma decision will have the same fate as that of the U.S. Senate," the diplomat concluded.
