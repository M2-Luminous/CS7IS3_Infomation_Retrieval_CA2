The reason given for the personnel reductions was a downturn in market conditions. The downturn is most noticeable in the demand for the Redigo, a training aircraft. The announcement of the layoffs came on Thursday [5 May]. According to Managing Director Juhani Markula, conditions are expected to remain difficult for quite some time. As the backlog of orders can provide work for only a short time, layoffs in parts manufacturing for the Redigo plane will also be necessary at Avicomp in August. Those layoffs would affect 100 employees at the most. The company began last Thursday to negotiate with personnel on the reductions and layoffs. Valmet aviation currently has 1,000 employees, 800 of whom work in Kuorevesi. Nearly 200 more work in the motor service units in Linnavuori in Nokia. According to Markula, the intended measures do not threaten the Hornet and Saab 2000 project or the production of air combat materiel. However, the measures will affect all types of workers in the aircraft industry. Valmet had revenues of 256 million markkas last year in comparison with 202 million markkas the year before. In 1992, losses amounted to 23 million markkas, last year they dropped to 1 million markkas. At year's end, it was expected that revenues would grow and that profits would increase in the coming year. According to the annual report, the number of aircraft in stock increased last year as a result of canceled orders. The Saab 2000 project, in turn, is behind schedule because of delays in technical approval.
