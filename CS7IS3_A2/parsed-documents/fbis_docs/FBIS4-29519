Kim Il-song conveyed his willingness to meet Kim Yong-sam in the not-too-distant future without any conditions through former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who arrived in Seoul Saturday after a four- day visit to Pyongyang. Presidential press secretary Chu Ton-sik said that President Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish to "meet President Kim Yong-sam at any time, anywhere without conditions at an early date," told Carter that he would accept the offer "without any hesitation." Carter conveyed Kim Il-song's verbal message while briefing the South Korean president on the results of his visit to Pyongyang. As to Kim Il-song's suggestion that "the earlier the summit came the better it would be," Kim Yong-sam expressed his assent, saying, "I myself think that the South-North Korean summit would be better the earlier it came." Kim asked Carter to convey his position to Kim Il-song, Chu said. Barring any unexpected developments, a South-North summit is likely to occur in the near future for the first time in the half-century of national division, now that the two top leaders have said they were willing to hold an "unconditional summit meeting at any time and at any place." The meeting could take place either in Seoul, Pyongyang or at a third location. Once a summit was materialized, the nuclear and other major issues pending between the two sides could be discussed and epochal momentum provided to progress in South-North relations. South and North Korea are expected to have working-level contacts soon to discuss details related to a summit meeting. "There will be working-level contacts as President Kim Yong-sam has given an express reply to President Kim Il-song's proposal by saying he would meet the Northern leader at any time and at any place," spokesman Chu said.
