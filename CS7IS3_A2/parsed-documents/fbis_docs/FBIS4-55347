That part of the war-wracked former Yugoslav republic has since last autumn been the scene of fierce clashes between troops loyal to [word indistinct] leader Izetbegovic and supporters of his moderate rival and local leader Fikret Abdic. Abdic's supporters proclaimed their own autonomous province of western Bosnia in late September 1993, and have since signed friendship and cooperation treaties with the other two Bosnian nations -- Serbs and Croats. Radio Sarajevo said that provincial forces on Thursday kept up a sustained attack, the brunt of which was directed at the village of Todorovo where `nearly all facilities have been demolished, including mosques and schools, and there was a considerable number of dead and wounded.' The source said that the Moslem army's 5th Corps, loyal to Izetbegovic, had managed to regain some strategically important positions captured by Abdic's troops the day before. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
