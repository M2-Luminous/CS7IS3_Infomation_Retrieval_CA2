According to the latest statistics, a total of 15,000 deals involving 100 million U.S. dollars have been concluded since last December, when the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the communications bank started such business. At present, individuals with foreign currency in hand may exchange it according to the rates on the international foreign exchange market. Until late last year all privately owned foreign exchange had to be deposited in banks. Wang Qinpei, an official of the Shanghai branch of the Communications Bank, said that the individual savings deposits in foreign exchange in banks in Shanghai had risen from less than 100 million U.S. dollars in 1987 to 2.4 billion U.S. dollars by the end of last year, accounting for about one fifth of the country's total private foreign exchange savings deposits.
