The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said farmers turned enthusiastic after typhoons helped make for a poor harvest last year, leading the government to begin emergency rice imports. According to a report by the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu), about 80,000 hectares are likely to be turned back into paddies in 1994. Since the 1993 acreage was 2.13 million hectares, about 2.20 million hectares are likely to be cultivated for rice, ministry officials said. If the crop index is 100 this year as in a usual year, approximately 11 million tons of rice harvest can be expected, about one million tons more than the yearly domestic demand. After last year's poor harvest which saw the crop index down to 74, the ministry decreased the size of fields that were to be used for other crops. For fiscal 1994 and 1995, the ministry lowered its target for such fields to 600,000 hectares.
