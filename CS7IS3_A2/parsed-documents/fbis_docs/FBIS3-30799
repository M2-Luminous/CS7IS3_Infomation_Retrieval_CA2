In the letter he points out that the Serb side "cannot tolerate a situation in which the perpetrator of the crime in Sarajevo's marketplace remains unidentified. Nor can it tolerate the international community's tacit agreement that this was done by the Serbs." "If the truth is not established promptly the Muslim side will continue to perpetrate crimes to fool the international community while the Serbian people and the whole region will experience an escalation and intensification of war," Radovan Karadzic cautions in his letter. The president of the Srpska republic demands that the Russian Government provide a neutral international group of experts to compile a professional report. This team of experts should also include, in addition to ballistics specialists, pathologists who would investigate the causes and time of death of the civilian victims. Radovan Karadzic maintains that in the course of identifying the true perpetrator of the massacre in Merkale marketplace one should also analyze it politically, something President Yeltsin has mentioned too. This analysis, Karadzic believes, would indicate which side has made a political gain from this crime. "We call on you and the Russian Government to provide such an expert report and appoint Russian ballistics experts, pathologists, and political analysts to such an international group of experts. It goes without saying that this group should also include experts from the Serbian and Muslim side," Karadzic writes in his letter to Churkin.
