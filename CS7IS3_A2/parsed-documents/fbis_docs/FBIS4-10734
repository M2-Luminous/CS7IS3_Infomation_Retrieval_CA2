Colonel Hernan Seaman, chief of the Honduran Army 9th Infantry Battalion, informed international news agencies that his troops engaged in heavy clashes with groups allegedly connected with the 3-80 Northern Front in the area known as Chilamates, 300 km east of Tegucigalpa. Two rebels and one Honduran soldier, identified as Santos Armando Rodriguez, 21, from the border town of Danli, were killed in this clash. "There was no confrontation with any group of the 3-80 Northern Front, nor has any member of the 3-80 Northern Front entered Honduran territory," CIAV-OAS Nicaragua Director Sergio Caramagna told LA PRENSA. "All commanders, subcommanders, and commandos of this rebel group are within the security zone," Caramagna added. LA PRENSA tried to interview Jose Angel Talavera, also known as commander "EL Chacal," chief of the 3-80 Northern Front, but our efforts were fruitless. "El Chacal" met yesterday with Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta to discuss the problem with the Legislative Branch, which questioned the executive's decision to incorporate members of the 3-80 Northern Front in the police. The Honduran Army is conducting offensive actions in territory bordering Nicaragua to reduce crimes by criminal armed gangs composed mainly of Nicaraguans who were linked to the Nicaraguan Resistance. In this regard, Honduran Army Chief General Luis Alonso Discua has ordered reinforcements on the border with Nicaragua and has ordered troops to respond "with strength against rearmed groups entering the neighboring country." Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock, spokesman for the Sandinist People's Army (EPS), told LA PRENSA the two armies have met to coordinate actions that guarantee security in the border areas of both countries. Wheelock termed these actions casual operations at specific locations. However, he announced larger operations will be conducted in the coming weeks. The Nicaraguan and Honduran armies agreed last month to fight border crime because crime in general has increased in both countries. In Honduras, particularly, gangs of Nicaraguan criminals are violating that country's territory. "Assaults, rapes, and robberies have increased at an alarming rate in southern Honduras, where another dangerous phenomenon is also occurring: gun-running by civilians who are not connected to gangs of criminals," Wheelock asserted. "What is happening is that in Honduras weapons are sold at good prices. This prompts Nicaraguans living near the Honduran border to try to sell their weapons left over from the war in that country. There are indirect gun-running activities," the high-ranking military officer remarked. For Wheelock, the fact the Honduran Army associates criminal actions with groups of the 3-80 Northern Front is not an important detail. "What concerns us is that there is a tangible manifestation of the crime. We have experienced gangs of criminals who perpetrate their crimes in other parts of the country and identify themselves as members of the 3-80 Northern Front, and this is perhaps not true," Wheelock concluded.
