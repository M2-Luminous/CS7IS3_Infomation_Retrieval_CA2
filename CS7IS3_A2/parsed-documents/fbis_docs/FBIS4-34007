Calderon, who assumed the presidency of his country on 1 June and is participating in this forum for the first time, advocated the strengthening of representative democracy and the promotion of human rights and economic and social development as the Ibero-American community's "major objectives." The Salvadoran president pointed out that they would be able to attain the Ibero-American peoples' aspirations of "living in peace, liberty, and with greater opportunities" once such conditions are attained. He observed that almost all the countries in Ibero-America enjoy democracy and added that "well-defined and concrete measures and actions," which conform to the current international economic trends, must be taken to confront the challenges posed by commerce, integration, and development. In this sense, he stressed, ways must be found to include regional economies in the international sphere, especially after the GATT Uruguay Round which will allow the opening of new markets for developing countries. As with the Central American presidents who spoke before him, the Salvadoran highlighted the "feasible development" [desarrollo sostenible] program implemented by the Isthmian countries. This program ties economic growth to respect for the environment and social problems for the people which, according to the Salvadoran president, requires "pragmatic policies." The struggle for development, he asserted, is not circumscribed to the liberalization of commerce but to the promotion of integration as a response to the international challenges. The program has made noteworthy progress in Central America since the Central American Integration System was created in 1991. This organization comprises a region where peace, liberty, and democracy have been consolidated. "However, we must admit the tasks we have set out to achieve are challenged by the difficulties inherent to our condition as a developing nation," he added. Calderon concluded by calling on the countries to take advantage of the historic, ethnic, and cultural ties binding the participating nations and to redouble their efforts for the "possible creation of the Ibero-American Community of Nations."
