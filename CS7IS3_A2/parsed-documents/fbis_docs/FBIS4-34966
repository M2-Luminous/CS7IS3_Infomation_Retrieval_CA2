In a speech delivered in the western province of Matanzas, some 100 km east of the capital, Alarcon pointed out that this fact is increasing the anger of the enemies of the revolution that first arose in 1959. The legislative leader said that in spite of the tightening of the blockade imposed on the island by the United States over three decades ago, a growing number of foreign investors are interested in establishing joint enterprises with Cuba. According to a report by the National Information Agency (AIN), every day more businessmen become interested in investing in our country, despite the blockade and U.S. hostility, Alarcon emphasized. Alarcon also mentioned the Canadian Government's announcement this week that it would resume official assistance to the country. Cuba has been experiencing an adverse economic situation since the disappearance of the European socialist bloc led by the former USSR, with which Cuba conducted 85 percent of its trade.
