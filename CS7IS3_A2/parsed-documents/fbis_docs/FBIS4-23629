"From this moment, a new government of national unity is in power throughout the length and breadth of the federal Republic of Nigeria, led by me...as president and commander-in-chief," Abiola told a crowd of nearly three thousand people at a clandestine meeting. A copy of the speech was obtained by AFP during Saturday night. "My government of national unity is the only legitimate constituted authority in the federal Republic of Nigeria, as of now." He provided no details on the government's composition but said that from now on all democratic institutions dissolved by military ruler General Sani Abacha after he seized power in November had been re-established. "I call on the usurper, General Sani Abacha, to announce his resignation forthwith, together with the rest of his illegal ruling council. "We are prepared to enter into negotiations with them to work out the mechanics for a smooth transfer of power. I pledge that if they hand over quietly they will be retired with all their entitlements and their positions will be accorded all the respect due to them."
