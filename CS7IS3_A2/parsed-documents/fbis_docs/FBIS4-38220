He was formally welcomed by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. After arriving in Tehran Mr. Aliyev, in an interview with our correspondent, referred to the Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI] and our country's revolutionary people as the friends and sincere brothers of the Azerbaijan Republic. Referring to the two countries' common historical, national, and religious background, he said: We attach great importance to the IRI as an influential and powerful neighbor and we would like the two countries to expand ties in all fields. The president of Azerbaijan added that during his stay in our country he will hold talks with President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and other IRI officials on the most significant regional and international issues and the expansion of the two countries' relations. On the axes of talks with Azerbaijan's president and the two countries' ties, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. We are very close to Azerbaijan in every respect. Our people feel solidarity [yeganegi] in both countries. At present the level of our ties is very good too. During my visit to Baku -- frankly -- among the authorities, with Mr. Aliyev himself, and among the people I felt as if they were like our own people. Fortunately many of the decisions we took during that visit are currently being implemented. Of course some of the important decisions require time for implementation. We have had some memoranda of understanding, which we will pursue during this visit. To us the problem of military conflict in Caucasia is highly significant. One of the subjects of our talks, therefore, will be the same issues of Karabakh and the problems of Caucasia in general. Among our important issues are cooperation in the Caspian Sea and greater utilization of the joint river of Aras. There are the issues of transit, trade and exchange visits by our people. Almost all the issues that the two countries are interested in and eager to discuss will be discussed during this visit. We hope that just like my trip to Baku, the visit of his excellency the president of Azerbaijan to Tehran will also be a great stride in the expansion of cooperation.
