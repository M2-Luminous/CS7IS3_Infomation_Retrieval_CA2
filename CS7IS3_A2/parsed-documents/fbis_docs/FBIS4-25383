As a result, drought resistance and disaster relief are now an overriding task for the province's rural work. Given the rigorous drought situation at the moment, the province held a drought resistance and disaster relief teleconference yesterday afternoon. The teleconference disclosed that since last September, the province has received less than 50 percent of its usual rainfall and got only meager rainfall last May when wheat was sprouting and in the flowering and autumn sowing period. The province's total reservoir water storage capacity has also dropped by 100 million cubic meters compared with the same period of last year. As a result, some 970,000 people and more than 730,000 head of livestock will be affected by a short supply of drinking water. Provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang spoke at yesterday's teleconference calling on all areas and departments concerned in the province to take drought resistance and disaster relief as an overriding task for the province's rural work at the moment, make sufficient ideological preparations for waging a whole-scale drought resistance struggle across the province, fully mobilize and rely on enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people, adopt comprehensive drought-resistance measures, assemble all available human, material, and financial resources for drought resistance and disaster relief work, strive to protect the province's grain crops by all means, and make every possible endeavor to reduce the province's drought-related losses to a minimum. Secretary Yan Haiwang noted: While implementing the relevant drought resistance measures in a timely fashion, we should also show great concern and make flawless arrangements for people's livelihood, carry out in-depth and meticulous work in disaster areas, and make effective use of disaster relief funds. Provincial Vice Governor Cai Xiaosu also spoke at the teleconference spelling out comprehensive arrangements for the province's drought resistance and disaster relief work.
