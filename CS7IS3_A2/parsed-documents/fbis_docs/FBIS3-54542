The Indian Government has strongly protested President Clinton's letter to the Khalistan Council and warned that the U.S. pronouncements may have a negative impact on bilateral relations. The international community has now begun to feel strongly about the shameful treatment meted out to the non-Hindu minorities, especially the Muslims and the Sikhs, in India in the name of secularism. That is why the international media has started to focus attention on the armed struggle for freedom in occupied Kashmir and the repression against the Indian Sikhs, and a voice is also being raised in their favor at the international level. A handful of higher caste Hindus have made the lives of all non-Hindu minorities in India extremely difficult. The Sikh minority had backed the Hindus in the struggle for independence and had rejected great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah's request for support to the Muslim League and his offer of a separate homeland for the Sikhs. They, however, realized their political mistake soon after independence. For the past 10 years, the Indian Sikhs have been waging a struggle to establish an independent Khalistan state and, presently, there is not a single Sikh family in Indian Punjab from which at least one person has not been killed at the hands of the Indian forces and the police. The manner in which the sanctity of the holiest seat of the Sikh faith, the Golden Temple, was trampled upon during the Indira Gandhi regime is glaring proof of the prejudice of the Hindu mind against the holy places of the non-Hindu minorities. The call made by President Clinton for a peaceful settlement of the issue of the Sikhs' independence is appropriate and justified in every respect. Besides the Sikhs, the Indian Muslims, the untouchables, the Nagas, and other oppressed sections also reserve the right to demand independence from India for their survival.
