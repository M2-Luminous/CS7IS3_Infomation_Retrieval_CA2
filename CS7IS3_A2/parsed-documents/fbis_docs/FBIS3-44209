The peaceful march was organised by the Lesotho Council of Non-governmental Organisations whose executive director, Caleb Sello, handed the petition to the Office of the Minister. The petition stated: "That the prime minister should enlist the support of the cabinet, parliament and leaders of various political parties in the country to declare a general amnesty, which would serve as pardon for all sections of the warrings factions of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force." A delegation from the Commonwealth of Nations Secretariat in London is visiting Lesotho on the instruction of Secretary General Chief Emeka Anyaoku to assess events in the Mountain Kingdom. The delegation is led by Maxwell Gaylard of Australia and Moses Anafu of Ghana, both diplomats at the Commonwealth Secretariat.
