The Griffin and Esquire assets include, but are not limited to, registered and unregistered trademarks; formulas and other trade secrets; raw materials, finished goods, packaging materials, and other inventories (excluding inventories of raw materials and packaging materials for any products to be manufactured by Kiwi for Hickory Industries, Inc., after the divestiture); customer lists; and business and financial records, relating to the ``Griffin'' or ``Esquire'' brands. II It is further ordered that Respondents shall divest, absolutely and in good faith, the Griffin and Esquire assets. The Griffin and Esquire assets shall be divested either: (1) within one (1) month of the date this order becomes final, to Hickory Industries, Inc. (``Hickory''), pursuant to the November 30, 1993, Asset Purchase Agreement between Kiwi and Hickory, as amended by Amendment One to November 30, 1993, Asset Purchase Agreement, dated March 8, 1994, attached hereto as a Confidential Appendix; or (2) within twelve (12) months of the date the order becomes final, to an acquirer or acquirers that receive the prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the divestiture is to assure the continuing use of the Griffin and Esquire assets in an ongoing, independent, viable operation engaged in the sale of chemical shoe care products in the United States, and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the Knomark acquisition and the Reckitt and Colman acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint. Provided, however, that if Respondents divest pursuant to Paragraph II (1) of this order, in no event shall Respondents' enforcement of any security interest contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement referred to in Paragraph II (1) of this order be construed to not require the Commission's prior approval, pursuant to Paragraph V of this order, if such approval would otherwise be required. III It is further ordered that: A. If Respondents have not divested, absolutely and in good faith and with the Commission's prior approval, the Griffin and Esquire assets within twelve months of the date this order becomes final, the Commission may appoint a trustee to divest the Griffin and Esquire assets. In the event that the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to section 5( l ) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45( l ), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, Respondents shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it for any failure by Respondents to comply with this order.
