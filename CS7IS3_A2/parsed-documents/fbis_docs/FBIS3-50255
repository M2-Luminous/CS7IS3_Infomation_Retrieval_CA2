[passage omitted] At the end of the meeting, PDSR President Adrian Nastase made a brief statement to the press. He mentioned that discussions regarding the negotiations with the parties that form the majority in parliament were very heated. After four hours, the Central Executive Bureau unanimously approved the formula of a coalition government open to all parties that belong to the current parliamentary majority. Adrian Nastase said that this act should be preceded by the preparation of a draft political pact open to all parties, as well as a political understanding between all five parties -- namely the PDSR, PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party], the PRM [Greater Romania Party], the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor], and the PDAR [Romanian Democratic Agrarian Party]. Likewise, Adrian Nastase mentioned that it is necessary to achieve a consensus on an anticrisis and anti-inflation program. After its drafting, consultations will continue with a view to setting up a parliamentary coalition government by 1 March. Mr. Adrian Nastase also expressed his surprise that these elements discussed with the aforementioned parties on 21 January in the evening were not taken into consideration at the meeting of the PUNR National Council. Mr. Adrian Nastase also stressed that the Central Executive Bureau wants to reaffirm the willingness of the PDSR for a political dialogue with the parliamentary parties in the opposition, noting that this dialogue might take place at the end of the next week. Referring to the memorandum convened between the Romanian Government and the IMF, Mr. Nastase informed the correspondents present that the participants in the meeting of the Central Executive Bureau agreed unanimously that it is necessary for the parliament to adopt a declaration in which it expresses support for this memorandum as soon as possible.
