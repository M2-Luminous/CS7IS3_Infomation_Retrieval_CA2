Commenting on the U.S. move at a news conference on 15 February, Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, said: "Perhaps the U.S. Government is considering various options. I hope that the U.S. Government will not deal emotionally with the issue. If the reasons for the United States to slap sanctions on Japan are deemed to be unfair, Japan will have to argue fearlessly with the United States at the GATT." In this way, the minister indicated that Japan would take its case to the GATT depending on how the United States handles the issue.
