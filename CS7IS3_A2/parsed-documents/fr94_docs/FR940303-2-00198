FR940303-2-00198 FR940303-2-00097 Overview The NIS Linkage Program is authorized under the Freedom Support Act of 1992. Funding for this program is contingent upon receipt of FY 94 Foreign Operations Appropriation Bill funds. USIA administers annual university affiliations programs under the authority of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, Public Law 87&hyph;256 (Fulbright-Hays Act). The Agency seeks to support at least one linkage each in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, and up to three linkages in Ukraine. Grants will be awarded for a period of two (2) years beginning October 1, 1994. The NIS Linkage Program is separate from USIA's College and University Partnerships Program for the Russian Federation, the University Affiliations Program and the University Development Program in Business Management, announced annually in this publication. However, the Agency strives to achieve institutional and geographic diversity across all four linkage programs. Institutions planning to submit proposals for more than one competition should note that USIA will not fund the same project activities more than once. The NIS Linkage Program is limited to the following specific academic disciplines: (1) Law; (2) business/economics; (3) education/continuing education/educational reform; (4) government/public policy/public administration; and (5) communications/journalism. Proposals should focus on curriculum, faculty, and staff development in one of these eligible disciplines. Administrative reform at the foreign partner institution should also be a program component. Proposals must involve the development of new academic programs or the building and/or restructuring of an existing program. Feasibility studies to plan linkages will not be considered. Participating institutions must exchange faculty and/or staff members for teaching/lecturing and consulting for periods of not less than one month. Each year at least one U.S. participant should be in residence at the foreign partner institution for one semester to serve in a coordinating role. E-mail communication should be established as part of the exchange. Other activities which serve the purpose of this program include: Team teaching; visits by faculty to update academic and professional skills, observe teaching techniques and strengthen subject area expertise; expansion of library holdings; textbook development; development of audio-visual instructional materials; distance learning; the translation or reprinting of U.S. texts and other materials; and community outreach in conjunction with curriculum development. Institutional partners may include current MA, MS or PhD students in the exchange. USIA will strive to achieve broad institutional and geographic diversity in awarding the grants. Participating institutions in the U.S. and relevant countries must maintain their faculty and staff on salary and benefits (with the sole exception of personnel assigned overseas for three or more consecutive months; see ``Allowable Costs''). U.S. institutions are responsible for the submission of proposals and must collaborate with their foreign partners in planning and preparing proposals. U.S. and foreign partner institutions are encouraged to consult about the proposed project with U.S. Information Service (USIS) offices in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine. Preference will be given to proposals which demonstrate evidence of previous relations with the proposed foreign partner institution(s). Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 20 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this administrative burden, to USIA Clearance Officer, M/ADD, room 624, U.S. Information Agency, 301 4th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20547; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Washington, DC 20503. (Information collection involved in this program has been cleared by OMB Approval Number 3116&hyph;0179, expiration date 12/31/95.) Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life.
