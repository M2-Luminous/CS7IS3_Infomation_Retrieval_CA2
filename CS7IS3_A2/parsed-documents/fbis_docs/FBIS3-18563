The group of ten Czech deputies, all members of the parliamentary Foreign Committee, included Committee Chairman Jiri Payne. Their visit took place at the invitation of the German parliamentary Foreign Committee. Germany urgently needs good relations with its neighbours, Sussmuth said, adding that the German Parliament intends to ratify the Czech association agreement with the European Union before its summer recess. Ratification of association agreements by large countries is a sign for the smaller countries to follow suit, Payne said, adding that Sussmuth was also taking steps to help ensure the inclusion in the European Parliament of deputies from the post-communist countries. The Czechs met their German counterparts, other German parliamentary representatives and high officials from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Economics. Towards the end of their visit they went to Dusseldorf, where they met representatives of the Land of Nordrhein-Westfallen. German politicians repeatedly stressed the need for the Czech integration into the European structures, Payne and his German counterpart Hans Stercken said, adding that both countries have a common interest in the Central European political and economic stability. Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group of deputies, said that the discussion of the Czech-German historical relations should continue. The Czech deputies quoted him as saying that the Sudeten German question had a German dimension. He reportedly also showed interest in Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus's idea of looking for individual rather than collective solutions. Schauble also said primarily present and future relations should be stressed. Both sides said that German compensation of Czech victims of Nazism had not been discussed, but that the Czech deputies had made it clear that progress on the matter rested with the Germans.
