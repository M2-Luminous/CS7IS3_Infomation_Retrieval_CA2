With what means will you struggle against it? [Georgiev] I will answer you with an example. The Bulgarians in Aegean Thrace are called Slavonic Hellenics?! One of the ways we maintain contact with them is through the historical literature we bring there. This literature indicates their roots to them. We will attract this population by improving their economic prosperity and then they will strive to come closer to us. If we succeed to bring down the border barriers and create appropriate social conditions we will perhaps be able to bring them back to the bosom of the Bulgarian nation. In Germany for example, the authorities pay for the social security of their immigrants. [Andonova] In anything related to foreign policy you use the principle "good is what is good for Bulgaria." Do you often read Machiavelli? [Georgiev] Yes, I have read "The Prince," but this is not what we mean. If we, nationalists, do not unite Bulgaria we will perish. We are not like the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the Union of Democratic Forces, which could transport their interests outside the borders of our country. We need an economic and spiritual upsurge. It is well-known that no one likes the weak ones. [Andonova] With what foreign parties do you maintain contacts? [Georgiev] Jean-Marie Le Pen invited me to visit France. Their delegation will visit us in September. We are in contact with Haider's party in Austria, Paradzik's Human Rights Party in Croatia, and the Italian Alliance -- all of them nationalistic parties. We also have close relations with Zhirinovskiy's party -- we have an agreement to help each other at difficult moments, and in addition, our programs are similar. [passage omitted] [Andonova] Do you intend to amend your style of behavior? Do you not insert hysteria in our society, which even without this has grave problems? [Georgiev] The times are changing and so are the categories. No one has the moral right to blame a dying person who is trying to save himself. In some regions, for example in the Rhodopes and the Ludogorie, the people think that I am too meek and should be firmer. Against the background of this economic destruction the Bulgarians in some regions, Yakoruda for example, directly face a genocide. In those regions the people prefer only the Bulgarian National Radical Party. What about the burning of the Bulgarian national flag? The Bulgarian authorities keep silent about this sacrilege and do nothing. This fact speaks of the lack of a Bulgarian sovereignty. We do not have organs which could protect the property and dignity of the Bulgarians. [passage omitted] [Andonova] What do you think the current Bulgarian borders should be? [Georgiev] From the ethnic and historical points of view we are entitled to an additional 127,000 square km -- up to the Albanian mountains. More than half of Bulgaria is outside our borders. [Andonova] When do you think you will come to power? [Georgiev] We will form our government in the 38th National Assembly. The people want to get rid of everything that makes them feel inferior and unneeded. Nationalism is one of the alternatives. We have a very simple formula -- a rich nation in a rich state.
