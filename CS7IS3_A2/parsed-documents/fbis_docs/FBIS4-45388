[passage omitted] This, the latest "designer drug" to find its way on to the streets, last surfaced several years ago when a man was arrested in Johannesburg for being in possession of a small amount of the powder. SANAB's [South African Narcotics Bureau] Cape Town branch commander Captain Hennie Marais says use of the drug in this country could become a massive problem. "In Europe and America, usage has reached epidemic proportions." He says addicts are inclined to test anything new on the market. "If he can afford it, he will test it." Captain Eddie Lightfoot, who heads Johannesburg's Drug Unit, says international drug syndicates are always looking for new destinations. "Now that South Africa has opened up, I think people are looking at using the country as a drug base and a possible conduit to other countries." [passage omitted] The drug, which can either be injected when mixed with water that is then heated up, smoked or taken orally, is also known as "glass crystal", "candy" or "poor man's cocaine"--although it is not a cocaine derivative. Sold in five sachets each containing 0.2 g, ice's street value is between R[Rand]30 and R35 per sachet, or about R150 a gram.
