As an activist, I therefore suggest: 1. The first major point that we all ought to agree on and the first major political accord that all groups ought to adopt is: the decisions of the Congress must be honored by all. Whether we like them or not. We know that the current makeup of the Congress does completely satisfy anyone. Yet, this is our Congress, and no one ought to leave the party because the results do not satisfy them. We should all stay in the Front so that we can continue to push the positions we hold inside it. 2. Without unity the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] has no chance of success in the 1996 elections. True, the revolutionary struggle does not end with the next elections. However, winning them, on our own or in an alliance, is decisive, vital, and strategic. Without FSLN unity, any chance of having a policy for victory becomes illusory and nonexistent. United Amid Diversity 3. At this Congress we must reaffirm the pluralistic nature of Sandinism. United amid diversity must be our conviction. Accepting internal pluralism means that it is not enough to continue being revolutionaries; we will also have to become more democratic. The culture of political tolerance must be developed first in the party and then made compatible with the entire society. Each force has a legitimate right to seek predominance in the party, but this should not give rise to moves to exclude anyone. Those who wish to leave of their own free will should do so. But exclusion, ostracism, and expulsion cannot be political methods of settling differences. 4. We must all pledge to respect our code of political ethics for debate. A steadfast defense of positions cannot turn into a pretext for political attacks on individuals, factions, or forums. Frank debates yes, personal attacks no. We must give society an example of what we mean by discussion and ideological political debate. 5. The FSLN needs a new identity. There have been many changes in Nicaragua and the world. The FSLN has to define its new revolutionary look in this new stage. The definition of this new content cannot be targeted solely at internal party life. In defining our new identity, we will also be defining ourselves vis-a-vis society. The new face of Sandinism has to be the appealing face of the nation's leading political force, which can offer and insure peace, stability, the rule of law, social justice, and economic well-being. Ruling Out the Armed Struggle 6. The FSLN does not give priority, a priori, to any one method of struggle over another. Its policy in this regard ought to be: the efficient combined use of all methods of struggle, excluding only the armed struggle. The priority of one method over another will be determined by the circumstances and peculiarities of the struggle in question. The important thing is to acknowledge the principle of efficiently combining all methods. 7. The FSLN has a preferential social option for the poor, who represent the majority in our nation. An approach that excludes the other social sectors and classes does not follow from this substantive principle, however. A priority means a priority, not exclusivity. The FSLN attaches great importance to all production sectors that are willing to work and invest to rebuild and revive the national economy. 8. We acknowledge the existence of the struggle among interests and classes in society, but we do not conclude, a priori, from this that the national bourgeoisie will be our mortal enemy. Those who are prepared to work for the rule of law with political and economic democracy and social justice will find in Sandinism a serious, responsible interlocutor and a strong ally in opposing the capricious economic policies of the current government, which are crushing producers, merchants, and production in general. [25 March] 9. The governments of the United States have sponsored interventions against and authoritarian, aggressive regimes in our country. We cannot forget this. Nevertheless, the United States is the most profitable market for the products that a developing Nicaraguan economy would put out. The American people are not and never have been our enemy. We are willing to work consistently to hammer out lasting agreements with the U.S. Government for a new type of relationship based on international law and respect for the sovereignty of the Nicaraguan nation. 10. No sector of Sandinism is calling for the nationalization of the economy or the doctrine of the single party or communism as Sandinism's ideology. What Sandinism opposes uncompromisingly is neoliberalism, as we try to push an alternative economic agenda based on actual conditions in Nicaragua. Accordingly, we Sandinists propose the agenda of the new economic players as a challenge to society. Just as we respect private property, we demand the progressive right to promote and encourage the democratization of ownership. We promote and encourage all forms of associative, communal, and cooperative ownership, the APT [Workers Ownership Sector], and joint ventures as new elements in an economic democratization that offers an alternative to the voracity of brutal capitalism. 11. We Sandinists acknowledge the existence and legitimacy of individual leaders in our party at all levels. Above and beyond personal merits, these leaderships, which have different degrees and looks, are the fruit of the collective revolutionary struggle of the FSLN. In this regard, our main leader is the people and our party. Turnover of Leadership We advocate the efficient turnover of leaders at all levels and the right to recall leaders in accordance with the FSLN's bylaws. However, a true turnover that goes beyond the necessary replacement of individuals means an updating of our program and forms of organization, innovative work methods, and above all, creative methods of struggle. 12. The involvement of women in the struggle of the FSLN has been unquestionable, but their presence in leadership bodies has been stemmed. This situation must be resolved positively at the Congress; in so doing, we will not only be serving justice but also strengthening the Sandinist Front. In regard to this latter point, young people are legitimately demanding their priority place in the Sandinist agenda. 13. We Sandinists cannot remain indifferent to the obvious signs of the renewed outbreak of Somozism. We cannot tolerate any attempt to return to a revanchist, authoritarian, neo-Somozist government. This would represent a return to political instability, and we must call for the broadest alliance to confront this number one enemy of the nation's peace and stability. 14. The Sandinists Front's most important material asset is the property in the hands of individual peasants, cooperative members, retirees, and worker enterprises. The defense of this asset is our main task. Nevertheless, this Congress will have to clarify the status of the party's assets proper once and for all. 15. The FSLN must come out decisively and definitively for the autonomy of the Atlantic Coast and the regulation thereof. The wealth and resources of the coast must benefit those communities first and foremost and must support a regional government that acts to serve this purpose. 16. All of the above will not guarantee renewal unless the FSLN truly begins to play its role as the main opposition party. Consequently, anything that smacks of joint government must disappear quickly and definitively from our political conduct.
