He said that the acceptance of new Eastern and Central European countries as NATO members would create new political barriers and would put Russia in the position of having to counteract the process, which would result in its isolation. According to Kozyrev, Pan-European partnership should be based on cooperation within the CSCE, which has been taking place until now, and the CSCE should be transformed into an effective organization. The Russian foreign minister said that European military and political cooperation should be concentrated in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which should coordinate efforts by NATO, the European Union, the Council of Europe, the Western European Union, and the CIS. Kozyrev emphasized the need to consolidate cooperation within the North Atlantic Council and pointed out the need to implement the Partnership for Peace program based on the principle of equality. According to the Russian minister, a network of bilateral agreements between states that are not NATO members should also be established as part of the Partnership program. In Kozyrev's opinion, this could initiate closer relations between the CIS and NATO. The Russian foreign minister stressed that the Pan-European partnership plan would also incorporate security guarantees to be given to Eastern and Central European states by Russia and its Western European partners. He added that the acceptance of new Eastern and Central European states as NATO members could create new political barriers, which would put Russia in the position of having to counteract them and which would result in Russia's isolation. Kozyrev added that closer economic cooperation should be established as part of the partnership program. He also pointed out the need to open Western markets to East European goods.
