It comprises 16 georgian public movements and organizations which were forced to leave the conflict zone at the end of September 1993 and are at present located in tbilisi. The radicalism of this organization's leadership was clearly manifested during today's meeting of the LAO leadership with representatives of the parliamentary majority. On behalf of the alo its chairman Boris Kakubayev has called on Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze and parliament to arrangee a meeting of LAO representatives with Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his forthcoming official visit to Tbilisi on February 3-4. "If we are denied such ameeting, then we will be compelled to start a hunger strike in the near future at different places in Tbilisi, demanding to arrange our meeting with the president of Russia to expound our vision of the Abkhazia problem," Boris Kaubayev said. Georgian parliamentarys vice-speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili noted that President Yeltsin's programme of meetings in Tbilisi is not planned by the Georgian parliament, but by the president of russia himself and his team. Boris Kakubayev's demand has evoked a contradictory reaction of those present who continued debating problems of Abkhazia and after LAO representatives and Boris Kakubayev himself left the conference hall. They explained it by the fact that the majority of deputies, comprising this parliamentary majority, had not come to the meeting. Kakubayev considered it as an indifference and lack of consideration to problems of Abkhazia.
