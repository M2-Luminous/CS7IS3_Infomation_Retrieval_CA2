During the visit, Birkavs met the Finnish premier, president, and parliament speaker. In their bilateral talks they touched on the questions of Finland's participation in the fund for Skrunda and the repatriation of retired Russian military personnel, Latvia's entry into the European Union, and issues of the two countries' economic cooperation. Valdis Birkavs also got acquainted with the work of the Finnish border guards. [Begin Birkavs recording] We did not sign any agreements. Our relations have entered a period of active cooperation, and I would like to emphasize the words said by several Finnish statesmen: There is satisfaction with the current development of bilateral relations, with Latvia's progress toward the European Union, and with Latvia's action in concluding a treaty that has strengthened Latvia's position as an independent country in Europe. I think that after this visit, cooperation will be considerably activated in several directions. [end recording]
