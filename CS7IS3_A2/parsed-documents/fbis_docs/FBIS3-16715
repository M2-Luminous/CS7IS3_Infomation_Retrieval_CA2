Mamedov begins the report from Baku, over video of people entering a metro station, by saying that the capital was particularly busy today because people were preparing for tomorrow's Muslim festival. At 1355 hours local time, as a train drew into the 20 January station, there was a powerful explosion in the front carriage. Following clips of the mangled wreckage, pools of blood, and rescue workers on the station platform, Mamedov interviews Baku City Procurator Adil Agayev, identified by caption, next to the wrecked train. Agayev says a powerful explosive device was planted in the train and adds: "And all these deeds that have taken place recently in the city of Baku demonstrate that a group of saboteurs is permanently operating in Baku. According to preliminary information, according to the testimony of witnesses, it is evident that there was a suspicious individual in the carriage where the explosion occurred today. We have been given a description of him and an identikit picture is being built up of him to establish his identity in the city." In the studio, the announcer adds that according to the latest preliminary figures, 12 people died and 53 were injured in the blast.
