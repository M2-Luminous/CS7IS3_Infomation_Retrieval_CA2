He wears neither the fascist uniform of coarsely woven woolen cloth nor a black shirt, but can it be a mere coincidence that it has fallen to him, Mirko Tremaglia, the former sublieutenant under the Republic of Salo who now chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, to break the news of al-Qadhdhafi's surrender over the Lockerbie affair? Yes, it is true, yesterday, the colonel of the Jamahiriyah, the supreme head of Islamic Libya, informed the veteran of the Empire -- via his ambassador in Rome -- that he will consent to the trial of the two men suspected of planting the bomb on the Pan Am jumbo. The trial will be held at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. But, a native of Bergamo through and through, the indefatigable Tremaglia has also succeeded, in the very same hours, in hammering home to Russian Ambassador Valeriy Kenyaykin the need for Moscow to expedite the return of the remains of our war dead to Italy. In exchange, of course, for substantial aid, the Russian Government is also to withdraw its veto on the former communist countries joining NATO. [Bianchessi] Full steam ahead, then, Mr. Chairman. What else do you have in mind to give Italy back its -- how did He [Mussolini] put it? -- place in the sun? [Tremaglia] I am working on various matters. The unsettled legal dispute with Slovenia and Croatia takes first place. [Bianchessi] Is that what it is, an unsettled legal dispute? [Tremaglia] No doubt about it. The Osimo Treaty is a thing of the past. [Bianchessi] What do you mean, a thing of the past? [Tremaglia] It ceased to exist when the party that signed it, by which I mean Yugoslavia, became extinct. I have never called for territorial reviews. The legal dispute was opened by Italy in September 1992 with bilateral committees, whose findings were negative, however. We are pressing for two things: first, the right of the 350,000 exiles forcibly expelled in 1947 to go back to their homeland and have their property returned to them, though let us also remember the thousands massacred by Tito's forces in the canyons; second, safeguards for the Italian minority in Slovenia and Croatia, including the right to bilingualism. These are rights recognized by the Council of Europe and the Vienna Summit. The problems faced by the Italians have become much more serious since the territory was divided by the border between Slovenia and Croatia, which has done away with one of the basic principles, that of ethnic unity. We call on Slovenia and Croatia to treat the Italians as we treat the German-speaking population of the Alto Adige region. [Bianchessi] Francesco Rocchetta, under secretary for foreign affairs, is about to set off for Sarajevo. What do we intend to do for Bosnia? [Tremaglia] Rocchetta's trip will be a humanitarian mission, as in Rwanda. But it is not enough. All the political solutions have foundered by now. We must make our minds up to go in with air strikes to neutralize the shelling positions on the ground. This is the only way to enable the UN peacekeeping forces to help get the true political solution under way. [Bianchessi] How about a quick look at Africa? [Tremaglia] Yes, there are two things here that need rapid action. One concerns the northern African countries on the Mediterranean seaboard: a European investment program to provide work for 20 million North Africans in their own countries. This will curb the flood of immigration, not for racist motives, but for reasons of solidarity. We shall be talking about this in Cagliari in a month's time. Secondly, Somalia. It must absolutely not be allowed to end like this. Pulling out was a mistake. [Bianchessi] Do you think that we will have to send our soldiers back there? [Tremaglia] The peoples of the Horn of Africa are waiting for us. I have many contacts there who are telling me so all the time. I propose another initiative, even a solely Italian initiative, in Somalia, again under the aegis of the United Nations, and provided, of course, that the Somalis ask us to go. This time, it must really be a peace mission, bringing humanitarian aid, reconstruction, and reconciliation, and not a war operation. I believe that we can and must do it. We have a century of friendship with the peoples there that we must honor. [Bianchessi] And your battle on behalf of expatriate Italians? [Tremaglia] It continues. Indeed, I have called for the European election to be declared null and void because tens of thousands of our fellow countrymen have not received their voting papers.
