Senada Cumurovic has a report. [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] In the beginning of his news conference, Sulejman Ugljanin noted certain inconsistencies in the work of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia which is solving the national problem of Croats and Serbs globally, while only the Bosnian national problem has been reduced to solving the status of the Bosnians within the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina alone. The aim of his visit is to alert the Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament and the international community to this problem. [Ugljanin] You all know that the policy of the Muslim National Council of Sandzak is to solve the Yugoslav crisis by agreement and by peaceful means. The priority of our policy is a sovereign and unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina and a special status for Sandzak. A special status for Sandzak is the only way to prevent the (?cruel) ethnic cleansing of the Sandzak Bosnian people from that area. [Cumurovic] The establishment of a special status for Sandzak implies the demilitarization of Sandzak, the right to display Muslim national symbols, education that honors the identity of the Muslim nation, and forming their own assembly and government. Explaining the difficult situation in Sandzak, Ugljanin pointed out the fact that the entire political leadership of the Muslim nation in Sandzak has been arrested, precisely at the time when the national problem of the Muslim nation is being solved. [Ugljanin] I will briefly tell you that since the beginning of the Serbian and Croatian aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, eight Muslims were killed in 1992, [words indistinct] and 181 Muslims have gone missing. Around 60 houses were destroyed by planted bombs, as well as almost 1,000 business premises, four mosques, and so on. Several thousand houses belonging to Sandzak Muslims (?have been attacked) by Serbs and Montenegrins in cooperation with the Serbian and Montenegrin police. [Cumurovic] This tragic position of the Muslim people in Sandzak has led to the following demand by the Muslim National Council: [Ugljanin] To urgently send CSCE observers, that is, a permanent CSCE mission with greater authority than the previous one had, to send UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], the UN forces for the prevention of conflicts, and to release the arrested political leaders of the Muslim people. We have placed this request with the European Twelve, the Geneva conference, and the United Nations, and I would like to repeat it during this news conference. [Cumurovic] Answering the question of whether an armed attack on Sandzak by Serbs and Montenegrins was possible, Ugljanin said: [Ugljanin] You know that 29,000 members of the Serb-Montenegrin Army are deployed in Sandzak on top of their peace time troops, that Muslim houses are searched every day, mainly at night between midnight and 0600 in the morning. Family members are harassed, our people are arrested. [Passage indistinct] Now, when the Bosnian crisis is over, we are expecting an open Serbian and Montenegrin aggression against [word indistinct]. [Cumurovic] Sulejman Ugljanin also presented the following figures: 69,000 residents of Muslim nationality have left Sandzak in the past three years, and 59 villages bordering with Bosnia-Herzegovina have been ethnically cleansed. All this points to the need to solve the status of Sandzak, but not within the framework of Serbia and Montenegro, but within the framework of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, it was said at the news conference today.
