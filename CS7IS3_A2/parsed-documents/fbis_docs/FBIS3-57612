This was stated in Beijing today by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a news conference for Chinese and foreign journalists. Replying to a question put by the ITAR-TASS correspondent, Kozyrev explained: "We shall not forget that China and Russia are two great regional powers, in several regions simultaneously moreover, be it central, western, or southeast Asia, that our regional cooperation embraces half the world. Moreover both countries are global powers, permanent members of the UN Security Council. In the economy, the minister continued, saying "constructive partnership" presupposes a transition to higher and more stable forms of cooperation. First and foremost this applies to cross border contacts in which, in the opinion of Andrey Kozyrev, "a change over must be made from petty commercial deals to long-term joint projects." Summing up the working part of his visit to the PRC, the Russian minister noted that in conversations with PRC chairman Jiang Zemin, State Council Premier Li Peng, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, a mutual striving to develop cooperation was confirmed, and "the strategic, long-term nature of bilateral mutual relations that is not subject to the vacillations of the state of the market, the foundations of which were laid during the visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin." "We have mapped out a program of mutual visits, the culmination of which should be a trip to Moscow by PRC Chairman Jiang Zemin," the Russian minister pointed out.
