Appointing the new government, Kovac called on the new cabinet members to carry on the processes of transformation which have already yielded positive results. But he supported "a search for matter-of-fact solutions where the steps taken by the previous government were politicized." Kovac explained Vladimir Meciar's dismissal by disagreement with "the autocratic method (of work) of the prime minister and some government members." He rejected their tendency to concentrate power and defended democracy and morality in politics. At the same time he praised Meciar's contribution to the shaping of Slovak statehood. Kovac said he considered the Hungarian parliamentary parties' support for the new government an "expression of loyalty towards the Slovak Republic." One of the major tasks of Moravcik's government is lessening "the incomprehensible and dangerous hostility between various groups of citizens," Kovac said.
