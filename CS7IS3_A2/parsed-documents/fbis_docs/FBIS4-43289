The industrialists argue that the government's mistaken policies on taxes and interest rates have landed them in their current indebtedness, and thus they too will become militant and will not honor their debts. This is bad news for the government, which has been trying to overcome all kinds of problems on many fronts. The coalition government set up between the True Path Party (DYP) and the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) is on the rocks. There are too many fundamental differences between the partners. The coalition parties are facing serious problems inside their own parliamentary groups. Thus the going is very tough for Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin. Besides that, Ciller is confronted by criticism from all sides that she has failed to manage the economy properly. Until recently the problem was whether the government was making mistakes in fiscal and monetary policies. Now the problem has become an economic crisis where the country is plunged into recession and high inflation. This has prompted major industrial groups to say the economic crisis today is unmatched in the 70-year-old history of the Republic. But now the economic crisis taking a turn for the worse as Ciller displays complete incompetence in facing the challenges. Industrial giants have started laying off workers in view of falling demand. There are estimates that in the past two months nearly 350,000 have become redundant. As unemployment grows, consumption falls, and so do prospects of the increased sales necessary to bring us out of the recession. So the prime minister tells the industrialists to start exporting. Yet we see that exporting under current conditions, with high interest rates on bank credits as well as a lack of government incentives for foreign trade, has become mission impossible. Ciller cannot tell the industrialists simply to sell their goods abroad without providing cheap loans for financing inputs and without meaningful incentives. So all avenues are closed to industrialists for the time being, and the incompetence displayed by the government suggests that it lacks the ability to do much. All the government could do was to try to save its own skin by further complicating internal market conditions in borrowing nearly 30 trillion TL [Turkish lira] from the nation through treasury bond sales in the past two weeks, at a net three month interest of 50 percent. That means in three months time the government has to pay back 45 trillion to the public... This has pushed up credit rates and thus halted investments, while increasing the interest rates of existing debts. Furthermore, the government, in trying to close the huge budget gap, has introduced new taxes for corporations, which has further angered companies already pushed for hard cash. Thus the industrialists were forced to confront the government. In June many business concerns who work on bank credits have to pay back the interest payments on their loans. They tentatively decided on Monday not to make any repayments to the banks as an act of defiance. Now the banks will have to confiscate their factories or just throw in the towel and ease the credit conditions. This is a dangerous turn of events. Soon the workers and the industrialists will all be confronting the Ciller administration. Will she survive all this? We will see in the near future...
