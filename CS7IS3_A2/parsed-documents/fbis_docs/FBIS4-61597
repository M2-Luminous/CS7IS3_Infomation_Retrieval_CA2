In his words, while supporting cease-fire in words, the Azerbaijani side opposes introduction of disengagement forces into the conflict zone "which are the real guarantor of cease-fire observance." Ivanyan pointed out that all previous agreements were disrupted due to the fact that there was an opportunity to violate the reached agreements and then to accuse the confronting party of this. Ivanyan also declared that the Azerbaijani party had used the previous truce periods only to win the time, to collect new forces, and to try another offensive on the front. "Now, having experienced a number of serious defeats and great losses in personnel and military equipment, the Azerbaijani command is looking for an opportunity for a respite in order to bring in order their demoralized forces, which are tired of endless attacks."
