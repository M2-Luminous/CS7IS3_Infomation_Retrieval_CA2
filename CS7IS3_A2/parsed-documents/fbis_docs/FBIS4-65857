Speaking after a meeting with NATO defence ministers, he said Russia would sign the programme "without setting forth any conditions." This contradicted a remark Grachev made on his arrival here earlier in the day -- that Russia wanted the partnership accord accompanied by a separate agreement with NATO on bilateral political relations. He told journalists after the meeting that the partnership's framework agreement "does not fully set forth the principles and themes of cooperation (as sought by Russia.)" The framework accord lays out the basis of military cooperation but it does not detail the specific levels of activity which each country of the partnership will contribute to the programme. The Russian general said he would set forth the details of Russia's proposed participation here Wednesday during a meeting between NATO and its Eastern Bloc partners in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. Reacting to persistent reports that Russia might not sign the partnership accord unless it gets a parallel political accord with NATO, Grachev said: "President (Boris) Yeltsin has made it clear that Russia will join the PFP." He gave no date for the signing. But the general added that the Russian military was "ready and willing" to cooperate in the partnership with the military structures of NATO and the former Eastern Bloc members of PFP.
