Nevertheless, the SPD, which a few weeks ago still seemed a sure winner of the Bundestag elections, is not in a good frame of mind. But Rudolf Scharping succeeded in getting a tighter hold of the reins in his passionate and militant speech at the SPD congress, in which he attacked the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], although his speech did not contain anything new. But the next few weeks will show whether his speech will enable him to take the rudder of the unwieldy SPD vessel and bring it back on course. Scharping has obviously drawn conclusions from the internal party criticism of his election campaign style in recent weeks. He wants to proceed to the duel with Kohl with greater militancy. He wants to avoid bad moves and take greater care that his team plays a better game. He made it very clear in his speech that he is prepared to accept a red-green alliance. That is a clear blow to his opponents within the party, especially to the Lower Saxon Minister-President Gerhard Schroeder. Scharping knows he would lose potential voters in the political center if there were a go-ahead to a coalition with the Greens. But what choice does he have? A red-yellow-green coalition is out of the question now that the liberals have placed their support in the CDU/CSU. Therefore the only thing left to him is a grand coalition, which officially he refuses to hear of. But there are many indications that he will accept such a solution if the Bundestag election dictates it, in view of the challenge posed by German unity, the decreasing budget deficit, and the difficult labor market situation. Obviously, another question that concerns him is which of the two people's parties will perform better at the elections. There is no doubt that the CDU/CSU is experiencing an upward turn right now. The chancellor is benefiting from the slow economic recovery, mainly in the east. Kohl's calculations seem to be proving right. However the road to the Bundestag elections is still long. Within the next few months, Scharping must demand more discipline from his comrades in arms; he made an initial call for this discipline in Halle. When he succeeds in guaranteeing order among his own ranks, his chances will increase again. Next Sunday's Landtag elections in Lower Saxony will provide the first indications of whether the population considers the "message" of Halle as an encouragement or as empty talk.
