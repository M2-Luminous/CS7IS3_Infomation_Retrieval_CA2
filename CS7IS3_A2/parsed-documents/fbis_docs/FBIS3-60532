Samoletov and A. Lomakin, identified by caption; figures in brackets denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds] [Text] [201529] [video opens with correspondent against backdrop of building] [Samoletov] A few years ago it was absolutely impossible to enter this enterprise's grounds. This was strictly a defense enterprise and produced nothing less than bacteriological weapons. After the production of bacteriological weapons was banned, a group of scientists from the center joined in the conversion program and began working on a comprehensive method of combating tumors and seeking a method of eliminating AIDS. They based their work on hyperthermia: Heating the tumor or the blood of the patient to a temperature of 42.5 degrees Celsius, at which point the diseased cells die. Similar experiments had been conducted before, but without producing tangible results because in practice raising the temperature too high inevitably results in death. Now the ``Biotherapy'' Scientific Clinical Center in Novosibirsk has conducted lengthy research into and examination of the human body and has learned how to achieve temperatures up to 45 degrees while protecting the healthy cells and the body itself from the effects of the high temperatures by means of new biological substances developed on the basis of a newly-discovered enzyme.
