Professor Murogov was speaking upon return from Tokyo, where he attended an international roundtable conference on the use of plutonium. "Tokyo is clearly orientated towards the solution of energy-supply problems. More, the country announced that it renounced nuclear weapons," the scientist said. Japan's ability to produce nuclear weapons within a brief period of time became a subject of speculations after the SUNDAY TIMES published at the end of January excerpts from a confidential British Government report on the matter. "In the development of its nuclear power engineering Tokyo is oriented to advanced technologies in the field of plutonium and the development of reactors of fast neutrons, although the Japanese do not yet have such reactors," Murogov said. He said Japan is lagging behind Russia in this respect and added that the lag amounted to some 10 years. "Japan buys technologies we developed earlier, which brings us good returns in hard currency". Murogov said no brain drain has been reported from Russia to Japan, although Russian nuclear specialists regularly visit Japan, as they do the United States and Western Europe.
