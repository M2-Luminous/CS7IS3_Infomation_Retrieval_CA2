This was reported by the director of National Iranian Gas Company, Asadollah Salihi Faruz, in an interview with journalists. He said that the increased consumption of natural gas during the planning years [1990-94] clearly shows that gas as a replacement for half-distilled imported products has led to a saving of $16 billion. He added that for the first time during the last few days natural gas production has gone up to 111.2 million cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]] a day, which is the current level of gas consumption in the country. The director of National Iranian Gas Company added that the National Iranian Gas Company general assembly in a meeting, attended by the president and six members of the Cabinet, approved that priority in gas consumption should be given to domestic use--not to export. Concerning gas pipelines, he said that the total length of pipelines built by the end of 1989 was 5,000 km, which will reach 8,100 km by the end of 1994. In other words, there was more than 62-percent growth of gas pipeline construction during the First Five-Year Plan. About extending pipelines to cities in the country, Mr. Salihi Faruz said that building networks and installing service lines reached 15,660 km and 758,000 extension lines by the end of 1989. By the end of the plan, there will be 33,834 km networks and 1,880 extension lines. In this way, the length of laying networks during the five-year plan will be 18,156 km and the number of installed extensions will be 1,122, which means that there has been an average 17-percent growth per year in building networks and 20 percent growth in installing extension lines. Concerning export of gas to other countries, he said that with the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the cut-off of gas to that country, a similar contract was signed with Azerbaijan, on the basis of which 8 m[.sup]3[/] of gas per day was exported to Azerbaijan for a year. Because of Azerbaijan's financial problems, there has not been any export of gas to that country since last winter. Mr. Salihi Faruz said that the joint partnership of the Islamic Republic of Iran and France in the area of underwater and overland production, in constructing pipelines, in planning and building stations to increase pressure in the Sarakhs-Naka gas-line, and in expansing the gas industry are among the accomplishments of the National Iranian Gas Company. He added that National Iranian Gas Company in partnership with Gas-tu France signed a contract with a 50-percent share of $200,000, which is currently in operation. According to Mr. Salihi, for the purpose of exporting gas to Europe, Iran and France together, with a 60-percent joint share, are cooperating with five European countries: Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Austria, and Spain, with a total 40-percent share, each with a share of 8 percent. At the end, he mentioned the problem of cash (the decline of gas prices), delay in opening credits, demands for funds for drilling permit and asphalt, prevention of the company works by municipalities and by some institutions, problems of acquiring land for extending pipelines, and shortage of contractors--he considered these to be among the executive problems of the company. He mentioned that if a portion of the remark under Article 25 of 1994 budget is to be left out, the National Iranian Gas Company will be forced to cease operating.
