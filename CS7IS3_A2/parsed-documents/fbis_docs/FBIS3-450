But he gave no indication of when he had in mind. "Without an all-inclusive election we really do run the risk of our country sliding into the abyss we are so clearly staring in the face," he told about [word indistinct] guests at Port Elizabeth's German Club. "But if the IFP is to take part in the election, then attention will have to be directed at possibly postponing the election to a later date. It is grossly unfair that the IFP be put at an unfair disadvantage in fighting the election when we have devoted our undivided attention to achieving a dispensation which will ensure democracy and prosperity." Citing Angola as an example, he told the guests the election was not a magic wand that would make the country's problems disappear. The Angolan elections were observed by a myriad of monitors but "just look at what's going on there now". "While many observers feel that delaying the election would precipitate increased violence, I do not agree. It is far better to spend a little more time in ensuring that we achieve an all-inclusive constitution that works, than to rush a settlement which will not be worth the paper it is written on." Mr Buthelezi said the interim constitution as it stood now was spawning a liberation election. "The fight is about which party will emerge to write the next constitution. I think the small parties will concentrate on policy issues, but the larger parties are going to be locked into a battle for the commanding position to be the only party which can introduce a new constitutional text to the constitution-making body, the constituent assembly. For the African National Congress [ANC] it will be a last act in a grand revolutionary strategy." Mr Buthelezi said neither the IFP nor the Freedom Alliance would instigate a worsening of the civil war South Africa was facing. Rather, he believed, "there will be terrible fights in elections to gain the position in which your party can dictate the constitutional future". "The parties which made bids for this awesome power, and lost, will not smile and settle down to working under a ruling party...This constitution and the elections under it are going to polarise our county and sow the seeds for future conflict." Mr Buthelezi said the latest so-called confessions by the ANC made no concession on provincial powers and functions. Under the interim constitution, regions had less powers than the kwaZulu government already had. "There is not one area where the regions will alone have the final say over matters affecting only them. The arrogance of the ANC indeed holds no bounds. It seems to escape the ANC that the Freedom Alliance will not participate in the election until all our bottom line demands are met. I am sorry to say that even the fact that we registered last Friday for elections does not necessarily mean we are going to participate if mediation does not take place before that." Mr Buthelezi said a meeting was under way in Cape Town on Monday to decide the kind of international mediation the IFP would settle for, and the party's national chairman would meet the ANC on Tuesday. "With due respect, even bodies like the United Nations are not right to deal with this question."
