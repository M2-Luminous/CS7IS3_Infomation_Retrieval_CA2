An editorial published by the "TRABAJADORES" weekly, which is the CTC mouthpiece, asserted: "We have to end the negative situation of inflated payrolls." Nevertheless, it added that factors other than excess personnel have a greater impact on the inefficiency of firms. The weekly said: "The payroll is certainly an element to be considered in the search for efficiency, but it is not the only one. Currently, it is quite possible that it is not the most important one in many places." In this way, the newspaper referred to the future reorganization of the government system, which will include ministries as well as firms. The reorganization, which was announced at least three months ago and still has to be implemented, would leave thousands of workers without a job. With this editorial, the union seems to be distancing itself from top government officials who have publicly expressed that the problem of excess personnel has to be given foremost attention because it is the key to improving productivity and profitability. According to the CTC, more damaging than excess personnel are "the huge shortages" experienced in several firms. This includes thefts, the squandering of raw materials and fuel, the low quality of various products, and employee absenteeism. The editorial concluded by saying: "We cannot streamline any process without the unions. They are a requirement and a condition for the process to be implemented effectively, especially if it is to be an orderly and well-handled process." Payroll reductions and other pending economic reforms will be debated at some 80,000 assemblies called by the CTC all across the nation starting today. The main issues to be discussed at these assemblies are: the creation of a tax system, the elimination of a number of gratuities and subsidies to unprofitable firms, formulas to reduce the surplus of currency in the people's hands, and ways to get the peso to recover its buying power. However, according to an official poll, what worries CTC members most "is the future of the superfluous workers who could be fired when the payrolls are streamlined." Once the assembly debates end, it is expected that a special National Assembly meeting will be called to start approving measures -- most of which will have a negative impact on the people -- that had been announced since last summer.
