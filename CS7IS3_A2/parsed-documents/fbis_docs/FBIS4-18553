Its financial practices were said to be curious, at the very least. Documents that have come into our possession confirm both of these facts. Tourism in China helps to finance the extreme left in our country. A report by the ABC auditors, in defiance of the majority of the board, thus condemned the 1992 use of the Association's tourism license by the Anti-Imperialist League, an outgrowth of the PTB devoted to the "liberation" of the Third World! The auditors were amazed, moreover, to see "hundreds of thousands of Belgian francs paid to airlines, without any invoices...." Just as confusing for the auditors was "the reason why, without a valid accounting document, an ABC debt of over 1 million Belgian francs was written off overnight by Luxingshe," the official Chinese tourist body. Was this a hidden payment by Beijing to its Belgian lackeys? Or was it fraud destined to refloat a nonprofitmaking association which, while its tours have generated "turnover of over 70 million Belgian francs," has regularly run up debts to the point where it could no longer pay its various rents? This paradox adds further fuel to the theory that funds are being transferred to the PTB.
