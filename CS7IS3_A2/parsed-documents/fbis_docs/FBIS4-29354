"We will submit a no-confidence motion against Hata cabinet," Kono told a faction meeting of LDP legislators at a Tokyo restaurant. "We cannot overlook this cabinet in silence." Kono, however, did not state clearly when the LDP will take the action. As the current Diet session approaches its final day June 29, the LDP is intensifying its pressure on the government, threatening to submit a no-confidence motion at any time. If the LDP secures enough support from the second largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, the passage of the motion is likely, resulting in either the cabinet's resignation en masse or Hata's calling a general election.
