He told a business breakfast that the budget could be released earlier as the parties involved thought August was too close to the planning cycle needed for the following year's budget. The budget therefore could be presented in July or as early as June, following the country's first all-race elections in April. Due to the country's transition, a budget was not presented, traditionally in mid-March, for the new fiscal year which starts at the beginning of April. However, government budgets were extended by parliament earlier this year. Mr Keys also revealed Tuesday the head of the finance, and state expenditure departments in conjunction with the finance sub-council of the Transitional Executive Council would outline next week the broad parameters of the first government's budget.
