A European Commission spokesman said in Brussels that the commission would submit to the EU Council of Ministers a set of proposals aimed at developing relations with the new South African Government. The measures include provisions for granting financial assistance and loans to small and medium-sized companies, as well as to government agencies wanting to invest in South Africa.
