At a news conference following their informal meeting, Waldemar Pawlak and Vaclav Klaus described their talks as very concrete. They concerned, above all, economic cooperation, but not exclusively, because they also talked about European integration and the Polish minority in the Czech Republic. It is not true that Polish-Czech relations are not good, declared Vaclav Klaus, and added that there was no other country whose politicians he was meeting as often. He recalled his talks with Waldemar Pawlak at the Visegrad-U.S. summit, with Aleksandr Kwasniewski in Davos, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy's visit to Prague, and announced a meeting with President Lech Walesa next week. Prime Ministers Pawlak and Klaus agreed, among other things, that the Polish debts would also be paid off through ecological investment projects. We would be most willing to provide coal, but the Czechs also have problems in this branch of the industry, and that is why the agreement finally was for ecology and a border infrastructure. For Waldemar Pawlak, the most important matters in relations with the Czechs are agreements concerning the Central European Free Trade zone and border cooperation. Vaclav Klaus appealed to Polish journalists not to put a political slant on the matter of reduced subsidies for Polish organizations active in the Czech Republic. The prime minister explained that his government had given up lump-sum subsidies in favor of supporting specific undertakings. Vaclav Klaus announced a financial shot in the arm for Polish minority organizations in the second half of the year.
