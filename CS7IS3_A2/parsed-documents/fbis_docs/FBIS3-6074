Pak Yong-su, head of the North side's delegate, said: "Recently, when I met Koreans residing in the United States who were visiting North Korea, they said that prospects for the realization of the exchange of special envoys of the South and North was not that bright. They also said, however, that we should not be so pessimistic about this matter." Pak Yong-su continued: "Since I am determined to open a breakthrough in today's contact, I came here with the determination to reach an agreement." In this connection, Song Yong-tae, the South side's senior delegate, said: "In a news conference after the fifth South-North contact on 9 March, I said that the sixth round of contacts will mark a turning point in the success or failure of the contact." He also proposed: "Even though today is a Saturday, if we do not reach an agreement in the morning, let us extend the contact into the afternoon so that we can come to a conclusion." The North Korean head delegate Pak Yong-su said: "When viewing the profound secrets of nature this year--the 49th anniversary of the `division'-- we are experiencing a rare phenomena with such a heavy snowfall yesterday. In particular, a double rainbow appeared at the summit of Chongil peak at Mt Paektu in mid-February. Our people view this as a sign of extremely good luck for our nation. We even made a song entitled, `Reunification Rainbow.' This has become one of the most popular songs." In this connection Song Yong-tae responded by saying: "The slogans and songs on reunification are important, but what is more important is for us to create practical conditions for reunification." The North Korean reporters who entered the House of Peace at around 0940 for the contact said: "It seems that today, some kind of important result will be achieved." They expressed deep interest in the purpose and schedule of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci's visit to South Korea. The North Korean reporters asked to the last detail and took notes of the purpose and schedule of Gallucci's visit to South Korea. When they heard that it was decided between the ROK and the United States that the third round of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks will be postponed if the exchange of special envoys does not take place before 21 March, they showed a somewhat sensitive response by saying that it is a violation of the agreement reached between North Korea and the United States. The delegates of the South-North contact waged a light verbal battle on whether to hold the contact openly. The North Korean head delegate Pak Yong-su said: "People of the whole nation as well as reporters here have great expectations in today's contact. How about holding the contact openly? In this connection, the South Korean senior delegate Song Yong-tae insisted on holding the contact behind closed doors by saying: "Is there a special reason for holding the contact openly?" The North Korean head delegate said: "There is no special reason so let us follow your opinion and hold the contact behind closed doors." Thus, the contact started behind closed doors at 1015.
