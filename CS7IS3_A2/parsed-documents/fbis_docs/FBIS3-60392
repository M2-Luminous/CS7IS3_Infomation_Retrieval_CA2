The most comprehensive study of the sea, undertaken by leading scientists from the eight countries surrounding it, has found that concentrations of toxic chemicals are high enough to cause tumours and breeding failures across a wide range of species. Ministers from all the countries concerned meet in Copenhagen this week to consider the conclusions of the Quality Status Report of the North Sea, which took six years to complete and is regarded as a conservative analysis of the impacts of pollution. They are expected to respond with measures to curb illegal dumping of oil from ships, pesticide pollution and over-fishing. Conservationists warned that marine wildlife was facing disaster in "a synthetic soup of chemicals" because governments had failed to meet anti-pollution targets set three years ago. Dr Sian Pullen, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said action so far had failed to reverse decades of deterioration. "The commercial and environmental losses are enormous," he said. The study, to which Britain contributed more than Â£5m, says mammals are particularly at risk from thousands of industrial chemicals that accumulate in body fat after getting into the sea from rivers, waste tips and the air. Some, including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), are thought to suppress immunity to disease and damage ovaries. Poisonous waste metals such as mercury have attacked the kidneys and livers of minke whales, bottle-nosed dolphins and grey and common seals. Tens of thousands of sea birds are also dying each year in oil slicks from rigs and ships' tanks. Dr Nancy Harrison, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: "Accidents make headlines, but chronic oil pollution is the biggest danger to wildlife and the health of the sea." Some of the most startling impacts have been recorded in fish. Contamination by tributyl tin, a highly-toxic component of paints used on ships' hulls, has triggered sex changes in whelks, often miles from shipping routes. Vast numbers of cod have developed tumours on their gills because of general chemical pollution and food and poisoning from shellfish, including mild paralysis, is on the increase: the report blames sewage. Dr John Huthnance, a leading British oceanographer, said the North Sea was especially vulnerable to pollution because it was largely landlocked. Chemicals that might disappear in six weeks in other seas could linger there for two years. The study warns that fertilisers seeping into the sea from rivers and underground channels have contributed to high levels of phosphorous and nitrogen, which have fed blooms of toxic algae. The Thames Humber, Tees and Tyne are all identified as important sources of industrial pollution. Metals swept downriver sink into sediments where they are absorbed by tiny organisms and gradually work their way up the food chain. Britain's pollution record has been fiercely criticised by other North Sea countries, particularly in Scandinavia, who pride themselves on their environmental performance. They are expected to complain this week that Britain has fallen behind targets set for curbing several pesticides. The use of dichlorvos -- one of the most toxic chemicals -- to deal with lice on fish farms was due to be cut by half between 1985 and 1995, but has so far increased. In Copenhagen, however, Britain is expected to accuse Denmark of taking grossly excessive catches of fish. The report says that up to 40% of all commercial species by weight are hauled out of the sea each year. More than half the adult cod and haddock in the North Sea were netted between 1986 and 1990, a rate described as impossible to sustain. Tim Yeo, the environment minister, said he regarded excessive spraying of pesticides on roadsides and railway embankments as one of the priorities for the conference. "We are committed to reducing their use to the absolute minimum," he said.
