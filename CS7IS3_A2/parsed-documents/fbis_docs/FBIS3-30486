The Ministry's statement says that the explanation that "a protest rally against the sanctions affecting the Serb community could threaten public order due to the risk of counterdemonstrations by associations hostile to the Serbs or by those associations whose aims contradict those of the rally organizers" is particularly surprising. The explanation and other circumstances indicate that the competent prefecture could not have made the decision without the consent of the French Government. Such measures by the French authorities point to the existence of double standards which some countries, and -- unfortunately -- France among them, apply to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. The decision to prohibit the Serbs from expressing legitimate protest and dissatisfaction against the unfounded and genocidal sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serb people gives even more reason for concern, bearing in mind that such measures have never been taken against anti-Serb demonstrations in France. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Yugoslav citizens who live and work in France, and the entire Yugoslav public, rightly expect that the relevant authorities in France will reexamine their decision and enable Yugoslav citizens and their French friends to express their viewpoint on the sanctions in a peaceful and dignified manner. Following the surprising decision by the French authorities the Federal Foreign Ministry has ordered the charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Embassy in Paris to lodge a protest note with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the statement says.
