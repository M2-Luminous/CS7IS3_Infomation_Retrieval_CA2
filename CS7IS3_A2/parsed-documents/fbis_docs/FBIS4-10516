Robaina, who arrived in Peru on 10 April on a two-day official visit, today held a working meeting with 200 private businessmen to inform them about the incentives that the Cuban Government is granting to foreign capital. Robaina said that the Cuban opening is "generally considered a priority, but within this perspective we want to prioritize Latin American investments." Explaining the Cuban juridical framework that regulates foreign investments, Robaina said that "it is sufficiently clear and flexible so as not to cause any mistrust." He added: "This can be certified by investors from Spain, Canada, Italy, France, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia, countries that have already invested in Cuba and with which we maintain good relations." Robaina also said that Cuba "is not asking anyone to adopt its political ideology as a precondition for the establishment of economic ties, because these foreign investments are in line with Cuban national interests." Commenting on current Cuban economic problems, Foreign Minister Robaina said "they are the result of many factors, but the greatest obstacle is undoubtedly the U.S. commercial blockade." Robaina today held a meeting with Peruvian Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg, with Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama, while tonight he is scheduled to hold a news conference. On Tuesday, the last day of his visit, Robaina will carry out private activities. He is scheduled to resume his South American tour, which started last week in Montevideo and also includes Argentina and Paraguay, on 13 April.
