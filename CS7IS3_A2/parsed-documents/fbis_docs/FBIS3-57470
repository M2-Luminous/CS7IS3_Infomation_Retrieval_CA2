The newspaper points out that during the January 24 meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin "according to some data, agreed to the appointment of Boris Fedorov as the minister of finance directly accountable to the premier". IZVESTIYA believes that the country's grim economic prospect could be the main reason for such a decision. "According to V. Krivov, chief of the group of experts to the Russian president, a rapid increase in oil production costs, as a result of which the export of oil, just as that of coal and timber, would become unprofitable, is reckoned to be the main factor which may lead to a further sharp drop in industrial output, decline in the living standards of people and depletion of the import of food. Chernomyrdin could not fail to know about such a prospect". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Ella Pamfilova, minister of the social protection of the population, who tendered her resignation. Pamfilova said in particular that she visualised the possibility of her resignation long before she took a final decision which was made public on January 16. Pamfilova said the loss of hope that the prime minister and the president would heed Yegor Gaydar's proposals about 'the need to pursue a coordinated policy between the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry, grant an appropriate status to the latter, and to shape a social policy dovetailed with decisions that are made at the macroeconomic level" became the reasons for her final decision to resign. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on ella Pamfilova's resignation. The newspaper criticises her activities as the minsiter of social protection. "Pamfilova is known to have gone on leave with a subsequent resignation from the ministerial post. This closely resembles taking to flight. But who will pay the debts to the older people?" the newspaper asks. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on Yegor Gaydar's resignation. The newspaper emphasises that the matter was decided upon by the president, not the prime minister. "The president could not ignore the sentiments of a vast majority of people in Russia who are disgruntled over the results of reforms and who associate the sharp decline in the living standards with Gaydar's name". "Notwithstanding all his sympathy for Gaydar, Yeltsin had to agree to his resignation." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on housing for servicemen. "The Housing Problem in the Armed Forces is a Political One" is the headline under which the newspaper carries an article about the servicemen's welfare problems. "It is at unreasonable, to say the least, to allow the army or, at any rate, a large proportion of army personnel, to proceed along the road leading from hopes to despair". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with former deputy speaker Yuriy Voronin. The newspaper reports that voronin intends to stage a comeback in politics. In the interview, Voronin again recounted the October 3-4 events in Moscow and the role played by politicians who retain their positions in high places now as well. Voronin is of the opinion that "as a result of the September-October crisis, it was democracy, not the legislative branch of power, that turned out to be the loser in Russia". IZVESTIYA and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA run carry a photograph of former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy in the Lefortovo prison. The picture was taken by a REUTER photographer on January 23. "How and why was a foreign reporter allowed to go and see in prison the person whom Russian ones are not allowed even to approach?" IZVESTIYA queries.
