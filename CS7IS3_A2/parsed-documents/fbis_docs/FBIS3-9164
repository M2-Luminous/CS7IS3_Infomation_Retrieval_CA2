The aim of the meeting was to clarify the latest controversy surrounding UNPROFOR accusations that a small amount of Serb heavy weapons was found inside the 20-km exclusion zone around Sarajevo in the locality of Cekrcici, north of Sarajevo and in the vicinity of Visoko. "Today we came to the conclusion that we had used different maps to identify the central point inside the Sarajevo exclusion zone. This led to misunderstanding between UNPROFOR and the Serb side," General van Baal said after the talks. He went on to add that an agreement was reached today to "start work on defining the positions tomorrow," in order to identify the central point in the controversial zone. Meanwhile Karadzic will talk by phone with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's envoy. We were in complete agreement regarding the situation in connection with the weapons inside and outside this zone and I think that today we achieved great success in the resolution of this problem, General van Baal said, expressing his gratitude to the Serb side and President Karadzic himself for their extremely good cooperation and understanding. Sarajevo-Romanija Corps Commander Major General Stanislav Galic said the meeting today was very successful. He stated that the misunderstanding arose due to different interpretations about where the center of Sarajevo is. "These misunderstandings have now been resolved, which is yet another illustration of the effective cooperation between UNPROFOR and the civilian and military authorities of the Srpska republic," General Galic said. UNPROFOR and Srpska republic representatives also met today at the Bratstvo-Jedinstvo bridge which is to be reopened to traffic on 23 March. UNPROFOR representatives for the Sarajevo sector and the Serb authorities in Sarajevo have agreed on details and technical particulars regarding the flow of traffic across this very sensitive location. UNPROFOR has been carrying out intensive preparatory work, the necessary marking and the protection of the bridge, and it is indicative that on the Serb side of the bridge, Russian UN troops were replaced by French UNPROFOR soldiers this morning.
