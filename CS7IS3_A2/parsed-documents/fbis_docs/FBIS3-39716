"Greece's decisions clearly violate the trade laws" of the European Community, he said, adding that the EC Commission is waiting for Greece to justify its action as called for by the law. According to EC law, any country that imposes such sanctions must prove that it was forced to undertake such a move because its security was threatened. In the northwestern Greek town of Ioannina on Monday, Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias issued a message to his EC partners saying that "it is not Greece that has hurt the EC's solidarity but rather those who have supported (FYROM's) intransigence." Greece, which holds the rotating presidency of the EC, said it had been forced to impose the punitive blockade last week after the United States "erroneously" recognised FYROM before the latter had responded positively to Greece's demands for Skopje to work towards stability in the region. Most of Athens' EC partners have also recognized FYROM. Greece accuses FYROM of usurping a name which Athens says is solely part of Greek heritage and of harbouring expansionist ambitions over the Greek province of the same name. "We are not asking anything from anyone, the only thing we want is respect for our borders, respect for the rights of the Greek minority (in FYROM) and respect for our history," Papoulias said. Along the Greek-FYROM border Monday, convoys of trucks could be seen waiting for Greek border guards to check their merchandise before being allowed to proceed. The Greek blockade covers oil and other essential supplies.
