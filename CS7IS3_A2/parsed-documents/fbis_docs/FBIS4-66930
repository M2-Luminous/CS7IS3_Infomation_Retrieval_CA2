The Federal Council made this proposal to the Assembly in a message that was adopted on Wednesday [13 April]. The convention is the first disarmament treaty for an entire category of mass-destruction weapons. Switzerland has no chemical weapons. In January 1993, Switzerland signed the convention that bans the design, manufacture, storage, and use of chemical weapons. The participating states also pledged never to help anyone undertake activities breaking this convention. Besides, all existing stocks of chemical weapons must be destroyed, as well as the plants innvolved in the making of such weapons and the weapons left by a state on foreign territory. An exhaustive monitoring system -- extended to the civilian chemic -- will be set up to ensure that the convention is complied with. An international organization on banning chemical weapons will be established in The Hague to carry out this monitoring function. Over 150 states have signed the convention up till now, including Switzerland in January 1993. No Problem for Switzerland In its message, the Federal Council stressed that Switzerland itself does not have any mass-destruction weapons. It considers that the convention on chemical weapons is, together with the nonproliferation treaty, the most important multilateral treaty in the security field. The elimination of chemical weapons will reduce the risk of a serious military threat. The government further says that the destruction of such weapons will have to respect the environment. The government underlines that the Swiss chemical industry unreservedly adheres to the objectives of the convention. Implementing this convention does not require creating new institutions or laws, but nevertheless implies considerable monitoring activities.
