FR941110-0-00274 FR941110-0-00017 Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to Poa mannii Munro ex Hillebr. (Mann's bluegrass) are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range The area of Kauai in which Poa mannii is found has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present land management practices, including grazing, deliberate alien plant and animal introductions, water diversion, and recreational development (Wagner et al. 1985). Feral animals have had the greatest overall impact, altering and degrading the vegetation and habitats of the area; feral goats currently cause the greatest damage to the area. Feral goats, which have inhabited the drier, more rugged areas of Kauai since the 1820s, consume native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, and promote the invasion of alien plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Feral goats on Kauai are managed as a game species with a limited hunting season (Tomich 1986), but their numbers are large enough to cause considerable habitat damage. Poa mannii survives only in very steep areas that are inaccessible to goats, suggesting that goat predation may have eliminated this species from more accessible locations, as is the case for other rare plants from northwestern Kauai (Corn et al. 1979). Populations of Poa mannii are affected by erosion and landslides, resulting, in part, from goat activities in surrounding areas (K. Wood, pers. comm., 1992). B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes Unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes and excessive visits by individuals interested in seeing rare plants could result from increased publicity. This is a potential threat to Poa mannii that could also promote erosion and greater ingress by competing alien species. C. Disease or Predation Poa mannii is not known to be unpalatable to goats, which inhabit the areas where all four known populations of Poa mannii grow. Predation is a probable reason that this species is currently found only on cliff faces inaccessible to goats (D. Lorence and K. Wood, pers. comms., 1992). Predation by goats constitutes a threat to the expansion of the extant populations of Poa mannii. D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms All four populations of Poa mannii are located on State conservation district land, which, among other purposes, are regarded as necessary for the protection of endemic biological resources and the maintenance or enhancement of the conservation of natural resources. Activities permitted in the conservation district are chosen by considering how best to make multiple use of the land (HRS, sect. 205&hyph;2). Some uses, such as maintaining animals for hunting, are based on policy decisions, while others, such as preservation of endangered species, are mandated by both Federal and State laws. Requests for amendments to district boundaries or variances within existing classifications can be made by government agencies and private landowners (HRS, sect. 205&hyph;4). Before decisions on these requests are made, the impact of the proposed reclassification on ``preservation or maintenance of important natural systems or habitat'' (HRS, sects. 205&hyph;4, 205&hyph;17), as well as the maintenance of natural resources, is required to be taken into account (HRS, sects. 205&hyph;2, 205&hyph;4). For any proposed land use change that would occur on county or State land, that would be funded in part or whole by county or State funds, or that would occur within land classified as conservation district, an environmental assessment is required to determine whether or not the environment will be significantly affected (HRS, chapt. 343). If it is found that an action will have a significant effect, preparation of a full Environmental Impact Statement is required. Hawaii environmental policy and, thus, approval of land use, is required by law to safeguard ``*␣*␣* the State's unique natural environmental characteristics *␣*␣*'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;3(1)) and includes guidelines to ``protect endangered species of individual plants and animals *␣*␣*'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;4(3)(A)). However, the species is not presently protected as an endangered species under the State's endangered species provisions, and, despite provisions for conserving endemic resources, individual rare species may be overlooked during consideration of other land use priorities.
