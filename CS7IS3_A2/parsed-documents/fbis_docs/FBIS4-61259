Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, signed the program's outline document at the NATO Brussels headquarters today. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Aliyev stressed that his country adheres to the principles of democracy and free enterprise. Its foreign policy proceeds from the principle of interdependence of the present-day world and is based on the principles of respect for national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and nonviolation of borders. At the same time, Aliyev noted, Azerbaijan is experiencing a grave economic crisis caused by a collapse of ties with the former Soviet republics and the transition to a new economic system. The crisis is being aggravated by the armed conflict with Armenia. Aliyev stated there is no military solution to the conflict and favors stepping up the efforts of international organizations, first of all the UNO and the CSCE Minsk group, aimed to attain a settlement at the negotiation table. The conditions put forward by his country for these talks consist of an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of Armenian troops from Azerbaijan's occupied territories. The talks should ensure Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. It is only after this that Baku is prepared to examine the issue of a status of autonomy for Nagornyy Karabakh. In signing the document on partnership, Azerbaijan, according to Aliyev, visualizes for itself two main goals for the development of cooperation with NATO: the country's integration into Western democracy and its quest for additional ways to stabilize the situation in the Caucasus and to end the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Sergio Balanzino, the NATO deputy secretary general who chaired today's session of the NATO Council, noted that regional conflicts today are a serious threat to stability and security in the zone of Europe and the Atlantic. Within the framework of the Council for North Atlantic Cooperation, which includes both Azerbaijan and Armenia, the countries of the alliance are making efforts to mediate with the purpose of a peaceful settlement to the conflict. He welcomed the measures taken in this direction by the Minsk CSCE group, stressing that only a solution of this kind can bring peace back to the region. Participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program will develop in accordance with the the tempo and content Azerbaijan itself determines, Balanzino noted, expressing the hope that this cooperation would contribute to stability and security in Transcaucasia and throughout the Euro-Atlantic zone. Also today Geydar Aliyev met the Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. He invited the head of the Belgian Government to visit Azerbaijan and expressed confidence that a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries would be signed during his visit to Baku.
