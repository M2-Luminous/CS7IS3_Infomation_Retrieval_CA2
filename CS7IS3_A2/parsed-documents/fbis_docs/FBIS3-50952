Therefore, it is willing to undertake actions to prevent the dynamics of the serious events that have taken place in Chiapas State from leading to more confrontations. This requires political decisions in favor of the nation, and which are a recognition of what did not work properly. In order to guarantee full adherence to the Constitution and the law in the public decisions demanded under the circumstances, and in order to open efficacious channels for reconciliation and justice in Chiapas State, based on Article 82 of the Constitution, we have agreed to: 1. Appoint Dr. Jorge Carpizo as government secretary. His mission will be to bear the responsibility of that office to guarantee that all the decisions necessary to restore the tranquility in Chiapas State as soon as possible, and maintain it in the rest of the country, will be in strict accordance with the law; and also to guarantee that the 1994 federal elections will be carried out in strict accordance with our Constitution and the new standing legislation. This morning I accepted the resignation of Jose Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco-Garrido. 2. In light of the need to create a framework, an agenda, and procedures for reconciliation of the conflict in Chiapas State, while meeting with Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis, we discussed his feelings about fulfilling this task. He said that as it is such an important cause for the nation, his work would require very broad flexibility for action in society and permanent access to the highest level in the government. As it is in fact a totally new topic, he will be the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. He will have the support of, and permanent access to the president of the Republic. On his part, he will seek to open spaces for society to contribute to the reconciliation in Chiapas State, aside from the general context. [sentence as heard] Mr. Manuel Camacho, asked me to allow him to carry out that duty without a salary and without creating any new government organization. 3. Mr. Manuel Tello Macias, will be the foreign relations secretary. Ambassador Tello Macias, a career diplomat, will guide the foreign policy with firmness and prudence, based on historic principles that shall always care for the national sovereignty. 4. Mr. Diego Valadez will be the attorney general of the Republic. Mr. Valadez, a well-known attorney, was until today the attorney general of the Federal District. He has broad experience in government duties and administration of justice. His instructions are to fulfill and enforce the Constitution and the laws, while maintaining the guidelines of conduct and work that have been characteristic of this institution. Mr. Rene Gonzalez de la Vega, will be the acting attorney general of the Federal District. I have sworn in all these public servants and they will immediately assume their new duties. With these guidelines and political decisions, the government of the Republic will strengthen the law and respect for human rights, and open channels for conciliation without ceasing, at any moment, to guarantee safety in Chiapas State. The Mexican Army, with loyalty and patriotism spawned from its historic roots and its popular origin, in fulfilling its constitutional responsibility and in accordance with the policy of the government of the Republic, will continue to guarantee the safety of the citizens in Chiapas; and, together with the proper authorities, will contribute to keeping individuals or groups from seeking to disrupt, through violence, the tranquility of the families and the harmony of the country. Thank you very much.
