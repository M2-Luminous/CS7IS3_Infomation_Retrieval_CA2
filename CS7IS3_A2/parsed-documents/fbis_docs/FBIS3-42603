The article notes that the PKK, in collaboration with ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] will launch an attack on Turkey next spring. The article also says that Armenian villages near the Turkish border offer support of all types to the PKK. Goksel Polad writes [in CUMHURIYET] that the Turkish security circles assume that PKK guerrillas trained in camps in Armenia will launch attacks against Turkey from the Armenian border in the spring of 1994, together with ASALA militants. The report by the Security Directorate General notes that the PKK has established camps in Armenian villages near the Turkish border inhabited by Armenians of Kurdish ancestry hostile to Turkey. PKK militants train in camps in the Bekaa in Lebanon and Zeli in northern Iraq, together with ASALA militants. The said report provides the following information about Armenian-PKK relations: ASALA militants are trained in PKK camps in Jordan and Syria. Trained ASALA militants recruit new guerrillas and procure armaments [for the PKK]. This assistance continues today. [PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan [Apo], who receives aid from Armenia and ASALA, conducts ties with Armenia personally. He has established training camps in Armenian villages near the Turkish border, and training is under way in those camps today. These activities are carried out with the knowledge and complicity of the Armenian government. The camps are in villages inhabited by Armenians of Kurdish ancestry hostile to Turkey. The PKK and ASALA militants trained in these camps will attack Turkey from Armenia's borders in the near future, probably in the spring of 1994. The report also enumerates the names of the villages that support the PKK. Those are: Mirek, Reya, Taze, Elegez (Alagiaz), Shengani, Derik, Afshin, Suphan, Chumushvan, Senger, Amritaze in the Aragadz region; Barazh, Hako, Delto, Sorik, Kabaktepe, Tellik, Sichanli, Baysich in the Talin region; Ferik in the Echmiadzin region; and Shamran in the Ashtarak region (these names are given as published in CUMHURIYET).
