"What is the motive of the Saudis in taking the lead and offering compensation on behalf of Israel?" JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, close to the Islamic hardliners, asked. "Has Riyadh volunteered in such a disgusting act under pressure from Israel and the United States, or because it feels responsibility for the tragedy?" The paper warned that the offer could "risk tempting the Zionists to repeat such crime" and portray an image of Saudi Arabia as a defender of Israel. A Saudi spokesman said Monday that the king had decided to make the gesture "to ease the suffering of relatives of those martyred in the vile massacre ... [ellipsis as received] and those shot dead afterwards by the Israeli army." The money would be paid to relatives of those who died in the mosque massacre and demonstrators who were shot and killed later the same day. The king also offered to fly the seriously wounded Palestinians to Saudi hospitals. Iran has strongly condemned the slaughter and several demonstrations have been held in protest at the incident in Iranian cities. The Israeli army says 30 Palestinians died in the mosque, and Palestinian doctors said the toll was 52.
