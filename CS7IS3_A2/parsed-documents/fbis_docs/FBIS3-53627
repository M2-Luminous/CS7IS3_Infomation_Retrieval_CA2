The casualties suffered by terrorist elements as a result of IRGC vigilance has increased ten times, and included top ringleaders, he said. Zolqadr was outlining the corps' activities on the eve of IRGC Day marking the birth anniversary of Imam Hoseyn (peace be upon him) whose selfless struggle has continued to inspire revolutionaries in every age and era. The prophet's (pbuh) younger grandson who tasted the cup of martyrdom in Karbala in 61 A.H.

Zolqadr said that in the fight against drug trafficking, IRGC personnel have destroyed 50 convoys of international traffickers and seized 14.5 tons of illicit drugs this year. He added that the IRGC killed in shoot-outs or arrested 940 smugglers in the eastern part of the country in the said period.
