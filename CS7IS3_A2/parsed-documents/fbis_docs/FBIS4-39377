In addition to talks with Raul Malk, the Estonian Foreign Ministry's deputy chancellor, Churkin had a meeting yesterday [7 June] with President Lennart Meri and Foreign Minister Juri Luik. Churkin opined that both parties genuinely wish to resolve all the problems as quickly as possible in order to close a chapter in Estonian-Russian relations and open a new one. Taking into account the agreements reached in the course of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Tallinn at the end of May, Churkin thought that talks are nearing the finishing line. The next meeting between Churkin and Malk will evidently take place next week in Moscow.
