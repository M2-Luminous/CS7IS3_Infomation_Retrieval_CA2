As SNARK was told today in the Armenian Defense Ministry, Azerbaijan side has acknowledged that tension at the border is sometimes caused by Nakhichevan combat units which thus try to justify their unwillingness to fight in Karabakh. Nakhichevan representatives also consider possible the provocations by Peoples Front of Azerbaijan attempting to destabilize the situation in Nakhichevan Republic. Negotiating parties agreed to undertake adequate measures to prevent the possible border incidents. There were no serious incidents along the entire Armenian border during the last day, informed the Defense Department.
