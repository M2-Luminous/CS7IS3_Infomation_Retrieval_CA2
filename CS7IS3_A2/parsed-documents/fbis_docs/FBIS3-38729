The foreign minister was inquiring about the chances of completing the entry talks by the end of February. The planned conclusion of the negotiations with the four membership candidates will be the subject of a meeting between the 12 EU and the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] foreign ministers, who will meet in Brussels on Monday. In view of the increasingly overt Croatian attacks against Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, they will also discuss imposing sanctions against Zagreb, comparable with those against Serbia.
