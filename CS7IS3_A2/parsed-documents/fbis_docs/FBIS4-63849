Although the leadership's active desire to hush up this affair and to avoid great publicity can be observed, there is no getting away from this extraordinary occurrence, and it is necessary to speak of it. Russian diplomacy, writhing in convulsions brought on by the capricious situation at home and by unprofessionalism, has valiantly disgraced itself once again, having made even doubters come to believe that the problem of saving the face, prestige, and reputation of a civilized, stable partner in contacts with the outside world is either secondary or simply does not exist for the present Russian political elite. We spat right in our own eye in the manner of a cheap vaudeville act: Just a few hours before the Russian delegation was due to arrive in Seoul (a special flight was planned for almost 50 high-ranking people, including several ministers and governors) Moscow informed the Koreans that Vice Premier Shokhin, head of the mission and cochairman of the bilateral intergovernmental Committee for Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation, could not leave his workplace because of some internal circumstances, and the delegation would hardly travel without its head; then another report arrived from Moscow, imparting the news that the measure which the sides had been working selflessly to prepare for almost two years would still take place, only instead of Shokhin, who is burdened with sudden difficulties, another vice premier -- Yarov -- would be in charge. True, Yarov is not particularly knowledgeable about Russian-Korean economic affairs but, on the other hand, he is of appropriate rank and is not bound by circumstances. Finally, two or three hours later, the "Yarov version" also fell through -- the Koreans were notified definitely that the Russian delegation would not appear in Seoul at all.... Moscow's odd feint, which struck the Koreans to the very bottom of their oriental soul, was at first perceived in Seoul as a symptom of a sharp exacerbation of the internal political crisis in Russia, threatening major reshuffles in the Kremlin corridors and other large-scale upheavals minute by minute. Instead of upheavals, however, Shokhin participated in Russian-Finnish talks and other measures, the Council of Ministers met on schedule, and enigmatic Russian life clearly had no intention of becoming unsettled. This made the puzzled Koreans look for other explanations, engage in soul-searching, and urgently analyze how Seoul could have angered Moscow so greatly. The nerve-racking work ended in the conclusion that the Korean side had provided no grounds on the eve of the summit meeting for a cooling or, still less, the wrecking of the intergovernmental talks. When it became crystal clear that no other interpretation could be found for the surprise from Moscow, except that "restricted movement" status had been imposed on Vice Premier Shokhin, emotions flared in Seoul. The Koreans regarded our nice vaudeville act as an insult. Just two factors have kept bilateral relations from major complications and a flat spin. The first, main factor is the aforementioned visit to Russia of Korean President Kim Yong-sam, which is scheduled for 1 June and remains on the agenda. The second is Yeltsin's personal message to Kim Yong-sam apologizing for the omission and assuring him that the calling off of the talks has no bearing on the bilateral dialogue. As is our custom, the letter did not arrive prior to the extraordinary occurrence but 24 hours after it, only after an adverse squall had swept through the Korean press. It is clearly too soon to regard the incident as closed. The thing is that the called-off talks were conceived not only for the sake of inaugurating the intergovernmental Committee for Economic Cooperation but also as a kind of lightning conductor -- the sides were to have discussed in detail a number of complex issues in bilateral affairs so as not to submit them "raw" to the meeting of the two presidents. Central to these issues are the problem of Russia's failure to repay its debts relating to Korean credits, the question of compensation for those who died on board the downed Korean Boeing, and other far from cheerful issues. Since the lightning conductor has not worked, Moscow must be prepared for all this to surface in the summit talks and not improve the climate there. Another nuance is a purely personnel one. Both in Gaydar's cabinet and in Chernomyrdin's government the economic part of the Korean salient was entrusted to Shokhin, who visited Seoul repeatedly and "ran" bilateral affairs. The present misfire with regard to his trip to Korea will inevitably freeze the very figure of Shokhin for Seoul and undermine its trust in him, unless Yeltsin personally rehabilitates his vice premier within the next few days. The biggest ricochet -- the severe blow to the prestige of Russian diplomacy and the undermining of the reputation as a reliable and stable partner -- will have to be kept in mind until "better times," since, as practice shows, Russia does not yet wish to learn from its own mistakes. Seoul believes, incidentally, that such "better times" will inevitably come in Moscow. It remains to add that Poltoranin, former vice premier and current parliamentarian, has been noticed in Seoul instead of the restricted Vice Premier Shokhin. He has been noticed in the trading rows in the market. Diverse sources, however, are so far failing to mention the purpose of Poltoranian's visit to Korea. Surely not a new vaudeville act?...
