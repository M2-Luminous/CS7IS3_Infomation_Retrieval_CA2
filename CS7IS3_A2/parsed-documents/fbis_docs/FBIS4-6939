FBIS4-6939 "dreas080__a94026" FBIS-EAS-94-080-A Daily Report 17 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Fair Trade Commission Criticized Fair Trade Commission Criticized Neutrality, Autonomy Needed 942A0088C Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 Mar 94 p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0088C Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Editorial: "Autonomy Is the Life and Soul of FTC"] [Text] While the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is a bona fide administrative agency, it differs from the other government agencies in that it is a "quasi-legislative organ" with additional authority similar to that of the public prosecutors office. The FTC is given authority to indict and criminally prosecute acts which violate the Antimonopoly Law. The chairman and four commission members, like the public prosecutor's office and judges, are guaranteed the authority to independently perform their duties. Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura's request that the FTC overlook indictment of the "dango" incident by the Saitama Doyokai was tantamount to demanding a change by the court prior to its decision. This is quite difficult to comprehend. In addition, it has been clarified that former Prime Minister Miyazawa relayed former LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] Vice President Kanemaru's wish to "forego indictment" to former FTC Umezawa. He cannot escape criticism for indiscretion. The responsibility of politicians will eventually be clarified. The problem is that politicians had the understanding that "the policy of the FTC could be changed by applying pressure." The FTC's posture in seeking the understanding and cooperation of politicians--particularly of the ruling parties' Dietmen--on budget acquisition and reform of laws is, as in the case of the other agencies, inevitable in some aspects. However, if a relationship of indebtedness arises with an inclination to comply with demands, it is simply out of the question. The FTC should take this opportunity for a complete reexamination of past antimonopoly administration. It is necessary to check whether it has permitted political intervention, or whether it has lacked the integrity to reject pressures when there were doubtful moves. Unless it does so, suspicion concerning the FTC's autonomy cannot be eradicated. When former Chairman Umezawa dropped the idea of criminal indictment, he stated that "it was totally based on a lack of evidence" and denied any pressures from politicians. If it was based on close consultation with the public prosecutors office, we would like to believe at the present that it was a proper judgment. However, if the arrest of former Construction Minister Nakamura was in fact based on suspicion, it would mean that he had lied about the intervention by politicians. Umezawa himself should clarify when and how the former construction minister applied pressure and whether there were other approaches made. It is well known that the FTC is a "legacy" left by the postwar U.S. Occupation policy. Subsequently, emasculation of the Antimonopoly Law has consistently been contrived. However, a reinforcement of the FTC has been demanded through the Japan-U.S. talks. The government is faced with the need to promote competitive measures based on the Antimonopoly Law in order to set forth a posture of emphasis on the consumers. The role of the FTC has grown unprecedentedly. To meet the expectations of the people, the FTC must adopt a consistent posture to avoid the impression that its application of the Antimonopoly Law is arbitrary and discriminatory. There is said to be a considerable variation in the interpretation of the Antimonoply Law among experts. It is therefore important to display clear-cut judgment. If its application varies according to acts of violation, credibility regarding antimonopoly administration will not only be shaken, but also political intervention will be permitted to pass through the cracks. There is also a problem with the present FTC system. In recent years, the chair has been occupied by former Treasury Ministry officials. The remaining four commission seats have all been occupied by former bureaucrats. Based on the nature of the FTC's duty to promote fair business activity and free competition, an array of personnel that speaks for the government agencies is not desirable. Representatives of the consumers and neutral persons such as scholars should be appointed. Political intervention can be rejected by enhancing neutrality and by consistent and appropriate application of the Antimonopoly Law.
