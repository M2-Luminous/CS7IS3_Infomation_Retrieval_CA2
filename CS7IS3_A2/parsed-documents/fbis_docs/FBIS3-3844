In his speech, Jiang Chunyun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shandong provincial party committee, expressed heartfelt gratitude, on behalf of the provincial party committee and government, to the friends from Hong Kong and Macao for their many years of great support to the promotion of the economies of Hong Kong, Macao, and Shandong and to Shandong's modernization drive. He said: Over the past decade and more since reform and opening up started, Shandong has continuously emancipated the mind, deepened reform, opened wider to the outside world, and accelerated development thanks to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the CPC's basic line, principles, and policies. It has created an excellent situation characterized by rapid economic development and social stability and unity. Meanwhile, we have remained clear- headed to note that Shandong is still lagging rather far behind the requirements of the party Central Committee and other provinces and municipalities in southern China in its extent of opening up and pace of development. It is hoped that friends from Hong Kong and Macao will continue their concern and support for Shandong and offer more valuable opinions on Shandong's future work. Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of Shandong, introduced to the friends from Hong Kong and Macao the basic situation of Shandong, its economic and social development in the past few years, its ideas for the development and work for some time to come, and the key areas of foreign investment for the near future and relevant policies. He said: Introducing more investment from abroad is the focus of Shandong's endeavor to open to the outside world more rapidly. To introduce investment from abroad more rapidly, we will greatly optimize the investment climate, simplify work procedures, improve the later-stage management of foreign-invested enterprises, and provide good-quality and high-efficient service to the foreign firms who have come to invest in Shandong. He emphasized: We wholeheartedly welcome the friends and relatives from Hong Kong and Macao to come to Shandong more often to visit, inspect, and give guidance and wholeheartedly hoped that, in the future, they will, as always, show concern for and support Shandong's modernization drive and, together with us, open up a still better future in the economic and trade cooperation between Shandong Province and Hong Kong and Macao. Thirty-seven deputies and members attended the meeting, including Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice chairman of the National CPPCC Committee and president of the China Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong. In their speeches, they held unanimously: Shandong is an important coastal open province, which has abundant resources and preferential policies for opening up, and whose people are loyal to friends and as good as their word. They said that they would visit Shandong more often to learn more about it and develop economic and trade cooperation. They believed that Shandong's economic and trade cooperation and exchanges with Hong Kong and Macao would be further developed. Li Zhen, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee; Lu Maozeng, chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee; Song Fatang, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and vice governor of Shandong; and persons in charge from pertinent provincial departments, were present at the meeting.
