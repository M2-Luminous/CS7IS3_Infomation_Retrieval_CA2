According to the municipal statistics bureau, Shanghai's gross domestic product (GDP) this year is expected to surpass the 13-percent increase of last year and reach the year's target. Although industry, of which the output accounts for 60 percent of the GDP, slipped early this year, it began to pick up in March, and jumped by 16 percent in April in comparison with the same period of last year. The ratio between sales volume and output reached 97.5 percent last month. As a result of streamlining the foreign trade structure, improving the mechanism for encouraging exports and the municipal government's policy of promoting foreign trade, Shanghai exported a record 2.46 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods in the first four months of this year, up 26.6 percent over the same period last year. The city's improving investment conditions have aroused the interest of foreign business people, who set up 1,256 foreign-funded projects with the approval of the municipal government in the January-April period. These projects involved a combined investment of 2.89 billion U.S. dollars, and some of them were funded by trans-national corporations. However, a local official said there are still problems in the economy. He analysed the situation as follows: "One third of state-owned enterprises suffer from losses which are caused by poor enterprise management, price hikes for raw materials and the unification of the dual exchange rate system. They result in a rise in production costs and hurt the enterprises badly." Other factors include shortages of funds, inflation and sluggish markets. The official noted that though Shanghai's inflation rate is lower than those of many other major cities in the country, it still affects the living standard of the lower-income people, retired people in particular. However, experts here agree that Shanghai's economy is developing steadily thanks to the high input into the economy over the past few years, the increasing rationality of the economic structure, and the smooth reforms of the tax, banking and social security systems. In line with the economic situation in the first four months of this year, the municipal government has decided to rearrange its credits and loans with the focus on supporting key enterprises, especially major foreign trade enterprises. It urged industrial departments to take the marketing of industrial products as the most important task in order to boost production. Meanwhile, related government departments have begun to help enterprises in the red to change their operational mechanism and make up deficits and increase surpluses in the process of market competition step by step. In addition, the city is looking for a new way to make an overall opening to the outside world while continuously implementing the reform measures. Economists believe that the municipal quota of a 12-percent growth in the economy and striving to attain 15 percent this year can be obtained on the condition that the macro-economic environment does not deteriorate.
