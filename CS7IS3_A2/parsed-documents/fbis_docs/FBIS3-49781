At a session late last night in Sarajevo, the Party of Democratic Action [Stranka Demokratske Akcije--SDA] elected its new organs and leadership. Addressing the session he said that "everything is different now" because his forces number 200,000 soldiers. The SDA leader said that the war in Bosnia would continue until the Serbs gave up all the territories which had been predominantly populated by Muslims before the outbreak of the conflict. Advocating again an undivided Bosnia, Izetbegovic admitted openly for the first time that the Muslims had organized themselves for armed secession from Yugoslavia ten months before the outbreak of war on 6 April 1992. "I would like to recall a meeting in the Police Hall in Sarajevo on 10 June 1991 attended by 380 people from the entire former Yugoslavia and the declaration we issued then, ten months before the beginning of the war. In that declaration we heralded the beginning of Bosnia-Herzegovina's armed defense." Izetbegovic said that the Muslims ought to continue along this path while opening up the party to members of other peoples. The SDA should admit all those who are willing to fight for Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. In his view the main criterion for membership is "whether or not someone has remained loyal to the people" referring obviously to the Muslim people he leads. Despite the fact that a vast majority of Serbs and Croats have opted for their independent republics, Izetbegovic said for the umpteenth time that they, too, ostensibly wanted a united Bosnia-Herzegovina. "There is no united Bosnia without the Serbs and Croats as all the Muslims, most of the Croats and a considerable number of Serbs want a united Bosnia-Herzegovina", he said. "There are two stages of struggle. The one phase of struggle for Bosnia's integration is of a military nature, the other is political. I used to quote that poet of ours who said: "By God we swear we shall not be slaves." At the same time Izetbegovic commented on the claims that he wanted to create an Islamic republic. "I am telling you clearly here that I am not in favor of an Islamic republic. Yet, I do want Islam to survive in these lands. We want to remain what we are. I do not know why we should do this. We illustrate here, European Islam. We illustrate a kind of modern Islam", he said. "To this end we can do a great deal for both the East and West," the leader of Muslims said in conclusion and added that they would try to achieve this as democrats.
