The seminar focused on new courses for scientific and technological development in Brazil. Controversies erupted over maintaining a model inherited from the military period (which envisaged the creation of a large military power through a scientific and technological effort undertaken by the Armed Forces) and over discontinuing military-oriented projects. Among the ongoing military projects that are worth mentioning are the AMX aircraft, the Brazilian Space Mission project (which totals $1.1 billion), and a nuclear-powered submarine project ($900 million). Geraldo Lesbat Cagnari Filho, director of the Group of Strategic Studies at Campinas State University [Unicamp], said: "These projects will provide the Brazilian military industry with great technological capability, and it will thus gain international standing." This opinion is not, however, shared by some researchers, who find it necessary to make a comprehensive review of the benefits yielded by these military projects. One who advocates this idea is Renato Peixoto Dagnino, of the technological department at the Unicamp Geoscience Institute, who believes that "the only benefits these projects will yield are academic ones, and not technological nor military." The search for new sources of financing that are not closely linked to the government, and cooperation between the private sector and Brazilian universities in undertaking joint scientific and technological research, were also among the main topics discussed at the seminar. Helio Barros, planning secretary at the Science and Technology Ministry, said: "The Brazilian Government is not planning to increase funds allocated for science and technology, which this year will stand at $900 million." He added that this is happening because "the country's budget system does not envisage specific investments in this area, and thus the budgeted funds are not earmarked for any specific project." In the past two years only 40 percent of the approved budget has been disbursed.
