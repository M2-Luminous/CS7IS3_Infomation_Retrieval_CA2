SPD Landtag Group Chairman Wolfgang Birthler said on Wednesday morning [23 March] that the current course of the government will be continued. Speaking to the Landtag, Minister President Manfred Stolpe (SPD), too, stressed that the Cabinet is able to function. He did not rule out early new elections, but a decision will be made by parliament. Normally, a new Landtag would be elected on 11 September. The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Landtag group, which is in opposition, announced that it will not tolerate a minority SPD-FDP government. New elections must provide clear conditions in the land, CDU Group Chairman Dieter Helm said. He will suggest to his group to put forward a motion for parliament to dissolve itself on Wednesday if possible. Helm accused Stolpe of trying to get by an "untenable situation" in an undemocratic way. The CDU will not, however, put forward a motion for no-confidence vote. The Party of Democratic Socialism group wants to decide at a special meeting this evening whether it will put forward a motion for new elections in parliament. [passage omitted]
