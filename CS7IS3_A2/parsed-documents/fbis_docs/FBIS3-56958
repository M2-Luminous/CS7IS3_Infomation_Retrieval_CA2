The head of the Baltic state reported on the late night television news, "Clinton categorically asserts that he differentiates between human rights, citizenship, and the question of the withdrawal of Russian troops." The army, said Clinton, must be withdrawn within the deadlines set without any kind of additional conditions. He spoke of his support for the troop withdrawal process and expressed the hope, according to Ulmanis, that Latvia will resolve the issues of human rights and citizenship in the spirit of the provisions of the CSCE. Clinton also stressed "that human rights and citizenship are the affair of each state, of each people." "I think," Ulmanis noted, "that this is very important for us." During the conversation an exchange of comments took place on the recent utterances of Andrey Kozyrev. The view of the U.S. President, Ulmanis said, "allows Latvia to calm down somewhat." However, Ulmanis added, "we should always be prepared for such an aggressive policy." According to Ulmanis, Clinton's telephone call "allowed us to dispel many of the suspicions regarding the talks between the United States and Russia."
