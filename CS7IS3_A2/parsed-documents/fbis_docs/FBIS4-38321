Foreign intelligence spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis described as groundless a statement by head of the Chechen department of the press and information Movladi Udugov made in an interview with FRANCE PRESSE that "local experts made an attempt on Dzhokhar Dudayev's life on the order from (Russian foreign intelligence chief) Yevgeniy Primakov." In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Samolis said that such allegations are a "fabrication bordering on nonsense and absurdity." She said the Russian foreign intelligence abandoned terroristic methods long ago and does not even have structures which could carry out such activity. The foreign intelligence service only collects information, she said.
