In an interview with Ken Daniels, he explained AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche's involvement with the events that led to the downfall of his government. [Begin recording] [Mangope] He said he spoke to me about their helping us and I said: No, I can't say yes; speak to my security people. I referred him to Mr. Cronje. [Daniels] He didn't go on with your consent, as it were? [Mangope] No, the people I spoke to and the people I invited are the Volksfront [National Front] people of Constand Viljoen. [Daniels] With hindsight now, do you think it was a mistake -- Mr. Terreblanche coming into the country? [Mangope] Well, I mean, he was not invited. I think it was a mistake that when he was told to leave he didn't leave. The people who were in charge -- my people in charge of security repeatedly requested him to leave but he, apparently, according to what they tell me, he would not leave. [Daniels] Did you think the whole situation could have been avoided altogether -- the traumatic events of the past few days? [Mangope] I don't know. I think you should direct that question to the African National Congress [ANC], to the Communist Party, and to the Nationalist Party who started the strikes. It has for a long time been the policy of the African National Congress and the Communist Party to destabilize Bophuthatswana, to make Bophuthatswana ungovernable, and to topple my government. [Daniels] But were you not facing a situation which a large section of your people were in fact supporters of the ANC? [Mangope] That has not been proved to me. I don't know if you have proof of that, that is the case. In any case even if that were the case why not allow me two days to put this matter to parliament -- for parliament to adopt a resolution in terms of which we would take part and that question that you asked would be proved right or wrong -- whether I have support or not, and also flowing from that resolution would be free political activity for other parties because we would not engage in an election campaign and deny others, other parties to do the same. We were literally denied the opportunity to prove that in fact we have...we have majority support in Bophuthatswana. [Daniels] Could you not have held a referendum? [Mangope] I have said all along that should the results of negotiations be satisfactory to us and should we be convinced that the constitution such as has been negotiated will bring a better life for our people, we'll go back to our people, but you know that up to the eleventh hour, which was last week, there was an impasse. We have said, therefore, that let there be international mediation. We are prepared to abide by whatever the mediation ... [pauses] whatever will emerge from the mediation, and we then will go to our people. [end recording]
