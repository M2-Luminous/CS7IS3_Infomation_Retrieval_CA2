This is the first time that our country has extended its police authority to the South China Sea to reassert our sovereignty over the South China Sea. The police patrol boats were to link up at Taiping Island with Yu-hsun No.2 boat and naval warships which went there by separate routes. Their operations have so far been kept secret. The patrol boats are on their way home and will arrive in Kaohsiung today or tomorrow. According to the Seventh Security Police Group, its No. 2 and No. 3 patrol boats, led by Chang Chen-chung, chief secretary of the police group, set out from the No. 2 harbor at Kaohsiung at 1930 on 16 April with a dozen or so high-ranking police officers on board, including Hou Chin-tsung, commander of the second battalion of the Seventh Security Police Group. Besides a dozen or so crew members, each boat also has on board more than a dozen policemen from the Fourth Company of the Seventh Security Police Group, armed with machineguns and Uzi submachineguns. According to the Seventh Security Police Group, our fishing boats have frequently been detained by the Philippines and Vietnam and piracy has been a serious threat to the lives and property of our fishermen operating in the South China Sea in recent years. Our country's South China Sea policy clearly calls for strengthened police patrols to protect our fishermen. For this reason, our first police patrol there serves to signal to the international community our reassertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea. Since the high level [of government] attaches considerable importance to this police patrol, it has been carried out after six months of prudent planning. According to the Seventh Security Police Group, its patrol boats are performing duties around Taiping Island for the first time. The main purpose is to test navigational safety between Taiwan and Taiping Island and to survey the waters around the island to prepare for stationing a police company on the island in the future. According to the Seventh Security Police Group, the No. 2 and No. 3 patrol boats are on their way home, expected to arrive in Kaohsiung harbor today or tomorrow. Its Fourth Company, stationed in Kaohsiung, has four patrol boats -- the 800-ton-class No. 1 boat, the 400-ton-class No. 2 and No. 3 boats, and the 200-ton-class No. 5 boat. Some of the boats may be diverted to perform duties around Taiping Island in the future.
