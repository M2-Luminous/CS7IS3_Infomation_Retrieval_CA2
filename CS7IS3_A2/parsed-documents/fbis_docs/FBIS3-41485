There has been a ban on importing and producing asbestos since the beginning of this year. When the new regulations go into effect, asbestos will be permitted only in certain special cases. Chief supervisor Kirsi Makela of the Labor Ministry's Worker Protection Division said the Finnish regulations are stricter than those in the European Union countries. According to the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, Finland has a right to stand by its stricter rules.
