Environment Minister Yosi Sarid has ordered the purchase of an incinerator capable of destroying 15,000 tons of hazardous waste a year, but the ministry plans for all incineration to be carried out at another site within four years, Vardi said. Committee chairman Yehoshu'a Matza (Likud) was surprised to learn from ministry Director-General Yisra'el Peleg the government had decided not to privatize the site. Matza said the toxic waste buried at the site threatens water sources and expressed concern over the recent discovery of radio-active waste at the site. Matza was further shocked to discover that hazardous waste is being imported, despite the fact Israel has signed the Basel Treaty which restricts the international movement of this type of waste. The subject was raised by MK [Knesset Member] No'omi Blumental (Likud). In response, the Environment Ministry's legal adviser, Bo'az Oren, said the treaty has not yet been ratified. After regulations have been authorized, no hazardous material will enter the country without the ministry's permission, Oren said, but in the meantime there is no restriction. He noted that although the treaty was signed in 1989, it was only ratified by the EC last month. Matza asked that the ministry establish regulations as soon as possible to close the current loophole.
