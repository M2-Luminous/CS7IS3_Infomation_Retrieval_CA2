It has had a surprising degree of success, for instance, in the new Namibia Defence Force (NDF), but the same cannot be said of the Namibian Police which is almost totally polarised at this stage." "Members of the public cannot help but notice the rift in the ranks of the Namibian Police, a rift that appears to be growing on an almost daily basis. In this case, however, the division is almost exclusively between black and white." Lister believes "there appears to be a tendency on the part of certain white police officers to bide their time for a golden handshake," which "does not demonstrate commitment on the part of those who have already gone for this option." The Namibian police force, "which has a mammoth task ahead of it, particularly in the combatting of increased crime, cannot be effective if it remains so divided. Unity among the ranks, whether black or white, must be brought about if the force is to earn the respect of the people."
