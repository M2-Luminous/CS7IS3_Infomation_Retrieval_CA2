The Swedish UN troops say that they have been given no information whatever about the possibility of the battalion moving to Bosnia. "After all, it is people who are involved here, not a flock of sheep that can be moved around here and there without being informed or consulted," the officers write. Even Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas was criticized by the Swedish UN command. She was on a tour of the former Yugoslavia last week when Sweden was asked by the United Nations whether the troops in Macedonia could be deployed to reinforce the troops stationed in Bosnia. The day after being informed about the inquiry, Mrs. af Ugglas inspected that very battalion in Macedonia. According to the officers, she did not utter a single word about the sensitive political discussions which were going on between Sweden and the United Nations. "The foreign minister touched on the matter with the battalion's commanders. She said that it was not her business to pass any information to the soldiers," Staffan Bjork at the UD's press office said. The officers who wrote the protest letter belong to the battalion of Swedish riflemen in Macedonia. They were informed by family members in Sweden that they might be moving to Bosnia. The defense staff is responsible for providing the Swedish UN forces with operational information. The press chief there, Bertil Tennert, is aware of the officers' criticisms and claims to understand the climate of uncertainty in which the soldiers are living: "We had thought of releasing the information, but news leaked out very quickly in New York. We did not succeed in getting our act together." Kjell Gothe, Defense Minister Anders Bjorck's spokesman, gave roughly the same explanation on the failure to provide information.
