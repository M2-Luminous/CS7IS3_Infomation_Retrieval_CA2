One of the plan's goals is to decrease the number of failed projects. The strategy behind the Danish development aid is to change tactics in the fight against poverty. Figuratively speaking, the shotguns will be traded in for larger caliber precision weaponry. Instead of shipping off 9 billion Danish kroner worth of shotguns in all directions -- and hoping for a few hits -- the targets in developing countries will be made smaller, while at the same time hoping for hits by a few large bullets. The result hopefully will be more bull's-eyes than today. We are not talking about nickels and dimes. Denmark still tops the list when it comes to cash support for the poor regions of the world. Since 1992, 1 percent of the GNP has been allocated for development aid, and this year it is expected to top 9 billion kroner. In passing it can be mentioned that one out of five people in the world has less than seven kroner a day for all of life's necessities. About 1.1 billion people live under such conditions. Denmark's development aid corresponds to approximately a little more than one day's pay for one-fifth of the world's poorest people. How this aid will benefit the poor and the needy is what an expert commission in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has just outlined in a strategic plan for Danish development aid through the year 2000. Concentration More than 25 years' experience with Danish involvement in developing countries will be reviewed in the plan. The main thrust is that the government's aid organization DANIDA is to concentrate its efforts and stick to areas in which it already has some expertise. Implicitly this will reduce the number of failed projects -- the so-called white elephants. This will happen by giving aid to selected sectors that enjoy the benefit of Denmark's bilateral, that is direct, support. One example is the massive support for the health sector already taking place in Zambia in southern Africa. Simplistically said, by the year 2000 an end will have been put to the practice of constructing a silo here, a school there, and a water pump here. The aid is to be better directed. This also goes for that half of the development aid given to multilateral support for international organizations. Last year Denmark contributed 3.9 billion kroner to the UN's many affiliated organizations like the World Food Program and the UNDP [United Nations Development Program], and also for various development banks and funds. The results of the effort have not always been well received in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. By the year 2000 Denmark wants to, to a far larger extent, donate money to those organizations that the government in Copenhagen thinks are following the guidelines that Denmark has drawn up for its aid efforts. To be on the donor list will not be a goal in itself. At the same time the proposed strategy determines that Denmark should use its multilateral billions as leverage to get more Danes employed in the UN organizations and to use their influence strongly in those areas where they are represented. The main recipients of the bilateral Danish development aid today are called planned partner countries. The goal is to have 20 countries. The great majority of these have been chosen from the list of the poorest in the world. Eighteen have been chosen, and the last two will have been decided on before the Folketing adjourns for the summer -- at which time it probably will have accepted the strategic proposal. One of the cornerstones in Danish aid policy for several years has been the concept of "poverty orientation"; that is Danish money is to benefit the poorest groups in the receiving countries. In the strategic plan, however, the idea is that the poverty orientation can be relative. This will happen in future years as a plan for giving aid is made for each country. Those meetings will hardly be dull. Knud Vilby, the head of the aid organization International Cooperation, says: "Even though this is only a draft I cannot see that there is any guarantee that the aid will be in relation to the poverty criteria." New Concepts One of the aid policy's key concepts so far has been aid for a particular project. That covers the strategy up to the present time of giving bilateral aid aimed at particular projects in the developing countries. This concept will frequently still be appearing in DANIDA's internal working language toward the year 2000, but with a somewhat devalued meaning, and it might be displaced by concepts like: "General program aid" and "sector-program aid." To the extent that Danish aid for a particular project will continue to be given, the projects shall not be very large, but clearly innovative and something that can serve as a model, according to the strategic proposal. That means that some of the current aid projects will be phased out by the year 2000. In return, organizations like International Cooperation can get money to establish projects in the respective countries. Through the year 2000 the focus is on state bilateral aid in return for: - Support for the receiving countries' staggering balance of payments, debt relief, and aid in the form of goods and materials, as well as for easing the effect of the enormous social decline the countries experience as they are exposed to demands from the World Bank to change over to a free market economy. - Support for the development of reforms in a well-defined area like, for example, the health sector, or for the establishment of an effective administrative system. These two new concepts serve notice of new times ahead for both DANIDA's employees, their delegates, and the receiving countries as well as for the voluntary aid organizations, the NGO's [nongovermentals]. The partial reorganization of aid-giving will involve, among other things, that DANIDA will send out experts for shorter periods of time. The receiving countries will to a larger extent than before be responsible for development -- and the money -- and the experts will remain more in the background. The show will be run by the local powers. On the other hand the proposal also stresses that abuse and corruption will result in Denmark's immediate shutoff of the money. For the NGO's the change in strategy means that they will be ensured of having a larger influence in DANIDA's decisionmaking process and that humanitarian organizations, among other things, will have the possibility of starting development projects as a replacement of direct aid. The business sector, which at times has had a tense relationship with DANIDA, will also be invited to join in working out aid strategies for the planned partner countries. In the strategy proposal it has even been determined that a major aspect of the cooperation with Danish business is that export possibilities will be derived from it. In the future businesses will come in from the cold with promises of more orders, more credit, and increased possibilities for cooperation with private enterprise in the planned partner countries. Women and the Environment It is known that the role of women in poor countries is closely connected with the countries' development potential and DANIDA has, along with the NGO's, for many years supported projects that will benefit women. It is therefore not unexpected that the female aspect of this is one of the areas that will receive the highest priority toward the year 2000. Before an aid project can be launched, plans for how a particular project will improve the situation of women must be worked out. The environmental aspect, which will be incorporated into Danish aid from now on, will receive similar top priority. According to the strategic proposal, this is to be taken so literally that environmental effects will be surveyed in connection with all physical development projects started with Danish support. One can hear an echo here from the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio in 1992. The proposal also mentions the so-called Environment and Catastrophic Fund; an outgrowth of the development aid that will gradually toward the year 2000 be receiving 0.5 percent of the GNP. At that time it will amount to 4 billion kroner. Some 2 billion kroner have been earmarked for restoring the global environment and is to be administered by the Ministry of Environmental Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The remaining 2 billion will be spent on asylum-seekers in Denmark and on humanitarian aid. Overpopulation Toward the year 2000 Denmark will also concentrate more on development programs whose goal is to permanently reduce population growth. This is a very emotional issue, and Denmark has not previously given direct bilateral aid to population policy programs. There have been fundamental doubts about getting involved in anything that hints of population control. When planning ahead, strategies for DANIDA's efforts in the area of population must be worked out this year. Just the wording of the plan mirrors the sensibilities involved: "The strategy will be based on activities aiming to strengthen the individual woman's and the individual couple's possibility to choose how many children they want and to plan [the size of] their family." Just wait until September when the UN has its international conference in Cairo on Population and Health. Here Denmark's strategy will form a part of the declarations along with, for instance, those of strict Islamic and Catholic countries. And then even the vaguest hints of contraception might create some commotion. While we are talking about wording, it is worth ruminating on one of the final remarks of the proposal: "The strategy of Danish development policy toward the year 2000 is to make up a superior framework for how to transform the general goals into practical efforts in the coming years. The carrying out of these goals is not a goal in itself, but a means that constantly much be adjusted to the development." This strategy is to be evaluated again -- in 1997. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Danish Development Aid in 1993(in million kroner) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bilateral | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Direct aid to developing countries | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Projects |3,177 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Advisors |193 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volunteers |160 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Scholarship for education in Denmark |77 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aid for external consultants |173 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Stock purchase and development loan b-|102 | |y IFU [Industrialization Fund for Dev-| | |eloping Countries] | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Democracy fund |59 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Reception of Refugees |500 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |4,441 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Multilateral | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aid through international organizations | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aid from the UN |1,301 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Development banks and funds |614 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aid from the EU |567 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Catastrophic aid |600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Multi-bi |223 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Multimiscellaneous |166 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Personnel |96 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Multi-environment |100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other |212 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |3,878 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
