These goals radically differ from those pursued in the totalitarian period, according to a decree by Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, released here today. The decree liquidates the so-called "operational services" of Armenia's State Office for National Security which were formerly engaged in ideological control over the population. Their staff will be paid salaries during next three months, after which period they will either be fired or fill other positions in the state office departments, according to results of professional fitness tests. All security personnel are subject to these tests, the decree says. New guidelines for the State Office for National Security will be developed, along with a new structure of the agency. Under the decree, the main border-guard administration, agencies in charge of guarding strategically important enterprises, financial and medical departments of the state security office, as well as its technical maintenance services will keep functioning until the complete restructuring will take place. Possibly, they will form the foundation for Armenia's future security service. David Shakhnazaryan, 39, who since March 1993 was an ambassador at large under the Armenian president, has been appointed an acting head of the State Office for National Security. He is to replace Eduard Simonyants, who headed the office since February 1993 and now will fill another post.
