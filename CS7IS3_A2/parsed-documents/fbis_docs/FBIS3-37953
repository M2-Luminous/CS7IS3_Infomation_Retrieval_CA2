Walesa pointed out that the visit had fulfilled its purpose, because it had once again affirmed the diplomatic relations between the two countries, giving a sincere and friendly character to the official declarations. The Polish president noted that there is much in common in the histories of Latvia and Poland. Both countries fell victim to the brutality of Hitler and the Soviet Union. Walesa noted that the Polish Government in exile, the legitimate representatives of the nation, never recognized the annexation of Latvia. Addressing the Saeima deputies, the Polish president noted that the two countries are currently solving similar problems of a political, economic, and social nature. Mutual cooperation by the two countries can assist in solving Latvia's economic problems. Walesa noted with satisfaction that the authorities in the Republic of Latvia have guaranteed the Polish minority the opportunity to develop undisturbed and preserve their national qualities. For this, I want to express here in your parliament my sincere gratitude. The Polish president expressed the hope that his visit will help to create all-round cordial relations between Poland and Latvia. Afterwards, a speech in response was made by Saeima Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs: [Begin Gorbunovs recording] Highly esteemed president of Poland, I wish to thank you for your address. I think that I express the thoughts of the deputies as well in declaring my satisfaction that you, highly esteemed president, have during your visit attended the Saeima of the Republic of Latvia. I especially wish to pay my respects to you, because your name is undeniably inscribed in the recent history of the transformations in Europe. We know that the processes that at present seem objective and inevitable, at the time, for the initiators of these transformations, demanded very much. At that time, Polish Solidarity, under your leadership, boldly showed the way that had to be undertaken by the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe. No less responsibility rests upon us today, when along with painful economic reforms, countries that recently returned to the company of free nations are seeking a way to stand together with the big developed countries on the map of common European security. All the more so because Latvia, like Poland, is conscious of being fully entitled to be a shaper of the new democratic Europe today and in the future. We fully concur with the idea expressed by you, Mr. President, that we must cope with the demands posed by the new times and the new situation in Europe. As Latvia is step by step being connected to the circuit of Europe, we see in Poland one of our closest partners. With great attention we have been following your country's experience of political and economic reforms, and what you have achieved has given us great hope. Let me wish success to you, to the whole Polish nation, in realizing those aims that you put forward on the way to prosperity, peace, and security. May your visit to Latvia serve the growth of our nations and our countries. [end recording] That was the speech in response to the Polish president by Saeima Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs.
