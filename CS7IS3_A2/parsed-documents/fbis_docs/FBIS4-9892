In other words, a plot existed and the individuals conspired with one another. In a news release, Montes says that, according to investigations, Mario Aburto Martinez, Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, and Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela -- the latter is a former Judicial Police member -- may have acted in concert. Montes also mentioned in the news release the simultaneous participation of Rodolfo Mayoral Esker, Rodolfo Rivapalacio, and two other people who have been identified visually but whose names and whereabouts are still unknown. Montes says the investigation could later be expanded to include a larger number of people. Here is the complete message that Montes read for the media this morning: [Begin Montes recording] Ladies and gentlemen, as was reported in a release issued by this office on 31 March, we have found new evidence leading to several important details related to the Colosio assassination. 1. Several individuals participated in concert with the intention of killing Colosio. 2. So far, the simultaneous participation of the following individuals can be mentioned, although this does not rule out the possibility that the investigation might be expanded to include a larger number of people some time in the future: Mario Aburto Martinez, assassin; Tranquilino Sanchez, who watched General Delmiro Garcia Reyes, who was in charge of security at the outer perimeter, thereby making it possible for Aburto to approach and walk up beside Colosio; Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, who pushed back the crowd making a path for the individual I will mention next; one participant, visually identified but whose name and whereabouts are unknown, who stood in front of Colosio and then threw himself to the ground with the purpose of blocking Colosio's movements and permitting Aburto to put himself in a position to fire on Colosio; one participant, identified visually, a man who was wearing glasses, but whose name and whereabouts are unknown, who blocked other people's movements until he positioned himself on the candidate's left side, crouching moments before Aburto fired; Rodolfo Mayoral, son of Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, who pushed and blocked Colonel Federico Antonio Reynaldo del Pozo, the man in charge of security at the inner perimeter, diverting the colonel's attention and forcing him to relax his vigilance; Rodolfo Rivapalacio, who hired Sanchez, Mayoral Valenzuela, and Rodolfo Mayoral to be part of the group seemingly created to maintain order. This is according to the list of the members of the group. The last name on the list has been altered. 3. Similarly, it has been confirmed that, during the meeting and before the assassination, Sanchez and Rodolfo Mayoral stayed with Aburto and chatted with him in a clear demonstration they knew one another. 4. The facts, based mainly on video footage and pictures studied by the authorities, constitute firm evidence, reinforced by eyewitness testimony, that confirms the actions perpetrated by the accused and validate the origin and authenticity of the material analyzed. Other circumstances, which are part of the investigation and which also point unmistakably to a criminal conspiracy, are also being studied. Sanchez, Mayoral Valenzuela, Mayoral Eskes, and Rivapalacio have been handed over to judicial authorities. [end recording]
