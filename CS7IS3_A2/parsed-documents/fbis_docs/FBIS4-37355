Sha'th, who carries the portfolio of minister of international cooperation in the new Palestinian Authority, was let through later in the day after he contacted Amnon Shahaq, Israel's deputy chief of staff. "Someone irresponsible thought of stopping me," Sha'th told reporters after meeting Palestinian security officials and foreign diplomats at police headquarters here. "This is totally unacceptable to Palestinians and to the (Israeli-Palestinian) agreement. "They have no right to stop us between Jericho and al-'Awja or between Jericho and the West Bank. This is against the agreement, how can they do that in peace time?" Sha'th was stopped at a checkpoint on the edge of Jericho, heading for the Arab village of al-'Awja, at the northern edge of the Palestinian self-rule enclave. He returned to the town. The main road between the checkpoint and al-'Awja is not part of the autonomous territory and crosses a Jewish settlement. However, it is patrolled by joint Israeli and Palestinian forces. Sha'th echoed a complaint voiced by other Palestinian officials that the Israeli army regularly bars entry to tourist buses. Around midday, Sha'th headed back from police HQ for al-'Awja and drove through the checkpoint in a convoy headed by an Israeli security van, part of a joint force with two Palestinian security vehicles. At al-'Awja, the Israeli van pulled up outside the village as Sha'th went in to visit a youth center.
