Investigation and analysis data indicate that there are problems such as a shortage of resources for the business and means of sale in agricultural production, particular shortages in the business and the sale of fertilizer; price hikes of these productive means; and disorder in these markets. The means of agricultural production are the essential factors of production. Success or failure in running the business in this regard is directly affecting the basic role of agriculture. In order to stabilize the agricultural development and to protect peasants' interests, it is imperative for us to consolidate the markets of means of agricultural production and to conduct macro-economic control. First, we should enhance the role of the business of means in agricultural production as the main channel of all sectors. Over many years, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels have played an important role in ensuring the supply of means of agricultural production, in safeguarding peasants' interest, and in protecting agricultural production. After having relaxed the restrictions on the business of means in agricultural production, competitions in this regard have become intensified because the state, collectives, and individuals have joined in succession in the business. The decline of economic results and the shortage of funds are adversely affecting the capability of supply and marketing cooperatives in market competition and in purchasing, selling, and storing the commodities of these productive means. However, the self-employed businessmen in this area who join in the transaction in the busy season and quit their business in the slack season, have jostled the normal operation of markets in this regard. They have made the departments in charge of supplying the means of agricultural production unable to estimate market capacity and demands, severely emphasized the role of supply and marketing cooperatives in being the main channel of all economic sectors, and imposed a shadow on the feeling of the broad masses of peasants. Second, we should consolidate the chaotic order in the markets of means of agricultural production. A number of falsified and sub-standard means of agricultural production have flooded in the markets due to increasingly intensified market competition and interference caused by abnormal competition. All of these have brought harm to peasants, hindered agricultural production, led to a chaotic order in the business of means of agricultural production and in the prices and quality of these productive means, and severely damaged the interests of peasants. Departments in charge of enforcing the law at all levels should resolutely check the business without a license and strictly handle the cases of illegal purchase and sales and the cases committed by those who are marketing the falsified and sub-standard commodities in this regard. At the same time, supply and marketing cooperative at all levels should enhance the organization of goods sources; engage in legal operation; keep the commodity prices stable; vigorously stabilize the markets of means of agricultural production; and meet the demands of agricultural production. Third, we should promote the establishment of a service network for the supply of means to agricultural production. The chaotic markets of means of agricultural production have enabled the business and sale of fertilizer to go out of control and will undoubtedly lead to a loss of guarantee in supplies that adversely affect production. The business of means of agricultural production is strongly seasonal and these productive means can enjoy brisk sales as soon as the busy season comes. In order to enhance the capability of readjusting and controlling the markets of means of agricultural production, we should reconsider the main channel role played by the supply and marketing cooperatives and provide preferential policies for the supply of business and marketing cooperatives. At the same time, these cooperatives should continuously deepen the reform in the operation and management of their business in this regard. They should also regard companies dealing in the means of agricultural production as a firm leader and the grass-roots cooperatives in rural areas as support, bring into play the strong points of mass communities, broaden the network and centers of purchase and sales, and actively promote the popularization of the service network for supplying and marketing these agricultural productive means.
