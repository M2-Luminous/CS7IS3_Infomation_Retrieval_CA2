CCEJ Secretary-General So Kyong-sok said that there had been problems during the Uruguay Round talks, and he called on the government to take measures to revive agriculture and rural economy in coping with rice market opening. So said the lack of experts caused by frequent reshuffles of concerned public officials, the absence of an active negotiating strategy and the lack of investment in rural areas during negotiations were problems noticed in the course of handling the UR talks. The government should fully support farmers' and fishermen's organizations and the fund for this support should be supplied by the non-agricultural and urban sectors, the policy recommendation says. While predicting farm products market opening will affect not only related industries such as fertilizer, farm machinery and farm products processing but living conditions in urban areas because of migration to cities, it calls on the government to take measures as early as possible.
