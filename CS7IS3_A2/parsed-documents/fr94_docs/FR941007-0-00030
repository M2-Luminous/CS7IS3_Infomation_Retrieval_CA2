FR941007-0-00030 FR941007-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Parts 51 and 78 [Docket No. 94&hyph;007&hyph;2] Swine Brucellosis AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. SUMMARY: We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that provided for payment at fair market value for whole herds of swine depopulated because of brucellosis. This action is necessary to eliminate in an expeditious manner all swine herds known to be affected with brucellosis, and to help ensure that swine brucellosis is eradicated in the United States within the next 5 years. This action is also necessary to help eliminate the human health risk associated with swine brucellosis. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Joseph F. Annelli, Chief Staff Veterinarian, Swine Health Staff, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, suite 204, Presidential Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7767. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Brucellosis is a serious infectious disease of swine, cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella. Brucellosis in swine is characterized by abortion, infertility, orchitis, posterior paralysis, and lameness. To help prevent the spread of the disease, and to further its eradication, the regulations in 9 CFR part 51 provide for payment of Federal indemnity to owners of certain animals destroyed because of brucellosis. The payment of indemnity is intended to provide owners with a financial incentive for promptly destroying animals infected with or exposed to brucellosis. The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 govern the interstate movement of swine affected with brucellosis. To help prevent the spread of the disease, under these regulations the interstate movement of brucellosis reactor swine and exposed swine is subject to certain restrictions. In an interim rule effective and published in the Federal Register on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12530&hyph;12533, Docket No. 94&hyph;007&hyph;1), we amended the regulations in part 51 to provide for payment at fair market value for whole herds of swine depopulated because of brucellosis. We also amended the regulations in part 78 to require that all brucellosis-exposed swine from herds known to be affected with the disease be identified with an eartag before being moved interstate from the herd. We solicited comments on the interim rule for a 60-day comment period ending May 16, 1994. We received 13 comments by that date. The commenters included a swine industry association and other members of the swine industry, a national veterinary association, a Federal agency, a workers union, representatives of a county government, and other members of the general public. Twelve of the commenters supported the interim rule as written. One commenter opposed the interim rule, on the grounds that the swine industry, not the Federal Government, should take financial responsibility for swine destroyed because of brucellosis. We are making no changes based on this comment. Under 21 U.S.C. 111, the Secretary of Agriculture has statutory authority to promulgate regulations to prevent the dissemination from one State to another of contagious, infectious, or communicable diseases of animals. Under 21 U.S.C. 114a, the Secretary is authorized to pay claims growing out of the destruction of animals affected by or exposed to any communicable disease of livestock that threatens the U.S. livestock industry. In accordance with this statutory authority, the regulations in part 51 provide for payment of Federal indemnity to owners of swine destroyed because of brucellosis. As we discussed in our interim rule, under the provisions of that rule, the total cost for indemnity is expected to increase only slightly over the life of the swine brucellosis eradication program, and total swine brucellosis eradication costs are expected to decrease substantially. We expect that paying fair market value for whole herds of swine depopulated because of brucellosis will reduce the total cost of eradication from $18.6 million to $11.35 million, and will shorten the time necessary to achieve eradication by more than 25 years. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the interim rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions of the interim rule, without change, as a final rule. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule also requires that all exposed swine in a herd known to be affected with brucellosis be identified with a metal eartag before being moved interstate from the herd known to be affected. At present, 10 swine herds in the United States are known to be affected with brucellosis. This number represents less than 0.005 percent of the 235,840 swine herds in this country. We estimate that the cost of applying eartags to exposed swine in the average herd known to be affected will be less than $20. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .) the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget. List of Subjects 9 CFR Part 51 Animal diseases, Cattle, Hogs, Indemnity payments, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 9 CFR Part 78 Animal diseases, Bison, Cattle, Hogs, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation. Accordingly, the interim rule amending 9 CFR parts 51 and 78 that was published at 59 FR 12530&hyph;12533 on March 17, 1994, is adopted, without change, as a final rule. 9 CFR Part 51 Authority: 21 U.S.C. 111&hyph;113, 114, 114a, 114a&hyph;1, 120, 121, 125, 134b; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d). 9 CFR Part 78 Authority: 21 U.S.C. 111&hyph;114a&hyph;1, 114g, 115, 117, 120, 121, 123&hyph;126, 134b, 134f; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d).
