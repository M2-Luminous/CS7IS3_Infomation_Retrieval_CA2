Local officials said that they hoped for a 12 percent growth in both the number of tourists and earnings from tourism services. To realize this target the autonomous region will launch at least three major tourism routes under the national program of "1994 Cultural Relics and Historic Sites Tours," and start some new tourism programs with special features, such as desert expedition and rafting on rivers addition to eight international tourism and trade fairs. Statistics show that Xinjiang received about 240,000 overseas tourists and earned 40.02 million U.S. dollars from relevant services last year. The famous "Silk Road," which used to serve as a major channel for conducting exchanges between China and countries in western Asia and Europe, is in the region. The opening of 14 Chinese border cities has presented Xinjiang with more opportunities for developing tourism, said the officials. Xinjiang's strategy is also to combine tourism with trade. From July 1991 to the present, nearly 300,000 people from Pakistan, Mongolia and the Commonwealth of Independent States came to Xinjiang on shopping tours.
