Hosokawa told a meeting of leaders of the government and ruling parties that Japan urgently needs to adopt market-opening measures to resolve the trade row with the United States. Meanwhile, a government source said, "we want to produce a concluded package at the earliest possible date in March." The Hosokawa cabinet decided last week to formulate a set of measures including deregulation and import promotion to improve foreign access to the Japanese market. The decision followed a U.S. announcement that it plans to impose sanctions on imports of Japanese cellular phones. The government source said, however, that the planned market- opening steps are not designed to avert threatened U.S. trade retaliation but are "voluntary efforts." Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a morning press conference that the government will hold a ministerial-level emergency meeting "within this week" to discuss ways to repair strained trade ties with the U.S. Ministers of foreign affairs, finance, and international trade and industry will attend the session, which is likely to be held after the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 becomes law, probably Wednesday, government sources said. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told the ruling parties' meeting that the focal point now is how Japan and the U.S. can strike a deal on criteria without using figures to measure the openness of Japanese markets. Hosokawa met U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this month in Washington but failed to agree on a new framework to slash Japan's huge surplus in bilateral trade, which last year amounted to about 60 billion dollars, according to U.S. figures. The U.S. asked Japan to set numerical targets but Japan rejected the demand, saying it would lead to managed trade.
