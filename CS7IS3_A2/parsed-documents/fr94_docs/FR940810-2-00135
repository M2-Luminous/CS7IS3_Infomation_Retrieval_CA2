The membership term is three years. A limited portion of the membership may serve consecutive terms. Those persons who submitted applications in reply to the May 3, 1993, notice need not reapply. To achieve the balance of membership required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Coast Guard is especially interested in receiving applications from minorities and women. The members of the Committee serve without compensation from the Federal Government, although travel reimbursement and per diem will be provided. The Committee normally meets in Washington, DC, with working group meetings for specific problems on an as-required basis. Dated: August 3, 1994. Joseph J.
