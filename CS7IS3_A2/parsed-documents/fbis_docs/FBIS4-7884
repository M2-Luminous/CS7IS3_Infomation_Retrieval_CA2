Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov is expected to dismiss some 3,000 officers and 1,000 sergeants. According to DUMA, that might provoke unrest and even a revolt in the army. According to TRUD, 3,400 officers and twice as many sergeants will be sacked. "I have dismissed 200 and I will dismiss more," Defence Minister Aleksandrov reportedly said at yesterday's meeting of the National Security Council with the Presidency, writes DUMA. The minister explained that cuts were inevitable because of the inadequate budget. Participants in yesterday's [4 April] meeting suggested that an official declaration be issued for the press to prevent dismal rumours from spreading in the Army, but the head of the president's office, Mr. Ivaylo Trifonov, chose to make a routine and colourless statement, DUMA comments. The daily points out that the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the former Communists) opposed any "shock measures" before the coming into force of the Defence Act. 24 CHASA also writes that BSP leader Zhan Videnov was against the dismissals. A signed commentary in TRUD analyzes the current situation in Bulgaria and concludes that a Pinochet-type dictator might fit quite well in this country. STANDART NEWS reports that the council discussed the financial and currency crisis. "Politicians and the president fell out over the foreign debt," it comments. It also maintains that Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev and BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva angrily left the session long before it was over. "The foreign debt issue is not to be settled at the Presidency; there is a government for that, and we are no presidential state," said Ms. Ananieva. [passage omitted]
