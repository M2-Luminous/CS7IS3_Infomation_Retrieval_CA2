The accord was reached when Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata met with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Chol-su, in Tokyo to attend the Japan-South Korean meeting of trade ministers. During the one-day, one-hour meeting, Hata said Tokyo will maximize its efforts to expand economic relations through further industrial cooperation with South Korean companies. The joint program is aimed at facilitating industrial restructuring in South Korea, especially among small companies, in an effort to narrow bilateral trade imbalance in favor of Japan, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) told a news conference. The program calls for regular studies of ways to encourage technological transfer from Japan to South Korea, promotion of human exchanges to reinforce technological foundations at small South Korean companies, and expanded marketing support of such companies by Japanese organs such as the Japan External Trade Organization. Japanese businesses will also be encouraged to step up direct investment in South Korea, the MITI official said. To that end, Japan will send study missions to Seoul and other South Korean cities, while South Korean delegations will visit Japan to lure prospective Japanese investors, the official said. The two countries will select small South Korean firms in "supporting" industries such as household electrical appliances parts, electronic components, general machine parts and auto parts. Selected companies will serve as model firms under the program, the MITI official said. Hata and Kim also discussed how to upgrade South Korea's investment conditions for foreign companies. Specifically, the MITI chief asked Seoul to remove measures that hamper smooth foreign investment, including a rule restricting activity of foreign trading houses. Kim replied Seoul will study the request positively, the MITI official said. Japan also will send its first investment study mission to South Korea this fall, the official said. Hata and Kim agreed to launch a joint working bilateral panel to enhance mutual cooperation in multimedia and other information-related areas. The joint program is in line with proposals made last March during the summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. Thursday's meeting was the third of its kind to be held between Japanese and South Korean trade ministers, following those in Tokyo in 1992 and in Seoul last year. Kim Chul-su arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day for a two-day stay, the first South Korean cabinet minister to visit Japan since the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed in late April.
