After 13 years of exile in France he has now decided to return to Gabon. Assane Diop met Max-Anicet Koumba, who is the leader of MORENA [Movement for National Recovery] in exile, and asked him to react to the multiparty presidential election of 5 December, which ended in the re-election of President Bongo. Here is Max-Anicet Koumba: [Begin recording] [Koumba] When one looks at the preparation for and the holding of the presidential election in Gabon, one has the impression that for several years now, and, more precisely, since 1990, the opposition has been content with playing a walk-on part within the institutions that were entrusted with preparing this election. Today, since the presidential election has taken place and the results are out, this is no longer a simulation, a polling operation, where one says so and so has come first, the first choice of the people, and such and such has come second. I believe that the verdict of the ballot box is out, it is known, the president of the Republic has been elected democratically in our country for once. Now it is for the losers, the unhappy rival candidates for presidential election, to acknowledge the result of this election. The technical part of the organization of the election was certainly not without imperfection, but basically the election took place and if there are any questions, they must be generalized. In other words, there must be an effort to check exhaustively the results of all the candidates, not just of a single candidate, but of all the candidates. [Diop] What do you think of President Bongo's proposal to involve all of the Gabonese political officials who so wish it in the running of the country? [Koumba] That is pointless. That is pointless in a democracy -- we are not obliged to operate and form a national unity government as if this was still the era of the single party. A president of the Republic has been elected. If he is confident in his election, then let him shoulder his responsibilities. I do not believe that it is useful to call on everyone to form a single party once again in the midst of democracy. If there is a majority, it is for this majority to shoulder its responsibilities and for the opposition to shoulder its own. [Diop] While honoring the law-based state? [Koumba] Yes, absolutely. [Diop] So, what do you think about the forming of a parallel government and of this parallel presidency taken on by Father Mba Abessole ? [Koumba] I would not venture even to comment on this initiative. I know quite simply that it is an imitation of the Gabonese Government in exile, which I myself had created here, of which I was the prime minister, the head of government. In an electoral stage, in the context of a democracy, this initiative seems to me to be stupid. It is politically stupid and legally reprehensible. [Diop] After your return to Gabon, where are you going to position yourself now within the political sphere? Where will you stand first of all with regard to the government of President Bongo? [Koumba] Before saying where I will position myself, I am going to begin by carrying out a tour of talks, because the problem today is clarifying the political situation in our country.
