Idiz] [Text] Public attention in Turkey may be focused elsewhere at the present time. But there are mounting signs of increasing cooperation between Turkey and Iran, especially, but not exclusively, in the security field which is an area of mutual concern for the two countries given the overall developments in the region that the two countries find themselves in. Ankara has at the same time been monitoring the gradually worsening economic situation in Iran. It has taken particular note of the fact that these difficulties have prompted this country's relatively liberal and certainly pragmatic President Hashemi-Rafsanjani in recent days to call on expatriate and particularly qualified Iranians around the world who have exiled themselves from their country. In a development that was unique as far as this country is concerned, Rafsanjani called on these expatriates to return home and contribute to the welfare of Iran. A high-level official in Ankara told TURKISH PROBE earlier this week that Ankara had no interest in exploiting these difficulties of Iran or seeing others exploit them. Quite to the contrary, he said it has always been the case that Turkey wants good political and economic ties with a stable Iran because it is important for key countries in the region like themselves to have a say in matters and developments pertaining to the region. "Turkey and Iran are two important countries in this part of the world that have parallel interests in many cases. This makes it necessary that they consult constantly and cooperate closely on a host of issues which they have a much closer insight into than countries from outside the region and from other parts of the world," this official said. One delicate subject that has required continued close consultation and cooperation between the two countries is, of course, that of Iraq. This subject is made even more delicate since Turkey is firmly within the Western camp in terms of many, if not all, of the factors concerning Iraq. Iran, with its deep antipathy for the West that it suspects so much is, of course, in a radically different category in this case. But both Turkey and Iran have nevertheless found common ground on one issue and have spelled out their views on this in clear terms. What they do not want to see is an independent Kurdistan in northern Iraq, where the political vacuum is still continuing, and where there is a semblance of stability only because of Western involvement in the region. But the West's overzealous involvement -- which Turkey is ironically but not illogically also a part of -- is also the cause of concern in both Ankara and Tehran that key countries in the West may be secretly planning to establish just such an independent Kurdistan. It was this fear that prompted Turkey and Iraq, together with Syria, to set up a tripartite consultative mechanism on northern Iraq at the level of foreign ministers in November 1992. All three countries have restive Kurdish minorities and are aware that developments in northern Iraq have close bearing on their vital interests given that there is always the possibility that these developments may spill over to their territory. In Turkey's case, of course, this fear has been amply justified given the developments in Southeastern Anatolia. Through this tripartite mechanism -- which was last activated in early February this year -- Turkey, Iran and Syria wanted to signal that they had a say in regional matters and that they would ensure that their influence was felt when it came to these matters. What they have been saying at the end of every meeting of the tripartite mechanism is, in effect, that no Kurdistan that is sandwiched between these three countries can hope to survive without endorsement from Ankara, Tehran and Damascus. But such tripartite cooperation between these countries also requires that bilateral cooperation is also enhanced among themselves if the three-way consultative mechanism they have set up is to really have any meaning and effect ultimately. This bilateral cooperation, however, is what has been elusive more often than not, especially in terms of Turkey's separate ties with Iran and Syria. This is also why some recent developments in ties with Iran that have not received much publicity are of importance for their broader implications. Until very recently there was a widespread belief in Turkish public opinion that Iran was one of the countries sponsoring the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is outlawed in Turkey where it has been waging a bloody separatist war. The belief was that with the latent tensions between the two countries because of their diametrically opposed systems -- Turkey being a secular parliamentary democracy and Iran being run by the Islamic Shariah law -- Tehran was using this as a card against Ankara. This belief has not completely disappeared as yet and crops up every now and again and is probably only dormant because the public's focus in Turkey is elsewhere at the moment. But an editorial in January in the English language TEHRAN TIMES -- which is known for its closeness to President Rafsanjani whose administration's views it is believed to express -- had given a clear intimation as to how Iran was beginning to see this whole Kurdish matter and particularly its place in it ties with Turkey. The editorial had suggested that the time had come for Turkey and Iran to combine their efforts to find a peaceful solution to their increasingly difficult problems with Kurdish minorities "Regional countries (should) set aside their differences and work out a practical peaceful solution to this common problem," it had said, adding that regional countries "should stop using the Kurdish card" against each other. It was significant that the TEHRAN TIMES editorial had come just prior to the February meeting on northern Iraq of the foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran and Iraq in Istanbul. It was also noteworthy at this time that neither of the sides allowed the death of nearly 20 Iranian villagers in February by stray cluster bombs from Turkish F-16 jets in a cross-border raid on the PKK's Zhalah camp in northern Iraq near the Iranian border to sully the positive atmosphere that was developing at that moment. Although initially angry at this development which led the Iranian press to lash out at Turkey, Tehran nevertheless conceded it had been a mistake, and Ankara for its part had agreed to provide compensation to the villagers' bereaved families. The matter was subsequently considered closed by both sides. The latest development in this ongoing positive climate that has been growing between the two countries was the returning by Iran to Turkey of PKK militants who had strayed to its territory following operations by the Turkish security forces in the Agri and Igdir regions. No precise date has been given by official sources in Turkey as to when this development had taken place; but the announcement earlier this week that a letter had been sent by Turkish Minister for Interior Nahit Mentese to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Besharati thanking him for this development indicates that the returning of the PKK militants took place very recently. Using noticeably sugary language, Mentese said that the returning of some members of the PKK to Turkey was "the expression of not just the cooperation on the question of security but also of the brotherly ties between the governments of the two countries." Expressing optimism that this positive development was just a harbinger of the further enhanced cooperation of the two countries on the security issue, Mentese ended his letter by thanking Mohammad Besharati for his personal contribution to this positive outcome and indicating his desire to see him in Turkey in the shortest possible time. Mehmet Agar, the Turkish chief of security, was reported as also having sent a letter to his Iranian counterpart prior to Mentese's letter to Besharati, expressing similar views and hopes for enhanced cooperation between the two countries in the security field. All of this appeared a concrete example of the new mood prevailing in Tehran that first started to reveal itself in late December 1993 when the Iranian Deputy President Hasan Habibi visited Ankara following a period of tension between the two countries over the PKK issue. It was also a far cry from what relations in the security cooperation area were just over a year ago when the then Minister for Interior Ismet Sezgin was accusing Tehran in so many words of supporting such Islamic terrorism in Turkey as the killing of Ugur Mumcu, a prominent investigative journalist and staunch upholder of Kemalism and in particular its principle of secularism. Iran, of course, had denied the charges levelled at it on this score, and the truth of the matter is that Ankara could come up with nothing that would stand up in court to substantiate its charges. The negative climate that had attended these developments had, however, prevailed for the better part of 1993 and had adversely affected relations between the two countries. The clouding of relations had happened at the very moment that the two countries needed strategic cooperation to help stabilize regional flash points, not just in Iraq, but also in the Caucasus, another part of the region where the two capitals have close interests and are watching the Armenian-Azeri conflict and the Russian position in this closely. Thus a breakthrough in the security field, such as the reported return of PKK members, portends well as far as the prospects of laying the groundwork for a more realpolitik approach by both Ankara and Tehran to each other. Officials in Ankara are adamant that Ankara always extended a warm hand to Iran but was hampered in the past because of what was considered by the Turkish public as tampering with Turkey's secularism and territorial integrity by Tehran. If there is now to be more genuine cooperation in the security field it is inevitable that this should lay the infrastructure for enhancement of overall relations between the two countries in other fields.
