The Secretary-general of the Office of Agricultural Economics, Pitiphong Phungbun na Ayutthaya, said the proposal was raised with the US Department of Agriculture at a recent meeting. Mr Pitiphong said the US has such an agreement with the European Union, China and Indonesia, and wants a similar one with Thailand because of the implications of the recent conclusion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Thailand is interested in the exchange programme, particularly with regard to the farm products of countries which have exchange agreements with the US. The agreement with the US will give Thailand access to information on farm products of these countries. Cooperation can begin immediately after negotiations are completed within three months. US agriculture officials will arrive for discussion with Mr Pitiphong in June after their trips to Indonesia. On a proposal of the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] agreement to include non-processed agricultural products in the agreement list, he said the office is in the process of informal discussion as there has been no official request yet for the inclusion. Should there be a formal request, a study must be conducted to gauge its long-term impact on the products, he said. If non-processed products are included in the AFTA list products which are subsidised will be affected because they will be uncompetitive.
