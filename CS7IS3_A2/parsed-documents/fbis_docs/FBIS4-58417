In a statement to AFP here, Hamas denounced the self-rule deal for Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which is due to be signed Wednesday in Cairo. The accord was "contrary to the wishes of the Palestinian people," the statement said. Hamas, which has its stronghold within the occupied territories, has claimed two recent suicide bombing attacks within Israel in which 13 Israelis were killed. The statement also rejected an accord on the future economic relations between the two sides signed in Paris on April 29, saying it was the start of "Zionist hegemony in the region."
