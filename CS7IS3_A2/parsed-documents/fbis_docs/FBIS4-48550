We have been informed by a diplomatic source that the Lusaka agreement will be signed on 6 June. One thing is certain: When Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos arrives in Portugal on 27 June, there will already be peace on paper. At the moment, the only remaining point at the talks is that of national reconciliation and at stake are the provinces of Huambo and Benguela. These are two provinces which the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] does not want to relinquish. For the moment, the government does not want to give in to this UNITA demand. Both the government and UNITA are now trying to gain ground in the military field.
