In his regular Sunday radio programme "Talks in Lany" Havel said that either the Senate had to be set up in compliance with the Constitution, or some other constitutional solution had to be found. He was reacting to the fact that the Chamber of Deputies failed on June 2 to pass a bill on elections to the Senate and to the Chamber, thus making senatorial elections planned for the autumn probably impossible. Elections to the Chamber are to be held in 1996. Reacting to Friday's [9 June] proposal from the coalition Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) on the division of the Senate's powers between the Chamber of Deputies, the president and possibly the government, Havel said: "Every additional power needs more work for my Office which already now would need more employees than it has. The question is what is correct." But he added that "the powers which the Senate was to have, must go somewhere." It would be logical if the president's right to return laws to the Chamber would be extended by the right to accompany the returned law with comments which the valid Constitution does not guarantee for him, Havel said.
