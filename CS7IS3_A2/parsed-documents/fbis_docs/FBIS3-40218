The causes of different results achieved by these two methods are discussed. The finite element method is used to simulate the thermal stress in FGM during its preparation. The consolidated rules for MgO/Ni FGM design postulation are obtained. Based on design results, progressive adjustments of powder technology properties are made. Consequently, MgO/Ni FGM is successfully sintered. Key words: Functionally gradient material, thermal stress, microstructure, design, preparation. 1. Introduction Metal/ceramic-system functionally gradient materials (FGMs) are new composite materials having applications potential in such high-tech fields as aerospace, nuclear energy, etc.[.sup]1[/] Whether they can eventually be put into practical application depends on the crucial elimination of fractures caused by the thermal stress induced from different gradient layer properties. MgO/Ni-system sintered bodies of various compositions are prepared by the powder spreading-filling method. Their basic property parameters for thermal-stress optimization design are measured. The causes of differences between these parameters and calculated values are discussed. Based on test data, the thermal stress induced during the MgO/Ni-system FGM (MgO/Ni FGM) preparation is simulated with the finite element method, and based on the consolidated analysis of the magnitudes and distributions of stresses, a principle of material structure and composition distribution is proposed. Guided by design results and considerations of such production technology factors as strengths of the transition layers and property data, as well as sintering shrinkage and densification conditions, MgO/Ni FGM plates are prepared. 2. Measurement and Evaluation of Property Parameters 2.1 Material System Selection and Preparation for Sintered Bodies of Different Compositions The MgO/Ni composite system is selected because of MgO ceramic's superior high-temperature stability, high-temperature basic vapor corrosion resistance, high-temperature insulation, etc. Additionally, the thermal expansion difference between MgO and nickel is small. The gradient combination of these two materials has high potential to be used as the inner-wall material for the ducts of magnetohydrodynamic generators.[.sup]2[/] The raw materials are MgO microfine powder and nickel carbonyl powder. Both materials have greater than 99.5 percent purity. The particle size for MgO is 0.3 �m; for nickel carbonyl powder, 5 �m. Each of the powder mixes of different MgO/Ni volume compositions is loaded in a separate pack and isostatically compacted under 100 MPa pressure. The pressed specimens are then sintered in 1.0 x 10[.sup]-2[/] Pa vacuum. Considering the nickel sintering temperature, we set the sintering conditions at 1300�C for 100 minutes. The sintered bodies are cut and polished for experimentation. 2.2 Properties of Sintered Specimens The specimen property parameters of six sintered compositions are measured. Their results are listed in the following table. Material Properties for Various MgO/Ni Mixture Volume Ratios Specimen No. A B C D E F Volume fraction of MgO 100 80 60 40 20 0 �/% Relative density 71 64 62 72 83 93 d[.sup]r[/]/% Young's modulus E/GPa 104 52 60 56 105 146 Bending strength 74 49 29 42 108 163 _s_[.sup]b[/]/MPa Poisson's ratio _n_ 0.16 0.18 0.27 0.26 0.26 0.35 Thermal expansion 12.8 12.9 13.5 14.3 14.5 15.1 coefficient _a_ x 10[.sup]6[/]/K[.sup]-1[/] The table shows that the bending strengths of the sintered specimens are closely related to their relative densities. The lowest relative density of specimen C corresponds to its lowest bending strength. In addition, among the three major property parameters for finite element simulation, only the thermal expansion coefficient _a_ has an approximately linear relationship with the volume fraction; the other two values, Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio _n_, obviously depend on the microstructure of the sintered specimens. Figure 1 shows the variation of the measured data of relative density and Young's modulus with the volume fraction of nickel. Figure 2 shows the variation of thermal expansion coefficient and Poisson's ratio with the volume fraction of nickel. For analytical convenience, the figures also contain the curves denoting the corresponding property changes with the changing of composition calculated from the micromechanical model of Wakashima.[.sup]3[/] When the nickel content is increased, the variation patterns of the calculated values and the experimental values of the sintered specimen's Young's modulus are similar, except at the point of 40-volume-percent nickel; besides, the calculated density variations correspond to the experimental variations. The calculated value of E is minimum at 60 volume percent of nickel; however, the fact that the experimental E is not minimum at 40 volume percent of nickel but higher than the E values of the two neighboring points indicates that Young's modulus is strengthened at this point. The strengthening characteristic also occurs in Poisson's ratio _n_. At the same point of 40-volume-percent nickel fraction, the value of _n_ is 0.27, which is also higher than the _n_ values of the two neighboring points. The phenomenon that material property parameter at a certain composition displays abnormal strengthening, which disagrees with the Wakashima equation, is caused by the exceptional sintered microstructure at that particular composition. Experiments show that specimens B, D, and E display typical dispersion structures, i.e., MgO as second phase disperses in the nickel matrix, or vice versa. However, the microstructure of specimen C is different, as it displays a geometric network structure with a continuous crisscross of nickel and MgO. This network structure strengthens E and _n_. Since Wakashima's model is based on the sparse-dispersion micro-geometrical structure, it cannot describe the properties of materials with network structures. Figure 1.

Thermal Stress Simulation and Structural Design 3.1 Computed Model The computed model uses the prepared disk specimen, 6mm thick and 30mm in diameter, which is sliced into 15 layers according to the composition. The specimen is cooled to room temperature from 1000�C. The measured properties are used as model parameters. The properties of the intermediate gradient layers are obtained through interpolations of the tested data. A power function is used to describe the volume fraction variations of different gradient layers. The composition distribution curves from different indices P are expressed by the equation C = (x/d)[.sup]P[/];[.sup]4[/] where d is the total thickness of each gradient layer, x is the position coordinate of any gradient layer, and P is the distribution index which determines the configuration of the composition distribution curve C. At the plate's 1/4 cross section, we make the finite-element network partitions, and assign different composition distribution indices accordingly, then simulate the thermal stress in the specimen with the finite element method. 3.2 Analysis of Computed Results In the computation, the P value varies from 0.6 to 2.8. The results show that a distinct thermal relaxation effect occurs for any FGM composition distribution, and the maximum stress boundary moves toward the nickel-rich side. When P = 0.6, the maximum radial stress component _s_[.sup]rr[/] is 96 MPa, which indicates a thermal stress relaxation rate of 35 percent, as compared with the thermal stress of the double-layered Ni-MgO FGM (NFGM); when P = 1.8, the relaxation rate is as high as 70 percent. Figure 3 shows the variation of the maximum _s_[.sup]zz[/], _s_[.sub]rr[/], and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] with the P values. All three stresses have minimum values in the areas of P variations and all appear in the neighborhood of P = 1.8. Comparatively speaking, the axial stress _s_[.sup]zz[/] is very small, about 1/4 of the radial stress _s_[.sup]rr[/] and the ring stress _s_[.sup]_th__th_[/]. This is due to the fact that for the FGM specimens of this experiment, the ratio of the gradient thickness to the diameter is 0.13. Large axial stress cannot be induced from this small thickness-to-diameter ratio.[.sup]4[/] Therefore, the FGM structural design must take _s_[.sup]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] as the main control stresses. Figure 3 shows that the _s_ value is minimum when P = 1.6 to 1.8. Whether this P value would provide the best design will be discussed later in this paper. Figure 4 shows the variation of maximum stress location center with index P (in the graph, h is the distance from the center line to the pure nickel side). Figure 4 also shows the corresponding FGM gradient layer to the Figure 3. Maximum Thermal Stresses vs. Various Compositional Distribution Power maximum stress location. We can see that the location of the maximum stress changes with the P value. After the P value reaches 1.2, the location of the maximum stress center drops sharply; as the P value continuously increases the maximum stress center moves downward and approaches the model's symmetrical center line. The right coordinate of Figure 4 shows that the center line is located at the layer with 40 percent of MgO, which is the weaker section (measured value is 42 MPa) of the gradient material. Comparing with Figure 3, we can see that even when P = 1.8, the stress is at the minimum value of 40 MPa; this minimum value is very close to the allowable material strength; hence, the failure would naturally occur at the center line of the radial direction. When P = 1.0, the maximum stress center occurs at 0.8 h, which is the straight nickel layer. Referring to both Figure 3 and Figure 4, although _s_[.sup]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] are comparatively high (about 60 MPa), they are still far below the actual test strength (163 MPa) of the straight nickel layer. Besides, the computed stress diagram also shows that when the P value changes, even though the straight ceramic side is generally under compressive stress, a tensile symptom still displays at the neighborhood of the circumference of 0.9 R (R is the radius of the round FGM plate) on the horizontal surface and the axial direction of the ceramic side. The tensile stress, however small (especially _s_[.sup]zz[/]), should be included in the analysis. As shown in Figure 5, the local tensile stress on the straight ceramic side at P = 1.6 is minimum. When P = 1.8, the local tensile stress _s_[.sup]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] are both smaller than 40 MPa, which is far smaller than the allowable measured strength. Figure 4. Maximum Stress Location vs. Various Compositional Distribution Power; h is a half thickness of the sample Figure 5. Tensile Stresses in the Part of MgO-Side vs. Various Distribution Power In conclusion, even the composition distribution index P that represents the best thermal stress relaxation effect cannot completely reflect the correct structural control parameters. All the following three conditions must be considered: (1) the target P value which represents the minimum thermal stress; (2) the adjusted P value so that the location of thermal stress occurs as close to the metallic side as possible; (3) whether the corresponding P value would induce a tensile stress far smaller than the allowable strength on the straight ceramic side. Based on these considerations, the best FGM design can be obtained and the FGM material composition distribution can be determined. This is the basic principle of structural design to avoid fractures in the FGM during its preparation. Based on the above, the design outcome is P = 1.0. 4. Preparation of Functionally Gradient Materials MgO/Ni FGMs are prepared according to the design result P = 1.0. Fifteen layers of MgO/Ni powder of different compositions are piled by the layer-filling technique, then the green compacts are either vacuum sintered, or hot-pressing (HP) sintered. 4.1 Adjustment of Compacting and Sintering of Powder Mix During vacuum FGM sintering, in the periods of temperature rising, sintering, and cooling, the compacts are not constrained by any external forces. Therefore, adjustments of the compacting property and the sintering property are possible, which is particularly important for a defect-free specimen. In this experiment, two different types of MgO powder, both mixed with 0.5 weight percent of Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder, are used. One is fluffy microfine powder decomposed from Mg(OH)[.sup]2[/]. The average particle size is about 0.3 �m. The other is fine powder thermally decomposed from MgSO[.sup]4[/]-7H[.sub]2[/]O. The average particle size is about 3 �m. When the mixes are made of exclusively 0.3 �m fluffy powder and nickel powder, the variation of compacting densities and sintering shrinkages with the MgO composition is as shown in Figure 6. Because of the considerable variations among the specimen compact densities (especially in the straight ceramic specimens, the differences between the axial pressed compacts and the compacts further treated with 100 MPa cold isostatic pressing are very wide), and the relatively low final straight ceramic compact density, stress-induced cracks frequently occur on the straight ceramic side of the laminated compacts. To solve this problem, 15 to 35 weight percent of large-particle (d = 3 �m) MgO powder is added. The addition of large-particle MgO powder increases the MgO compact density, and also reduces the shrinkage differences among the sintered specimens. The previous table shows that the densification rates of all specimens used in structural designs are fairly low with high degrees of porosity, which is mainly affected by the sintering parameters and densification technique. To meet the sintering temperature of nickel powder and reduce the densification sintering temperature of MgO so that the sintering properties of nickel powder and MgO become compatible, about 0.5 weight percent of Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder is added.[.sup]5[/] After this treatment, almost all the specimen relative densities reach 90 percent after sintering at 1320�C for 2.5 hours. Figure 6. Formation Density and Sintering Shrinkage for MgO/Ni Mixtures After the aforementioned adjustments, the green compacts of various compositions are used to determine the sintering shrinkage rate changes from room temperature up to 1250�C at a constant temperature increasing rate. The results are shown in Figure 7. For all but the straight MgO specimen, the sintering shrinking rate increases with the increase of nickel content, but the difference of the shrinkage magnitudes between any two neighboring specimens is small. Basically, a balance of the sintering shrinkages is achieved. The straight MgO specimen contains about 70 weight percent of microfine powder, and produces an uncoordinated shrinking situation with its neighboring layers. During the FGM's actual lamination, compaction, and sintering, the straight nickel side has a higher compaction density due to isostatic cold pressing. Hence the diameter of the ceramic side is larger than that of the straight metal side (by about 6 percent). However, the ``uncoordinated'' shrinkage offsets the existing dimension difference during compaction, and eventually a uniform FGM specimen is prepared. In conclusion, quality FGM can only be made according to the Figure 7. Sintering Shrinkage of MgO/Ni Mixtures With Various Mixing Ratios basic structural design principles when the preparation conditions such as powder particle size, additives, compact deformation, sintering shrinkage, etc. are adjusted and controlled in coordinated fashion. 4.2 Preparation of FGM Two FGM disc specimens of the MgO/Ni system with about 6mm thickness, and diameters of 24mm and 30mm are made by vacuum sintering and HP sintering, respectively. The vacuum sintering parameters are as follows: 1320�C, 2.5 hours, and 1 x 10[.sup]-2[/] Pa vacuum; and the HP sintering parameters: 1300�C, 28 MPa pressing pressure, and 1 hour. Figure 8 shows the prepared specimens. During the HP sintering, the pressure is released at about 1000�C, and MgO displays high-temperature plastic deformation,[.sup]6[/] hence, the thermal stress is sufficiently relaxed in the course of HP sintering to pressure releasing. Therefore, the specimen prepared by HP sintering has a larger diameter and no surface defects. Figure 8. MgO/Ni FGM Samples Prepared by Different Sintering Methods 5. Conclusions (1) The experimental method and the micromechanical model are used to measure and calculate the property parameters of the sintered bodies of the MgO/Ni system with various compositions. The results show that the specimen's sintering strength is mainly controlled by porosity; the coefficient of thermal expansion follows a quasi-linear variation; and Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are strengthened at 40 volume percent of nickel content. The implication is that Wakashima's micromechanical model cannot yet truthfully describe the micro-network structure of the sintered body. (2) The thermal stress simulation of a FGM model with a thickness-to-diameter ratio of 0.13 shows that compared with NFGM, FGM clearly has a thermal stress relaxation effect, and the maximum stress boundary layer moves significantly toward the metal side. The degree of relaxation depends on the distribution index P. The minimum values of the three major stress components occur when P = 1.8 (when the stress relaxation is 70 percent). (3) However, the best material structural design condition is not when P = 1.8. When factors such as the structural location of the maximum stress, the strength of the gradient layer at the same location of the maximum stress, and furthermore, the tensile strength of the straight ceramic side are considered, the best combined design condition for MgO/Ni FGM is when P = 1.0. (4) Based on P = 1.0, when factors such as raw-material particle size, sintering properties, and the balance between compact contraction and sintering shrinkage are adjusted, FGM of the MgO/Ni system without macroscopical surface defect can be prepared by vacuum sintering and HP sintering methods.
