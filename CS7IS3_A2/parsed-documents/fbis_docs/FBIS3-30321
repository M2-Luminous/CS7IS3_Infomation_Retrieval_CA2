In an interview with the correspondent of MTI and Hungarian Radio, Jeszenszky said that talks went beyond the expectations of cautious optimism. The leaders of Serbia and Yugoslavia are ready to fulfil the wishes of the international community, yet how these are realized in Sarajevo and Bosnia is a different matter. "It is even more important for us that not merely the readiness, but the will also exists to improve and settle bilateral relations on the part of both sides, and this can take place amidst the current upholding of sanctions. The end of sanctions, after fulfilling the requirements of the international community, is in the interest of all," Jeszenszky said. "There were talks about high-level negotiations, but the priority now is practical steps. Serbian President Milosevic reported on the situation of Hungarians in Vojvodina, and I am curious to see how the promises are fulfilled in the future. This theme is on the agenda of talks between Serbian leadership and Vojvodina Hungarians, however, I indicated that the legitimate representatives of the Vojvodina Hungarians enjoy the support of the Hungarian Government," Foreign Minister Jeszenszky said. Speaking to MTI, president of the Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina, Andras Agoston, said the meeting held with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic forms part of a series of consultations which have not yet been concluded. "This means quite a lot for us, as on the one hand they recognize us as a political factor, and on the other, we can show a responsible approach to Yugoslav politics," Agoston said. In his statement, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stressed that a political and psychological turn had taken place in the Hungarian-Yugoslav talks, which should lead to the stabilization of relations, to normalization, and ultimately bring peace to the entire region. "Agreement was reached on numerous issues, and we must immediately implement these in order to be able to regard these talks as genuinely historical later on. Talks covered all essential topics, stressing there is a mutual intention for the sanctions to be lifted, and for us to prepare expanding relations. We agreed to eliminate all phenomena which could threaten this process," Jovanovic said.
