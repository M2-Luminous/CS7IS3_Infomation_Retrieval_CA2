The works of the Crans Montana Forum conference in Bucharest have offered the opportunity for a useful meeting between Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat and have increased the chances for peace in one of the most blood-stained zones of the world, said President Ion Iliescu. To a question whether the contacts among the sides of the conflict in former Yugoslavia were bringing hopes as much encouraging, the Romanian president underlined the fact that Bucharest had enabled the Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian representatives to get informed with the opinions of the international community about this conflict but also to have contacts meant to get closer the divergent views. "I had contacts with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, with the president of the Parliament of Croatia, Stipe Mesic and with the foreign minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Irfan Ljubijankic. I have convinced myself that this conflict is not an ethnic conflict and I have made all the efforts to convince the sides to sit at the negotiations table. I have succeeded to ease way for contacts, except for Stipe Mesic who said he had no mandate to meet Jovanovic. The mere fact that part of the players on the Yugoslav scene have meet and discussed is a gain facilitated by Bucharest for the cause of peace in former Yugoslavia," said President Iliescu.
