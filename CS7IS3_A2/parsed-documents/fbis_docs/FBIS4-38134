These instructions urge all doctors to comply with the new charges, which range from 50 to 100 dinars for a specialized doctor and from 25 to 50 dinars for a practitioner. Dr. Nayif al-Hassuni, head of the Doctors Union, said that these measures by the union came at the instructions of the Council of Ministers to ease the burdens of the citizens. The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH has followed the issue of charges for medical examinations in private clinics and noticed that these charges rose in conflict with the citizens' standard of living, especially for employees with low incomes. In a number of cases, these charges exceeded 500 dinars, when it used to be only 10 dinars. The paper also noticed that the rise in the charges is due to imposing additional charges, including charges for testing blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiography. [passage omitted]
