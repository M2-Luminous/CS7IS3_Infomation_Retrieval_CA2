By the end of 1992, 30 provinces and cities had reported a total of over 800,000 VD patients. In 1992 alone some 200,000 cases were notified, an increase of 13.79 percent over the previous year. In addition, by the end of November 1993, 1,159 AIDS patients and individuals infected with the HIV virus had been found in 22 provinces and cities. Mainlanders made up 948 cases, with the rest being foreigners and overseas Chinese. Out of the 19 full-blown AIDS patients, 14 have died. The incidence of VD and AIDS patients or HIV carriers is most serious in coastal or border provinces and regions such as Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Hainan and Guangxi. However, in recent years, inland provinces which are economically advanced or experiencing tourism booms, like Hunan, Hubei and Sichuan, have also witnessed rapid increases in these afflictions. The spread of VD and AIDS on the mainland has disturbed and worried people. The media has generally attributed the rapid spread of AIDS to the influx of foreigners into a more open China plus the internal floating population. In reality, China's younger generation, affected by unhealthy foreign thinking and at variance with traditional concepts about sexual behavior, constitutes the more dangerous internal factor. In 1992, Shanghai held a comprehensive survey on psychology and morals among people aged between 20 and 55. To the question "Are you in favor of a woman developing sexual relationships with several men?" the responses varied according to generation. More younger people said yes. In 1991, the China Union Medical College Hospital conducting a survey on taxi drivers and hotel attendants in a Beijing district. Some 13.6 percent of the drivers and 3.4 percent of the attendants admitted to more than one sexual partner. About 16.6 percent of the former and 41.9 percent of the latter had desires for more sexual partners. New concepts have led to disastrous consequences. Surveys on 16 large and medium-sized cities indicate the annual increase rate for VD in recent years reached 45.63 percent. The number of Chinese HIV carriers infected through sexual contact rose to 20 percent. The press, sociologists and medicos have made an appeal that in the coming new year priority be given to extensive publicity and education on VD and AIDS prevention, and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Various approaches should be applied to publicize the influence brought by VD and AIDS on individuals, families, children and society, to foster public awareness of protection measures and morality, so that people become neither VD sufferers nor spreaders.
