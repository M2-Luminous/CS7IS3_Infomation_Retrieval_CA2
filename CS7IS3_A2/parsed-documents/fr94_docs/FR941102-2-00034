FR941102-2-00034 FR941102-2-00023 Pursuant to 18 CFR 385.211, protests and comments will be considered by the DOE in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene under 18 CFR 385.214. Section 385.214 requires that a petition to intervene must state, to the extent known, the position taken by the petitioner and the petitioner's interest in sufficient factual detail to demonstrate either that the petitioner has a right to participate because it is a State Commission; that it has or represents an interest which may be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding, including any interest as a consumer, customer, competitor, or a security holder of a party to the proceeding; or that the petitioner's participation is in the public interest. A final decision will be made on this application after a determination is made by the DOE that the proposed action will not impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. Before an export authorization may be issued, the environmental impacts of the proposed DOE action (i.e., granting the export authorization, with any conditions and limitations, or denying it) must be evaluated pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Copies of this application will be made available, upon request, for public inspection and copying at the address provided above. Issued in Washington, DC, on October 27, 1994. Anthony J. Como, Director, Office of Coal & Electricity, Office of Fuels Programs, Office of Fossil Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27191 Filed 11&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450-01-P
