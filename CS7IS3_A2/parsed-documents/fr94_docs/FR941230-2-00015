Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on April 3, 1987, as amended, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive directs you to prohibit entry of certain cotton, wool and man-made fiber textiles and textile products and silk blend and other vegetable fiber apparel, produced or manufactured in the Philippines for which the Government of the Philippines has not issued an appropriate visa. The Government of the Philippines has notified the United States Government that it will reduce the size of its current export visa stamp. Effective on January 1, 1995, you are directed to amend the April 3, 1987 directive to provide for the use of the new visa stamp to accompany shipments of textile and apparel products, produced or manufactured in the Philippines and exported from the Philippines on and after January 1, 1995. Goods produced or manufactured in the Philippines and exported from the Philippines during the period January 1, 1995 through January 31, 1995 shall be permitted entry if accompanied by either the old or new visa stamp. Merchandise exported from the Philippines on and after February 1, 1995 which is not accompanied by the new visa stamp shall be denied entry. A facsimile of the new visa stamp is enclosed with this letter. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). Sincerely, Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;32178 Filed 12&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DR&hyph;F
