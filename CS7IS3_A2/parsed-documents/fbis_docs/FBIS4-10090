FBIS4-10090 "drlat067_p_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-067 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 Ecuador Privatization To Resume Under New Council President Privatization To Resume Under New Council President PA0604134694 Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 4 Apr 94 PA0604134694 Quito Voz de los Andes Spanish BFN [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] [Text] Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen has sworn in banker Marcel Laniado as new president of the National Council of Modernization, Conam. This institution will oversee the privatization process. It is expected that with this appointment Ecuador will embark on an aggressive state modernization process by reactivating the sale of state-run companies. This process lost steam in the past few months, as Conam has not had a president since mid-1993. Laniado said that a common effort must be made to achieve our nation's social and economic well-being. Laniado noted it is impossible to develop unless all the community's sectors participate. He thus stressed: I invite you all to cooperate. The government will submit the rules of the State Modernization Law approved in December 1993 by the Congress after an eight-month study. Conam was created in 1992 at the conservative government's initiative. But is has been in serious crisis since the resignation of its board of directors last year. [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2335 GMT on 4 April, in a Quito-datelined report on the same topic, adds: "Finance Minister Cesar Robalino announced that the first state-run company to be privatized will be the telecommunications company (Emetel), a public sector giant. Defense Minister Jose Gallardo gave the assurance that while companies operated by the Armed Forces are diverse, the military will agree to any required sales. Also in line to be privatized are important petroleum and energy companies considered strategic by previous governments."]
