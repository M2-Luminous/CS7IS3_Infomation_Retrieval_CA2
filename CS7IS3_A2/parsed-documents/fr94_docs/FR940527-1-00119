FR940527-1-00119 FR940527-1-00014 Pursuant to section 1886(d)(5)(A)(iv) of the Act, we calculated outlier thresholds so that estimated outlier payments equal 5.1 percent of estimated DRG payments. In conjunction with the elimination of the rural standardized amount, we considered raising the proportion of operating payments estimated to be paid as outliers from 5.1 percent to 5.5 percent. This is the percentage offset that currently applies to the urban standardized amounts and is in the middle of the 5 to 6 percent range for outlier payments required by statute. Raising the proportion of operating payments paid as outliers would reduce the financial risk to hospitals in treating outlier cases. However, financing 5.5 percent in outlier payments would require reducing the average standardized amounts by 5.5 percent. We welcome comments on this issue. The model that we use to determine the outlier thresholds necessary to target our desired outlier payment percentage for FY 1995 uses the FY 1993 MedPAR file and the most recent available information on hospital-specific payment parameters (such as the cost-to-charge ratios). This information is based on the January 1994 update of the provider-specific file used in the PRICER program. In estimating payments we convert billed charges to costs for purposes of estimating cost outlier payments. As we explained in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46347), prior to FY 1994, we used a charge inflation factor to adjust charges to costs; beginning with FY 1994, we are currently using a cost inflation factor to estimate costs. In other words, instead of inflating the FY 1993 charge data by a charge inflation factor for 2 years in order to estimate FY 1995 charge data and then applying the cost-to-charge ratio, we adjust the charges by the cost-to-charge ratio and then inflate the estimated costs for 2 years of cost inflation. In this manner, we will be automatically adjusting for any changes in the cost-to-charge ratios that may occur, since the relevant variable is the costs estimated for a given case. In setting the proposed FY 1995 outlier thresholds, we used a cost inflation factor of 1.04735. This is the average increase in cost per case between PPS&hyph;7 (data from cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1990) and PPS&hyph;9 (data from cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1992), for a matched set of hospitals. We made an audit adjustment for any cost report that had not been settled, based on the average ratio between submitted and final cost report data. This adjustment was made separately for Medicare inpatient capital costs and Medicare inpatient operating costs. We used the actual settlement ratio for PPS&hyph;7 (data from cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1990), since most cost reports for that period had been settled. We also used the settlement ratio from PPS&hyph;7 for the PPS&hyph;8 cost reports, since the PPS&hyph;8 settlement ratio currently available is based on many fewer hospitals (approximately 37 percent, as opposed to 92 percent for PPS&hyph;7). When we modeled the combined operating and capital outlier payments, we found that using a common set of thresholds resulted in a higher percentage of outlier payments for capital-related costs than for operating costs. We estimate the proposed thresholds for FY 1995 would result in outlier payments equal to 5.1 percent of operating DRG payments and 6.3 percent of capital payments based on the Federal rate. As stated in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46348), we have established outlier thresholds that would be applicable to both inpatient operating costs and inpatient capital-related costs. As explained earlier, we will apply a reduction of approximately 5.1 percent to the FY 1995 standardized amounts to account for the proportion of PPS payments paid to outliers. The proposed outlier adjustment factors applied to the standardized amounts and the capital Federal rate for FY 1995 are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Operating standardized amounts 1Capital federal rate 0.948772 0.9372 We would apply the proposed outlier adjustment factors after removing the effects of the FY 1994 outlier adjustment factors on the standardized amounts and the capital Federal rate. ii. Other Changes Concerning Outliers. Table 5 of section V of this addendum contains the DRG relative weights, geometric and arithmetic mean lengths of stay, as well as the day outlier threshold for each DRG. When we recalibrate DRG weights, we set a threshold of 10 cases as the minimum number of cases required to compute a reasonable weight and geometric mean length of stay. DRGs that do not have at least 10 cases are considered to be low volume DRGs. For the low volume DRGs, we use the original geometric mean lengths of stay, because no arithmetic mean length of stay was calculated based on the original data. Table 8a in section V of this addendum contains the updated Statewide average operating cost-to-charge ratios for urban hospitals and for rural hospitals to be used in calculating cost outlier payments for those hospitals for which the intermediary is unable to compute a reasonable hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio. These Statewide average ratios would replace the ratios published in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46439), effective October 1, 1994. Table 8b contains comparable Statewide average capital cost-to-charge ratios. These average ratios would be used to calculate cost outlier payments for those hospitals for which the intermediary computes operating cost-to-charge ratios lower than 0.279 or greater than 1.314 and capital cost-to-charge ratios lower than 0.013 or greater than 0.241. This range represents 3.0 standard deviations (plus or minus) from the mean of the log distribution of cost-to-charge ratios for all hospitals. The cost-to-charge ratios in Tables 8a and 8b would be applied to all hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios based on cost report settlements occurring during FY 1995. iii. FY 1993 and FY 1994 Outlier Payments. In the May 26, 1993 proposed rule (58 FR 30271), we estimated that actual FY 1993 outlier payments would be approximately 4.5 percent of actual FY 1993 total DRG payments. We also estimated that total DRG payments for FY 1993 would be higher than estimated at the time that we set the FY 1993 outlier thresholds. Our estimates of actual outlier payments and actual total DRG payments were computed by simulating payments using actual FY 1993 bill data available at the time. Our current estimate is that actual FY 1993 outlier payments were approximately 4.1 percent of total DRG payments. At the same time, we estimate that FY 1993 total DRG payments per case were 1.6 percent higher than we estimated when we set the FY 1993 outlier thresholds (1.9 percent higher if indirect teaching and disproportionate share payments are included). These estimates are based on simulations using the January 1994 update of the provider-specific file and the December 31, 1993 update of the MedPAR file. In our June 4, 1992 proposed rule (57 FR 23645), we discussed several factors that could explain the difference between estimated outlier payments and actual outlier payments, relative to total DRG payments. With regard to FY 1993 outlier payments, we note that the percentage increase in the Medicare case-mix index was 0.8 percent between FY 1992 and FY 1993, which was a lower rate of increase than for prior years. Although the case-mix index is not a factor in setting the outlier thresholds, lower growth in FY 1993 indicates that the average severity of a Medicare case increased less in FY 1993 than in prior years. We also believe that use of a charge inflation factor in setting the FY 1993 outlier thresholds may account for some of the difference. As we explained in our June 4, 1992 proposed rule, charges have historically grown faster than costs. In setting thresholds for FY 1993, we used the most recently available Medicare data, but that data contained 2-year old cost-to-charge ratios. Thus, the cost-to-charge ratios used to set the FY 1993 outlier thresholds are higher than those used to determine payments. Consequently, actual FY 1993 outlier payments as a percent of actual total DRG payments may be lower than we estimated when setting outlier thresholds.
