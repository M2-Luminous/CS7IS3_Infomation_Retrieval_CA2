FBIS4-27628 "dreas106_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 26 May 1994 South Korea Government To Reexamine Policy on DPRK Government To Reexamine Policy on DPRK SK2705011094 Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean 26 May 94 p 1 SK2705011094 Seoul HANGUK ILBO Korean BFN [By Reporter Choe Kyu-sik] [Text] It was learned on 25 May, that our government will conduct an overall reexamination of its policy toward the North in connection with North Korea's nuclear development, thereby readjusting our position toward "the declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." The government has worked out such a policy under circumstances in which the prevailing opinion is that "the declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" has virtually become scrap paper because North Korea possesses a nuclear reprocessing facility referred to as a radiochemical laboratory, in Yongbyon, and in preparation against the eventuality that might be created if North Korea is revealed to have already developed two or three nuclear bombs following the measurement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt atomic reactor. In this connection, at the Foreign Affairs-National Unification Committee of the National Assembly on 23 May, Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for national unification, said: "If North Korea should continue to maintain the radiochemical laboratory, which is known to be a nuclear reprocessing facility, we cannot but reevaluate the declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula from a new angle." The government is going to focus on the question raised by Deputy Prime Minister Yi at the Unification-National Security Policy Coordination meeting to be held on 27 May before making public a new government position. Prior to this meeting, the government is said to also be undertaking a working-level policy finetuning procedure by convening a strategic planning team meeting for unification and national security composed of chiefs of relevant agencies' offices and bureaus on 26 May. One high-ranking government official said: "Deputy Prime Minister Yi's remarks are based on a basic principle, but his remarks are loaded with meaning. The government is of the opinion that it should lay a clearer and more detailed policy before the public this time. Now is not, however, the time to declare the nullification of the declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. His remarks emphasize ensuring the nuclear transparency of North Korea. The government also needs to send out a strong warning message to North Korea for its on-going nuclear development. The United States has the position that the special inspections of North Korea's nuclear development should be settled at the third round of North-U.S. high-level talks. We cannot rule out the possibility that even if North Korea is revealed to already possess two or three nuclear bombs, the United States will not be able to do anything because of its adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty system. We need to readjust our position in preparation against this situation."
