After the Ukrainian Parliament ratified, with reservations, START-1, Russian specialists, in fact, refused to provide technical maintenance of SS-19 warheads, including the supply of hydrogen absorbers. The Ukrainian leadership has been driven into a corner. The West and Russia continue putting pressure upon Ukraine, demanding that it become a nuclear-free state as soon as possible and unconditionally. Time works against Ukraine. As is known, after a certain period of storage, missile warheads become dangerously explosive and are not subject to dismantling. This is perfectly well understood in Russia. However, in the Kremlin, an openly temporizing position has been taken, until the condition of the SS-19's approaches critical. Then, Moscow will be able to count upon Ukrainian missiles without any compensation. Accordingly, Russia will be able to dictate its own terms: Either it accepts all missiles (together with solid- propellant SS-24) or none. Kiev is definitely lacking the initiative. It could, for example, make a good-will gesture by offering Moscow some of the SS- 19 warheads in exchange for fuel for nuclear reactors. In this situation, there remains, perhaps, a last step that Kiev could take. Without waiting for assistance from Moscow, it may hand over to Washington (or to some other interested party, for example, China) the right to the dismantled liquid-propellant missiles, after receiving guarantees and monetary compensation. This will not be at variance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, if we deal with members of the ``nuclear club.'' (The treaty bans such actions only with regard to nonnuclear states). In such a case, Moscow would see that the problem may also be resolved without it. In turn, the Pentagon would get a unique chance to study Soviet missile technology. This step is inadmissible from the point of view of Russian security. However, to all appearances, only in this way the Kremlin politicians may become more compliant with regard to compensation and assistance. Even though, theoretically, this is a perfectly possible development of events, there arise many practical questions in the ``American'' variant.
