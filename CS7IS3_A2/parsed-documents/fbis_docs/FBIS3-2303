This is beyond question, and no force can stop us from achieving this objective. Zhou Nan said: We are now in an important period for the country to carry out reform and opening up and establish the socialist market economy. Some major reform measures will be introduced. We hope to solicit opinions through these "two sessions" and correctly handle the relations between development, stability, and reform. In addition, we will further carry out the policy of "doing two types of work simultaneously," namely, we will pay attention to material and spiritual civilizations and to the formation of the democratic and legal systems to enable the country's economic modernization to embark on a healthy track. One of the two reporters asked if the Hong Kong issue would become a hot topic at the "two sessions." Zhou Nan said he believed that Premier Li Peng's government work report would refer to the Hong Kong issue, that the Hong Kong NPC deputies and members as well as the mainland NPC deputies and members will make some comments on the Hong Kong situation, and that, to express state and popular intentions, the NPC and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will, of course, respond to this issue.
