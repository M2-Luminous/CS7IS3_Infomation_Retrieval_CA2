Replying to questions by our correspondent, Cetin pointed out that all weapons outside Sarajevo must be under UN control within the next few hours. Otherwise, he said, NATO must intervene. Cetin said he had a telephone conversation with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic this afternoon. He pointed out that 20 percent of the Serbs' heavy weapons have not been placed under UN control yet, and that there are reports that some of the weapons are being taken to residential areas. The latter constitute a potential danger, Cetin said, and must be placed under UN control with the other weapons. Cetin recalled that Turkey, a NATO member, has been saying for the past 22 months that a limited air operation would be a first step toward the solution of the problem. The latest developments justify our position, he stressed.
