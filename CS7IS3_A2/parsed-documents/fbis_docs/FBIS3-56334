Viktor Yerin, Russian minister of internal affairs, met Moshe Shahal, Israeli minister of police, energy and infrastructure. As a result, a protocol was signed on talks about cooperation between the two ministries on combatting international crime. Our correspondent Georgiy Sovtsov reports. [Sovtsov] The main themes of the protocol are the prevention of crime in the sphere of law enforcement, public safety, the prevention of the illegal narcotics trade with the cooperation of police forces at lower levels. Viktor Yerin, the Russian minister, confirmed that at present work is being actively conducted to conclude a full-scale agreement between Russia and Israel, but as this is being done at government level, the two countries' police ministers can for now sign only the present protocol. Viktor Yerin also stressed that the restoration of diplomatic and economic relations with Israel made it necessary to draw closer on questions of operational and criminal pursuit work and there are cases of this happening already; for example, in 1993 Israeli police seized over 100 kg of narcotics. Moshe Shahal cited one of the points of this protocol, on confirming the posts of liaison officers under the ministers of each country to provide operational information. Israel has already established such relations with the United States, France, Turkey, Ukraine, and Russia. Asked whether a Russian mafia existed in Israel, Mr. Shahal replied that the level of crime among former emigrants from Russia and other CIS countries was no different from those living permanently in Israel.
