How does the Palestinian side view the [Israeli] Government's decision in this regard? [Al-Husayni] First, I believe this decision came too late. It was unnecessary to commit the [Hebron] massacre in order to make such a decision. In any case, to make such a decision--no matter how late--is better than not to make any decision. However, what is more important than making this decision is implementing it, and figuring out how to do it. Will this actually be a battle against all these settlers who are opposed to the peace process and the idea of peace, or will its implementation be confined to those whose membership in Kakh is confirmed? [Mu'addi] What can be done immediately to ease the tension prevailing in the Palestinian streets in the wake of this incident? [Al-Husayni] First, I believe that the settlers residing in Hebron should be evacuated. In addition, arrangements should be made to protect the Palestinian people's security. Such arrangements should include the issue of arming the settlers everywhere. We believe that these settlers should be disarmed, and that the army, and not the settlers, should maintain security, especially since many of these settlers engaged in settlement activities from the very beginning in order to achieve a single objective; namely, to foil this political process. We also believe that the file of settlements should be opened at the negotiating table because this directly concerns the Palestinian people's security. This issue should thus be discussed. Discussions should not be confined to the Israeli people's security, as was the case in the past. [Mu'addi] Do you believe that Israeli-Palestinian negotiations may resume next week in light of the intensive consultations and contacts in Tunis, Washington, and Jerusalem? [Al-Husayni] In fact, it depends on the practices on the ground in terms of evacuating the settlers and releasing the Palestinian detainees. All these issues, together, can pave the way for the resumption of negotiations. I believe it is almost impossible to resume negotiations without making any kind of implementation on the ground. [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni: Thank you very much, and many happy returns ['Id greetings]. [Al-Husayni] Same to you.
