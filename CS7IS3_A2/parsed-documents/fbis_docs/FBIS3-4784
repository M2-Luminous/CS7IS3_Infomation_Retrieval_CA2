However, Foreign Trade Department director-general Oranut Osathanon said she believed that the prospects looked bright for the next round of talks. Ms Oranut last week led the Thai delegation for the second round of negotiations with the US textiles negotiating team in an attempt to extend the bilateral agreement that expired in December last year. The first round of talks, last December, failed because the US placed very tough punishment conditions in cases where the US found trans-shipment or re-routing of Thai products to third countries before entering the US, a method designed to get around quotas known as "circumvention". Ms Oranut said last week that the US had relaxed its condition on the "circumvention" clause, saying that it would cut quotas only once in the case of products found to be shipped to the US illegally. And if the Thai side was able to prove its innocence in the case, the US must compensate for all quotas cut. She said the US had relaxed its earlier stance insisting on investigations, without advance warning to the Thai side, of factories suspected to have conducted "circumvention". Both sides last week agreed that the US must inform the Thai Government and investigate the factories accompanied by Thai officials. However, neither side discussed the amount of quotas or the growth rate of quotas for which the US will allow imports from Thailand each year. Hence the need for another round of negotiations. Ms Oranut said the Foreign Trade Department will today call a meeting of private-sector representatives to determine what the country's position should be.
