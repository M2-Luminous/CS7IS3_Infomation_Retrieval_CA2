When several states, including big powers, such as the PRC, Russia, and France, three major powers that enjoy the veto right at the UN Security Council, change their positions, this means that Iraq's steadfastness has paid off, and that the gambles of the United States and Britain have failed, although they have chosen to oppose changes in the new international position by forcing their evil wishes on others. The United States and Britain have realized that continued enforcement of the embargo was merely an impasse that causes whoever chooses to stick to it to collapse in terms of political and international positions. As the leader of the camp hostile to the national yearnings and ambitions of other peoples who are not about to let go of their independence, the United States is bound to forfeit further allies, even if these belong in the camp of the second- or third-rate powers that, in 1990 and 1991, rushed to support the U.S. aggression on and siege of Iraq. America's loss will then be compounded and the United States will not be in a position to lead the world. There will be a dwindling in its international standing, after it had been afforded the opportunity to gain exclusive control of the world by the former Soviet Union. The world Zionist movement and the United States wanted their aggression on Iraq and the sanctions to create conditions that would make it impossible for any other power to take them on. Such a scenario has certainly failed to materialize, but the Zionists and the Americans continue to pursue that objective. The credit for the failure of that goal to come to fruition must go to the steadfastness of the Iraqi people and the brilliance of Saddam Husayn. The forces of aggression assumed that where the comprehensive 30-state aggression and the page of treachery and treasons failed, the comprehensive siege would succeed. Iraq's steadfastness and President Saddam Husayn's historic leadership are the most outstanding features of the 20th century's most outstanding and ferocious battle. Neither ancient nor the modern history has seen such a massive array of forces ranged against such a small-sized people with a disproportionately strong will-power. Iraq's steadfastness illustrates that the Washington-Tel-Aviv plot to partition Iraq and defeat its nationalist movement, led by the peerless leader Saddam Husayn, has collapsed, with the Americans and Zionists left without any viable forces to help them weaken Iraq's unity. The split in the ranks of the world's leading powers at the United Nations is a heavy blow to the alliance, which had attracted 30 nations by trickery and misrepresentations. If there is a lesson to be learned from the split at the Security Council, it is that Iraq's stamina and pan-Arab and socialist and independent policies have won the day. It is such principles that have shielded Iraq and its national unity, made it a role model, and turned the siege into an ever-increasing burden for the aggressors.
