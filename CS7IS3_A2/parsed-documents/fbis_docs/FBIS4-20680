The following satisfactory results were obtained: BOD and SS concentration in the system effluent was under 50 mg/l and 90 mg/l respectively. More than 99 percent of organic matter was removed. About 40,000 kcal of methane gas energy was recovered in an operation of 12-22 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day, and the average methane gasification rate and sludge yield rate were 0.33 Nm[.sup]3[/]-CH[.sub]4[/]/kg-COD removed, and 0.12 kg-VSS/kg-COD removed respectively. Introduction Many industries, such as the food industry require an energy efficient system to treat the waste water, which may contain high strength dissolved and suspended organic matter. Anaerobic waste water treatment systems had advantages over aerobic ones in not only energy efficiency but less sludge yield and production of gas useful for fuel, but, on the other hand, had some drawbacks, such as unstability in treatment and high effluent concentration. The process of anaerobic degradation roughly consists of acidogenesis, where organic matter degrades into organic acid, and methanogenesis, where organic acid degrades into methane and carbon dioxide. However, these two processes have to be separated in order to offer desirable circumstances that allow each bacteria to work in each process.[.sup]1,2[/] This has proven to be very difficult in actual operation. A membrane combined two phase methane fermentation system has been developed to overcome such difficulties of anaerobic treatment. In this system, a membrane is placed between the acidogenic and methanogenic phase. Therefore, undegraded organic matter, SS and acidogenic bacteria remain in the acidogenic reactor (AR), and the methanogenic reactor (MR) is fed with membrane filtrate, mainly containing organic acid which can be utilized by methanogenic bacteria. One difficulty with this system is that SS is retained in the AR. This system was tested with wheat starch waste water containing high strength SS, and degradation of organic matter and organic loading was studied. Pilot Plant Flow of Pilot Plant Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of the pilot plant, which consisted of fixed bed AR, UASB[.sup]3[/] MR and membrane module. The feed water was the waste water from a wheat starch and gluten producing plant, owned by Nagata Industry Co., Ltd. The pH of waste water was adjusted in the feed tank and pumped to the heat exchanger, which recovers heat from the effluent from the MR. The preheated waste water was heated again to 37�C by steam injection before being fed to the AR. The effluent from the AR was fed to the membrane module, and the filtrate was fed to the MR and the concentrate was recycled to the AR. The effluent from the MR was finally discharged out of the system through the heat exchanger. The gas produced in both reactors was desulfurized in the desulfurization towers, reserved in the gas holder and then discharged out of the system. Table 1 shows the specification of the pilot plant.

The loading rate is per total capacity of the AR and the MR. As shown in Figure 2, the removal rate decreases a little as the loading rate increases. With 20 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD loading rate, however, 99 percent of TOC removal rate was kept and more than 99.8 percent of BOD removal rate was recorded. As a result, it is clear that the system can treat wheat starch waste water containing high strength SS with more than 20 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD loading. Figure 2. Relation Between TOC Removal Rate and COD Analysis of Waste Water Table 3 shows the results of the analysis of the effluent in each process. The concentration of the AR effluent is higher than that of the feed water because undegraded matter and bacteria were concentrated by the membrane. The BOD of MR effluent mostly levels off at 50 mg/l and the SS concentration at about 100 mg/l. As the membrane filtrate, which is fed to the MR, contains no SS, all SS in the MR effluent is considered as biomass. The results prove the system could efficiently and stably treat waste water to a level of purity high enough to allow discharge into a river. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.

The gasification ratio was defined as the amount of carbon in produced gas to influent TOC. Figure 3 shows the liquefaction ability and gasification ratio. Each ratio, of which the average was 86.5 percent and 23.6 percent respectively, decreased a little as COD loading increased. The excess sludge was extracted with a fixed ratio to feed amount from the reactor. Therefore, the increase of COD loading resulted in a concentration of membrane concentrate, which led to an increase in the amount of carbon in the sludge extraction. The 63 percent, carbon ratio of liquefaction minus that of gas shown in Figure 3, is carbon ratio fed to MR via membrane. Figure 3. Liquefaction and Gasification Ratio vs. COD On the other hand, volatile fatty acid production is the most important degradation reaction in the AR. Figure 4 shows main volatile fatty acids content change with time in membrane filtrate. In Figure 4, propionate and n-butyrate content increased gradually over time, and COD loading increased too. it is likely that the acetogenesis reaction reaches its limit by the increase of COD loading. However, acetic acid content changed with time, and decreased greatly from 130 to 200 days. Figure 4. Main Volatile Fatty Acids Content vs. Elapsed Figure 5 shows the change in the rate gas production over time in the AR. Because the gas production rate in this period increased, it is likely that methanogenic bacteria transformed acetic acid into gas. In order to operate the AR normally, it was necessary to suppress gas production to prevent severe foaming in the reactor. A decrease in the amount of methanogenic bacteria was attempted by drawing the excess sludge from the AR. As a result of the suppression of gas production in the reactor, the acetic acid content of filtrate increased and normal operation was maintained. Figure 5. Gas Production Ratio vs. Elapsed Time Degradation in MR The efficiency of degradation of the MR can be evaluated with the index of the TOC removal rate. Figure 6 contrasts the TOC removal rate with the COD loading in the reactor. While the rate decreased a little with the increase of COD loading, it was always over 98 percent even with 30 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD loading. This was because the influent to the reactor, which mostly consisted of organic acid and did not contain SS, was good for the USAB to operate most efficiently. Of the TOC removed in the reactor, approximately 96 percent was gasified and 2.5 percent transferred to bacteria, which indicates that the organic matter fed to the reactor had almost completely degraded. Figure 6. TOC Removal Rate vs. COD Loading Rate Gas Production The gas produced from the both reactors consisted of 62 percent methane and 38 percent carbon dioxide, and amounted to 7.6 Nm[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]3[/]-feed waste water (2.0 in AR, 5.6 in MR). Taking the energy level into account, when 1 m[.sup]3[/] of waste water was treated, 40,000 kcal of energy with gas of about 5,400 kcal/m[.sup]3[/] was produced. Figure 7 contrasts methane yield rate with the COD loading in the AR, the MR and the system. The methane yield rate in the system has little influence over the increase in COD loading. However, it decreases a little in the AR and increases in the MR. This is because organic acid content of AR effluent increase with the rise of COD loading, and as a result high strength organic acid was fed to the MR. Methane produced in the AR amounted to only one-fifth of that in the system, which meant that the acidogenesis reaction occurred mainly in it. The average gas yield rate of the system recorded high 0.336 m[.sup]3[/]-CH[.sub]4[/]/kg-COD removed.[.sup]5[/] Biomass Yield Figure 8 contrasts the biomass yield rate per removed organic matter with COD loading. The biomass yield rate in the each reactor increases with the rise of the rate of COD loading. In this system, all SS separated is retained by the membrane in the AR. In spite of the many degradation reactions going on in the reactor, the organic matter removed is a little amount of gas and biomass. Almost organic matter flows out in the form of volatile fatty acid from the AR. Therefore average SS yield rate for removed organic matter was 0.248 kg-SS/kg-COD removed in the AR, a value which was comparatively high.[.sup]6[/] However, this is only 0.106 kg-SS/kg-COD removed for the whole system. On the other hand, the biomass yield rate of the MR was few 0.020 kg-SS/removed COD,[.sup]7[/] because it was membrane filtrate containing more than 92 percent of organic acid that was fed to the reactor. That of the whole system was rather high 0.126 kg-SS/removed COD, which is a good result considering that the waste water contained high strength SS and the system operated with high loading rate. Figure 8. Biomass Yield Rate vs. COD Loading Rate Membrane Module The membrane unit operated with constant amount of filtrate, and the linear velocity on the membrane surface was kept of 0.9 m/sec for energy saving in this test. As a result, the flux per operating pressure was highly affected by SS concentration on the membrane surface. The membrane was regularly washed with reverse flow of membrane filtrate but not washed by any other method. The membrane could maintain the flux for SS concentration of 30,000 mg/l by washing with the filtrate, which proved the membrane was usable for treating high SS concentration solution. Conclusions The pilot test fully proved the efficiency of the system. It surpasses other state-of-the-art reactors in treatment efficiency, high removal rate of organic matter and gasification rate as well as compactness of size. From these results, the anaerobic treatment was considered to be useful for low strength waste water as well as high strength waste water.
