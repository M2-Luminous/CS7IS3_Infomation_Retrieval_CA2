The March poll, which was conducted by Dimarso on behalf of DE MORGEN, revealed that the SP [Socialist Party] has to settle for only 15.3 percent of the votes. This is a decrease by 2.1 percent. The French-speaking sister party, the PS, had already been the victim of the scandals around "the three Guys" in December and January. In March, Busquin's party fell back to only 30.5 percent of the votes. As a result, the socialist family is now, for the first time since 1919, only the third political formation in Belgium. SP and PS combined, get only 19.7 percent of the Belgian votes. CVP [Christian People's Party] and PSC [Social Christian Party] score 19.9 percent, while the liberals are the largest family with 27.4 percent. In Flanders, Agalev [Live Differently] made great progress in March: from 11.3 to 13.5 percent. This is also an historic record. The CVP continues to concede ground (21 percent), the liberals rose slightly (to 29.2 percent), but no longer exceed the 30 percent limit. According to Dimarso, the federal coalition has only 39.6 percent of the votes left. The Walloon majority barely reaches 51 percent, while the SP-CVP-VU [People's Union] coalition in Flanders has only 42.2 percent.
