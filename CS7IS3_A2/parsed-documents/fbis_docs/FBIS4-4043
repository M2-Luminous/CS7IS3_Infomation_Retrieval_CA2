Mr. Wang, 25, said yesterday he had decided to leave the capital towards the end of May and return a few days after the anniversary. "The political situation here is very sensitive at the moment so it really would be inconvenient for me to be here on June 4," he said. Analysts said the absence of Mr. Wang, the only significant leader of the student movement still in Beijing would make it difficult for any meaningful commemorative protest to take place on June 4. "Any commemorative activity would require a figurehead and Wang Dan is just about the only person who fits the bill," a Western diplomat said. "Everyone else is either in detention or abroad." Mr. Wang had earlier said he felt a moral responsibility to be in Beijing during the anniversary but admitted yesterday to having a change of heart. "I've come to the conclusion that things will only get worse if I stay," he said. Mr. Wang said he would probably be travelling on his own and at his own expense although he had not yet decided where to go. He has been under intense pressure from the security forces to curtail his political activities and stay away from foreign journalists. Friends of the democracy activist said the pressure was affecting him and it was not surprising that he had decided to lay low for a while.
