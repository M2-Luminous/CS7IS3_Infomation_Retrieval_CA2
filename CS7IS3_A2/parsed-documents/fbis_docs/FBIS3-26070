Attached to the bill, which was passed 92-8, were amendments calling for the unilateral lifting of arms embargo against Bosnia- Herzegovina and recommending the redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea if no major progress was made in talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on nuclear inspections. Another amendment, passed last week, urges the Bill Clinton administration to end a 19-year-old trade embargo on Vietnam. The amendments are not legally binding. Clinton said today he might make a decision on the embargo in a few days. According to the Senate bill, which still has to be reconciled with the House of Representatives, 900 million dollars will be provided for peacekeeping missions over the two-year period aside from an 175 million dollars requested for an international peacekeeping contingency fund. The Senate bill also called for: -- The quick inclusion of East European countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as full members while praising the "Partnership for Peace" Program. -- Cuts of 10 percent and 20 percent respectively for 1994 and 1995 for U.S. contributions to the United Nations. -- Blocking arms sales to countries that enforce the Arab League boycott on U.S. companies that do business with Israel.
