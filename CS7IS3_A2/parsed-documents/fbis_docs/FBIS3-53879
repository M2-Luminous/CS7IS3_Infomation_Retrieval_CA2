In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, Ghawshah said that the alliance's 20-member leadership (two members from each faction) will discuss the results of the Syrian-U.S. summit and its implications for the Palestinian people's cause at this important and serious stage. [passage omitted] Answering a question, Ghawshah described the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva as "an important political meeting but we do not expect quick or direct results from it. The first result could be an improvement in Syrian-U.S. relations." [quotation marks as published] Any developments in the Middle East problem, will be premature for the following reasons among others: 1. The Syrian track is a major track with many obstacles. The U.S. Administration, represented by Clinton, does not hold sway over the Zionist entity. There are two major power centers for this entity: one inside the Zionist entity itself and the other in the United States, represented by the Zionist lobby. 2. The ball of fire has moved quickly to the Zionist side. The Zionist Knesset is in permanent session and the settlers and rightists, especially the Likud and religious parties, have made quick moves against withdrawal from the Golan, forcing Rabin to announce through his deputy Mordekhay Gur that he is prepared to hold a referendum on full withdrawal from the Golan. This in itself will create other contradictions. Some are demanding fresh Jewish elections. All this indicates that any hopes that caused some to be optimistic will collapse. [passage omitted]
