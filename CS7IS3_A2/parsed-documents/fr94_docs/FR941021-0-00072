In addition to the above changes, the Department of the Air Force is currently conducting a review of its exemption rules. Upon completion of the review, the Department of the Air Force will update its exemption rules. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Anne Turner at (703) 697&hyph;3491 or DSN 227&hyph;3491. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis of the rule indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993). Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act rule for the Department of Defense does not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it is concerned only with the administration of Privacy Act systems of records within the Department of Defense. Paperwork Reduction Act The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act rule for the Department of Defense imposes no information requirements beyond the Department of Defense and that the information collected within the Department of Defense is necessary and consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a, known as the Privacy Act of 1974. The Department of the Air Force previously published its proposed rule on July 28, 1994, at 59 FR 38389. No comments were received that resulted in a contrary determination, therefore, the Department of the Air Force is publishing this final rule. List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 806b Privacy.

(b) The Air Force does not: (1) Keep records on how a person exercises First Amendment rights. EXCEPTIONS are when: The Air Force has the permission of that individual or is authorized by federal statute; or the information pertains to an authorized law enforcement activity. (2) Penalize or harass an individual for exercising rights guaranteed under the Privacy Act. Give reasonable aid to individuals exercising their rights. (c) Air Force members: (1) Keep paper and electronic records containing personal information and retrieved by name or personal identifier only in approved systems published in the Federal Register .

(6) Let individuals review and receive copies of their own records unless the Secretary of the Air Force approved an exemption for the system or the Air Force created the records in anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. (7) Provide a review of decisions that deny individuals access to or amendment of their records. ยง806b.2 Violation penalties. An individual may file a civil suit against the Air Force for failing to comply with the Privacy Act. The courts may find an individual offender guilty of a misdemeanor and fine that individual offender not more than $5,000 for: (a) Willfully maintaining a system of records that doesn't meet the public notice requirements. (b) Disclosing information from a system of records to someone not entitled to the information. (c) Obtaining someone else's records under false pretenses. ยง806b.3 Personal notes. If you keep personal notes on individuals to use as memory aids to supervise or perform other official functions, and do not share them with others, and an Air Force directive does not require their maintenance, the Privacy Act does not apply. ยง806b.4 Responsibilities. (a) The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/AA) manages the entire program. (b) The Office of the General Counsel to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/GCA) makes final decisions on appeals.

(2) Maintain a list of all systems of records and system managers in their area. (3) Act as liaison with the Privacy Act Officer. (4) Maintain statistics for the annual Privacy Act report. Subpart B - Obtaining Law Enforcement Records and Promises of Confidentiality ยง806b.5 Obtaining law enforcement records. The Commander AFOSI; the Chief, Air Force Security Police Agency (AFSPA); MAJCOM, FOA, and base chiefs of security police; AFOSI detachment commanders; and designees of those offices may ask another agency for records for law enforcement under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7). The requesting office must indicate in writing the specific part of the record desired and identify the law enforcement activity asking for the record. ยง806b.6 Promising confidentiality. Record promises of confidentiality to exempt from disclosure any `confidential' information under subsections (k)(2), (k)(5), or (k)(7) of the Privacy Act. Subpart C &hyph; Collecting Personal Information ยง 806b.7 How to collect personal information. Collect personal information directly from the subject of the record when possible. You may ask third parties when: (a) You must verify information. (b) You want opinions or evaluations. (c) You can't contact the subject. (d) The subject asks you. ยง806b.8 When to give Privacy Act statements (PAS). (a) Give a PAS orally or in writing: (1) To anyone from whom you are collecting personal information that will be put in a system of records. (2) Whenever you ask someone for his or her Social Security Number (SSN). Note: Do this regardless of how you collect or record the answers. You may display a sign in areas where people routinely furnish this kind of information. Give a copy of the PAS if asked. Do not ask the person to sign the PAS. (3) A PAS must include four items: (i) Authority: The legal authority, that is, the United States Code or Executive Order authorizing the program the system supports. (ii) Purpose: The reason you are collecting the information. (iii) Routine Uses: A list of where and why the information will be disclosed outside DoD. (iv) Disclosure: Voluntary or Mandatory. (Use Mandatory only when disclosure is required by law and the individual will be penalized for not providing information.) Include any consequences of nondisclosure in nonthreatening language. ยง806b.9 Requesting the social security number (SSN). (a) Do not deny people a legal right, benefit, or privilege for refusing to give their SSNs unless the law requires disclosure, or a law or regulation adopted before January 1, 1975, required the SSN and the Air Force uses it to verify a person's identity in a system of records established before that date. When you ask for an SSN to create a record, tell the individual: (1) The statute, regulation, or rule authorizing you to ask for the SSN. (2) The uses that will be made of the SSN. (3) If he or she is legally obligated to provide the SSN. (b) The Air Force requests an individual's SSN and provides the individual information required by law when anyone enters military service or becomes an Air Force civilian employee. The Air Force uses the SSN as a service or employment number to reference the individual's official records. When you ask someone for an SSN as identification (ID) to retrieve an existing record, you do not have to restate this information. (c) Executive Order 9397, November 22, 1943, authorizes using the SSN as a personal identifier. This order is not adequate authority to collect an SSN to create a record. When law does not require disclosing the SSN or when the system of records was created after January 1, 1975, you may ask for the SSN, but the individual does not have to disclose it. If the individual refuses to respond, use alternative means of identifying records. (d) SSNs are personal and unique to each individual. Protect them as FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). Do not disclose them to anyone without an official need to know. Subpart D &hyph; Giving Access to Privacy Act Records ยง806b.10 Making a request for access. Persons or their designated representatives may ask for a copy of their records in a system of records. Requesters need not state why they want access to their records. Verify the identity of the requester to avoid unauthorized disclosures. How you verify identity will depend on the sensitivity of the requested records. Persons without access to notary services may use an unsworn declaration in the following format: `I declare under penalty of perjury (if outside the United States, add `under the laws of the United States of America') that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).' ยง806b.11 Processing a request for access. Consider a request from an individual for his or her own records in a system of records under both the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act regardless of the Act cited. The requester need not cite any Act. Process the request under whichever Act gives the most information. When necessary, tell the requester under which Act you processed the request and why. (a) Requesters should describe the records they want. They do not have to name a system of records number, but they should at least name a type of record or functional area. For requests that ask for `all records about me,' ask for more information and tell the person how to review the Air Force systems of records published in the Federal Register or in AFDIR 37&hyph;144 1 , `Privacy Act Systems of Record' (formerly AFR 4&hyph;36). 1 Copies may be obtained at cost from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. (b) Requesters should not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail channels for making Privacy Act requests. Privacy Act Officers and system managers process such requests but tell requesters that using government resources to make Privacy Act requests is not authorized. (c) Tell the requester if a record exists and how to review the record. If possible, respond to requests within 10 workdays of receiving them. If you cannot answer the request in 10 workdays, send a letter explaining why and give an approximate completion date no more than 20 workdays after the first office received the request. (d) Show or give a copy of the record to the requester within 30 workdays of receiving the request unless the system is exempt and the Air Force lists the exemption in appendix C of this part; or published as a final rule in the Federal Register . Give information in a form the requester can understand. (e) If the requester wants another person present during the record review, the system manager may ask for written consent to authorize discussing the record with another person present. ยง806b.12 Fees. Give the first 100 pages free, and charge only reproduction costs for the remainder. Copies cost $.15 per page; microfiche costs $.25 per fiche. Charge the fee for the first 100 pages if records show that the Air Force already responded to a request for the same records at no charge. Do not charge fees: (a) When the requester can get the record without charge under another publication (for example, medical records). (b) For search. (c) For reproducing a document for the convenience of the Air Force. (d) For reproducing a record so the requester can review it. ยง806b.13 Denying or limiting access. Process access denials within five workdays after you receive a request for access. When you may not release a record, send a copy of the request, the record, and why you recommend denying access (including the applicable exemption) to the denial authority through the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and the Privacy Act officer. The SJA gives a written legal opinion on the denial. The MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act officer reviews the file, gets written advice from the SJA and the functional office of primary responsibility (OPR), and makes a recommendation to the denial authority. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial authority grants access, release the record. If the denial authority refuses access, tell the requester why and explain pertinent appeal rights. (a) Before you deny a request for access to a record, make sure that: (1) The system has an SAF approved exemption. (2) The exemption covers each document. (3) Nonexempt parts are segregated. (b) You may refuse to give out medical records if a physician believes that doing so could harm the person's mental or physical health. You have these options: (1) Ask the requester to get a letter from a physician to whom you can send the records. Include a letter explaining to the physician that giving the records directly to the individual could be harmful. (2) Offer the services of a military physician other than one who provided treatment if naming the physician poses a hardship on the individual. (c) Do not delete third-party information from a record when the subject requests access, except as noted in ยง806b.13(d), unless the Air Force covers the record with an established exemption (appendix C of this part). Presume that all information in a file pertains to the subject of the file. (d) Do not release third-party personal data (such as SSN and home address). This action is not a denial. (e) Withhold records compiled in connection with a civil action or other proceeding including any action where the Air Force expects judicial or administrative adjudicatory proceedings. This exemption does not cover criminal actions. Do not release attorney work products prepared before, during, or after the action or proceeding. ยง806b.14 Denial authorities. These officials or a designee may deny access or amendment of records. Send a letter to SAF/AAIA with the position titles of designees. You must get SAF/AA approval before delegating this authority to a lower level. Send requests for waiver with justification to SAF/AAIA. Authorities are: (a) DCSs and chiefs of comparable offices or higher level at SAF or HQ USAF. (b) MAJCOM or FOA commanders. (c) HQ USAF/DPCP, Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330&hyph;5060 (for civilian personnel records). (d) Commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Washington, DC 20332&hyph;6001 (for AFOSI records). Subpart E &hyph; Amending the Record ยง806b.15 Amendment reasons. Individuals may ask to have their records amended to make them accurate, timely, relevant, or complete. System managers routinely correct a record if the requester can show that it is factually wrong. ยง806b.16 Responding to amendment requests: (a) Anyone may request minor corrections orally. Requests for more serious modifications should be in writing. (b) After verifying the identity of the requester, make the change, notify all known recipients of the record, and inform the individual. (c) Acknowledge requests within 10 workdays of receipt. Give an expected completion date unless you complete the change within that time. Final decisions must take no longer than 30 workdays. ยง806b.17 Approving or denying a record amendment. The Air Force does not usually amend a record when the change is based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official judgment. This action constitutes a denial, and requesters may appeal. If the system manager decides not to amend or partially amend the record, send a copy of the request, the record, and the recommended denial reasons to the denial authority through the SJA and the Privacy Act officer. SJAs will include a legal opinion. (a) The MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act officer reviews the proposed denial, gets a legal opinion from the SJA and written advice from the functional OPR, and makes a recommendation to the denial authority. (b) The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial authority approves the request, amend the record and notify all previous recipients that it has been changed. If the authority denies the request, give the requester the statutory authority, reason, and pertinent appeal rights. ยง806b.18 Seeking review of unfavorable agency determinations. Requesters should pursue record corrections of subjective matters and opinions through proper channels to the Civilian Personnel Office using grievance procedures or the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR). Record correction requests denied by the AFBCMR are not subject to further consideration under this part. ยง806b.19 Appeal procedures. (a) Individuals may request a denial review by writing to the Secretary of the Air Force through the denial authority within 60 calendar days after receiving a denial letter. The denial authority promptly sends a complete appeal package to SAF/AAIA, including: (1) Original appeal letter. (2) Initial request. (3) Initial denial. (4) Copy of the record. (5) Any internal records or coordination actions relating to the denial. (6) Denial authority's comments on the appellant's arguments. (7) Legal reviews. (b) If the denial authority reverses an earlier denial and grants access or amendment, notify the requester immediately. (c) SAF/AAIA reviews the denial and forwards to SAF/GCA for legal review or staffing to grant or deny the appeal. SAF/GCA tells the requester the final Air Force decision and explains judicial review rights. (d) The requester may file a concise statement of disagreement with the system manager if SAF/GCA denies the request to amend the record. SAF/GCA explains the requester's rights when they issue the final appeal decision. (1) The records should clearly show that a statement of disagreement is filed with the record or separately. (2) The disputed part of the record must show that the requester filed a statement of disagreement. (3) Give copies of the statement of disagreement to the record's previous recipients. Inform subsequent record users about the dispute and give them a copy of the statement with the record. (4) The system manager may include a brief summary of the reasons for not amending the record. Limit the summary to the reasons SAF/GCA gave to the individual. The summary is part of the individual's record, but it is not subject to amendment procedures. ยง806b.20 Contents of Privacy Act case files. Do not keep copies of disputed records in this file. Use the file solely for statistics and to process requests. Do not use the case files to make any kind of determination about an individual. Document reasons for untimely responses. These files include: (a) Requests from and replies to individuals on whether a system has records about them. (b) Requests for access or amendment. (c) Approvals, denials, appeals, and final review actions. (d) Coordination actions and related papers. Subpart F &hyph; Privacy Act Notifications ยง806b.21 When to include a Privacy Act warning statement in publications. Include a Privacy Act Warning Statement in each Air Force publication that requires collecting or keeping personal information in a system of records. Also include the warning statement when publications direct collection of the SSN from the individual. The warning statement will cite legal authority and the system of records number and title. You can use the following warning statement: `This part requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by (U.S.C. citation and or Executive Order number). System of records notice (number and title) applies.' ยง806b.22 Publishing system notices. The Air Force must publish notices in the Federal Register of new, amended, and deleted systems to inform the public of what records the Air Force keeps and give them an opportunity to comment. The Privacy Act also requires submission of new or significantly altered systems to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and both houses of the Congress before publication in the Federal Register . This includes: (a) Starting a new system. (b) Instituting significant changes to an existing system. (c) Sending out data collection forms or instructions. (d) Issuing a request for proposal or invitation for bid to support a new system. ยง806b.23 Timing of notices. At least 120 days before the effective start date, system managers must send the system notice to SAF/AAIA on a 5 1/4 or 3 1/2&hyph;inch disk in Wordstar (ASCII text file) or Microsoft Word, with a paper copy highlighting any changes through the MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act Officer. See Appendix B of this part for a sample system notice. Subpart G &hyph; Protecting and Disposing of Records ยง806b.24 Protecting records. Protect information according to its sensitivity level. Consider the personal sensitivity of the information and the risk of loss or alteration. Most information in systems of records is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). Refer to AFI 37&hyph;131 2 , `Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program,' for protection methods. 2 See footnote 1 to section 806b.11, of this part. ยง806b.25 Balancing protection. Balance additional protection against risk and cost. AF Form 3227, `Privacy Act Cover Sheet', is available for use with Privacy Act material. For example, a password may be enough protection for an automated system with a log-on protocol. Classified computer systems or those with established audit and password systems are obviously less vulnerable than unprotected files or word processors in offices that are periodically empty. Follow AFI 33&hyph;202 3 , `The Air Force Computer Security Program,' for procedures on safeguarding personal information in automated records. 3 See footnote 1 to section 806b.11, of this part. ยง806b.26 Disposing of records. You may use the following methods to dispose of records protected by the Privacy Act according to records retention schedules: (a) Destroy by any method that prevents compromise, such as tearing, burning, or shredding, so long as the personal data is not recognizable and beyond reconstruction. (b) Degauss or overwrite magnetic tapes or other magnetic medium. (c) Dispose of paper products through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) or through activities who manage a base-wide recycling program. The recycling sales contract must contain a clause requiring the contractor to safeguard privacy material until its destruction and to pulp, macerate, shred, or otherwise completely destroy the records. Originators must safeguard Privacy Act material until it is transferred to the recycling contractor. A federal employee or, if authorized, a contractor employee must witness the destruction. This transfer does not require a disclosure accounting. Subpart H &hyph; Privacy Act Exemptions ยง806b.27 Requesting an exemption. A system manager who believes that a system needs an exemption from some or all of the requirements of the Privacy Act should send a request to SAF/AAIA through the MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act Officer. The request should detail the reasons for the exemption and the section of the Act that allows the exemption. SAF/AAIA gets approval for the request through SAF/AA and the Defense Privacy Office. ยง806b.28 Exemption types. (a) A general exemption frees a system from most parts of the Privacy Act. (b) A specific exemption frees a system from only a few parts of the Privacy Act. ยง806b.29 Authorizing exemptions. Only SAF/AA can exempt systems of records from any part of the Privacy Act. Denial authorities can withhold records using these exemptions only if SAF/AA previously approved and published an exemption for the system in the Federal Register . Appendix C of this part lists the systems of records that have approved exemptions. ยง806b.30 Approved exemptions. Approved exemptions exist under 5 U.S.C. 552a for: (a) Certain systems of records used by activities whose principal function is criminal law enforcement (subsection (j)(2)). (b) Classified information in any system of records (subsection (k)(1)). (c) Law enforcement records (other than those covered by subsection (j)(2)). The Air Force must allow an individual access to any record that is used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she would otherwise be entitled by federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be eligible as a result of the maintenance of the information (unless doing so would reveal a confidential source) (subsection (k)(2)). (d) Statistical records required by law. Data is for statistical use only and may not be used to decide individuals' rights, benefits, or entitlements (subsection (k)(4)). (e) Data to determine suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal service or contracts, or access to classified information if access would reveal a confidential source (subsection (k)(5)). (f) Qualification tests for appointment or promotion in the federal service if access to this information would compromise the objectivity of the tests (subsection (k)(6)). (g) Information which the Armed Forces uses to evaluate potential for promotion if access to this information would reveal a confidential source (subsection (k)(7)). Subpart I &hyph; Disclosing Records to Third Parties ยง806b.31 Disclosure considerations. Before releasing personal information to third parties, consider the consequences, check accuracy, and make sure that no law or directive bans disclosure. You can release personal information to third parties when the subject agrees orally or in writing. Air Force members consent to releasing their home telephone number and address when they sign and check the `Do Consent' block on the AF Form 624, `Base/Unit Locator and PSC Directory' (see AFI 37&hyph;129 4 , `Base and Unit Personnel Locators and Postal Directories'). 4 See footnote 1 to section 806b.11, of this part. (a) Before including personal information such as home addresses, home phones, and similar information on social rosters or directories, ask for written consent statements. Otherwise, do not include the information. (b) You must get written consent before releasing any of these items of information: (1) Marital status. (2) Number and sex of dependents. (3) Gross salary of military personnel (see ยง806b.32 for releasable pay information). (4) Civilian educational degrees and major areas of study. (5) School and year of graduation. (6) Home of record. (7) Home address and phone. (8) Age and date of birth. (9) Present or future assignments for overseas or for routinely deployable or sensitive units. (10) Office and unit address and duty phone for overseas or for routinely deployable or sensitive units. ยง806b.32 Disclosing information for which consent is not required. You don't need consent before releasing any of these items: (a) Information releasable under the FOIA. (b) Information for use within the Department of Defense by officials or employees with a need to know. (c) Name. (d) Rank. (e) Grade. (f) Air Force specialty code (AFSC). (g) Pay (including base pay, special pay, all allowances except Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) and Variable Housing Allowance (VHA)). (h) Gross salary for civilians. (i) Past duty assignments. (j) Present and future approved and announced stateside assignments. (k) Position title. (l) Office, unit address, and duty phone number. (m) Date of rank. (n) Entered on active duty (EAD) date. (o) Pay date. (p) Source of commission. (q) Professional military education. (r) Promotion sequence number. (s) Military awards and decorations. (t) Duty status of active, retired, or reserve. (u) Active duty official attendance at technical, scientific, or professional meetings. (v) Biographies and photos of key personnel. ยง806b.33 Disclosing other information. Use these guidelines to decide whether to release information: (a) Would the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information requested? (b) Would disclosing the information benefit the general public? The Air Force considers information as meeting the public interest standard if it reveals anything regarding the operations or activities of the agency, or performance of its statutory duties. (c) Balance the public interest against the individual's probable loss of privacy. Do not consider the requester's purpose, circumstances, or proposed use. ยง806b.34 Agencies or individuals to whom the Air Force may release privacy information. The Air Force may release information without consent to these individuals or agencies: (a) Agencies outside the Department of Defense for a Routine Use published in the Federal Register . The purpose of the disclosure must be compatible with the purpose in the Routine Use. When initially collecting the information from the subject, the Routine Uses block in the Privacy Act Statement must name the agencies and reason. (b) The Bureau of the Census to plan or carry out a census or survey under 13 U.S.C. 8. (c) A recipient for statistical research or reporting. The recipient must give advanced written assurance that the information is for statistical purposes only. Note: No one may use any part of the record to decide on individuals' rights, benefits, or entitlements. You must release records in a format that makes it impossible to identify the real subjects. (d) The Archivist of the United States and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to evaluate records for permanent retention. Records stored in Federal Records Centers remain under Air Force control. (e) A federal, state, or local agency (other than the Department of Defense) for civil or criminal law enforcement. The head of the agency or a designee must send a written request to the system manager specifying the record or part needed and the law enforcement purpose. The system manager may also disclose a record to a law enforcement agency if the agency suspects a criminal violation. This disclosure is a Routine Use for all Air Force systems of records and is published in the Federal Register . (f) An individual or agency that needs the information for compelling health or safety reasons. The affected individual need not be the record subject. (g) The Congress, a congressional committee, or a subcommittee, for matters within their jurisdictions. (h) A congressional office acting for the record subject. A published, blanket Routine Use permits this disclosure. If the material for release is sensitive, get a release statement. (i) The Comptroller General or an authorized representative of the General Accounting Office on business. (j) A court order of a court of competent jurisdiction, signed by a judge. (k) A consumer credit agency according to the Debt Collections Act when a published system notice lists this disclosure as a Routine Use. (l) A contractor operating a system of records under an Air Force contract. Records maintained by the contractor for the management of contractor employees are not subject to the Privacy Act. ยง806b.35 Disclosing the medical records of minors. Air Force personnel may disclose the medical records of minors to their parents or legal guardians. The laws of each state define the age of majority. (a) The Air Force must obey state laws protecting medical records of drug or alcohol abuse treatment, abortion, and birth control. If you manage medical records, learn the local laws and coordinate proposed local policies with the servicing SJA. (b) Outside the United States (overseas), the age of majority is 18. Unless parents or guardians have a court order granting access or the minor's written consent, they will not have access to minor's medical records overseas when the minor sought or consented to treatment between the ages of 15 and 17 in a program where regulation or statute provides confidentiality of records and he or she asked for confidentiality. ยง806b.36 Disclosure accountings. System managers must keep an accurate record of all disclosures made from any system of records except disclosures to DoD personnel for official use or disclosures under the FOIA. System managers may use AF Form 771, `Accounting of Disclosures'. (a) System managers may file the accounting record any way they want as long as they give it to the subject on request, send corrected or disputed information to previous record recipients, explain any disclosures, and provide an audit trail for reviews. Include in each accounting: (1) Release date. (2) Description of information. (3) Reason for release. (4) Name and address of recipient. (b) Some exempt systems let you withhold the accounting record from the subject. (c) You may withhold information about disclosure accountings for law enforcement purposes at the law enforcement agency's request. ยง806b.37 Computer matching. Computer matching programs electronically compare records from two or more automated systems which may include the Department of Defense, another federal agency, or a state or other local government. A system manager proposing a match that could result in an adverse action against a federal employee must meet these requirements of the Privacy Act: (a) Prepare a written agreement between participants. (1) Secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board. (2) Publish a matching notice in the Federal Register before matching begins. (3) Ensure full investigation and due process. (4) Act on the information, as necessary. (b) The Privacy Act applies to matching programs that use records from: (1) Federal personnel or payroll systems. (2) Federal benefit programs where matching: (i) Determines federal benefit eligibility, (ii) Checks on compliance with benefit program requirements, (iii) Recovers improper payments or delinquent debts from current or former beneficiaries. (c) Matches used for statistics, pilot programs, law enforcement, tax administration, routine administration, background checks and foreign counterintelligence, and internal matching that won't cause any adverse action are exempt from Privacy Act matching requirements. (d) Any activity that expects to participate in a matching program must contact SAF/AAIA immediately. System managers must prepare a notice for publication in the Federal Register with a Routine Use that allows disclosing the information for use in a matching program. Send the proposed system notice to SAF/AAIA. Allow 180 days for processing requests for a new matching program. (e) Record subjects must receive prior notice of a match. The best way to do this is to include notice in the Privacy Act Statement on forms used in applying for benefits. Coordinate computer matching statements on forms with SAF/AAIA through the MAJCOM Privacy Act Officer. Subpart J &hyph; Training ยง806b.38 Who needs training. The Privacy Act requires training for all persons involved in the design, development, operation and maintenance of any system of records. Some persons may need more specialized training.
