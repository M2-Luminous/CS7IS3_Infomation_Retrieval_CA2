No Way! If He Beats Berlusconi He Will Be Prime Minister" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction] [Text] "In the Rome 1 constituency the challenge is a political one, although it also has a symbolic value. The winner in the fight between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [progressive candidate] Spaventa will be the next prime minister." Adornato has chosen a different horse now, albeit from the same stable. Democratic Alliance [AD] is no longer backing Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to head the government and has chosen Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa as the new leader of the united (so to speak) Left. [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto and [Rete Secretary] Leoluca Orlando may as well stay home, in other words in Via delle Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] and Palazzo delle Aquile [Palermo's town hall]. Ferdinando Adornato, a journalist on REPUBBLICA and L'ESPRESSO and the AD's candidate in a safe constituency in Umbria, wants to be the one to choose the head of the progressives. [De Marchis] So, who is the leader of the Left? [Adornato] Spaventa, Spaventa. [De Marchis] Another left-wing liberal: Whatever will the neocommunists have to say about that? They maintain that you want a constituent government as a favor to your political godfather, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. [Adornato] I reject the idea of a constituent government out of hand. After the election there must be only two potential scenarios: Either a right-wing government with Berlusconi as prime minister or a left-wing government continuing the line pursued by the Ciampi government. [De Marchis] And if the numbers are insufficient, it will mean another election, as Berlusconi proposes. Right? [Adornato] Let us see what results the election brings before we say so. However, I take pleasure in reminding the Italians that, for the first time ever, they have the chance to choose the government directly. [De Marchis] Then let us name the team. Do you already have some ministers in mind for the left-wing government? [Adornato] At least four or five members of the Ciampi government should be reappointed, and let us not forget that we want to set up some new ministries. One for culture, for example. [De Marchis] Berlusconi says that if you get into Palazzo Chigi [government seat], you will turn the country "into one big USL [local health unit]." [Adornato] Slogan for slogan, I might retort that if he gets there he will turn the country into a drive-in. [De Marchis] And if we leave the gibes aside? [Adornato] The truth of the matter is that, thank God, none of the forces running in this election is fighting a statist platform. The USL's are the great metaphor for a deal between state-subsidized businesses and citizens involved in a back-scratching system. And Berlusconi was part of that system. And how! [De Marchis] So what is your recipe for reconciling the market and the welfare state? [Adornato] We must retain welfare mechanisms, not based on back scratching, for the weakest members of society; modernization must take account of the most vulnerable. To cite some examples, we must go for computerization ... [De Marchis] Aha! That is a somewhat suspect point. You work for publishing companies controlled by Carlo De Benedetti, head of Olivetti. [Adornato] But I want to favor no one. [De Marchis] Sure? [Adornato] I am sure. I did not like the deal between Olivetti and the unions... [De Marchis] Le us move on. [Adornato] We must improve relations between the education system and research, promote the tourist industry, and make the most of our cultural heritage, creating new jobs. [De Marchis] Let us change the subject. A lot of ex-Socialists have found shelter in AD: Benvenuto, Cazzola, and Ruffolo, for instance. The UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] is looking more and more like Democratic Alliance's battleship. Where is renewal to be found? Do these cumbersome facts not create discontent? [Adornato] Ninety percent of our candidates have no previous experience in politics. However, I personally am no Jacobin as far as those who were in politics before are concerned. I do not ask, "where have you come from?" but, "where are you going?" [De Marchis] Talking of where you are going, what will happen to Adornato if AD fails to make it across the 4 percent threshold? [Adornato] It will merely mean that we shall pursue our goals in more difficult conditions. [De Marchis] Perhaps it might have been better not to run in the proportional representation section? [Adornato] It might have been an idea, but we decided to give it a try. [De Marchis] And if it does not work out, will you be keeping your head down? [Adornato] No. In the long run, ours will be the winning platform. In any case, even now ours is the only true alliance fighting this election.
