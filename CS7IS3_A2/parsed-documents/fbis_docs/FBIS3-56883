The report opens with a shot of Russian cosmonauts Aleksandr Serebrov and Vasiliy Tsebliyev being picked up in a snow-covered field, still in their space suits, and pans to a tent in the fields, and finally to doctors checking the cosmonauts. Correspondent Sergey Slichenko reports that news about problems with spacecraft docking came one-and-half hours before the landing of the crew. The landing was not without problems either: the crew was found about 100 kilometers off the target area. A tent was erected in the middle of the snow-covered fields where the two men landed, and it is in this tent that they spoke to the correspondent while the doctors checked their physical condition. Cosmonaut Serebrov, looking pale and exhausted, comments on the significance of Inca launching sites, while Cosmonaut Tsebliyev says that during the 197 days of the mission he and Serebrov did not have a single quarrel. The correspondent then describes the technical problem the two cosmonauts encountered during their mission. He says that "the cosmonauts' last task was to photograph the docking point, where the Americans will have to dock their shuttle. The spacecraft left the space station, started circling it, and at that moment Tsebliyev and Serebrov felt a thump, and it seemed to them that they had bumped into the station. "However, the crew of the Mir station did not feel anything and according to their reports everything was fine there. Experts at the space center are now analyzing the information to determine whether there had been an accident and whether the space station had been moved. "However, this incident may turn out to be very useful. The Russian spacecraft is considerably lighter than the American shuttle and if the American shuttle were to bump into the space station, this could have serious consequences. Now Russian scientists have an opportunity to study such an eventuality, even though they'll have to do so with a real situation, rather than a theoretical one."
