This is the result of a survey carried out by the Forsa Institute for the "RTL- Kanzlerbarometer" program which the RTL TV channel published today. According to the survey, Scharping and Kohl are neck and neck in popularity among the voters, both at 32 percent. Thirty-nine percent of Germans would vote CDU/CSU [if there were an election] this week, 40 percent would vote SPD, 8 percent Alliance 90/Greens, 6 percent FDP [Free Democratic Party] and 3 percent for both the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] and the Republicans. Twenty percent of Germans believe that the Union [CDU/CSU] is the best suited to solve the country's problems. Only 14 percent have confidence in the SPD in this respect. The majority of Germans (62 percent), however, believe that no party is in a position to do so.
