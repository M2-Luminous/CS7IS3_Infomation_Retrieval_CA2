FR940617-2-00132 FR940617-2-00079 Response: Appropriate coordination means working with R & P agencies to ensure that there is a smooth transition between services provided by the R & P agencies and services provided to refugees through the State program. When planning services, a State should take into account what services are provided by R & P agencies so that there is a relationship and a continuum between R & P services and State-funded services and an absence of service gaps or service duplication. Comment: One commenter expressed concurrence with the need for continued provision of services after employment to help a refugee retain employment or move to a better job. The commenter recommended that ORR review the list of services in 45 CFR 400.153 through 400.156 and if additional services are desired, specify them in the notice. Response: We are reviewing the list of allowable services in 45 CFR subpart I to determine if changes should be made. Such changes would have to be made through a regulatory change, not through the notice. Comment: Two commenters commended ORR for not restricting services to a 36-month refugee population, while one commenter expressed disappointment that ORR did not limit services to a 36-month population. Response: As a point of clarification, a restriction of services to a time-limited population could only be effected through regulatory action. Comment: One commenter complained that the requirement that States must specify and justify the use of funds for services to refugees who have been in the U.S. more than 3 years is a reversal from previous years when a justification was required to use social service funds for newly-arrived refugees. Response: ORR regulations under 45 CFR 400.147 require that both the use of funds for services to newly arriving refugees (ยง400.147(a)) and the use of funds for services to refugees who have been in the U.S. more than 36 months (ยง400.147(c)) must be specified and justified as part of a State's annual services plan. This regulation has been in effect since July 1, 1989. The notice this year simply emphasized ยง400.147(c) instead of ยง400.147(a). Comment: One commenter objected to the requirement that funds should be used for services designed to get refugees a job in less than one year, while one commenter supported the one-year requirement. Response: We have responded to this comment in previous notices. Since our position remains unchanged, we refer the commenter to our response in the FY 1993 final social service notice, published in the Federal Register on July 28, 1993 (58 FR 40437). Comment: One commenter recommended that the notice clarify that social service funds may be used to serve unemployed refugees who are not receiving cash assistance as long as cash assistance recipients make up a percentage of the social services caseload which is at or above the State's welfare dependency rate. The commenter indicated that the State currently interprets the ORR notice to mean that only cash assistance clients may receive services. Response: We believe the notice is clear that social services funds may be used to serve non-cash-assistance recipients. The notice, under the section ``Population to be Served,'' states that ``social service programs should not be limited exclusively to refugees who are cash assistance recipients.'' However, as the wording indicates, this is not a mandatory requirement. States are not required to ensure that cash assistance recipients make up a percentage of the social services caseload that is not less than the State's welfare dependency rate. States, however, are required to give priority to a refugee who is receiving cash assistance. Comment: One commenter objected to the use of a floor amount for small States. Response: We have responded to this comment in previous notices. Since our position has not changed on this issue, we refer the commenter to our response in the FY 1993 final social service notice, published in the Federal Register on July 28, 1993 (58 FR 40437). Comment: Two commenters objected to unlimited State administrative costs for social services. One commenter recommended capping administrative costs at 5% for any State receiving more than $12 million in social service funds and recommended that counties be allowed a maximum of 20% for administrative costs. Response: Since the statute does not specify a limitation on the amount of social service funds that can be used for administrative costs, we have not imposed a limit on States, choosing instead to allow States to make that determination. In regard to the percentage of funds that counties may use for administrative costs, this is an issue that needs to be resolved between county and State, not ORR. As noted earlier, all costs must meet Federal grant requirements. Comment: One commenter suggested that ORR consider safeguards to ensure that primary emphasis is placed on serving new arrivals, with services beyond the initial period being the exception and only allowable if a State has been successful in meeting the needs of new arrivals. Response: Such a requirement could be put into effect only through regulatory action. We are giving this issue consideration.
