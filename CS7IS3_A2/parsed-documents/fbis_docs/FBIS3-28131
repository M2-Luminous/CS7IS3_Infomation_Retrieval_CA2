FBIS3-28131 "dreas023_l_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 Philippines Communists Said to Threaten IMF, World Bank BK0302034494 Hong Kong AFP in English 0239 GMT 3 Feb 94 BK0302034494 Hong Kong AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] MANILA, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Communist assassins have threatened to target representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Philippine government's Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) unless a recent hike in oil prices is reversed, newspapers reported here Thursday. The newspapers quoted spokesmen of the Alex Boncayo Brigade (ABB), the urban assassination squad of the insurgent New People's Army (NPA), that they would target representatives of these three groups unless President Fidel Ramos reversed a 22 percent increase in the prices of fuel products. The formerly-dormant ABB, which killed over 200 soldiers, policemen and civilians in Manila from 1987-90, earlier claimed responsibility for the bombing of the offices of three oil companies in this city on Tuesday. The ABB said the bombings were intended to protest the oil price hike imposed last Friday. The ABB added that if the government agreed to reverse the oil price hike, they in return would agree to open peace talks with the government. The Communist Party of the Philippines, the political leadership of the NPA, is already considering peace negotiations with the Ramos government, but talks have been stalled by numerous conditions imposed by the insurgents. Meanwhile, an anti-Ramos newspaper, in an editorial published Thursday, called on the assassins to target local officials and not foreigners. The Today, a broadsheet which began publishing just last month, in reaction to the ABB's threat said: "Do we have to remind the ABB that native insurgencies are supposed to kill native officials, not foreign civilians or diplomatic personnel?" The newspaper said that attacking foreigners would only scare away foreign investment and would only give the Ramos government justification to crack down on civil liberties, "so it can steal in peace and stay in power." The newspaper also said that the ABB "doesn't have the discrimination and the balls to tackle its proper enemy -- the government and its officials." "What a pity. Yet another golden opportunity to prove the ABB's usefulness thrown out the window," the editorial concluded.
