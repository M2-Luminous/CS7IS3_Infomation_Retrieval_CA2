Members of the Foreign Relations Council held an urgent meeting with President Guillermo Endara to take a stand on the report issued by Robert Gelbard, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, which describes our country as an important money laundering center. After a meeting that lasted two and a half hours, the Panamanian Government officially rejected the high-ranking U.S. official's report that Panama's efforts to combat money laundering have been small. [Begin Foreign Minister Jose Mulino recording] We will also request a meeting at the highest level of the U.S. Government to discuss the drug issue. This issue must be broached, not only in regard to Panama, but also with respect to the United States, which is the country that consumes this product the most. [end recording] He added that the Panamanian Government does not intend to argue the issue but wants to begin a constructive dialogue to correct possible errors in the management of the money laundering problem. [Begin Mulino recording] Those issues do not stay at a bilateral level. It is offensive and denigrating for our country to be identified as one of the world's principal money laundering centers. [end recording] The foreign minister announced that he will send Panama's official statement on the matter to U.S. officials early next week. In his opinion, the report tarnishes the country's image among nations.
