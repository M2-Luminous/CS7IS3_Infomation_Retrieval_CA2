Consequently, the development of private business made substantial headway. In 1993, 2,500 new independent business operators and over 40 private enterprises with registered capital of more than 13 million yuan were set up in Tibet, topping those of 1992 by 2.2 times and 2.3 times, respectively. The development of independent and private businesses used to be quite slow in Tibet, primarily because of relevant authorities' excessive controls. Last year, industrial and commercial authorities in Tibet gave top priority [fang zai shou wei] to the development of independent and private businesses. Making continual efforts to emancipate their minds, change their mindset, and free themselves from worries, they drew up preferential policies and measures for supporting the development of independent and private businesses. These policies include simplifying registration and licensing formalities. Anyone can apply for an operating license as long as he has an ID card and a letter of recommendation from relevant authorities; and all applications are immediately processed without delay. Meanwhile, the scope of operations was also broadened. Local independent operators as well as those from other parts of the country were allowed to engage in wholesale or retail trading of whatever commodities the state had decontrolled. Surplus personnel which government organs, enterprises, and institutions were to replace were permitted to take up second vocations. Peasants and herdsmen were allowed to trade their agricultural, sideline, and livestock products in cities without paying management charges or business taxes. Local and nonlocal independent operators were encouraged to provide long-distance delivery services. Meanwhile, other relevant departments also changed their old ways of doing things by abolishing irrational levies and providing services which independent and private businesses needed for their development. These improvements and effective measures have expedited the rapid development of independent and private businesses in Tibet. Last year, Tibet's independent and private businesses paid more than 20,000 yuan in taxes to the state.
