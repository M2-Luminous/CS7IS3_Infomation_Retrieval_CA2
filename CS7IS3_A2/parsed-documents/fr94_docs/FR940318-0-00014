FR940318-0-00014 FR940318-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY Office of Thrift Supervision 12 CFR Part 567 [No. 93&hyph;198] RIN 1550&hyph;AA58 Risk-Based Capital: Multifamily Housing Loans; Interest Rate Risk Component Delay of Effective Date AGENCY: Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule; delay of effective date. SUMMARY: The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is adopting a final rule that amends its risk-based capital regulation to give a 50 percent risk weight to qualifying multifamily mortgage loans and securities backed by such loans (mortgage-backed securities or MBS). The OTS is adopting this rule as part of an interagency initiative to implement the provisions of section 618(b) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991 and section 305(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. Multifamily mortgage loans that on the effective date of this rule qualified for the 50 percent risk-weight category under criteria in the OTS's previous capital rule and continue to satisfy those criteria will continue to be risk-weighted at 50 percent. The OTS is also further delaying the effective date of a portion of its Interest Rate Risk final rule adopted on August 31, 1993 and making a conforming amendment to the rule. EFFECTIVE DATES: This final rule is effective March 18, 1994, except that the first amendment to ยง567.6(a)(1)(iii)(C) is effective on March 18, 1994 through September 29, 1994, and the second amendment to ยง567.6(a)(1)(iii)(C) is effective September 30, 1994. The amendments to ยง567.6 published at 58 FR 45813 (August 31, 1993) are delayed from July 1, 1994 to September 30, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Information A. Statutory Authority and Regulatory Background The OTS today is issuing a final rule amending its risk-based capital treatment of multifamily mortgage loans. This rule conforms with the requirements of both section 618(b) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991 (RTCRRIA) 1 and section 305(b)(1)(B) of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). 2 1 Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, 105 Stat. 1761 (1991). 2 Pub. L. 102&hyph;242, 105 Stat. 2236 (1991). Section 618(b)(1) of RTCRRIA requires the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, and the OTS (collectively, ``the federal banking agencies'') to accord a 50 percent risk weight to multifamily mortgage loans and related MBS meeting certain specified criteria and gives the agencies discretion to add other prudential safeguards. Section 305(b)(1)(B) of FDICIA requires the federal banking agencies to revise their risk-based capital standards to ensure that those standards reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss of multifamily mortgage loans. Under the OTS's existing risk-based capital regulation, multifamily mortgage loans are assigned to the 50 percent risk-weight category if: They are secured by multifamily residential properties consisting of 5-to-36 dwelling units; they have an initial loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of not more than 80 percent; and an average annual occupancy rate of 80 percent or more of total units has existed for at least one year. While the criteria prescribed by RTCRRIA for qualifying multifamily mortgage loans overlap with OTS's existing criteria for these loans, they are not identical.
