The economic output decreased approximately 2 percent in 1993, whereas prices increased approximately 4 percent. [Tietmeyer] This result is definitely not what we would like to see. But it is probably a transition situation that was inevitable following the poor developments at the beginning of the 1990's. Regarding the price trend, we have always made clear that it is unacceptable for us and that we must return to clearly lower prices. It is important, however, that while the average annual increase was about 4 percent, the price increase slowed down in the second half of the year. [Blohm] What are you expecting this year? [Tietmeyer] We assume that there will be a better result in 1994. We do not rule out that we will have a 2 before the comma in the course of the year. [Blohm] The Bundesbank's current policy has been described as a policy of small steps. Do you think the 1993 end result would have been worse if the Bundesbank had decreased the key interest rates faster and more extensively? [Tietmeyer] It is correct that we pursued a policy of small steps. But this was urgently necessary, because it was absolutely impermissible for us to jeopardize the positive assessment of the German mark by investors, in particular abroad, or the credibility of the German central bank's policy. All in all, we have made considerable progress. On the one hand, we have preserved the confidence of international investors. On the other, we clearly lowered long-term interest rates, and that is decisive. One thing is sure: Our interest rate policy has not had a negative influence on economic development, but has created the basis for an upward trend in the next few years on a new and sound basis. [Blohm] You said recently that in view of rapidly growing unemployment, the dictate of the moment is to secure and promote employment. Couldn't the Bundesbank do more in this respect? [Tietmeyer] The Bundesbank has done what it could. It is not primarily monetary policy that has to act, but decisions are now required in the area of the companies themselves, collective wage settlements, labor cost, and the area of public finances, which essentially influence the framework conditions. [Blohm] The word "social cuts" is the keyword in 1993. You said that monetary policy cannot be the repair shop of public finances. Does this mean that the Bundesbank welcomes the discussion on entitlements and social cuts? [Tietmeyer] I think that speaking of social cuts does not describe the situation or the task correctly. The task is to restructure the social welfare state and adjust it to the new conditions, nationally and internationally. I think it is important for us in Germany to return to the simple economic truth that says that one can only distribute what has been produced. In an open market economy system, entitlements cannot be retained in companies or in the social system, if the competitive conditions have changed. The most important thing is for us to interpret the term of social justice also in light of performance. [Blohm] What do you mean by this? [Tietmeyer] I mean by this that work must be remunerated according to the results. Payment for work must have an advantage over the distribution of benefits. [Blohm] As of this year, the gasoline and diesel tax will be considerably increased. In 1993, taxes were also increased, and in 1995, we will again have to pay a solidarity surcharge. All this will, of course, also have an effect on prices. Is the state diminishing your stability successes? [Tietmeyer] A restructuring of the tax system is in order, if taxes are imposed on consumption rather than performance-oriented incomes. An increase in the mineral oil tax does not have to undermine stability policy or growth and employment policy. However, it is of decisive importance that this tax-conditioned price increase not be passed on or taken as a reason for further income demands, which would then touch off another spiral. It is important for us not to increase the tax quotas in the Federal Republic, one of the highest in the world, but to consolidate the public budgets, including social security systems, by restricting increases in expenditures. [Blohm] Several days ago, the Bundesbank announced its new money supply target for 1994. It envisages an M3 money supply growth by 4 to 6 percent during the course of this year. Will monetary policy be continued along the line pursued since September 1992? [Tietmeyer] It is certain that we will continue this course. This also includes the option of further interest rate reductions in case the money supply expansion slows down. We assume that it will decelerate in the course of this year. Then we will examine what the proper interest rate should be. [Blohm] Are you still anticipating any leeway for interest rate reductions on the capital market? After all, interest rates on the capital market have already dropped far more considerably. [Tietmeyer] To begin with, viewed historically and internationally, our capital market interest rates are relatively low. Currently, our capital market interest rates have almost reached their historical nadir. In the past, the rate of inflation was close to zero. On this basis, some observers do not expect another major decrease in interest rates on the capital market. In my view, it will be of decisive importance whether we will be able to maintain positive stability expectations for the next few years. The more positive they are, the more likely it is that long-term interest rates remain at a low level or decrease even further. [Blohm] This year, 1994, is the 20th time that the Bundesbank has announced a money supply goal. In the first 10 years, the goal was missed five times, in the second nine years, six times. We do not see any kind of learning effect from such statistics. Why was this goal missed more and more often? [Tietmeyer] More and more often is not correct. It is correct that we have not always fully reached it, but we must differentiate between a minor and a major deviation. There have been major deviations in a few years only. We hold the view that we must keep to the money supply concept because it provides an orientation for our own policy and for the financial markets. This is important for longer-term stability anticipations. In addition, all our analyses show that there is a close medium-term connection between the indicator, M3, which is the money supply watched and controlled by us, and the price trend. That is why we are convinced that it is the best indicator, which can also serve as a yardstick for ourselves. [Blohm] On 1 August, 1993, the so-called fixed exchange rates in the European Monetary System were discarded. Now the exchange rates are allowed to fluctuate plus/minus 15 percent in the exchange rate mechanism. Does this make German monetary policy easier? [Tietmeyer] The decision of 1 August certainly makes German -- and our neighbors' -- monetary policy easier. Now the risk involved in speculation is much greater. For us it is important that in our policy we must and will continue to consider what is happening in Europe as a whole. But we are less restricted by the tight corset of narrow bands. Our neighbor countries have to again bear more responsibility. [Blohm] Are you expecting a relatively early return to narrower bands? [Tietmeyer] Certainly not over the short term. For the time being, it is important to create confidence on the financial markets in the national monetary policy of the countries concerned. It is important to create the economic bases required for lasting exchange rate stability. In this respect, we have made good progress since 1 August. [Blohm] Under the Maastricht Treaty, the progress made regarding fulfillment of the convergency criteria will be examined by the end of 1996. Do you think that most member states will then have met the prerequisites for European monetary union? [Tietmeyer] I do not think it is possible at this point to forecast anything. Judging by the present data, it is not very likely. I do not consider it appropriate to say today what the situation will be by the end of 1996. The race has begun, and everyone should have a chance to reach the goal in due course. [Blohm] You said that at the third stage of European monetary union, we will need a convincing and, if possible, also well-tested monetary policy concept. In your view, could it be different from that of the Bundesbank? [Tietmeyer] To begin with, we think the Bundesbank's concept is convincing and good. That is why we will fight to make sure that this concept is made the yardstick and guideline of a European concept. But we must talk about it with our partners because other countries have totally different concepts. I hope our arguments will be convincing, so that in the end, the German monetary policy concept will be accepted as an orientation. [Blohm] Frankfurt will be the seat of the European central bank. At the beginning of this year, the European Monetary Institute [EMI] has started work in Frankfurt. Are there any contacts with the Bundesbank? [Tietmeyer] The EMI is an independent monetary institute. There is no special relationship with the Bundesbank. Of course, the institute cooperates with all central banks, and its council is composed of the presidents of the European central banks. So I am a member of this body, and I therefore have to codetermine this institute's line. However, the Bundesbank does not have a privileged position compared with other central banks. We hope, of course, that the Bundesbank's thinking and experience will have the greatest possible effect on the EMI's work. [Blohm] What specifically will the EMI do? [Tietmeyer] This institute has two tasks. The first task is to help ensure good cooperation between central banks in the next few years, and to help coordinate monetary policy to the extent that this is possible in stability policy terms. The second task is the specific preparation of the work of a future European central bank system. In this respect, the concept, the instruments, and the organizational things must be clarified. But we must be aware of one thing: This institute is a cooperation institute, and not a central bank. [Blohm] If you want to cooperate with your counterparts in the other European central banks, you just phone them. This is the closest form of cooperation one can think of, isn't it? [Tietmeyer] This will be continued in the future, but in addition, we will meet in Frankfurt once every month, and not in Basel at the Bank for International Settlements. But this is only one side. The other side is that the European monetary institute will have its own staff and will prepare its own documents. In addition, there will in the future be a very intensive form of cooperation below the level of central bank presidents. This means that a large number of committees will try to find common positions for individual areas of the central banks' work. This is the form of cooperation that we want. However, at the second stage, as long as we do not have monetary union, the national central banks will in the final analysis be responsible for their policy themselves. There can be no majority decisions in the EMI that would bind a central bank in its policy. [Blohm] Does this also hold true for the currency reserves? [Tietmeyer] It holds in particular true for the currency reserves. There is an option allowing individual countries to transfer all or some of their currency reserves to the EMI and to ask the EMI to manage these reserves as an agent. The German side does not intend to make use of this option. We can and will continue, for the time being, to manage our reserves ourselves. [Blohm] There is talk everywhere about structural crises and necessary adjustments in the economic sector and society. The judgment on the Bundesbank ranges from "bronze rock" to a creature from Jurassic Park. Where do you see the Bundesbank? [Tietmeyer] For some people to see the Bundesbank as a "bronze rock," seems to me to be an attribute that is not wrong. However, the metaphor of the dinosaur is certainly inappropriate. The Bundesbank has won a high degree of credibility. I hope this will also play a relevant role regarding the further European policy orientation. We will not be those who want to determine everything, so to speak, but we will bring in our arguments, and we will fight for our experience being taken as a yardstick. The common goal is and must be to develop a stability community in Europe. [Blohm] Nonetheless, it is correct to describe the Bundesbank as a preserving element in a rapidly changing financial world. [Tietmeyer] You addressed a right point. Compared with many other central banks, we have pursued a more conservative monetary policy -- conservative in that we have pursued our policy in a stability-oriented way. I think our policy has helped keep the financial markets in Germany more stable. They have developed more calmly than elsewhere. You can see this by the fact that in our country, long-term credit relations play a much larger role than in other countries with lower monetary stability. We want to maintain this basis because we know from experience that this not only furthers the stability of our currency, but is also an indispensable basis for growth and employment.
