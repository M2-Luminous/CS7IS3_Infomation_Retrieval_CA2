The operation was successful and now his condition is quite satisfactory. [Mkrtchyan] Let us get one thing clear first: Was this form of recruitment agreed upon by the Ministry of Defense and your commission? Are you not afraid that recruitment using mass raids will compromise the very idea and increase the alarm in the society while simultaneously creating occasion for various legal infractions? [Bagdasaryan] On 27 March of this year the government of the Republic of Armenia made a decision approving the list of officials not subject to being drafted for three-month active duty training. Everyone else, actually, by a decision of the government and the Ministry of Defense, is subject to the draft. But there is one "but" here.... The government is not coordinating all issues with the Supreme Council, particularly with our commission or the Commission on Legal Questions. And this is the reason mistakes have been made. I cannot say right now whether there are instructions granting military commissariats and the military police the right to arrange raids and other such actions. So far we have received no written protests from citizens to study them and set them in motion. We, like many others, learned about this from conversations with friends and acquaintances. According to these conversations there have been trading sessions on the spot, and in dollars or Russian rubles. Incidentally, there was a discussion of the aforementioned negative phenomena in the Presidium of the Supreme Council as well, but, I repeat, so far we have received no written complaints about the commission's orders. By one of the resolutions adopted last year the Supreme Council made significant changes in the Law on Military Duty. They stipulate that if an individual with a military obligation does not show up at the military commissariat within three days after receipt of his notice, he may be held criminally liable. In other words, there is no need for additional notices or warnings. But, as we can see, the organizers of the raids have decided to take the shortest path. They decided not to wait until the draftees start evading the draft before they resorted to repressive measures in keeping with the law, but wanted to solve the problem at once, with the help of raids. I think that such forms of mobilization are unacceptable. [Mkrtchyan] Mr. Bagdasaryan, let us take a look at the problem from the other side. As we know, the state minister for questions of defense, when summing up the results of the preceding recruitment, noted with satisfaction that when conducting it they managed to achieve extremely high indicators. The legitimate question arises: If it is possible to achieve such results using the structure of military commissariats, what brought about the use of such "unacceptable," as you put it, methods during the last conscription? [Bagdasaryan] I find it difficult to answer this question and I can only give my personal opinion. We have lived through a difficult winter and some of our citizens are outside the republic. This probably explains why the Ministry of Defense resorted to extreme measures to provide for mobilization of the necessary number of reservists. [Mkrtchyan] The present military-political situation shows that our state will be forced to conduct large-scale mobilizations in the future as well. What is the legal basis for conducting them and how good is it? [Bagdasaryan] The law on military duty regulates all of these questions. It has a special chapter devoted to the reserve and it talks about both the time periods and rights of the draftee and about the social protection for his family and everything else. So far we have received no proposals to make an amendment to the law and so far we see not need to make it either stricter or more lenient. I repeat that we too are dissatisfied with the form in which it is conducted...so far that is all. [Mkrtchyan] We assume that the reasons for the panic that arose during the time of the mobilization and the evasion of the service go much deeper than people sometimes try to indicate. In this case the most important task is to provide for a favorable social and political atmosphere, level of psychological preparation, etc. Frequently one gets the impression that state propaganda, especially on television, does not see this as its task. And one wonders whether this is intentional or the result of inability. How do you assess the activity of state propaganda? [Bagdasaryan] The gap that formed after the fall of communist ideology is now being filled with whatever is at hand. There is no clear-cut state ideology that could fill the vacuum. Possibly this is the reason why many of our citizens, including in administrative positions, are lacking ideological approaches. In my opinion, this explains the panic that arose. If this gap were filled, say, with the national ideology of Gagerin Nzhde, I do not think that we would be seeing such phenomena. If the people had an awareness that every Armenian family must have one military serviceman, such a panic would not have existed. If the prestige of the military had been high, there would not have been this kind of panic at all. But to tell the truth, I find it difficult to accuse anybody of the situation that developed. It seems to me that we are all to blame. And I watch almost no television because of a lack of electricity.
