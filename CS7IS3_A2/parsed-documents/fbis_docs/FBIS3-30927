"There is a line that has been crossed," he said, the line being the willingness to use force as NATO issued an ultimatum Wednesday [9 February] for an end to shelling of Sarajevo and withdrawal of heavy weapons. It "might be the first step towards disengagement," he said. Asked by AFP at his hotel here if the peace initiative would really work, after so many have failed, Silajdzic said: "I think it will." Silajdzic is in Geneva for a Bosnian peace conference opening Thursday. He said the withdrawal of the artillery of the besieging Serbs from around Sarajevo would not change the strategic balance since it is "not true you can protect troops with artillery." He said the only purpose of the Serb artillery was "to attack civilians." Military experts in Sarajevo consider, however, that the Serbs' artillery advantage enables them to offset the numerical superiority of the mainly Moslem Bosnian troops defending the city against a 22-month Serb siege. Silajdzic said that the NATO ultimatum could lead to a "balance of power and with a balance of power you will have peace." He denied that the Bosnians were outnumbered since he said they were fighting not just Bosnian Serb forces but troops from Serbia. "They can bring out more troops at any time," Silajdzic said.
