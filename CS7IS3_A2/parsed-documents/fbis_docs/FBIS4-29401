Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu spoke over the phone with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher early Friday morning and was briefed about former President Jimmy Carter's meeting with Kim in Pyongyang, ministry officials said. "We consider Kim's remarks as an indication that North Korea is willing to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue," a Foreign Ministry official said in reaction. "We will, of course, have to wait until we hear directly from Carter on his talks with Kim," the official said, "but we cautiously welcome North Korea's gesture." Kim was quoted as telling Carter in their first meeting Thursday that his government has changed its mind and will let two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) remain in North Korea. Another ministry official called this a highly symbolic move on Pyongyang's part, since permission for the inspectors to stay suggests North Korea will remain in the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime. Carter and Kim are to hold a second meeting Friday before the former U.S. President returns to Seoul. Pyongyang has threatened repeatedly to bolt the NPT if the U.N. Security Council went ahead and adopted a sanctions resolution. A draft of the resolution was circulated Thursday. CNN reported that Kim said North Korea would not engage in any reprocessing or refueling, the two core activities involved in producing plutonium. "We have yet to verify this part, but if true, we certainly welcome that," the ministry official said. "This is the right way to guarantee transparency in present and future nuclear activities." Of minor concern here was Kim's failure to mention anything about clarifying his country's past nuclear activities. "But this does not have to be done before North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue. This issue was to be discussed at the high-level dialogue, anyway," the official said.
