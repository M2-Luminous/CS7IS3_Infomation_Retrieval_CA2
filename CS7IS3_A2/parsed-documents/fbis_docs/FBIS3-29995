Finance ministers and central bankers of the G-7 nations will gather on Saturday in Kronberg, the outskirts of Frankfurt, to reaffirm cooperation in macroeconomic measures for global growth, stable currency rates and aid to Russia, the source said. The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. On the exchange rates, Japan will explain that the yen's sharp rise since early last year has "poured water" on signs of economic recovery, he said. Since then, Japan has launched a spate of pump-priming measures, including the latest record 15.25 trillion yen package, despite the tough financial situation, the source noted. Japan will stress the plan's inclusion of tax cuts worth 6 trillion yen to stimulate consumption and deregulatory actions primarily to facilitate land-market liquidity, the source said. He said such steps were taken while continuing to boost public works and housing-related loans, sectors that remain strong. Japan will brief other nations particularly on the tax issue to win support, the source said, citing U.S. criticism over the effects of a single-year tax cut. U.S. officials have said such cuts are not enough to prop up the economy and reduce trade imbalance. They were disappointed with the scrapping of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's original plan. It called for a permanent 6 trillion yen tax cut and an offsetting 7 percent "welfare tax" in three years to replace the 3 percent consumption tax. The U.S. side had pictured tax cuts worth 18 trillion yen in three years. The source emphasized that Japan's ruling coalition leaders agreed to conduct a full-fledged tax reform by year's end, an accord that won confirmation at a cabinet meeting. He noted that the G-7 ministers and central bankers are unlikely to issue a joint statement on macroeconomic policies and currency rates, but there are chances for the aid to Russia. Discussions on macroeconomic policies and exchange rates will be limited to the morning session of the one-day meeting that kicks off at around 11 A.M., he said. With each nation presenting its economic measures, there will not be much to discuss, he said, indicating pressure on a single nation is unlikely. The ministers and central bankers will focus on Russian aid in the afternoon session and Russian counterparts will join for about an hour before the meeting ends at around 5 P.M., the source said. The G-7 nations want to directly confirm economic reforms since Russian President Boris Yeltsin formed a new cabinet in the wake of elections last December, he said. According to latest information, the source said the new cabinet intends to inherit and continue reforms led by inflation-curbing economic policies that are the key condition for multilateral aid from G-7 nations. Large chunks of aid through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have not been implemented due to Russia's political and economic uncertainties. The source said the aid package decided at a G-7 meeting of finance and foreign ministers last April in Tokyo and upgraded in a Tokyo summit last July is unlikely to be increased or changed. Confirming that Russian policies are in line with the aid conditions will be the major issue, he noted. Despite his indication that the aid will be the major topic, global attention is apparently fixed on currency and trade issues between Japan and the U.S. Bilateral trade disputes have escalated since Japan flatly rejected a U.S. demand for "numerical targets" at a meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. After trade talks failed, the yen surged more than 6 yen against the dollar on speculation over the U.S. tolerating a stronger yen. Japan and the U.S. are now in a "cooling off" period and the G-7 meeting will be the first top-level one since the summit. Japanese officials said a possible meeting between Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has not been scheduled.
