Raja Mohan: "U.S. Softens Tone on India"] [Text] Washington, Feb. 10--The Clinton administration may not initiate any substantive change in its policy towards India, but a more cautious and gentler tone is evident. Apparently there is a recognition of the buffeting that Indo-U.S. relations have taken in the recent months, and the need to provide a better balance in the articulation of policy towards India. In the new perspective, the emphasis on the economic imperative is a little more pronounced than in the recent past. The differences on Kashmir, human rights and non-proliferation remain, but there is a stress on the positive elements of the relationship as well. The Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, Ms. Robin Raphel, went to some length yesterday to correct the impression that Indo-U.S. relations "have soured because of public disagreements over such issues as Kashmir." Speaking to the Asia Society here, Ms. Raphel stated that the "reality is much different," and "the fabric of our relations extends much beyond disagreements we may have." She referred to close cooperation in education, culture, science and technology, besides the rapidly growing commercial relationship. Ms. Raphel regretted that while the differences get most of the media attention, there is a vast positive effort to improve the relations that remains outside the spotlight. In an important assessment, Ms. Raphel noted that expanding Indo-U.S. economic relations could be the "harbinger of further growth throughout the region." Suggesting that the rapid economic integration of South Asia with the world will encourage deeper involvement of American business, generate prosperity and provide a better market for U.S. goods. "Everybody will win" in the process, she asserted. Balanced perspective: On the nuclear issue, too, Ms. Raphel, presented a balanced perspective. Accepting that both India and Pakistan are "nuclear capable," she noted that there are "large constituencies" in both countries who believe that nuclear capability is indispensable to their national security. The United States, according to Ms. Raphel, must "also recognise the importance of outside factors--concerns about China, Central Asia and Russia--in the South Asian security equation." She asserted, however, that the United States must convince the two countries that nuclear weapons make the sub-continent a "more dangerous and unstable neighbourhood." The United States must make this case "honestly and without discounting the security perceptions of each side," Ms. Raphel stated. She expressed the intention to work closely with India and Pakistan to "reduce tensions and enhance confidence." "The United States remains in favour of a multilateral process to promote arms control, non-proliferation and regional security," she said adding that India and Pakistan "already accept the multilateral approach in principle," only details had to be worked out. The U.S. emphasis on a multilateral approach is a clear vindication of the Indian position that non-proliferation cannot be addressed in a limited South Asian framework. It is also clear that the Pakistani proposal for a five-power conference on nuclear proliferation is now dead. Less focus on human rights: Whether she meant it or not, human rights and Kashmir came lower down in Ms. Raphel's listing of American priorities in South Asia, after economic cooperation, non-proliferation, and curbing narcotics trafficking. On human rights, she noted the "long tradition of affinity for the ideas of democratic government and respect for the rights of the individual." Stating that these "democracies and individual rights are in peril," Ms. Raphel called on the freely elected governments of South Asia to "effectively provide for the present needs and future hopes of their citizens." On Kashmir, Ms. Raphel's comparison of the situation in the Kashmir Valley to that in Afghanistan was a bit surprising. While asserting that Kashmir and Afghanistan will remain high on her agenda for South Asia, Ms. Raphel acknowledged that she is "keenly aware of the limits that constrain U.S. policy in both conflicts." She reiterated the now-standard formulation of the Clinton administration that Kashmir is a disputed territory, and called on India and Pakistan to resolve the issue through peaceful negotiations, while taking into account--as a practical matter--the wishes of the Kashmiri people. In a representation of the issue in non-offensive terms, Ms. Raphel said the United States regards India and Pakistan as good friends who "remain trapped in what appears to be a zero-sum game." "We would like to see them escape the tortured history of the conflict and deal with the problem based on the situation in Kashmir today." She also noted that the current American approach seems "doomed to be interpreted by one side or the other as a tilt." In her survey of the broader trends in the region, she noted that the forces of moderation had triumphed in South Asia, despite the recent fears to be contrary. She acknowledged the valuable contributions made by India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal to the on-going peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Cambodia, Kuwait, Mozambique and elsewhere.
