Prior to the conclusion of a fortnight visit to China, an international regulatory review mission from the IAEA stated that the NNSA has achieved these standards in the fields of structure, organization and resources, codes and regulations as well as in safety review, licensing and commissioning of nuclear power plants. In its opinion, the approach taken by the NNSA for its development "can be used as a good example for other countries developing a new nuclear power program." The seven-member group, led by Annick Carnino, head of the safety standards and co-ordination section, IAEA's division of nuclear safety, arrived here on April 23 at NNSA's invitation. During the visit, the group had talks with NNSA officials in Beijing and visited Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Shenzhen. The visit is IAEA's first review of China's regulatory practices in a decade, sources here said. Morris Rosen, assistant director general for nuclear safety of the IAEA, told XINHUA here today that the invitation for a visit itself shows that the Chinese Government is open-minded and willing to have international cooperation in the area of nuclear safety. The whole array of China's nuclear safety system is consistent with international practices, since China has based its legislation on NUSS [expansion unknown] safety series documents, Rosen said. The set of codes and regulations of the nuclear power plants at Qinshan and Guangdong conform with international standards, he added. The group advised its Chinese host to strengthen feedback on operating experience in nuclear power plants. At a reception here this evening, Huang Qitao, vice-minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, expressed his thanks for the group's hard work and their recommendations and suggestions. "These will help us to summarize past experience and make great contributions to the further enhancement of China's nuclear safety regulation, ensure safe operation of nuclear installations in China and the protection of the public and the environment," he said. The Chinese Government pays much attention to nuclear safety, and "safety first, quality first" is the basic guideline for developing nuclear energy, said Huang, who is also NNSA director general. "We will continue to work with governmental departments and organizations and continue to do our best to strengthen the cooperation with international organizations and foreign regulatory bodies and to improve nuclear safety regulation in China," he said.
