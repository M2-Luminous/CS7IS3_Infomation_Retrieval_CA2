In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, he said that if the ceasefire accord between Serbs and Muslims is carefully observed by the warring sides, the 22-month-old civil war will come to an end "within four or five months". The ceasefire accord was signed soon after the NATO ultimatum issued on February 9, following the bombing of a crowded Sarajevo marketplace on February 5, killing 68 people and injuring over 200. Karadzic said the bloodshed in Sarajevo has damaged the process of peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. Meanwhile, he accused NATO of issuing the ultimatum and threatening air strikes against Serb positions, saying that the West is playing power politics toward small nations by showing off their military forces. Karadzic said the Bosnian war could be ended if the international community treats all sides equally. He thanked the Chinese government for opposing foreign military intervention in Bosnia-Hercegovina and insisting on a political resolution to the conflict. Karadzic said the three ethnics (Serbs, Croats and Muslims) would be good neighbors provided they become separate states. He added that the relations between Serbs and Croats "are good now". He urged the United States and Germany to exert pressure on Muslims so that "a genuine peace can finally come". The Bosnian war has so far claimed 200,000 lives and produced millions of refugees. The war has also inflicted heavy blows to the economy in the former Yugoslavia.
