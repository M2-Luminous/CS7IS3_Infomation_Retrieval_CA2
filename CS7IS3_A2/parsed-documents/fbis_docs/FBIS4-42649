This purpose was favored by the cordial welcome granted by such newspapers as the WASHINGTON POST to the minister who knows how to "say things openly in clear and correct English." The endeavor also entailed some legitimate, though not easily negotiable, demands. The first issue was the demand for a permanent seat for the Italian Government on the UN Security Council, if and when the Germans and Japanese are admitted to that body. According to reports, Warren Christopher's sole reply was that it can be discussed. But in what terms? If it is true that Germany and Japan, unlike Italy, will not take part in UN military operations, it is also true that they are two crucial world economic superpowers. The second issue was the demand that the Italian Government be admitted soon to the "contact group" that decides on interventions in Bosnia, which has hitherto been confined to the United States, Russia, France, Britain, and Germany. Again, according to reports, Warren Christopher apparently replied by citing certain difficulties. So Antonio Martino, perhaps anxious to exert the maximum pressure, publicly acknowledged the possibility that Italian troops could serve as Blue Helmets in Bosnia as long as the action is conducted under NATO command and is definitely a peacekeeping operation of short duration after an agreement is reached among all the warring sides. But it is reasonable to express cautious and serious objections to such a prospect. On the basis of the disturbing experiences had hitherto, nobody can guarantee that agreements between the enemy sides will be honored, that the so-called peacekeeping operation would not degenerate and/or that it would be short-lived. As everyone knows, the theater of events lies across ancient borders between inaccessible or turbulent regions that have always been in discord -- those formerly governed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire and those that belonged to the Ottoman Empire. If the offer of Italian troops to serve as Blue Helmets is based on conditions that are bound to prove impossible, then this is merely a policy of gestures. If, however, the aim is also to challenge the unknown or to take chances, then the risks to the Italian people are incalculable. UN operations in areas at war or affected by guerrilla warfare are, under the regulations, entrusted to troops belonging to non- bordering nations that have never in the past been occupying powers. Germany is excluded from any military operation, on the basis of constitutional exclusions. For its part, Austria, neutral since 1955, is almost like Switzerland. Why send the Italians -- the sons or grandsons of the soldiers of 1941 -- to Bosnia? Better the French, British, Russians, or even Ukrainians. This geostrategic peninsula is like an aircraft carrier at the service of the United Nations and NATO over the Adriatic. Infantrymen are needed more in Calabria, against the tormenting internal guerrilla warfare of the Mafia. In the ghastly upheavals in the Balkans, the Croats, Serbs, and Muslims do not forget anything about their ancient conflicts or their respective ancient wrongs, let alone the wrongs of others. Anyone who has traveled widely through the lands of the now- dissolved Yugoslavia is well aware that the polite welcome afforded to Italians from Ljubljana to Skopje implies neither unconditional friendliness nor forgetfulness. Nobody wants to see a return of German, Austrian, or even Italian troops, with or without Blue Helmets. Indeed, nobody has forgotten the fact that the invasion by Hitler's Panzer divisions was prompted in April 1941 by Italy's surrender on the Greek-Albanian front, nor have they forgotten the partitioning of Slovenia between Hitler and Mussolini, or the handing over of the kingdom of Croatia by Pavelic to Duke of Spoleto Amedeo Savoia Aosta. Antonio Martino will of course have considered all this, but perhaps not enough. The question is not how a well-intentioned but risky operation should begin, but how it might end. Back in 1992 it was proposed that Italian troops be used at least in escorting humanitarian convoys bound for Bosnia. To the objection that the route would be long and full of obstacles, perhaps under cross-fire from Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian Muslims, some people replied that history is also composed of such bold expeditions as the wagon trains headed for the American West in the last century. This was an ill-considered and ill-augured example, since it evoked memories of the deadly ambush at Little Big Horn in which General Custer met his death. And that was the last that was heard of it, until now.
