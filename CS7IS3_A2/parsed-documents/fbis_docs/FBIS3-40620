China and Pakistan are not only neighboring nations, but also have extended trade, cultural, and historical relations. China has helped Pakistan a lot in its effort for economic development. Pakistan should be especially proud about the dedication shown by Chinese engineers in building the Silk Road. This highway has helped connect both countries. Whenever there were bad times for Pakistan, China always extended a helping hand. Since U. S. military and economic aid to Pakistan has been stopped, Pakistan is looking for an alternate source of help, and China has never shown any hesitation in helping us. China is working on many plans with us to make Pakistan's defense stronger and more stable. Among these, the building of tanks tops the list. Despite U. S. anger and unhappiness, Pakistan has made important progress in building missiles with China's help. The HATF-1 and HATF-2 are worth mentioning here. The United States is also very angry at China for providing missile technology to Pakistan, and is threatening China every other day. The friendship and brotherhood of the Chinese are praiseworthy, because they were not affected by these threats. With the help of Chinese expertise and technical assistance, Pakistan can progress in every area. Though the United States is blocking these efforts at every occasion, Pakistan should keep the Chinese example in front of it and not accept any foreign pressure. The way China responded to the combined U. S. and former Soviet Union pressure can be a guiding principle for Pakistan. Because of the close relationship between Pakistan and China, a new series of conspiracies is being hatched at the international level. On one side, there are indications of new external interference in Pakistan's northern region, and on the other, a solution to the Kashmir problem is being worked out that would change Kashmir into an independent country and a United States military base. This way, the United States would use the base to carry out its conspiracies against Pakistan and China. After the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the world's balance of power has been destroyed, and a new rivalries and power struggles have started. In order to protect ourselves from it, it is important that a new power bloc composed of China, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Central Asian Muslim Republics be established. Pakistan can play an important role, because of its geographic location, in bringing China and other countries together. The government of Pakistan should take the necessary steps immediately to realize this goal. Only this way can we counter the challenge of the New World order.
