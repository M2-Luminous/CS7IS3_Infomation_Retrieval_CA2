Local Serbs refused to attend a meeting on the previously agreed terms. The most controversial questions concerned the agenda and issues in connection with delegations and the presence of Croatian journalists. Hrvoje Sarinic, the head of the Croatian delegation to talks with the Serbs, explains why the discussions were canceled. [Begin Sarinic recording] The Serbs gave as a pretext our request that you, the media, should be present. My stand was very firm. I said that if the media are not present then the Croatian delegation will not come to the talks either. I think that the presence of the media is an indication of civilized behavior -- I would even say a question of general culture -- pardon me if I speak sharply -- and of decency. Why do I say decency? Because it was my initiative to invite the journalists from the UNPA. Your colleagues came here to witness the signing of an agreement on the cessation of hostilities. Enough said about this; let there be no speculation about who is to blame for the talks not taking place. Of course, the Serbs will most likely try to shift the blame on to us. I can say that had it not been this reason they would have thought up some other one. At this stage they are clearly not prepared to talk. If they were to talk they would want to discuss certain points of the agenda which they would like to stick to -- and these would certainly not be acceptable to the Croatian side. In particular, after the Zagreb agreement they interpreted the accord as if they had been given a state and now they have to solve some vital problems, such as water, electricity, equipment, and so on -- problems that are normally solved by other states, such as Italy, Austria -- among themselves. This is of course a stand that Croatia cannot accept and that we will not and cannot accept. [end recording]
