The new laws regularise ordinances promulgated by the caretaker government in September last and puts new and more powerful weapons in the hands of the government with which to fight the evil. One of these provides for death penalty and also the confiscation of the assets of convicted offenders. The other two remove certain deficiencies in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1930. Knowing the magnitude and complexity of the problem, the laws will be welcomed by all those who have been demanding more stringent punishment for drug traffickers and their minions. While doubts may be entertained about how effective a deterrent the death penalty will be, the provision relating to the confiscation of assets will surely be seen as a potent measure because it is bound to have some chastening effect on those criminals who may not be unduly averse to the idea of being sent to prison for a year or two but who would certainly be deterred by the thought of losing their considerable fortunes as a punishment for their drugs-related crimes. Doubt will nevertheless persist about the ultimate effectiveness of these laws if they are no enforced in the same spirit in which they have been enacted. In deterring crime the awareness of the inexorability of the course of law is far more important than the severity of punishment. This is especially true in this country where most laws are rendered impotent by a combination of corruption and slothful enforcement. Unfortunately, this is even more true in the case of drug-related offences in which the culprits very often are influential people or enjoy powerful patronage through sheer money-power and influence. The drug barons, who have powerful links and lobbies, can dodge the law without much difficulty. Therefore, what is of the utmost importance is the will to strictly enforce these laws. Only the certainty of being caught, tried and punished can instill the necessary fear in the hearts of the offenders. The need for a sustained and determined drive to eradicate the drug menace is all too apparent. Over two million of Pakistan's citizens, including women and youth, are victims of heroin and other deadly drugs; the country's image and reputation are being tarnished in foreign lands as a producer, processor and supplier of different kinds of narcotic drugs. The new and reinforced laws should give the government the punch and power it needs to get at the purveyors of poison, bring them to justice and break the back of their well-entrenched operational networks. But the enforcers will have to be careful to ensure that the powers are not applied only against the pedlars and other small-time operators because they can be apprehended more easily than the big fish who really control them. If the drug barons, whose identities are not unknown to the authorities, are allowed to go scot-free either because of negligence or legal lacunae, the purpose of enacting stringent laws would be frustrated. The government would also do well to consider integrating the different laws, said to number about a dozen, under which drug- related offenders can be apprehended and punished, into one comprehensive and forceful law that would eliminate the possibility of any offender, however influential and powerful, evading arrest and punishment. Drug enforcement officials would welcome such a law in place of the several which now guide their activities and which only add to the confusion and hinder enforcement. Of equal importance is the need to keep a strict watch on the activities and modus operandi of the various groups involved in the deadly trade--drug barons, carriers and pushers. They are well-organised, have at their disposal huge wealth, are spurred by enormous profits from relatively small investments and have powerful links and patronage; to facilitate their work; they cannot be restrained merely by enacting laws, however strict. A totally different approach, backed by scientific methods of detection, trailing, intelligence gathering, surveillance and so on and, above all, by an indomitable will to succeed, is what it takes to win a decisive battle against the scourge of drugs.
