More than 20 Russian newspapers decided yesterday to stop publishing from January 11 to 17 when the new parliament opens its first session and U.S. President Bill Clinton visits Russia. The move was designed to protest against a November 25 government decree which would raise the printing costs by five times. To avert the press revolt, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today held talks with the editors-in-chief of these newspapers and decided to suspend the decree.
