Does that mean that the president's office is resting as well? I know that many of the president's aides are also resting or undergoing treatment -- Kostikov, Ryurikov, Ilyushin -- none of them are in the Kremlin. Who is in charge of the state in the president's absence? [Filatov] Well, firstly, the president himself is in charge, because as you know he went, as he said, both to rest and to work. He is indeed working every day. Every day we receive signed decrees and orders from him, various instructions. Every day we speak to him on the telephone and consult him on various issues. So firstly, he has the entire situation in the country in hand. But the prime minister and the government are working, and naturally the president's office and administration are working as well. So we are all working. [Medvedev] At the moment a second wave of rumors seems to be spreading. In the corridors of the State Duma, for example, these rumors were whipped up fairly actively on Friday. They concern Boris Nikolayevich's health. Do you speak to him often by telephone? Because people are even saying that the president nearly came back to Moscow in secret. [Filatov] One of the unpleasant features or actions of the opposition that I have clearly perceived over the last two years at least, has been to inflate the question of the president's health, and especially to raise this question at the moment when the president is on vacation. And sometimes, I have a suspicion that these people want above all else to wreck his vacation -- to summon him back early from vacation, for example, or just to spoil his mood on vacation. I would like to make use of your camera to say: Give the president a chance to rest. He is a human being too, and he has a right to rest for 10 days or so twice a year, and to rest in peace and quiet, so that he is not tormented by these entirely superfluous and unnecessary suspicions being blown up. I can understand why -- in order to create an atmosphere of nervousness in society. In this instance, I think that if society is driven into such a nervous state with the help of such rumors, it could result in some sort of disruption. Well, we have had enough disruptions. Naturally, everyone feels a certain anxiety about the way our reforms will go in the future. But nevertheless, let us hope we can go on without any of those upheavals, which unfortunately, certain forces are trying to lead us into. You see, they are deliberately trying to remind us of those events, suggesting that they have thought up a new way to do everything in Russia. But I think that if we do indeed proceed from civic accord, if we proceed from the fact that we want to achieve something as a society, I think we should get through the year all right.
