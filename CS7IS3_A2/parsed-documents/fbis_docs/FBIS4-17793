The headquarters believe that Azerbaijan will make use of the cease-fire agreement for replenishing its forces and launching a new large-scale offensive. However, the final say on the truce is to be said by the Karabakh political leaders, whose official position is to be announced within the next few hours. Grachev's cease-fire plan, proposed during the talks in Moscow with Azerbaijani parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev, was supported by Azerbaijan. On the same day, Grachev got in touch with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosian and, to quote the Armenian president's aid Levon Zurabian, asked him to influence Karabakh. Zurabian said that Armenia could not accept or reject the reached agreement, because the conflict had to do with Azerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh, and that Armenia could only use its influence. "The final decision must be taken by Nagorny Karabakh," he said.
