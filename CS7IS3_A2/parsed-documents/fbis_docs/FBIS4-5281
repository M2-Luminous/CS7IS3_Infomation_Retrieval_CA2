His comments came in response to North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development, an issue that heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula after Pyongyang refused to allow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to check nuclear sites. His remarks indicated that the government should take into account the situation in North Korea in its continuing review of the Guidelines for Defense Build-Up. On the need to defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula, the government source stressed the need to think of ways which would lead North Korea to act moderately. He said: "North Korea is currently in a state of starvation and Chinese food aid is needed."
