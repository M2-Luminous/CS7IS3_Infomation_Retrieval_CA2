The cabinet should discuss about 20 points, including the new version of the defense doctrine. [passage omitted] Michal Tvarozek reports: [Tvarozek] [passage omitted] I asked Defense Minister Pavol Kanis for an interview. First of all, I put it to him that the defense doctrine was already on the agenda of the previous government -- the government dealt with it at the beginning of March this year. Has anything in the doctrine been changed by the Moravcik cabinet? [Begin recording] [Kanis] This new version of the doctrine is quite different in that the draft passed by the government today, albeit passed with the proviso that certain appended comments should be taken into account, spells out clearly the foreign policy affiliation of the Slovak Republic. The emphasis is on closer relations with and on the future membership of western European and transatlantic defense structures. The new version includes a foreign policy section and many things in it have been clarified and are now expressed clearly. There are none of those general cliches we saw in the variant discussed by the previous government. [Tvarozek] At the moment, an all-European defense system is being set up. Does it mean that our defense doctrine has a time limit? [Kanis] This is an important point: just for how long should the defense doctrine be valid? We are going through a stage when we are coming closer to Western European and transatlantic defense structures and our defense doctrine will therefore be valid up to the moment that we become a member of these structures. As soon as we become a member of these structures we will adopt their military doctrine as well. If we take into account the fact that the Slovak Republic has the weakest military potential, the weakest economic and even the weakest human potential, then our thinking must recognize that the first prerequisite of our successful defense is our membership of some collective defense system. In other words, one has to emphasize that it is, above all, our successes in foreign policy and in foreign-defense policy that constitute a guarantee of our security. [Tvarozek] In connection with this document, the government today also discussed the so-called presentation document [prezentacny dokument]. What is it? [Kanis] Just as the defense doctrine is a kind of pillar as regards our internal political activity and our own forces, the presentation document is the concrete expression of the Partnership for Peace framework document -- and therefore the second pillar on which our security is based. This document is extremely important because it gives concrete expression to the framework document and in fact also expresses our self-projection and self-reflection regarding our security up to the end of the millennium. The defense doctrine and the presentation document therefore constitute the basic documents of our security and defense policy. On their basis a specific security policy for this millennium will be implemented. [end recording]
