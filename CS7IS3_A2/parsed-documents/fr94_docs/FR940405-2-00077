FmHA projects must also contact the HUD field office that normally handles the jurisdiction in which the project is located. A copy of the Notice amendment and Notice H&hyph;93&hyph;71 will be available to those who request it. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice provides notification to interested parties that the Office of Housing has amended HUD Notice H&hyph;93&hyph;71, which provides procedures to HUD field offices of advertising for, receipt of, and processing requests for section 8 funds for service coordinators. Additional funds are available for service coordinators in Fiscal Year 1994 for qualifying projects. The amendment to HUD Notice H&hyph;93&hyph;71 (entitled ``Processing of Requests for section 8 Funds for Service Coordinators in section 8, 202, 202/8, 221 and 236 Projects and Monitoring of Approved Requests_Fiscal Year (FY) 1994'') extends funding for service coordinators to section 8 projects (including FMHA section 515/8) with project-based subsidy and section 221(d) BMIR and section 236 projects without project-based subsidy. Available funding is $22 million for section 202 and 202/8, $15 million for section 8, and $10 for section 221(d) BMIR and section 236 projects without subsidy. All requests must be for projects which are housing for the elderly and disabled. Eligible projects include any building within a mixed-use project that was designated for occupancy by elderly persons, or persons with disabilities at its inception, or although not so designated, for which the eligible owner gives preferences in tenant selection (with HUD approval) for all units in the eligible project to eligible elderly persons or persons with disabilities. There are three new dollar allocation plans and a new request submission and review schedule. A service coordinator is a social service staff person hired by the project owner/management company. The coordinator is responsible for assuring that the elderly, especially those who are frail, and disabled residents of the project are linked to the supportive services they need to continue living independently in that project. Dated: March 28, 1994. Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.
