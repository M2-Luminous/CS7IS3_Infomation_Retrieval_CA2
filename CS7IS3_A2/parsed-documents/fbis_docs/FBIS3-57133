IF: How did you get on with the President while discussing the make up of a new cabinet? Is it possible to speak in terms of a "government crisis?" CHERNOMYRDIN: To start with your second question, I think it is not at all serious to talk of a government crisis as such. Of course, in a society as divided and turbulent as ours is there are forces seeking to sow the seeds of chaos and panic so as to fish in troubled waters. But all of it is simpler than that in reality. Under the country's new constitution, the Prime Minister submits a list of cabinet members to the head of state. Naturally, the President and I had to discuss at length both the key cabinet figures and a new government team as a whole, but there is nothing unusual about that. As in any team, there is a clash of interests in a government. So we tried to pick up a team of the like-minded individuals. I hope I have managed to do so after all. To offset any speculations about the new government's make up, I would like to say this: I myself am to work with these people, not someone else, so I will be personally responsible for my choice. Of course, my consultations with Boris Yeltsin were far from smooth but we had both sought the same goal: to create a team of professionals seeking to update the country through reforms. IF: Much was said about incompatible differences during the latest cabinet shake up. What is the cause and substance of those differences if there were any? CHERNOMYRDIN: To begin with, there have always been differences and no one tried to hide them. On the contrary, there was much said and written about them, that the divisions on ways of embracing reforms had deepened. But all of this is in the past. But I think it is more important to realize one thing: the country, the society and economy are in a difficult period of transition and each stage has its own logic and priorities. The time has now come to focus attention on curbing production slump in all economic sectors as the only way to resolve the gamut of social problems facing the country. What sort of reforms or democracy can one talk about at a time when huge enterprises and private businesses come to a standstill while coal miners, oil workers, doctors and journalists go on strike? When private farmers, cooperatives and state farms are starved of cash to buy equipment, fuel, fertilizers and cornseed in the run up to this year's sowing campaign? No matter how progressive, theory as such cannot salvage a huge country from shortages of food, energy and commodities and by definition, from social upheavals which will make the reforms next to impossible. If we fail to boost up production, we will fail to salvage the newly-emerging market economy. This is an axiom. IF: Don't you think that a cabinet must be made up of people upholding different views on the direction of reforms? CHERNOMYRDIN: A government called upon to run a huge country at a hard time such as the present is not a debating society. This is obvious. There is no time for "flash in the pan"-style discussions. I prefer a team of the like-minded individuals, which is alone capable of acting with a fair amount of efficiency. But this does not mean we are against any sensible opposition provided it offers its own cure for the problem. More importantly, we prefer precisely this style of work. Some observers try in vain to suggest that Chernomyrdin had ostensibly formed a government of silent consensus. This is not true and I hope the country will be able to ascertain this in the next few months. IF: Do you think the latest shake up will lead to some corrections in the pace of reforms? If so, what changes are likely to be made? CHERNOMYRDIN: It seems we have been carried away too far with putting labels on leading politicians such as reformist democrats or hardline upholders of the state planning and so on. This leads to a situation when the role of a personality is blown out of proportion. It is clear to all and sundry that the reform is past the point of no return. The main task now is to try to enforce reforms with the least possible sacrifice for the society, each individual and each household. There is no tragedy if one government member is replaced by another. This is a normal process. Besides, we would not take up the job if we were uncertain about our ability to halt the production slump. There is an abundance of those who criticize us but not many who are prepared to do the daily work, something that we are ready to cope with it. IF: The new government is widely described as being made up of a managerial corps lacking an explicit macroeconomic policy. Does the cap fit? CHERNOMYRDIN: I do want to deprive those cap passers of their daily bread though some of their descriptions are far from being decent at times. Perhaps, it would be more correct to describe the new cabinet as a team of pragmatists aiming to fulfil concrete tasks. But it would be absolutely wrong to say we are out to throw macroeconomic approaches overboard. The government is not alone, it leans upon an enormous scientific basis and experts of world renown. This means, we will be able to co-relate global issues with the solving of day-to-day tasks without which the country will not be able to survive. IF: In what way do you think the emergence of a new government will affect Russia's relations with international financial institutions and the problem of the country's foreign debt? CHERNOMYRDIN: I state with full responsibility that new government appointments will in no way affect Russia's obligations to its foreign partners. Russia will continue to service its debt in line with the conditions and schedule set by the IMF, the World Bank and other financial structures of the West. The same applies to our commitments in respect of separate countries. Our partners should not have even the slightest cause for concern. Russia's policy on this remains unchanged and does not depend on separate cabinet members. President Yeltsin himself acts as guarantor of this. IF: What do you make of a sharp fall in the ruble rate in the past few days? CHERNOMYRDIN: I think it must be clear to all by now that the setback earlier this week had nothing to do either with the economic situation or government actions. The ruble gained somewhat on Thursday which indicates that the panic caused by a government reshuffle is now subsiding. The banks' behavior at the currency market also indicate that panic buying of the dollar was artificial because of being caused by irresponsible statements by some of the government staff members.
