FBIS4-1264 "drafr080_d_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-080 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Zimbabwe Minister: No Commission Ordered on Land Scandal Minister: No Commission Ordered on Land Scandal MB2204095594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0850 GMT 22 Apr 94 MB2204095594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Harare April 22 SAPA -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has not, contrary to reports, ordered a commission of inquiry into a land-grab scandal involving senior party and government officials, a daily newspaper in Harare reported on Friday [22 April]. He had made his own enquiries and that was the end of the matter, it said. The DAILY GAZETTE was quoting Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa on an earlier remark to a human rights convention nearly two weeks ago that Mr Mugabe had ordered an inquiry into disclosures that state-owned farms, many of them intended for resettling thousands of peasant farmers, had been distributed among officials including two cabinet ministers, top officers of the army, air force, police and intelligence services and senior civil servants. "The word inquiry does not automatically translate into a commission," the GAZETTE quoted Mr Dabengwa on Friday. "The president went on to enquire about the scheme himself and got the reply he wanted, resulting in the action he has taken." Last week Mr Mugabe announced he had cancelled all leases to the estimated 180 state-owned farms, and denied there was a scandal. Only a few political figures had benefited, he said. The independent press here has named 15, and there are known to be at least five more. Observers say Mr Dabengwa's remarks are likely to deepen dismay over the way in which the government is handling the scandal, and that it is clear Mr Mugabe does not intend to give it the same concern he did to the 1989 controversy when ruling party politicians profiteered in a used-car racket. Then he appointed a commission of inquiry headed by a judge that resulted in five cabinet ministers resigning in disgrace for cheating and lying, one of them taking his own life. Land is regarded as the most explosive issue in Zimbabwean politics, and probably the basis of Mr Mugabe's political platform because he regularly promises to correct the inequities of the colonial past. At independence the ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] party promised 165,000 families would be settled in five years. Fourteen years later, about 100,000 have been settled and vast tracts of land bought by government are lying idle.
