Moreover, he asserted that there is no problem with the Ecuadoran Government. The minister stated: "The Peruvian ambassador in Quito does not need to be confirmed in his post. Ambassadors are appointed, and cannot be confirmed in their posts. Ponce therefore continues to be Peruvian ambassador to Ecuador until the Peruvian Government decides otherwise." Goldenberg said that the relationship between the two countries is satisfactory. "Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes, with whom I met in Washington recently where we both voted for Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as new OAS secretary general, can himself tell you that." Regarding Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's visit, Goldenberg explained that it is to return the visit he paid to Buenos Aires last December. Among the subjects on the agenda, he said, are the arrangements for President Carlos Saul Menem's upcoming visit. Moreover, he announced that a group of Peruvian Government officials who belong to the Commission for the Promotion of Private Investment (Copri) will shortly travel to Buenos Aires. He said that "Argentine businessmen want to participate in the privatization process," and then mentioned that this will be another issue he will discuss with Di Tella.
