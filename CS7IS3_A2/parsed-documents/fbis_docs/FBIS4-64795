Leaders' Popularity Surveyed The results of a poll conducted jointly by the Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE and the Lisbon Catholic University among 1,066 individuals (no further details provided) were published in the 22 April edition of O INDEPENDENTE. Respondents were asked to rate political leaders on a scale of 1 (worst possible rating) to 10 (best). Prime Minister Cavaco Silva led the list with 8.2 points, followed by Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio Guterres with 7.6, Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) leader Manuel Monteiro, and Communist Party (PCP) leader Carlos Carvalhas with 5.5. Respondents were also asked to evaluate the government's actions. Some 7.8 percent thought these were "good," 51.8 percent thought they were "reasonably good," and 37.9 percent said they were "bad." When rating Cavaco Silva's qualities as compared with Guterres's, 36.4 percent of the respondents said the prime minister is "competent," compared with 24.6 percent who thought so for Guterres. Some 49.4 percent thought Cavaco Silva is "intelligent," compared with 34.3 percent for Guterres. The prime minister was also thought more "honest," more "sincere," more "efficient," and more "cultured" than Guterres, losing to the PS leader in "tolerance" and "humanism." The prime minister's popularity, however, has apparently not transferred to his party, for the poll indicated that if legislative elections were held at this time, the PS would win with 36.6 percent of the vote, followed by the PSD with 25.8 percent, the PCP with 6.3 percent, the CDS with 5.6 percent, other parties with 1 percent, and 24.7 percent undecided. When respondents were asked their preference for president, former President Ramalho Eanes and Cavaco Silva were both chosen by 15.9 percent, followed by Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio with 14.3 percent, Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes with 10.5 percent, Eurodeputy Lucas Pires with 6.5 percent, CDS luminary Adriano Moreira with 3.2 percent, and former PSD Minister Eurico de Melo with 2.8 percent. Some 18.8 percent chose none of them, and 13 percent did not know or did not answer. The government's actions on the economy were rated "very bad" and "bad" by 59.1 percent of the respondents, compared with 3.4 percent who termed them "good" or "very good," and 36.4 percent who considered them "reasonably good." Poll on European Parliament Elections The 14 April Lisbon weekly VISAO published the results of a Marktest/VISAO poll conducted between 12 and 30 March in the Greater Lisbon and Greater Porto areas among 812 individuals, with a 4.6 percent margin of error. Respondents were asked their party preference for the 12 June European Parliament elections. Of the 455 respondents who said they would vote, 47.9 percent would cast their ballot for the PS, while 28.1 percent would vote for the PSD. The CDS (11 percent) and the PCP (4.8 percent) followed. Some 27.3 percent of the respondents did not know if they would vote. Public Opinion of 25 April Revolution Surveyed In view of the forthcoming celebration of the 25 April revolution that in 1974 freed Portugal from its period of dictatorship, the 20 April Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS published the results of a poll (no details provided) in which respondents were asked to rate political leaders who most contributed to the democratization and development of Portugal. Some 33.8 percent chose President Mario Soares. He was followed by the late Prime Minister Sa Carneiro (15.8 percent), Prime Minister Cavaco Silva (10.9 percent), former President Ramalho Eanes (7.6 percent), and former PCP leader Alvaro Cunhal (7.4 percent). Another question focused on whether the goals of democratization and development of the 25 April revolution have been achieved. Some 24.4 percent said democratization has been achieved fully, 46 percent thought it was achieved partially, 9.5 percent said it was not achieved at all, and 20.1 percent did not know or did not answer. Only 11.4 percent said the development goal has been achieved, 48.6 percent that it was partially achieved, 19.2 percent thought it was not achieved, and 20.9 percent did not know or did not answer.
