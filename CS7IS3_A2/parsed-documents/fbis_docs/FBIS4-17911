Li said it is possible to enlarge the network of Chinese shops in Kazakhstan and joint trading ventures only provided the two countries make profit. He also emphasised that the quality of commodities which are supplied directly by state producers will be much higher and cheaper than that of those being delivered by profiteers from China. As far as China's possible participation in the modernisation of the Karaganda metallurgical mill is concerned, the Chinese premier said it is essential at first to carry out an expert examination to determine the economic efficiency of the mill and gauge the competitive power of its products. Speaking about transit transportation from Kazakhstan to Pakistan, which is being effected via Turkey and Iran, Li admitted that routes across China would reduce transportation distance by half. He expressed understanding of this aspect and suggested that the respective ministries of the two countries examine the matter. Li took up a similar attitude as regards shipping along the Irtysh and Ili Rivers and the Khorgos Free Economic Area and its status. The premiers of Kazakhstan and China expressed satisfaction with this exchange of views.
