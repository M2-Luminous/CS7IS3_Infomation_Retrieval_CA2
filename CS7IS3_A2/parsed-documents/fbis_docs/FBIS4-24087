FBIS4-24087 "drafr121_e_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-121 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Factional Fighting Continues Around Buchanan Factional Fighting Continues Around Buchanan LPC Denies ECOMOG Supplying Arms AB2206212894 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 22 Jun 94 AB2206212894 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] There is apparently no end to the fighting in Liberia. Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] seems to be involved in at least two conflicts that continue to endanger any efforts to establish peace and hold general elections in Liberia. Taylor claims he keeps getting attacked by the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] in the southeast. At the same time, the Armed Forces of Liberia, AFL, are frequently involved in battles with the NPFL. The latest seems to be control for the approaches to the port of Buchanan. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: United Nations officials say the fighting started yesterday, and that by this morning the NPFL had taken control of a section of the Buchanan Highway around the Bible Industrial Academy. According to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], the highway is now closed to civilian traffic. AFL defense spokesman Arthur Dennis says the current round of fighting has broken out because Charles Taylor has ordered his NPFL fighters to blow up all bridges on the Buchanan Highway. Dennis claimed the NPFL had been beaten back and he warned: Any further attacks on the AFL will force us to pursue the NPFL all the way to their headquarters at Gbarnga. Meanwhile, NPFL radio says Charles Taylor has ordered his fighters to take up positions on the Buchanan Highway to prevent the Liberian Peace Council from using this road to transport weapons to its fighters. Well, it is not only Charles Taylor who complains about the activities of the LPC, who are not signatories of the Cotonou Accord. Taylor claims the Nigerian contingent in ECOMOG is supplying the LPC with arms. The human rights organizations are unhappy with LPC's operations, and the United Nations' representative, Trevor Gordon-Somers, last week expressed concern about the LPC. Well, the LPC's chairman, (George Boley), called us up and Robin White asked him what he made of the allegations against the LPC. [Begin recording] [(Boley)] Robin, let me make one thing very clear. First of all, we have never received any supply of arms and ammunition from ECOMOG, particularly not the Nigerian ECOMOG. These are fabrications that are, you know, calculated to destroy the reputation of ECOMOG. We made it clear: Many of the weapons we capture are captured from the NPFL. They are our main supply of arms and ammunition, seriously. [White] But, it is not just Charles Taylor who is making this accusation. Human rights groups are saying the same. [(Boley)] Those human rights groups, Robin, that are making these claims, don't know what they are talking about. When the lady came, the Gail Fleischman -- whatever she is -- came to Buchanan, she never ventured beyond LPC lines. [White] But, even Mr. Gordon-Somers, a special UN representative, he has expressed concern about your activities. [(Boley)] Mr. Gordon-Somers is someone who does not know precisely what he is doing in Liberia. Let me repeat, Mr. Gordon-Somers is somebody who, by my judgment and perhaps the judgment of many other Liberians, typically does not even know the geography of this country, let alone what his mission is in Liberia. [White] So, you are, what, saying he is lying or just ignorant? [(Boley)] I think it is both. [White] Have you been to see him? [(Boley)] I have met Mr. Gordon Somers. [White] And, what happened? [(Boley)] Mr. Gordon Somers, as I said, does not seem to know what he is doing. The man continues to be a part of a propaganda machine against the LPC. We have informed Mr. Gordon-Somers on many occasions what we are, and Mr. Gordon-Somers continues to tell the world that the LPC continues to attack the NPFL, which is not true. [White] A lot of people wonder, Mr. (Boley), now, how come it is that you have so suddenly sprung up and that you are so well armed? [(Boley)] Look, I have said to you.... [pauses] Let me put this issue to rest once and for all, we have never received any consignment of weapons from ECOMOG, generally, and from the Nigerian ECOMOG, particularly. We are as armed as the NPFL. I have told you, Mr. Taylor has been the major supply of our arms and ammunition -- we captured his weapons in Greenville, Sinoe County, we captured his arsenal in (Olak) -- and every other place we have gone, NPFL is going to run, and NPFL has been our major supplier. Yes, there is an embargo. How does Mr. Taylor continue to get weapons even today? He cannot point any accusing finger at anybody because he brought the arms in, we are simply recipients of what he has brought into the country. [end recording]
