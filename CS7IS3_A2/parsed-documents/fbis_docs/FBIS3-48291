"Results were not greatly achieved in the first half." Howls about loans not increasing are being raised in every city bank. Due to the sluggish economy which has been more prolonged than expected, all that meets their eyes is the need for non-expansionary funds. It is a situation where the little demand for funds has been absorbed by government affiliates. In Greek mythology, in Hades after his death, Sisyphus, the king of Corinth, had to roll up to the top of a mountain a rock that constantly rolled down. The rock rolled down no matter how many times he rolled it up. Loans today are truly the rock of Sisyphus. Plans Unfulfilled The various city banks are not presenting absurd loan increase goals such as half-year net increase of 1 trillion yen as happened in the bubble era. At most, they say "about a 3 percent increase on a fiscal year basis." (person in charge of domestic operations planning) It is about half the level compared to the time of the peak of the bubble. In performance, however, even viewing the loan trends announced by the Bank of Japan, the figures continued to be about 1 percent throughout the first half. Why have they been unable to fulfill the plan? The head offices of all the banks say in unison, "the greatest factor was that the economic forecast scenario at the time of setting the plan was greatly out of kilter." In February to March this year, they had the view that "in so far as the summit in July and House of Councilors election are close at hand, the government will embark on a full-scale bolstering of the economy. Due to this, the tone of the economy will turn to recovery in summer and thereafter, and we will enter a complete recovery situation in the second half." (person in charge of planning at high-ranking city bank). In reality, however, they could not meet those expectations at all. Corresponding to the Loan Spread Of course, those on the scene did not sit and wait because the economy is bad. In the meantime, they offered loan terms less than short-term prime if they were to make the most of lending spread with market interest as the base. Moreover, if they incorporated a yen-yen swap in this, low interest, medium- to long-term loans on a 3 percent interest level would be possible. With these attractive lending terms as a weapon, a life or death sales effort centering on large corporations developed. However, large corporations have not changed their policy of basically curbing borrowing. Yet it is a fact that "there were quite a few successful cases of converting existing short-term prime borrowing to long-term fixed borrowing or narrowing the target to [acquire] redemption funds for such as warrant bonds or convertible debentures." (person in charge of loan planning at high-ranking city bank) Loans below prime rate are taboo in so far as "once they are executed, it takes several years to return to principal." Consequently, banks must concentrate on spread lending other than prime loans. In the operations office of one bank, it was such that "in the first half, spread lending on a limited basis accounted for 70 to 80 percent." However, all the banks have a line up of the same kinds of commodities. So, the next thing that happens is interest competition by reducing the spread margin. It is said that at one time, "excessive competition was seen such that it closely resembled the bubble era." (city bank operations department) However, a strong rival besides other banks exists in this field. It is life insurers who have been troubled by fund employment difficulties. Voices of chagrin are heard everywhere that "regardless of reduction in the spread margin, the level of a 0.5 percent addition to the swap rate is our limit, no matter how much we try. Life insurers, however, are offering an addition of 0.1 to 0.2 percent even with medium- to long-term ones with a 3 to 5 year period, and they are snatching away loan cases one by one." (person in charge of loan planning) This life insurance offensive, however, was conspicuous in early spring, but recently seems to have disappeared. Rather, those in charge at various banks vehemently say the problem is "the government affiliates such as the Export-Import Bank of Japan and the Japan Development Bank." It is the term period rather than the interest level in which they are unable to compete with government loans. That is because "with low interest like today, an interest risk extending for a term period of 10 years cannot be borne at all by private institutions." (same) Of course, that does not mean a situation is occurring where government loans are "devouring" even existing loans by private financial institutions. However, "the actual situation is that while fund demand is very meager today, we are steadily pursuing cases of 500 million yen and 1 billion yen and somehow linking them to loans. If government affiliates continue to execute loans of 1 billion yen or 2 billion yen on the strength of advantageous lending terms, it inevitably will be a big threat in a limited field." (person in charge of domestic operations planning) Strengthening of Internal Bank Structure On the other hand, what about the medium- to small-sized business market? There is a strong feeling that they "would like to increase loans aggressively in the medium to small market" only to the class of customer that has a high degree of dependency on bank borrowing. (person in charge of loan planning) However, they "cannot steadily loan to firms with a continued deficit." (same) If this economic situation continues, naturally "clients to whom they can loan will be very few in themselves." On the other hand, it is a deadlock situation in which great success cannot be expected in so far as other banks also are stampeding to the few firms with favorable performance. Among them, stories have been heard that up until last year when other banks changed to a negative lending policy in order to reduce assets as far as BIS measures were concerned, they contrived to contact them and were able to skillfully take over the business, but such examples were extremely few. At this point, the demand for funds that is increasing is "non-expansionary." (high-ranking bank). They are "funds for lump sum retirement allowances due to plant closures or employee reduction programs" or "clothing-related inventory has increased because of the cold summer and it is borrowing to provide for those funds." (person in charge of loan planning) Looking back over this war situation in the first half, there is a move among the high ranking banks to attempt to correct downward the plans for the second half. However, that does not mean that they are greatly pessimistic. The move by firms to reduce borrowing due to the collapse of liquidity in hand, which had continued since last year, has calmed down at this point. In so far as surplus funds have become meager on the corporate side also, borrowing for the portion to pay off commitments should be a necessity. The view is strong that "in the future, the loan balance probably will not turn to a net decrease." (person in charge of domestic operations planning) However, it is viewed that "the results from economic measures and the drop in the official rate will appear in the spring of next year or thereafter at the earliest." (high-ranking Kansai-related city bank) The fact has not changed that demand for expansionary funds cannot be expected in the second half. Therefore, the various banks are prepared to deal with the second half, strengthening loan business capability by applying their hand to internal bank structure. Specifically, it will be in the fashion of "raising the weight of loans in the performance rating, or increasing public relations personnel." (high-ranking bank) "While the economy is sluggish, expansion of markets for sales growth, or needs for various kinds of business information will rather increase. Therefore, if we fully demonstrate the bank information function and meet these customers' needs, we should be able to link it to new acquisitions." (person in charge of loan plans) The only way to do that is "return to the foundation of lending operations, grasp the commodities which firms are handling and their vendors, and steadily grasp demands for funds." (same) Every bank firmly feels the need to look back once more on the foundation of lending operations that was forgotten in the bubble.
