He attended Friday's White House ceremony at which the documents were signed. Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, and Kresimir Zubak, a representative of the Bosnian Croats, appended their signatures to the documents. On the same day Churkin arranged a news conference, at which he declared that the agreement on a new Muslim-Croat state formation, and especially the agreement on arranging confederative ties between it and Croatia were of an interim nature. It was a vital condition for a true settlement in Bosnia that it preserved its territorial integrity and that the Bosnian Serbs, therefore, took part in the peace process, the high-ranking Russian diplomat explained. Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent about whether the agreement on confederative relations between the new federation and Croatia might be an obstacle to the inclusion of the Serbs within the federation, Churkin said: I don't think so, since the agreement on a confederation with Croatia is of an interim nature. Equally interim is the agreement on the formation of the actual federation. In other words, both documents may be changed if the Bosnian Serbs decide to become involved in implementing them. I am sure that the Serbs will demand some changes that will be in keeping with their views on the future Bosnia. The Russian deputy foreign minister pointed out that the territorial contradictions constituted one of the main issues dividing the opposing sides today. Churkin stressed the major role that is currently being played in the process of settling the Bosnian conflict by American and Russian diplomacy. He noted that the two countries' interests in this respect were not opposed in principle. He said that evidence of this was provided by the praise for Russia's efforts that was expressed at the signing ceremony by U.S. President Bill Clinton. Equally high praise for Moscow's policy was forthcoming at the meeting that took place on the same day with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. During the visit by the Russian president's special envoy to the American capital, he also had a conversation with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. He held consultations with Charles Redman, the American special envoy on Yugoslavia, and met David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the co-chairmen of the peace process in the former Yugoslavia. Churkin told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that Russian diplomacy would continue to play an active part in settling the Bosnian conflict. He announced that he was flying on 19 March to Zagreb to have further talks and to organize a meeting between the sides, which are planned for the Russian Embassy on 25 March.
