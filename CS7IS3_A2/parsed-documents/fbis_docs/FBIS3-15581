The high-ranking representative of the United Nations believes that the negotiating process is a concrete step towards peace, national reconciliation and stability in the Republic. Liviu bota stated this today in an interview with ITAR-TASS commenting on the latest initiatives of the Tajik authorities in establishing contacts with representatives of oppositional circles of different political orientation. In this connection the head of the U.N. mission of observers noted that this international organization was prepared to render feasible aid in arranging these negotiations. Ramiro Peres Ballon, U.N. secretary-general's special envoy currently staying in Tajikistan, agreed to participate in this process. In reply to a question by ITAR-TASS correspondent if the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border under conditions of continuous armed provocations there, may affect the negotiating process, the U.N. representative said that, in his opinion, clashes on the border are not of a mass character and was skeptical about the possibility of large-scale operations there. However, he stressed that at the moment of the talks all combat actions and other negative incidents on the frontier should be ceased. Assessing the present social and political situation in Tajikistan, Liviu Bota noted that over the last year on the whole it certainly has changed for the better, become much quieter, although not everywhere, he admitted. Specifying his thought, Liviu Bota explained that there were separate facts of violations of human rights in Tajikistan, as well as infringement of security guarantees for Tajik refugees returning from Afghanistan. According to the head of the U.N. mission, this is not the policy of the government. In the conditions of Tajikistan, he noted, when as a result of the recent civil war many people lost their relatives, a factor of revenge is acting. This should not be disregarded, Liviu bota explained, although the United Nations categorically condemns each such fact and informs the Tajik leadership about them. At the same time the U.N. official said that he would like to emphasise that the government naturally is responsible for everything which is going on in its republic including such a sphere as the observance of human rights. It is very important the U.N. mission of observers meets with understanding in this issue on the part of the Tajik leadership, Liviu Bota stated.
