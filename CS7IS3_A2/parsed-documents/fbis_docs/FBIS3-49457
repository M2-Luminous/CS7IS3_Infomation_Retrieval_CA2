A statement issued by the ZChN Political Committee says that "the restoration of the property of the Ukrainian populace that in significant measure supported the ethnic cleansing and that was nationalized during `Operation Wisla' may take place in the event there is a parallel restoration of the property of the Polish population expelled from Galicia and Volhynia during and after World War II." The statement was issued in association with a letter from Ukrainian circles in Poland to the speaker of the Sejm in December of last year with a request for the abolition of the consequences of `Operation Wisla', said Marian Pilka, member of the ZChN Political Committee, speaking to journalists. The statement also asserts that the destruction of the Polish cultural heritage and the prevention of the restoration of Catholic church buildings to the Roman Catholic Church on territory at present belonging to Ukraine is directed against Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation.
