In his address, Gorbunovs thanked the former Supreme Council deputies who started to form the structures of the independent state regardless of the counteractions by Moscow administration. Commenting on the present political situation, Gorbunovs said he could "support radical changes in the life of our society" if it stabilized the Latvian situation. The most important future issue is the choice of Latvian citizens on the chief issues of national development and politics, Gorbunovs said. Answering on journalists' questions, Gorbunovs said he hoped that the Saeima opposition and the ruling coalition would narrow their differences to avoid hampering the work of the parliament. Gorbunovs said that the opposition ideas to propose extraordinary Saeima elections were logical from the opposition viewpoint because it could not have more influence in the present Saeima as it already had. "The government of the Latvia's Way and the Farmers' Union is a minority government but the government that the opposition could form would be even more unstable minority government," said Gorbunovs. Gorbunovs characterized as immature the idea to adopt a public reconciliation declaration because "the issues of the offenses by former KGBs and communist nomenklatura officials have not been sufficiently considered yet." "People who were humiliated now wait for amends," he noted. Finally, Gorbunovs claimed that the Constitution should be amended to avoid various interpretations by deputies.
