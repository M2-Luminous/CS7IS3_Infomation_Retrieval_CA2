The future of an "appendage" of the executive and pocket body or, on the contrary, a "nest" of the opposition, which for precisely this reason will shortly be "ravaged," has been predicted for the new corps of deputies. A grain of sense could, if so desired, be found in each of the adduced viewpoints. Nonetheless, we will venture to make one further forecast: The new parliament will be by no means a monolithic fifth column of the ruling state bureaucracy. It may with substantial reason be called an arena of the confrontation of group interests. And the country's future will, perhaps, depend on whoever gains the upper hand. The past 70-plus years were marked by the consistent realization of the interests of a group of high-ranking party bureaucrats within a strict ideological framework. A vigilant eye was kept on the permanency of this framework by the powerful and well-oiled administrative-command machine--the CPSU. With the disintegration of the Soviet Empire new "interest groups" began to appear--primarily the national bureaucracy. Although today it is the interests of this group which are being realized the most fully, it aspires to enshrine this process and make it irreversible. It is this that explains to a considerable extent the attempts, first, to shape a single national ideology of "market reforms in the name of the prosperity of Kazakhstan" (we recall if only the birth of the SNEK [Union of People's Unity of Kazakhstan] in February 1993) and, second, to legitimize its power (the self-dissolution of the former parliament--a "result of the totalitarian past"--and the elections of a new one). Analyzing the events of the end of the last and the start of the present year, it may be affirmed that the sponsors of the process of the "renewal" of the legislature have not at this stage achieved their goals. In this context the new parliament should be regarded as a kind of patchwork canvas, each "patch" of which is endeavoring to pull over to its side the whole "blanket." After all that has been said, it remains to analyze each fragment of this canvas individually. It is impossible in a single newspaper article, of course, to take account of all the factors influencing the correlation of forces in the corps of deputies (national, religious, clan, and so forth). The observations offered here are merely an attempt to distinguish the main political and economic interests which will, possibly, determine the strategic course of the new parliament. Corps of Directors of State-Owned Enterprises It has an objective interest in economic upturn, economic and political integration in the CIS, in securing guarantees of preservation of its social status in the event of a cancellation of the contract with the state, and in a share of the profit in the enterprises it manages and also in the stability and efficiency of legislative instruments. It is not interested in the proposed plan of privatization, and the majority are opponents of the new economic structures. For a number of reasons it frequently acts as a brake on the structural reorganization of the economy. In its endeavors it frequently relies on the work force of the enterprises. The upper part of the corps could be temporarily neutralized by the transfer of part of the block of shares in the privatization process. But there will be no long-term neutralization inasmuch as the economic recession rules out tangible dividends on the stock and is reducing considerably the value of the block itself. The transition to a contract system of the hire of enterprise managers, the venture remuneration of their labor, and a guarantee of the acquisition of part of the block of shares of the enterprise upon fulfillment of the terms of the contract would make it possible to realize the interests of the said group sufficiently fully. The anticipated strength of the parliamentary lobby is approximately 25 persons. It is the corps of directors (more precisely, the group lobbying for its interests and consisting of deputies who have entered parliament from large industrial structures and also from the scientific and technological milieu) which could in principle be an ally of the "irreconcilable" parliamentary opposition composed chiefly of deputies of the former parliament and novices elected from the opposition parties and movements. Both have an interest in the realization of an "intelligent" anticrisis program and, most important, in a reorientation of the present privatization strategy. But their ultimate goals are fundamentally different. The "irreconcilables" are preoccupied with an improvement in the political and socioeconomic atmosphere in the country and, ultimately, with an upturn in society's living standard. The corps of directors has an interest primarily in the political and economic defeat of the "holding company barons," who have seized the initiative in the control of the economy. Nonetheless, it is the efforts of the directors' lobby in parliament that could create a legislative base limiting to a considerable extent the appetites of the national-state bureaucracy and placing the executive within the strict framework of the law. Administration Chiefs A process of federalization of the state is actively under way in Kazakhstan, in an unlawful form, it is true. There are more than sufficient prerequisites for this process. The inevitable flow of command authority from the ministries to the administration chiefs has led to a redistribution of real power between the higher (central) and local bureaucracies in favor of the latter. It is its interests, which are today being realized unlawfully, that will be partially legalized by the new parliament in a brutal struggle with the representatives of the central bureaucracy. "Political relaxation" of the strict dependence on the president, decentralization of the state budget, a diminution in the role of the cabinet of ministers and other central structures in the management of state property, and a reduction in the powers of the local representative authorities, control powers primarily, are in the interests of this group. Realization of these aspirations would enable the chiefs to acquire political hegemony with all the ensuing consequences in the sense of privatization of property. This group has a sizable lobby in the Supreme Council, on the official slate included. The chiefs are not interested in the establishment of a regime based on the rule of law but would support with pleasure the demands for strict supervision of the activity of the cabinet. They are objective supporters of the concept of a strong regional policy. As of today this is one of the most influential groupings, whose financial possibilities and degree of freedom are very substantial and growing constantly. The anticipated size of the parliamentary lobby is approximately 40 persons. Considering what has been said above, it may be assumed that the deputies from the ranks of the former chiefs and the figures close to them will play in the new parliament the part of Trojan Horse. People who in terms of their former status were duty bound to be loyal to the president will embark with particular zeal on attacking the government (which under our conditions means an indirect blow at the head of state). At the same time, on the other hand, the deputy-chiefs will be the principal obstacle to the "irreconcilables" in the latter's aspiration to consolidate the corps of deputies on all-Kazakhstan interests. It is by the efforts of the chiefs' lobby that parliament could begin a gradual drift down the stream of regionalism (which, incidentally, is feared in earnest at the upper levels of power). State Bureaucracy Not only part of top government officialdom but also the majority of bank "generals" and the top leadership of the holding companies, concerns, and so forth may be attributed to this group. They are represented in parliament by part of the official slate and also the party factions of SNEK and the People's Congress. The continued centralization of the executive up to and including its "absolutization" is in the interests of this group. They will aspire to the maximum limitation of parliament's control functions, remembering the lessons of the Control Chamber of the former Supreme Council. It is most probable that this group will enjoy the tacit support of the top executive structures, including the top persons of the state. Nor is it ruled out that it is they that will try to obtain (and will obtain) a majority in the key parliamentary committees (primarily those in charge of the economy and finances), having supplanted the representatives of other groups. In this case hopes of intelligent opposition to the government's present economic policy are not destined to be realized. The anticipated strength of the parliamentary lobby is from 30 to 50 persons. Middle Class The group with substantial capital, but lacking a sure outlet to power, is the one the worst represented in parliament. For this reason the middle class has in practice been sidelined from the redivision of property and, consequently, will lose more than it gains as a result of official policy. It is represented in parliament by deputies from the unions, the middle and petty commercial structures, and certain social and political formations. The establishment of a truly democratic, law-based regime, a strengthening of market institutions, and the assurance of tax and other privileges for the producer and, ultimately, a rise in the living standard of as large a part of society as possible are in their interests. Proceeding from this, we may forecast a direction of their parliamentary activity aimed at limitation of the omnipotence of the "executants," fair privatization, and a broadening of the political and social opportunities of all members of society. Aside from all else, it is the middle class that is capable, given support on the part of other social groups, of really effecting a structural reorganization of the economy consonant with the aims of the "irreconcilables" and the corps of directors. Consequently, the lobbyists of this group could count on the support in parliament of all the above-mentioned groups, other than the state bureaucracy and the administration chiefs. In addition, the middle class has in the new corps of deputies potentially outstanding leaders. If this leadership acquires real outlines, the forecasts concerning the constructive-opposition character of the new parliament would seem reasonably justified. We have thus logically approached a problem of extreme importance for this corps of deputies--the candidacy of the speaker. Speaker In the context of present-day political realities there is no doubt that the person who occupies this seat will find himself in a difficult situation. If he fully supports the official course (primarily in the sphere of privatization), conflicts with the interests of the majority of parliamentary groups and, thus, the emergence of a parliamentary crisis "from within" are inevitable. Many observers are inclined to use this to explain the rumors that have arisen as of late concerning the refusal of the "big house" to take a chance on Kuanish Sultanov, whose candidacy was even recently seen as being a sure thing, virtually. The former vice premier himself, it would seem, is sincerely convinced of the soundness of the "reform" policy that is being pursued. Speaking on the eve of the elections in a northern oblast, he spoke about the reasons for the crisis as being objective and independent of the government and the president, from which it followed that struggle against the crisis was a secondary preoccupation. "The main thing today is privatization," Mr. Sultanov declared. And although this logic coincides in principle with the precepts of the top persons of the state, they have to understand that the aspiration of the leader of the SNEK to be "holier than the pope" would hardly meet with understanding on the part of the present deputies. In addition, account needs to be taken of the manifestly negative image of the SNEK, which was merely reinforced in the period of the election campaign. Olzhas Suleymenov could be named in this category also, but he could be hampered by problems of a linguistic nature: the speaker must, according to the constitution, know the official language. In addition, the speaker must have a grasp of the economic situation, which the leader of the Kazakhstan People's Congress clearly lacks. But if Mr. Suleymenov decides, for all that, to let his name go forward, he could "draw off" onto himself the votes of some of the deputies, exerting a considerable influence on the final result. Some people are inclined to speak seriously about the candidacy of Abish Kekilbayev, former state counselor, who acquired certain political capital on the Aral problem. But this figure, many informed people believe, enjoys far more support in his native west than here, in the south. And the positions of the southerners in this parliament are quite strong. Particular meaning has come to be invested as of late in the "foothills" of the political Olympus in the mentions of Umirbek Dzholdasbekov--former dean of the Kazakhstan State University and president of the Engineering Academy. To his credit are, first, successful activity, in the view of some people, as dean and, second, a correct (from today's standpoints) line of behavior in December 1986. At the same time, on the other hand, his role in the successful "self-dissolution" of the former Supreme Council is well known (to be persuaded of this it is sufficient to take a look at the stenographic accounts of the final sittings of the 11th Session). Mr. Dzholdasbekov was not only a member of the so-called 11-man "action committee" but was also an active inspiration behind and conductor of all its undertakings--together with Zamanbek Kurkadilov and his ilk--former corps of deputy colleagues. And at the sitting on 10 December he even delivered the report on the draft law on delegation of the powers of the Supreme Council to the president. It is notable that prior to this the academician had spoken at the sessions quite infrequently, and on matters of procedure, more often than not. Old-timers recall just two exceptions: the impassioned monologues of "Uncle Dzho" during discussion of the coat of arms (1992) and the government awards (1993). In the first instance, what is more, the member of parliament favored the central component of the attribute of statehood with a comparison with an intimate part of a lady's attire.... According to the latest information, Mr. Dzholdasbekov recently assembled the Alma-Ata [Almaty] deputies and persuaded them to support the draft law "Legislative Assembly of the Republic of Kazakhstan" containing a provision concerning a bicameral parliament. Although not long before this, at a meeting of the working group preparing the agenda, it was declared that this bill would not be put to the session. It is perfectly probable, however, that it will, for all that, surface at a plenary sitting in the very near future. In any event, a high-ranking government official communicated to your author the perfectly realistic prospect of such a development of events. In his opinion, there is behind this the endeavor of backstage "scriptwriters" of the parliamentary performance to "decapitate" the corps of deputies according to the principle: two heads, hence, none. And to thereby exclude the possibility of the arrival on the captain's bridge of a powerful politician of an opposition persuasion. Gaziz Aldamzharov, cochairman of the Socialist Party, for example, who is known for his uncompromising position in the office of chairman of the Control Chamber of the former Supreme Council. Despite all the apparent ease of this maneuver, it turns on the need for an amendment to be made to the constitution, and the consent of two-thirds of the corps of deputies is necessary for its revision. Obtaining the latter would seem highly problematical inasmuch as the majority of deputies would easily read behind the prospect of their division into two chambers the artless scenario of a counterpoise of the parts of the corps of deputies to one another, which would signify a blocking of the legislative work of parliament and its virtual loss of control functions. Observers do not rule out the possibility of the speaker's chair being taken by a person around whom a majority of the opposition groupings examined above would consolidate. In this case very interesting events await us. It is even possible that the president would be forced to "surrender" to the deputies the present cabinet. And then, instead of a parliamentary crisis, we would be witnesses to a government crisis, whose consequences would be truly unpredictable.
