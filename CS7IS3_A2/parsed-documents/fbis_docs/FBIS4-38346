The talks between the delegations of the two countries headed by their respective presidents were also concluded. The joint communique pertaining to the talks was signed by Demirel and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. In a statement at the signing ceremony, Demirel said that the cooperation between Turkey and Ukraine will benefit world peace as well as the region. The aim is to increase the existing $500-million bilateral volume of trade to $1 billion, Demirel stated. Stressing that Turkey is in favor of continued peace in its region and in Europe, Demirel noted: We are opposed to gaining territory through the use of force or to interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. As with other countries, we support the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Demirel expressed the belief that bilateral relations will develop even further in the future, adding that the necessary political will exists to this end. Answering a question concerning Crimea, Demirel said that this is Ukraine's internal matter. Kravchuk, in reply to a question of whether the protocol on the oil pipeline project can be interpreted so as to support Turkey's view that the straits not be used in oil transportation, declared: As far as we are concerned, this is not an issue only between Turkey and Ukraine. It concerns the whole of Europe from an environmental aspect. Meanwhile, highway transportation and tourism cooperation agreements were also signed between Turkey and Ukraine in Kiev. The agreements were signed by the foreign and transportation ministers of the two countries. Kravchuk also hosted a dinner in honor of Demirel. In his dinner toast, Kravchuk described the visit as a natural extension of the constructive dialogue between the two countries. He remarked that Ukraine is still at the beginning of the path seeking the right place among democratic countries, a path long ago discovered by Turkey. He added: What brings us together is not just geographic proximity and history. We are brought closer together by the economic reforms introduced for the people's prosperity and the struggle waged for the development of the democratic society. Kravchuk explained that bilateral relations have been based on a sound legal foundation and concrete steps were taken in the fields of economic, commercial, cultural, and scientific cooperation. The two countries must establish closer ties to ensure peace and stability in the region and in the whole of Europe, Kravchuk said. This visit, he noted, will open a new page in the relations between Turkey and his country. Demirel, for his part, declared that a brand new period has begun with the reciprocal visits of the two leaders. [Demirel] Turkey believes that the Cold War period should not be replaced by a cold peace period. We must now experience a period in which nations reach out for one another, [as heard] with the most the common history of the human race should become one of peace, friendship, solidarity, and cooperation. The fact that Ukraine, an important country of our region, shares these views with us gives us confidence. [Yorulmaz] The president stated that Turkey is exerting great efforts for the peaceful solution of all the problems in the region, adding that it is pleasing that Ukraine also takes part in these efforts. Pointing out that the Black Sea Economic Cooperation brings Turkey and Ukraine closer together, Demirel said that it is beneficial for the Black Sea countries to join their efforts for the development of friendship and cooperation. Turkey sincerely supports Ukraine's goal for modernization as well as its independence and territorial integrity, Demirel concluded.
