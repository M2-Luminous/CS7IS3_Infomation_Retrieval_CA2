Makhnyr, E.P. Kozlovskaya, Pacific Bioorganic Chemistry Institute at the Far Eastern Department of Russia's Academy of Sciences, Vladivostok; UDC 577.11] [Abstract] The potential of using Radianthus macrodactylus sea anemones as a source of physiologically active substances and the failure to isolate neurotoxins with a nonprotein origin from Radianthus macrodactylus sea anemones prompted attempts to isolate highly active nonprotein toxins from tropical sea anemones. The toxin was isolated by chromatography on polytetraflourethylene, CM-sephadex C-25, and HPLC ion exchangers in Ultropac TSK CM-3SW and Ultropac TSK DEAE-3SW columns. This toxin was firmly sorbed by the hydrophobic agent Polychrome-I and interacted weakly with cation- and anion-exchange substances at a pH of 5.0 and 7.4, respectively. The toxin's nonprotein origin was confirmed by the negative outcome of a test for N-terminal amino acid and amino acid analysis. It is shown that the palytoxin molecule's trans-3-aminoacrylamide fragment which is responsible for the 263 nm peak in the ultraviolet spectrum is unstable both in acidic and alkaline media. For intravenous injection in mice, the toxin's LD[.sub]50[/] is 74+/-0.29 ï¿½g/kg. It is speculated on the basis of the substance's high toxicity as well as spectroscopy data that it is the same palytoxin which was isolated for the first time from Palythoa toxica zoanthid. The authors are grateful to T. Balashova and A.I. Kalinovskiy for recording the 500 MHz NMR spectra and discussing the spectrum patterns. References: 7 Western.
