Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan hit a record U.S.$14.42 billion in 1993, and the deficit is expected to top U.S.$15 billion this year. A ministry official urged Taiwan importers to diversify their sources of imports and to help promote domestic-made goods they would normally buy from Japan. Ministry statistics show that increasing salaries here combined with fewer import restrictions and the popularity of Japanese goods have worked to boost Japanese imports year after year. Last year, 34 types of Japanese goods were imported to the tune of U.S.$10 million each -- mostly electrical appliances, food additives, hygiene and beauty products, film, and video games. The ministry official said a field study of Japanese imports found that products that are no longer popular in Japan may still sell in Taiwan for more than two or three times the cost of similar Taiwan products. He said some domestic importers even import Japanese foodstuffs whose "use-by" dates have expired, banking on their popularity here to turn a brisk profit.
