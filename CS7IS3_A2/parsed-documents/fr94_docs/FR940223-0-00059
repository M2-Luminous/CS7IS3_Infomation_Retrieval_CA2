FR940223-0-00059 FR940223-0-00022 Due to the broad scope of these rules, business and nonbusiness PMCPs with 50 or more drivers will have until January 1, 1995 to comply with the new drug and alcohol testing regulations. Business and nonbusiness PMCPs with less than 50 drivers will be required to comply with the new drug and alcohol testing regulations beginning January 1, 1996. To further the purpose of the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act, no waiver or exemption from any provision of the new rules, including the recordkeeping requirements, is provided. Consequently, all nonbusiness PMCPs will be required to meet certain recordkeeping requirements when the final rule is fully implemented. Vehicle Requirements Business PMCPs Part 393, Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation, and Part 396, Inspection, Repair and Maintenance, provide detailed safety requirements for commercial motor vehicle components and inspection thereof. Business PMCPs are required to comply with the vehicle equipment requirements contained in part 393 (excluding fuel systems that have been maintained and meet original manufacturer's standards) and the maintenance and recordkeeping requirements in part 396. A few carriers may need to perform minor retrofitting to bring their vehicles into compliance with the requirements of part 393. Nonbusiness PMCPs Nonbusiness PMCPs must comply with the vehicle equipment requirements in part 393 (excluding fuel systems that have been maintained and meet original manufacturer's standards) and the maintenance requirements of part 396. These carriers will not have to comply with the recordkeeping requirements contained in part 396. Insurance Requirements Section 18 (a) through (g) of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;261, 96 Stat. 1102, 1120, as amended) established minimum levels of financial responsibility for for-hire motor carriers of passengers. The Act did not extend coverage to motor carriers involved in private transportation of passengers. Therefore, for purposes of this final rule, PMCPs are not required to comply with part 387. Enforcement PMCPs will be subject to the FHWA and State motor carrier safety enforcement activities. The FHWA has a field staff which monitors compliance and enforces the regulations primarily by reviews of company records. Also, the FHWA administers a formula grant program, the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP), to reimburse States for uniform enforcement of commercial motor vehicle safety and hazardous materials compliance through roadside driver/vehicle inspections and review of motor carrier safety practices. Business PMCPs The primary enforcement activity will be unannounced terminal and roadside driver/vehicle inspections conducted by State personnel. Roadside driver/vehicle inspections may include inspections performed at origin or destination points such as parking lots, amusement parks, sporting complexes, and convention centers as well as on the road. A terminal inspection is a comprehensive vehicle inspection conducted at the carrier's terminal facility, garage or at a bus station. The vehicle standards for these inspections are reflected in the current periodic inspection requirements (part 396, Appendix G). Business PMCP drivers will have CDLs, medical cards, and records of duty status reviewed. Federal and State investigators will also conduct safety and compliance reviews of these carriers at their principal places of business. The investigators will review motor carriers' safety management practices and regulatory compliance as evidenced by records maintained. These carriers will also be subject to FHWA's rating process and the provisions of the Motor Carrier Act of 1990 regarding the consequences of unsatisfactory safety ratings, i.e., an unsatisfactory rating will prohibit the operation of buses effective 45 days after receipt of the rating. Unsafe carriers will be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as all other carriers currently under the jurisdiction of the FHWA. Carriers identified in FHWA's information system as having unsafe operations will be scheduled for safety and compliance reviews. Nonbusiness PMCPs Nonbusiness PMCPs will be subject to the same terminal and roadside driver/vehicle inspections as business PMCPs, except the drivers will only be subject to having their CDL reviewed and hours of service verified from evidence gathered at the scene. Compliance reviews will not be performed on these carriers nor will they be subject to FHWA's safety rating process, unless the information systems reveal that the carrier has been identified as having ongoing roadside safety inspection problems. Marking To facilitate State inspections of these vehicles and drivers, the FHWA is requiring each PMCP to have its name, city and State, and U.S. DOT number marked on the side of the bus to the extent presently required of all motor carriers.
