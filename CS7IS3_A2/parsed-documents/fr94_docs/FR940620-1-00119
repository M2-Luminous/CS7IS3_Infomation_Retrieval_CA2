FR940620-1-00119 FR940620-1-00013 On November 30, 1993, the Department amended Part 37 to extend the compliance deadline for the requirement to install detectable warnings on platform edges of key rail stations. The final rule reaffirmed the Department's view that detectable warnings are an essential safety feature of rail stations for persons with impaired vision. The Department is not, through this proposal, seeking further comment on the issue of detectable warnings on rail station platform edges. The Department will regard any comments received on this subject as outside the scope of this rulemaking. Regulatory Analyses and Notices This NPRM has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The Access Board has analyzed the impact of applying its amendments to ADAAG to entities covered by Titles II and III of the ADA and has determined that they are a significant regulatory action for purposes of the Executive Order. The Access Board has also prepared a Regulatory Assessment, which includes a cost impact analysis for certain accessibility elements and a discussion of the regulatory alternatives considered. This Regulatory Assessment applies to the Department's proposed adoption of the Access Board's guidelines. Comments submitted to the Access Board on its Regulatory Assessment will be considered by the Department as comments on this NPRM. The Access Board has determined that its guidelines will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, has included in its Regulatory Assessment a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Access Board has made every effort to lessen the economic impacts of its proposed rule on small entities, but recognizes that such impacts are the necessary result of the mandate of the ADA itself. The Access Board's flexibility analysis also applies to the Department's proposed adoption of the revised ADAAG. The Access Board also made every effort to lessen the impact of its proposed guidelines on state and local governments, but recognizes that the guidelines will have some federalism impacts. These impacts are discussed in the Access Board's Regulatory Assessment which, as noted above, also applies to this NPRM.
