FBIS TRENDS-10JUN94-CHINA-DPRK Chinese Leaders Reiterate Opposition to Sanctions Chinese Leaders Reiterate Opposition to Sanctions Chinese Communist Party General Secretary and President Jiang Zemin and Politburo member and PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen have affirmed Beijing's opposition to the imposition of sanctions against North Korea in China's most authoritative statements on the sanctions issue to date. Reflecting China's longstanding position on the DPRK nuclear issue, Jiang, according to a 10 June Xinhua account of his interview with Japan's NHK television the same day, told NHK commentator Hatsuhisa Takashima that China "does not approve of sanctions." Sanctions, he warned, "do not help" the situation and can only "escalate" it and lead to "consequences which none of the parties is willing to see." Calling for "all parties concerned" to take "active measures to avoid intensifying the crisis," Jiang said that China believes that "dialogue and consultations" are the only "effective way" to resolve the problem. On 8 June, Qian delivered the same message to the visiting Maltese foreign minister (Xinhua, 8 June), a message' he repeated on the 9th in talks with the South Korean foreign minister (Xinhua, 9 June).
