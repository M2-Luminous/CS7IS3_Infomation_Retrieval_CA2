How should China proceed to take advantage of the opportunity presented to China by the world? [Kissinger, in English fading into Chinese translation] First, the new world order will be composed of some influential countries: the United States, Japan, China, Russia, Europe, and India. These nations interact with one another free of any ideological conflicts and share common interests in many areas. China attaches great importance to stability in Asia, does not have any territorial designs, and does not have troops stationed outside its borders. The United States has no territorial designs, either. This can serve as a basis for common efforts toward maintaining global peace. China will play an increasingly important role on the world stage. Economically, China will grow in importance as an exporter; at the same time, it will also become a major importer, thus becoming an integral part of the world economy. Because the world economy is closely linked with countries of the world, China's development will have a direct impact on world economic development. China follows with great interest countries of the world, which, on the other hand, have shown great interest in China. In the next century, China will play an even bigger role.
