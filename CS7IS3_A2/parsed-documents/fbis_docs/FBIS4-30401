Both of them are dietmembers from the Liberal Democratic Party. Following the talks held between former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and President Kim Il-song, North Korea has made positive moves towards holding the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks, as well as South-North summit talks. Touching on these moves in his report, Yamazaki stated his view that the DPRK is shifting its political stance to an open-door policy. However, concerning further nuclear inspections, Dietman Tani said: "There will possibly be a difference in views between nuclear and military experts. (When we suggested that they should accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency,) we got no response. It certainly is not that easy." Thus, he expressed his view that it will be difficult for the United States and the DPRK to succeed in talks.
