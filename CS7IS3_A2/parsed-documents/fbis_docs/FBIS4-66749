Nasirullah Babar, federal home minister, has announced that all foreigners including Arabs living here will be deported. The home minister told the news reporters in Peshawar about his government's decision that all foreigners who took part in the Afghanistan jihad will be deported from Pakistan. The truth is that this action is being taken under U.S. pressure. Calling the Arab nationals living in Pakistan terrorists and instigators is inappropriate and an extreme action. These people support an Islamic form of government and are those who took part in the Afghanistan jihad against the Russian aggression. The service they have provided to the Muslim world and Pakistan by leaving their far away countries to participate in the Afghanistan jihad cannot be forgotten. These are the mujaheddin who protected Afghanistan and Pakistan from the oppression of communism and the Soviet Union. They participated in the Afghan jihad side-by-side with the Afghan brothers without any racial or regional prejudice, and made many sacrifices. They still have great courage and are ready to help the Muslim world wherever brutalities are committed against them. The truth is that these Arab nationals are an asset to Pakistan. They can be used in the jihad in Kashmir. They are ready to go to occupied Kashmir to help our Kashmiri brothers in their struggle for independence just like they helped in Afghanistan. India and its ally, the United States, are worried about it. The United States does not want the movement of Kashmiris to become like the one in Afghanistan. Therefore, it wants them expelled from Pakistan by accusing them of terrorism. The Government of Pakistan should not play into U.S. hands at all!
