FR940816-2-00003 FR940816-2-00002 Forest Service Chenuis Creek/Cayada Mountain Timber Sale, Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Pierce County, WA AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Cancellation of an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: On August 7, 1990, a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Chenuis Creek/Cayada Mountain Timber Sale on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest was published in the Federal Register (55 FR 32105). A notice of availability for the draft EIS was published in the Federal Register on January 11, 1991 (56 FR 1184), with a comment period on the draft EIS ending February 25, 1991. The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was amended on April 13, 1994 with additional land allocations and standards and guidelines (Record of Decision for Amendments to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Planning Documents within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl, as amplified in attached Standards and Guidelines for Management of Habitat for Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Related Species Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl). Because of this amendment, the analysis process has been terminated; there will be no final EIS for the Chenuis Creek/Cayada Mountain Timber Sale. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Direct questions regarding this cancellation to J. Hansen-Murray, Environmental Coordinator, 21905 64th Avenue West, Mountlake Terrace, WA 98043 or telephone (206) 775&hyph;9702. Dated: August 2, 1994. Robert L. Dunblazier, Acting Forest Supervisor.
