The document claims that "the attempts made by Tiraspol to speed up the negotiation process, which was started with Russia's mediation, has again run into a silent blockade by Moldova, and President Mircea Snegur has in fact withdrawn from further talks." In this regard Igor Smirnov, head of the Dniester Republic, has appealed to Ambassador Vladlen Vasev, plenipotentiary envoy of the Russian president, to exert all his influence on Mircea Snegur. The statement also underlines that the inhabitants of the left bank of the Dniester river have postively assessed the joint statement by the leaders of Moldova and the Dniester Republic on finding a settlement to the aftermath of the armed conflict, which was signed at the end of April. At a time when President Igor Smirnov is complaining about the lack of progress at the talks, State Secretary Valeriy Litskiy, chief coordinator at the talks from the Tiraspol side, discussed today with the CSCE mission in Moldova prospects of resuming the dialogue. They agreed that the talks could be continued in the near future following the return to Kishinev of Richard Samuel, head of the CSCE mission. The arrival of Vladlen Vasev, the special Russian envoy, is also expected then.
