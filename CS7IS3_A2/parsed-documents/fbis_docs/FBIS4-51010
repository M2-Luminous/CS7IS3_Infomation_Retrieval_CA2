In a departure from previous strategy, Chinese officials have refrained from criticising the Government attempt to seek more than $1 billion from legislators for airport and rail projects. A senior mainland official admitted they had adopted pragmatism and acknowledged the "difficulties" raised by the British side over the urgent need for funds to keep the projects going. "We hope to be more pragmatic and show the spirit of mutual accommodation to strive for an early accord," he said. This is despite early statements made by the Chinese that the Government should not seek funds while the diplomatic talks on the overall financial arrangements were still underway. "Our major concern now is to secure a full agreement as soon as possible," said the official. Just one day after the Airport Committee meeting, the Government said on Saturday it would seek funds from the Legislative Council to build an immersed tunnel across the railway link. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod was quoted as saying yesterday the Government planned to seek another "huge amount of funds" related to the airport project from lawmakers before the end of the current Legco session. At a meeting with two legislators from the United Democrats and Meeting Point, he also reportedly said that the administration might publicise details of its fourth financing proposal which was handed to the Chinese side in February. It is understood the next funding request will mainly cover the construction of the superstructure of the passenger terminal, estimated at more than $10 billion. The Provisional Airport Authority has already completed the design of the terminal and it is necessary for construction to go ahead. The Government is hoping that talks at the Airport Committee could "go parallel" with construction of the multi-billion-dollar project in order to minimise any delay. A deputy director of XINHUA (the New China News Agency), Zhang Junsheng, yesterday pressed the British side for a quick solution to the airport issue claiming problems were "not on the Chinese side". "We, on our part, hope very much that there could be a concise solution to the new airport problem. The earlier we can reach an overall solution on the financing package, the more conducive it would be to the new airport construction."
