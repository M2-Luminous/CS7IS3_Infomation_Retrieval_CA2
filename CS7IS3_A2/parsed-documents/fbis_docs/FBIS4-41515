[Khenik] Fortunately, none of the candidates has made use of this bad situation. Not in the polluted regions either. [Rosenkranz] Why fortunately? The catastrophe has made people sick, has burdened the budget and economic perspectives. Does the population not want the candidates to tell them what the future will be like? [Khenik] Our people understand very well what effects the disaster still has on the country. Take the 18-percent Chernobyl tax that we have had to levy on all firms. There have never been any complaints or protests about it, although it makes life more difficult than it already is. The disaster has been inflicted on our people together, and people are aware of this. [Rosenkranz] Does this mean that there is no polarization of opinion between the presidential candidates on this issue? [Khenik] No. Most of the candidates have tried to avoid this issue in their election campaigns. The central priority in the elections is our economic development. [Rosenkranz] What are your feelings in Belarus as you watch the Chernobyl nuclear center in the Ukraine still operating? [Khenik] My country has repeatedly appealed to Ukrainian President Kravchuk and the parliament in Kiev to cancel the decision to maintain operations and reopen the reactor. Unfortunately, we have not even received an answer to our request to their parliament. Kravchuk asked us to understand that there is no other solution owing to the current economic situation in Ukraine. [Rosenkranz] Belarus does not have any nuclear power stations, but of all the countries concerned it is suffering the most from the effects of the accident. Are you getting any support from the former Soviet Union? [Khenik] Russia is the only state of the former USSR that supports us economically. This year, President Yeltsin wants to increase payments to 40 billion roubles. [Rosenkranz] Of the humanitarian help that your country gets from the West, 82 percent comes from voluntary organizations and individuals, while only 18 percent is from the states. Are people in the West more sensitive to your problems than governments? [Khenik] It is true that only now, after eight years, has an agreement come about with the German Government on cooperation in fighting the effects of Chernobyl. Fortunately, several German land governments have shown more human decency and have supported us, especially Hesse and Lower Saxony. But it is true that social organizations and individuals have been doing a great deal more. [Rosenkranz] In spite of this situation there have been discussions going on in Belarus on whether the problem of energy supplies could not best be solved by constructing nuclear power stations. Would a party or a presidential candidate taking such a position stand a chance of being elected? [Khenik] No. That is why this issue is systematically avoided in candidates' speeches. No president would be in a position to decide on the construction of nuclear reactors by himself, without a referendum. There is no possible location where this would not lead to massive protests. [Rosenkranz] What do you think the outcome of a national referendum on that issue would be? [Khenik] People would, of course, be against nuclear power, no doubt about that. There is no other option: We will have to find non-nuclear, alternative sources of energy.
