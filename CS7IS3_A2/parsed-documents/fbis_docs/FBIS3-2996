The two-hour closed-door meeting between representatives of the two sides was held north of the demarcation line at the Panmunjom truce village. Pak Yong-su, head of the DPRK working delegation, said after the contact that the two sides failed to bridge their difference on the role of the special envoys. South Korea was opposed to the inclusion in the role insistence on national independence, pursuit of national unity and identification of ways of national reunification, Pak said. He added that the south side was marking time with a view to blocking the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks scheduled for March 21. Pak said that whatever, special envoys should be exchanged at an early date and DPRK would continue to work for it. The two sides will conduct their eighth contact south of the demarcation line at Panmunjom on March 19.
