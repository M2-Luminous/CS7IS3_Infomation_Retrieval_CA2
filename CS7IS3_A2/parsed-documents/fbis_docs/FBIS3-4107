They also said that the central bank will not support Chinese- funded enterprises engaging in real estate speculation in Hong Kong; that foreign banks will be allowed to carry on renminbi business once conditions and the climate mature; and that, after the foreign exchange trading market begins operation on 1 April, foreign banks can participate in the market if they are trusted by customers. The above remarks by bank Vice Presidents Zhou Zhengqing, Dai Xianglong, and Chen Yuan, were made at a news briefing held by the "Two-Session" News Center for the People's Bank of China [PBC]. Answering a question asked by a reporter about whether Hong Kong currency will continue to be used in the Zhu Jiang delta, Zhou Zhengqing said: Any sovereign state in the world will not allow foreign currencies to circulate in its country. When exchange rates were unified in China, the relevant authority unequivocally indicated that foreign currencies were forbidden from circulation within the borders. As to the specific problems encountered by Shenzhen during the transition period, as it is a special economic zone which has many contacts with Hong Kong and Macao, we will adopt some specific measures to resolve them by considering the advantages of economic development with Hong Kong and Macao. As to the impact caused by the substantial amount of Hong Kong dollars flowing back into Hong Kong, Zhou Zhengqing said they were aware of the situation as the Hong Kong monetary administrative authority had informed China's central bank of the matter. When asked about the central bank's views on Chinese-funded organizations which engage in real estate speculation in Hong Kong, Chen Yuan definitely said that the central bank opposed conducting such speculative activities because China is a country which practices exchange control and which is seriously short of funds for construction. However, if a few Chinese-funded enterprises needed to increase office and residential premises because of their business expansion, they are allowed to buy some properties so long as they are not involved in speculation. With regard to property mortgages extended by the Bank of China [BOC] in Hong Kong, Chen Yuan disclosed that the BOC conducts its business activities in Hong Kong independently without being restricted by the PBC, so it may carry on property mortgage business according to the market conditions, for which the PBC will not show any special concern. Regarding the issue of allowing foreign banks to carry on renminbi business, Zhou Zhengqing said: Taken from the reform orientation and from a long-term perspective, it is necessary to resolve this issue gradually. However, this requires certain conditions. For example: First, it is necessary to ensure that after foreign banks carry on renminbi business, they must be on an equal footing with the Chinese banks in terms of tax requirements so that there is a foundation for equal competition. Second, our commercial banks have just been established and they need a process of gradual development and perfection. Third, our banking laws and regulations are not yet sound, and we are now speeding up the formulation of a series of banking laws and regulations including the "law on central bank," "law on commercial banks," "securities law," "bills law," "insurance law," and so on. When these conditions mature, the issue of carrying on renminbi business by foreign banks will be promptly settled. Discussing the foreign exchange trading market that will begin operations on 1 April, Zhou Zhengqing said the 13 domestic banks [as published] will all enter this inter-bank foreign exchange trading market, and foreign banks, if entrusted by their customers, may also enter the market and engage in trading according to foreign exchange regulations. Although a well-known economist strongly appealed to change the current phenomenon of negative interest rates in order to reduce the adverse impact on the economy, Zhou Zhengqing thought it better for the mainland's interest rates on deposits to maintain stability rather than making readjustments now because deposits are still increasing by a large margin and there is a favorable situation in the withdrawal of currency from circulation in January and February, which is conducive to economic development. He stressed that, as the objective of monetary reform this year, China will institute three systems and achieve genuine results in two aspects. The three systems are: a macroeconomic regulation and control system for the central bank which carries out monetary policies independently under the leadership of the State Council; a monetary organizational system under which policy banks are separated from commercial banks and multiple financial institutions co-exist, with state-run commercial banks as the main body; and a financial market system characterized by unified openness, orderly competition, and strict management, so that the PBC will be a genuine central bank and the commercial banks will be run as genuine commercial banks. He further pointed out: In order to realize the major targets for China's macroeconomic regulation and control this year, the principal duty of the central bank this year is to stabilize the currency. To this end, the central bank will adopt the following four measures in 1994: 1) Strictly control the increase of total credit volume of the state-owned banks and the base currency of the central bank and strictly control loans for fixed assets in particular. 2) Strictly control loan supply and vigorously organizing withdrawal of currency from circulation. 3) As of this year, suspend the overdrafts and loans of the Ministry of Finance from the central bank, and from this year onward, depend on treasury bonds to make up for the balance of financial revenue and expenditure of the central bank. 4) Intensify monetary supervision and control and maintain normal monetary order. As for the concrete measures for controlling inflation, he summed up the following three points: 1) Strictly control investment in fixed assets. 2) Ensure the comprehensive development of the rural economy, particularly the production of daily necessities including grain, cotton, edible oil, and so on. 3) Ensure the basic equilibrium of total demand and supply. Dai Xianglong said emphatically: Since the second half of last year, the central bank has practiced a "steady" monetary policy -- neither stringently tightening up money supply nor excessively easing it. At present, the ratio of provision in commercial banks is relatively high, and there is a fairly large scope of credit. The credit scope for the second quarter will be fixed and assigned very soon. He added: "In a bid to guarantee a steady economic growth, we do not practice a retrenchment policy."
