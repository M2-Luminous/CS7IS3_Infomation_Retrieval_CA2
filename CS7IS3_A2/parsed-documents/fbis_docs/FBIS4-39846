Akayev was speaking at a conference at the Slavic University, in Bishkek. In Akayev's view, the republic's geopolitical position did it little credit. Kyrgyzstan was a land-locked Republic and lacked other trade communications. Very soon, he said, the republic would depend on its neighbors and especially on Russia because economically developed nations felt Central Asia as a whole, including Kyrgyzstan, lay in a zone of their interests. But, Akayev said, the Republic's industrial potential failed to call for serious foreign investment because Kyrgyzstan was unable to save its industrial infrastructure. And that was why, he said, the government had to discontinue the production of many items. According to Akayev, political instability and the absence of government guarantees impeded foreign investment in the Kyrgyz economy. So, he said, Kyrgyzstan would be unlikely to build up its international rating in the next 10 to 15 years.
