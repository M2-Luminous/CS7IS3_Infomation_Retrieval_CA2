This method is called a phase weighing method. The method is based on lowering the amplitude of the reflected wave by shifting two adjoining elements into opposite directions. In this study, the phase weighing method was used for constructing DDL with slanted reflecting structures made with grooves. A diagram of such DDL using a SAW with inclined reflecting structures is provided. Two types of DDL made with YZ- LiNbO[.sup]3[/] were constructed and their parameters and functioning is described. Interdigital transducers with equidistant electrodes were employed for the DDL. The first type transducer contained four pairs of digits and the second type contained ten pairs. The amplitude-frequency characteristics and the shape of the compressed pulse at the ouput of both types of the DDL are shown in graphs. It was demonstrated that the method of phase weighing is very effective for obtaining the DDL amplitude-frequency characteristic of a specified configuration.
