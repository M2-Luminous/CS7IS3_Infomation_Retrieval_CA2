It is a worthwhile topic: A closed session of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine voted 254 in favor and nine against to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known among specialists as SNO-1 and christened by journalists as START. Ukraine, in accordance with this START, will cut back 36 percent of the overall number of missiles and 42 percent of the nuclear warheads. So the Ukrainian parliament has taken the first step toward common sense, contrary to which these terrible weapons were built, placed and serviced on our Ukrainian soil for many long decades. A press conference was also devoted to the ratification of START-1 by the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, with the participation of Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Vasyl Durdynets, Supreme Soviet Commission on Questions of Defense and State Security Chairman Valentyn Lemish, Vice Prime-Minister Valeriy Shmarov, Minister of Defense of Ukraine Colonel-General Vitaliy Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko. Deputy Vasyl Durdynets indicated that the decision made to ratify START was preceded by an almost year-long review and diligent collective analysis of possible military-political, economic, ecological and social consequences of the fulfillment of this treaty by our state, a treaty that took shape at one time without the participation of Ukraine. And they approached this important decision both with the noble intention of our country to be a non-nuclear state in the future, and with the idea of the inviolability of our borders and a regard for other national interests. The deputies addressed their principal attention in the course of discussion toward such serious factors as the role of nuclear weapons as a factor of restraint, the economic capabilities of our state to meet to the full the obligations that arise from the treaty, and the capabilities for ensuring ecological and nuclear security during the cutback and elimination of nuclear weapons. I would especially like to emphasize, said Vasyl Vasylovych, that in the context of the decision made the attitude of the Supreme Soviet and the leadership of Ukraine toward the future non-nuclear status of our state has not changed. We have hoped and tried in our activity to convince the international community, and first of all the nuclear and other influential states of the world, of the necessity of reciprocal steps on their part with regard to granting Ukraine solid guarantees of security, the receipt of adequate financial assistance for the reduction of these weapons and compensation for the nuclear warheads, including tactical ones. Times are such today, however, that it does not pay to be an optimist. Kiev cherishes the hope that it is now the turn of Moscow and Washington to display trust. But as they say, trust in God, but... You know the rest. So it is understandable why the decree of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine ratifying START has thirteen stipulations, only after the fulfillment of which the treaty, or more precisely the whole great series of political, economic and military-technical components of this document, will begin to be realized. Here are just a few of them. "Ukraine as a state possessing nuclear weapons is moving toward non-nuclear status, and will gradually get rid of the nuclear weapons deployed on its territory, provided it retains sound guarantees of its national security, in which the nuclear states assume the obligation never to employ conventional armed forces against it and will not resort to the threat of force, will respect the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of Ukraine, and will refrain from economic pressure with the aim of resolving any disputed issues." The current crisis state of the economy of Ukraine is taken into account among the other stipulations--the granting of sufficient international financial and technical assistance. The leadership of Ukraine, by the way, has emphasized all of this repeatedly. But words remain words, and promises promises. And it is becoming more and more understandable that we will have to guarantee our own security and inviolability, first and foremost with our own resources. Even the signing of the framework agreement between Kiev and Washington, in accordance with which Ukraine could receive 175 million dollars (moreover not monetary, but rather in the form of specific programs and hardware purchased not at our prices, but at significantly higher world prices) does not fundamentally resolve the problem of finances. The 2.8 billion we need sometimes elicits only pessimistic smiles in the West. The attempts to conduct negotiations with Russia on receiving compensation for the tactical arms removed from Ukraine, about 5-6 billion dollars, are already reaching a dead end. So who can we count on? The West? Russia? Certainly, on ourselves first of all. The more so as Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov, answering a question on who should give us financial assistance, answered quite concretely, "No one should. None of us has the idea that someone will be coming to us with money, and we will start spending it. Although we do need assistance. And I hope that after the ratification of the treaty there will be a suitable attitude toward Ukraine as well." Frankly speaking, by the way, may we be mistaken in counting on a suitable attitude toward Ukraine, as Valeriy Shmarov says, or in the words of Vasyl Durdynets, on reciprocal steps on the part of the nuclear powers? On the very same day that the Supreme Soviet ratified START, after all, the WASHINGTON POST wrote that the Ukrainian parliamentarians had put forth so many stipulations that the voting was more a political gambit than a final decision. That reaction is understandable; the conclusions and the results of the discussion by the Ukrainian parliamentarians affirmed in the document on the further fate of nuclear arms is not quite what they were counting on outside the borders of Ukraine. Thirty-six percent of the warheads, after all, is not 100 percent, as they wanted very much in Washington. And the seven years over which the cutbacks will take place are not the 24 months that the Russian delegation was seeking at the negotiations at Masandra. It clearly suits neither Russia nor the West that our parliamentarians made the stipulation that Ukraine does not consider Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, ratified along with START and signed in the name of Ukraine on 31 June 1991, binding on it. That article states that "Ukraine is obligated to become a non-nuclear state as soon as possible, and to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in that quality." You will ask, is it really and truly just a matter of Ukrainian nuclear ambitions, as Kiev has already been hearing for a whole year, and not only from the Russian minister of foreign affairs? No, it is not a case of ambitions. First of all, Ukraine could not make a claim to the components of the nuclear arms as their property in the case of joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. All scientific and industrial activity in Ukraine that is associated with the atom would moreover become illegal today. And what then would happen to our power engineering, which today relies almost a third on AESs [nuclear electric-power plants]? Second, the recent partners in the negotiations on nuclear arms are forgetting something that is already known and has been repeated more than once: "We can," feels Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Vasyl Durdynets, "provide for cutbacks and reductions only of that quantity of nuclear weapons that corresponds to our financial and economic capabilities." So it is still too early to put the period to the history of nuclear arms in Ukraine. And time will tell how it will be in the future. But one thing is clear now--after the ratification of START, there are no fewer problems in Ukraine. A difficult path to non-nuclear status and heavy and crucial work lie ahead. Both for the politicians and for the military. Neither domestic nor foreign journalists at the press conference, by the way, were interested in the fate of the servicemen of the 43rd Army. Until the diplomats agree, responsibility for security connected with the strategic arms--from ecological to military--rests with the people in uniform.
