Is such an agreement possible? [Voigt] Foreign citizens violating laws in Germany must expect to be punished or deported. But they must, of course, not be deported if there is a danger that they face a death sentence or torture. [Gast] This is exactly what the agreement should prevent. [Voigt] In the last instance, the decision will be made by German courts. I cannot imagine them only considering the contents of such an agreement, but they will take into account what these people are actually going to face in Turkey. [Gast] The reason for the Kurdish protests in the FRG is oppression in Turkey. The Turkish Government has been receiving military aid from the Federal Government for years. What are the government's possibilities of stopping military aid and thus pressing Turkey to improve the situation of the Kurds? [Voigt] The military aid that the government offered several NATO partners during the time of the Cold War is obsolete and no longer justifiable. This goes for Turkey, as well as for Greece and Portugal. I very much doubt whether stopping arms supplies is enough to get Turkey to change its treatment of the Kurds, which is primarily motivated by domestic policy considerations. Supplying arms is obsolete in foreign policy terms anyhow; apart from that, it cannot be justified in terms of human rights. Turkey's policy toward the Kurds will not change unless the government and population realize that this course leads to a dead end. They will realize that the Kurdish problem cannot be solved by military means and that the operations in southeast Anatolia ruin the country economically. The totally unacceptable military operations against the Kurds have increased pressure from outside and aggravated the economic crisis in the country. Nevertheless, the parties advocating particularly drastic measures gained votes in the recent elections. That is why one has to acknowledge quite realistically that pressure from outside cannot replace the learning process that must gain ground in the country -- realizing that the Kurds problem cannot be solved by military means. [Gast] But, irrespective of that, the Federal Government has to make sure that the arms it supplies are not used in internal conflicts. [Voigt] This is a promise that the Turkish Government has given the Federal Government already.... [Gast] ...and which it does not keep. [Voigt] This is a dilemma the government faces, because it advocates arms supplies and relies on this promise. We have been opposed to such supplies for years.
