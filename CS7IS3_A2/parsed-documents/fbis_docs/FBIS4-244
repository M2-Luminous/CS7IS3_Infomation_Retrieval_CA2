FBIS4-244 "drafr066_d_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola Envoy Urges UN Security Council Action on UNITA Envoy Urges UN Security Council Action on UNITA MB0604073394 Luanda Radio Nacional Network in Portuguese 0600 GMT 6 Apr 94 MB0604073394 Luanda Radio Nacional Network Portuguese BFN [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] SHOULD be more realistic and prove with facts and not maneuvers that it is really interested in national reconciliation that guarantees the continuation of the democratic process. That is the view of Ambassador Afonso van Dunem Mbinda. Speaking during a news conference at the UN headquarters in New York yesterday, the Angolan envoy to the United Nations accused UNITA of having stepped up its military offensive throughout the country while negotiating in Lusaka. In doing so, UNITA has sowed death and destruction. As an example, Ambassador Mbinda mentioned the destruction of the Luanda power lines and the killing of civilians in every corner of Angola. Ambassador Mbinda said that UNITA, although it has not won the elections arrogantly demands ministerial posts and the administration of provinces in central Angola, alleging its concern about the safety of residents who have coincidently been the most affected by the armed attacks. Mbinda says UNITA's demands are designed to facilitate the political control that the organization and its leader have always longed for and to fulfill UNITA's goal of dividing the country. The Angolan envoy said the government has rejected UNITA's proposals because they are illegitimate and contrary to the rules of democratic coexistence. Ambassador Mbinda said the government will continue to strive for the fulfillment of what has so far been agreed at the peace talks. Afonso van Dunem Mbinda says it is imperative that UNITA should continue to be pressured by all possible means so that it abides by democratic rules and abandons the warmongering stance that the organization has tried to conceal by claiming to be willing to negotiate politically. He said the unilateral cease-fire declaration was in fact designed to deceive world opinion and prevent the application of the second package of sanctions by the Security Council in line with Resolution 874/93. The Angolan diplomat said the government favors the adoption of a declaration by the UN Security Council. [Begin Mbinda recording] The government would like the declaration to state that in view of UNITA's unwavering attitude, and because it has not abided by the UN Security Council recommendations, conditions have been created to adopt new measures against UNITA.
