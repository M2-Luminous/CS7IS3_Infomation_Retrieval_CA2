The joint conference plan was agreed by the chairmen of the Tax Commission, the Economic Deliberation Council -- both advisory panels to the prime minister -- and the Fiscal System Council, an advisory body to the finance minister. The conference, made up of 10 members sent by the panels, will study such issues as the scrapping and reorganization of government ministries and agencies and the further privatisation of public organizations. It will present a concrete administrative reform plan to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata by early June, the sources said. They said panel leaders agreed that if they leave the long-proposed administrative reforms up to bureaucrats, the plan may lack substance. The leaders believe that the reforms should be carried out with the government taking the initiative, the sources added. At present, Japan faces the needs to change its taxation system in order to implement income tax cuts designed to stimulate the flagging economy, the sources said. Also, to cope with the rapid greying of the Japanese society, it is necessary to change the taxation system to secure funds to implement welfare programs for senior citizens, they added. The panels have urged the government to promote across-the-board discussions between panels responsible for different fields, such as the economy and spending for social security and defense programs.
