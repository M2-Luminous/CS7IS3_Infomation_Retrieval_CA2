According to the latest statistics compiled by the Ministry of Construction, the trend of rapid expansion of the scale of real estate development has somewhat subsided with the implementation of the various macro-regulatory and control measures. That is, the work has achieved initial results. Comparing the growth rates for January-November 1993 versus the same period in 1992 and the growth rates for the first half of 1993 versus the first half of 1992, we can see the following changes: The growth rate fell 14.9 percentage points for real estate investment, 26.7 percentage points for the floor space of buildings for sale under construction, 67.2 percentage points for the floor space of newly launched building projects, 15.9 percentage points for the floor space of buildings completed, 22.4 percentage points for the floor space of buildings sold, and 3.2 percentage point for the total sales volume. Since July 1993, strengthening and improving macro-regulation and control over the real estate market has been one of the focal tasks for all levels of governments and construction departments. Under the overall planning by the party Central Committee and the State Council, the Ministry of Construction promptly called a meeting in mid-July, attended by chairmen and directors of construction commissions and departments across the country, to make arrangements for the macro-regulation and control of the real estate market. After that, special teams led by six leaders from the Ministry of Construction were sent out on two different occasions to various places to listen to local work reports on strengthening macro-regulation and control over the real estate market and on conducting inspections of real estate development units. Meanwhile, similar arrangements for macro-regulation and control and plans for inspections were promptly mapped out by party committees and governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities and by all relevant departments and commissions of the State Council. Among other things, leading inspection groups were formed with the local governments' comrades in charge of construction work as the heads. The groups were composed of representatives from the departments of construction, land administration, industry and commerce, taxation, planning, and finance with the construction department representatives as the leading members. The concerted efforts made by the various levels of pertinent government departments have not only reined in remarkably the growing scale of real estate development, but also produced many positive results in the real estate industry, such as a better mix of investments, stable prices, and the gradual improvement of market rules. Plus, the management of real estate companies has also been improved to a remarkable extent. With the gradual shift of the focus of investment to urban residential construction, between January and November last year, 84.6 percent of the building projects around the country being constructed for sale were residences. Of the new building projects launched in this period, 85.5 percent were residences. Residences accounted for a whopping 89.7 percent of the building projects completed. All these topped the 1992 records. With the market under macro-regulation and control, real estate prices during the latter half of last year remain basically stable even in those areas that had been hot spots for real estate business. In some areas, prices of buildings completed and to be completed fell by 20-30 percent and 10-20 percent, respectively, compared with the beginning of last year. While progress is made in the macro-regulation and control of the real estate market, a number of pertinent regulations drawn up by the concerned departments of the State Council have been promulgated and put into effect. These include the "Statute for Value-Added Tax on Land," "Regulations Governing Assets of Real Estate Development Enterprises," and "Provisions on Comprehensive Acceptance Inspection of Newly Completed Small Housing Areas." Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other provinces have also promulgated local laws and regulations governing sales and transfers of land-using rights, real estate transactions, real estate price appraisal, and standard land prices. This has prepared the ground for legalizing the operations of the real estate market. With the market under macro-regulation and control, a number of incapable real estate development companies have closed down of their own accord. For example, 380 real estate companies in Guangxi have closed down in this way. Meanwhile, the authorities concerned in various localities have forced incapable real estate companies to cease their operations. In Guangdong Province, 170 real estate companies have been thus shut down. In addition, a number of illegally operating companies around the country have been investigated and dealt with. With regard to real estate companies established by land administrative departments or financial institutions, steps are being taken to separate them from these departments and institutions as required by the state regulations. Through more than a half year's efforts, remarkable results have been achieved in exercising macro-regulation and control over the real estate market. However, many problems exposed in the course of real estate development have yet to be radically resolved. For example, due to a lack of self-provided funds, many real estate development companies cannot fulfilled their contracts. To get foreign funds, some localities have often sold their land not in accordance with their established plan or even without a plan. The result is that they have arbitrarily sold a lot of farmland, especially vegetable land, leading to a sharp rise in vegetable prices within a short period. This has made it difficult for people to satisfy their vegetable demand. Besides, quite a number of localities have over-expanded their scale of development, making it necessary to move a large number of people out of the old residential areas. These people have to take care of themselves during the transitional period. They get no timely assistance from the government. In view of the above, some experts say that the macro-regulation and control of the real estate market over the past six months has only solved some urgent problems in developing the real estate industry, and the results obtained are merely initial-stage achievements. To truly put our real estate market on the track of orderly development and healthy operations, we should still do a lot of hard and careful work on the basis of what we have achieved at present.
