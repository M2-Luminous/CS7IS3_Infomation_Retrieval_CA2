The most complicated issue is that related to the presence of [former Lebanese Prime Minister] General Michel 'Awn whose position there is extraordinary because he is neither a political refugee nor an ordinary foreigner residing in France. In the agreement under which 'Awn left Lebanon for Marseilles and then La Hutte Maison, the French authorities promised to receive the Lebanese guest and provide protection for him provided he fulfilled a number of conditions. According to a high-ranking French source, the most important condition was that 'Awn should exercise restraint and not carry out any political activity on French soil. It seems that 'Awn has begun to seriously annoy the Lebanese Government since he announced preparations for a national conference which he invited the opposition to attend in the French capital in June. Lebanese official sources have hinted that 'Awn's financial file might be reopened and that there is a possibility that a request could be made for his extradition. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe if his government had received any such official request. Juppe replied "we have heard some echos about this matter but there is no official Lebanese request. At any rate, handing 'Awn over is out of the question but we will impress upon him the need to exercise the utmost restraint." Juppe seized the opportunity to call for a new Lebanese law for radio and television media "as soon as possible to enable everyone to express himself freely," in fulfillment of the promises made by the Lebanese Government to the French authorities. The French official also said that he wished that "judicial procedures in Lebanon would be carried out legally and legitimately, upholding the right of defense." He was referring to the file of the recent assassinations and explosions. Meanwhile, in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Gen. 'Awn said that he "intends to honor the restraint commitment" and would, therefore, refrain from holding any press conferences or organizing political demonstrations. He added that he would only answer the numerous telephone calls he gets from Lebanon and various parts of the world. On the claims that the Lebanese state was trying to open a dialogue with him, 'Awn said: "That kind of talk remains a kind of informational maneuvering. If there is anything serious, those concerned in Lebanon and outside it (Syria) should state their position in advance on a number of fundamental non-negotiable issues, namely the restoration of full sovereignty and freedom and independence of Lebanese decisionmaking." 'Awn added: "Everything else is negotiable. I am one of those who advocate respect for the vital interests of Lebanon's neighbors and for realistic dialogue with them, free from any complexes." 'Awn said that the "attempts of the current authorities in Lebanon are part of the policy of intimidation and temptation." He revealed that attempts were made in the past to hold a dialogue with him but they failed because "the government could not provide answers to the questions I asked."
