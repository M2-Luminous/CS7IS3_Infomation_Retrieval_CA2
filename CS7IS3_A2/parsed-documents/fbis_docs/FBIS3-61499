I. Mokrousova, N. A. Belova and N. A. Tsybikov, Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring; UDC 504.3.054. (1993.03) (047)(47+57)] [Abstract] During March 1993 extremely high atmospheric pollution was not registered (in March 1992 one such case was observed), nor were such cases registered in the first quarter of this year (two such cases were observed in the first quarter of 1992). During March in 7 cities (Omsk, Glazov, Tomsk, Kemerovo, Norilsk, Tolyatti, Moscow) in 12 cases the presence of pollutants in concentrations of 10 times the maximum admissible concentrations (MAC) were observed (in March 1992 this was true in 58 cases in 14 cities). In Moscow during March two cases of high atmospheric pollution with ammonia with 28 MAC and two cases of pollution with carbon monoxide with 12 MAC were observed. In this month extremely high pollution levels (MAC greater than 100, with a sharp worsening of organoleptic properties) resulted from 22 accidents in 16 water bodies (in comparison with March 1992 with 25 such events in 17 water bodies). During March 1993 there were 153 cases of high pollution in 103 water bodies, especially rivers. Various cases of oil spills in Russian rivers occurred. During March 1993 radiation conditions in the Russian Federation did not change substantially in comparison with February. The diurnal concentrations of radioactive aerosols in the atmosphere and their fallout onto the underlying surface were at the level of the background values.
