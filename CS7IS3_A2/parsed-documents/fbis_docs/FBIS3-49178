This was stated yesterday [4 January] by Sergey Kozlik, deputy Slovak prime minister for the economy, following his talks with the German Ambassador in Slovakia Heike Zenker. It is being considered that the overall sum of foreign credits for Mochovce should represent 1.5 billion German marks. This financial help is truly inevitable for Mochovce because, according to our information from this part of Slovakia, if the minimum funds for suppliers' survival are not safeguarded, they will have to suspend all work this month and leave the building site. This stems from the joint statement of two general suppliers of the Mochovce nuclear power station, Hydrostav Bratislava and Skoda Praha, addressed to the Slovak Government at the end of last year. In this connection, Stanislav Katrinec interviewed Peter Cuntala, deputy head of the Mochovce nuclear power station, and Mojmir Seliga, head of the department for international cooperation. [Begin recording] [Katrinec] Mr. Cuntala, does the Slovak Power Enterprise, as an investor, possess the minimum funds for both the main suppliers, or are they indeed leaving? [Cuntala] For the time being, we do not possess them. According to the statement of Director Gejdos, head of Hydrostav in Mochovce, the decision about whether they will remain at the building site will be made after 10 January 1994. [Katrinec] Mr. Seliga, you have about a week to do something in order to get this money. What are you going to do? [Seliga] At the beginning I should like to say that the business intention for Mochovce for 1994 has been prepared, but it has not been discussed yet. This is what is important for us. This means that, for the time being, we have no money. To get it, we must undergo important talks at the level of the Slovak Ministry of the Economy and the government. These talks were preceded by important talks at the Ministry of the Economy before Christmas, which were attended by Mr. Fauve, the head of foreign investments of Electricite de France, where the actual speeding up of the entire process was agreed upon. At the same time, however, I must say that, out of the original three members of the investors' consortium, only one remained--namely, Electricite de France. [Katrinec] This changes the situation. However, it does not change the basic condition of all of the potential foreign investors, which is privatization. At what stage is it at the Mochovce nuclear power station? [Seliga] The privatization project has been returned by the government bodies, and one has to wait for its signing so that we might implement the subsequent privatization steps at Mochovce. I should also like to say that Electricite de France remains the only partner to coordinate trade management in Mochovce. Its employees are now moving to the houses of [name indistinct] village. [Katrinec] Is one to understand that Electricite de France is serious about the investments in Mochovce? [Seliga] Yes, it may be understood that way because, in mid January, the director general of Electricite de France is coming for crucial talks with the Slovak Government, and our supervisory board has been preparing for them.
