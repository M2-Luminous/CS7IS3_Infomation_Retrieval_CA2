The plan, which was expected as a follow-up to the resignation of the company president 2 weeks ago (see LE MONDE of 1 February), calls for a 20 percent drop in production, which is slated to fall from 50 to about 40 aircraft per year, and an almost proportionate cut in the number of employees. Some 1,900 positions of the company's 10,500 positions will be eliminated (it had employed 12,800 as of December 1991), thus doubling the scope of initial personnel retrenchment plans for 1994. Assembly lines will suffer the largest number of cuts (1,400), but management is also taking hits. Some property disinvestments will follow, further reducing Fokker's overhead. Finally, the company is going to take a close, hard look at its contracts with suppliers. The big question is whether the Amsterdam builder will succeed in reducing its costs for the airframes provided by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), currently at a price well above the world average: 37 percent higher in the case of the F-70, and 57 percent in the case of the F-100. The contract antedates DASA's takeover of Fokker but has never been amended, a fact that leads some Dutch journalists to speculate the company is being set up for "strangulation" by its "predator-savior." The airframe surcharge is responsible for all but a few million florins of the 450-million loss Fokker is expected to post for 1993. But Fokker, like every other aviation builder, is buffeted by turbulent winds: The airlines, overequipped and locked in a price war, are not modernizing their fleets, and builders are intensifying the competition to hang onto market shares. Fokker does not expect real recovery before 1996, but says it is convinced it will weather the storm and keep its reputation for building innovative models.
