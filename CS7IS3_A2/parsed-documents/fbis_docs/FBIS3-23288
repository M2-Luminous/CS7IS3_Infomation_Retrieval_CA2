The bombings began at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah [refugee camp] in 1988. The security official, who preferred to remain anonymous, explained his viewpoint on the details of the bombings. He said: The plan, which was drawn up by the 30 defendants, most of whom received training and lived in Afghanistan, goes back to 1988. That is the year in which the explosion at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah took place. However, the repeated travel by their leaders to Afghanistan and the Philippines, and the discovery of 'Muhammad's Army', which carried out similar acts, prompted those individuals to suspend their activities in Jordan. The security official continues: Some of those who returned from Afghanistan and who have been arrested are members of the Islamic Action Front Party. However, the Front had nothing to do with their acts. He indicated that this "organization," if one can call it that, is composed of two groups: The first, which is the smaller of the two, carried out the al-Yarmuk Cinema bombing in 1988. The second, includes the leaders as well as the first group. [as published]. The security official said that 'Abdallah Kamul al-Hashayikah, who belongs to the Muslim Brothers, is the leader of this organization, and that Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ayyad is the second man in the organization. The security official revealed that this organization endeavors to promote the spirit of jihad and raises the jihad slogan through the Islamic world. It seeks to eliminate vileness and to strike at the dens of corruption. He explained that it became clear from the investigation of the defendants in the bombing operations that their motive was opposition to what they termed as capitulation. They also targeted theaters and liquor stores out of their belief that they play a vile role and should be uprooted as a religious duty. They believe there is no alternative to the use of force by bombing operations. The security official indicated that the bombing scheme was not confined to the bombings at the Rivoli and Salva theaters. An explosive charge was placed in a toffee box at the 'Akrush stores in Safut [a village between Amman and al-Baq'ah refugee camp], but failed to explode. A similar charge was placed at the Zahran Cinema in Amman. He said that investigations revealed that first class hotels in Amman were also a target. Furthermore, the investigations revealed a plan to assassinate political figures in the Jordanian and Palestinian peace delegations. However, President Yasir 'Arafat's name was not among them because they could not monitor his movements, but they were following the movements of members of the Jordanian and Palestinian delegations. The security official revealed that the defendants intensified their activities during the month of January this year because the main financier of their operations and plans, a Saudi citizen working with Usamah Bin Ladin, was planning to visit Jordan. The official continued to identify the financiers of the organization by saying that: Usamah Bin-Ladin is a wealthy Saudi who lives outside Saudi Arabia and is known for supporting extremist Islamic movements around the world. He was a friend of the late 'Abdallah 'Azzam, the spiritual leader of the Jordanian Afghans. On the relationship between what took place in Jordan and what is taking place in Egypt, the official said the defendants had no links to the fundamentalist organizations that are responsible for bombings in Egypt. However, some of the defendants confessed to their admiration for what is happening in Egypt and Algeria. He said most defendants had confessed to the charges against them, and that quantities of dynamite and raw materials used for making homemade explosives, such as acetone peroxide, a highly explosive material, in addition to a few pistols and machine guns, were discovered at their homes. He did not rule out the fact that other weapons may have been hidden because the arrest of some defendants was expected after some of their colleagues were arrested. The security official suggested a link between this organization, to which he did not give a name, and Muhammad's Army. However, he said that there is an organizational interconnection, but not organizational relations between the two. He denied that any of the defendants in the bombings were members of Muhammad's Army. On how the organization and the defendants were uncovered, the official said that the first link in the chain was defendant 'Id al- Jahhali, who was injured in the theater explosion. At first, he was moved with the other injured people who were inside the theater. However, the forensic experts had suspicions about his injuries because he lost his two legs and a finger. Thus, when his condition, described as critical, improved, he was interrogated by security men. He admitted he had placed the explosive charge in the theater. He said he waited for a while before leaving to avoid suspicion, but got carried away watching the movie and the charge exploded under his seat. The official said al-Jahhalin admitted to the names of those who carried out the bombings with him. They were led by Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ayyad, who gave him the explosive charge and who supervised all the bombing operations. The security official concluded by affirming that the judicial circles have started interrogating the defendants and that a charge sheet will most likely be ready in 3 weeks. He refused to reveal where the defendants are being detained. He merely said that "they are being held in an officially recognized prison."
