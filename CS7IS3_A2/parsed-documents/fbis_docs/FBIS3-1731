As we bade farewell to the old year and greeted the new, State Vice President Rong Yiren, in the midst of his pressing affairs, gave a special interview to a TZU CHING magazine special correspondent, talking freely about the excellent situation of China's reform and opening-up, forecasting the major trend of China's economic development, expounding on the inseparable relations between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, and extending New Year's greetings to our countrymen at home and abroad. Quick in thought, the 78-year-old vice president remained a good talker. Concentrating on the main points and taking a strategically advantageous position, he reviewed the past, forecast the future, and was full of confidence in the prospects for China's socialist modernization program. Assist the State President in Doing Jobs Rong Yiren was elected vice president of the PRC at the First Session of the Eighth National People's Congress on 27 March 1993. Ten full months have elapse since then. Rong Yiren said: "In the past I held the posts of vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, chairman of All China Association of Industry and Commerce, and chairman of the Board of Directors of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation [CITIC], but I spent most of my time on CITIC business. I am now state vice president, and have resigned my position as CITIC Board of Directors chairman. As a matter of fact, I was prepared to retire. Besides, I also have resigned my position as chairman of the Association of Industry and Commerce." "My position as state vice president is mainly to assist the state president in doing jobs." Rong Yiren declares. As state vice president, from April 1993 until now, Rong Yiren has visited Portugal and Spain, and has received and met with 88 groups of visitors from all over the world, including fellow countrymen from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, with almost one interview every two or three days, or sometimes several interviews in one day. Since the beginning of this year, the vice president has met with the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Zimbabwe, U.S. Senators, the Romanian minister of state affiars, and other important visitors. Talking about holding the post of state vice president, and whether or not he is busier than before, Rong Yiren said: "I cannot say busy; I was very busy in the past, when I worked at CITIC. Only now my work is of a stronger political nature than in the past, and the requirements are higher too." He declared that as state vice president he represents the interests and reputation of the state. In contacts with foreign visitors, it is necessary to present China's situation to them in a practical and realistic manner, introduce them to matters they want to know, and also explain to them patiently the things they do not quite understand. It is important to respect guests, as well as ourselves, but it is more important to promote and develop contacts and friendship between China and other countries. Constantly Exchanging Views With President Jiang Zemin Rong Yiren said: "In my work I often exchange views with President Jiang Zemin. I assist him in doing jobs, and I will do my best in whatever business I am required to do. President Jiang Z emin also attaches importance to my views, and we have had very good cooperation." Talking about his relations with President Jiang Zemin, Rong Yiren recalled with delight: "The two of us have a longstanding friendship, and have always been on very good terms. In 1979, in the PRC Foreign Investments Management Committee, Jiang Zemin was vice chairman, Gu Mu was chairman, and I was advisor. We had many contacts between us." "Afterward, Jiang Zemin became minister of the electronics industry, and I was engaged in setting up CITIC. We had many contacts in our jobs. When Jiang Zemin was mayor of Shanghai and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, I even called on him when I visited Shanghai." Talking about his job in mainland China, Vice President Rong Yiren said that as the emphasis of his job in the past was in the economic field, his job in mainland China was mainly to do more investigation and study and to discover the facts, and after consideration, to make suggestions and proposals to the departments concerned. "Therefore," Rong Yiren declared: "After being busily engaged in protocol work, I spend much of my time reading data and studying problems." In May and November last year, he went to Jiangsu Province and Tianjin Municipality in succession to make on-the-spot investigations and to discover facts. The visits were most rewarding. He points out: "As a whole, my job has been pretty smooth." The Year 1993 Laid a Solid Foundation for Future Development Talking about his appraisal of China's economic situation in 1993, Rong Yiren said: "Taken as a whole, China in 1993 witnessed the implementation of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It was a year in which China continued to score successes by seizing opportunities, deepening reform, and developing the economy faster and better [zhua zhu ji yu shen hua gai ge you kui you hou di fa zhan jing ji 2119 0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 0642 1816 0642 1170 0966 4099 1455 4842 3444]. Enormous changes have taken place in China's situation following Deng Xiaoping's inspection tour to southern China in 1992. At the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress, we finally built up all over China a unanimous understanding of the experiences gained through more than 10 years of exploration and discussion, that is, to build up the socialist market economy system. This has vigorously promoted the development of China's economy." Rong Yiren declared: From 1980 to 1991, the annual average growth of China's economy was about nine percent, the growth in 1992 was 12.8 percent, and the growth in 1993 was about 13 percent. Such high-speed growth for years running is very rarely seen in the world. The reason China made tremendous achievements in economic construction last year was primarily because China emphasized in- depth reform, strengthened macroeconomic regulation and control, and enabled economic construction to proceed in a more orderly way than in the past. Now China is socially and politically stable, agriculture continues to gain great bumper harvests, industrial production is growing rapidly, domestic markets are prosperous, foreign trade is brisk, the life of the people continues to improve, and the overall strength of China's economy has increased to some extent. All these accomplishments have laid a solid foundation for development in 1994 and in the years to come. A Nine Percent Growth Rate This Year Is Laid on a Good Foundation Rong Yiren said that this year China will further carry out in- depth reform, and will develop the economy with more intensive reforms in banking, fiscal levies, foreign trade, and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. In addition, we will step up legislation work, and a series of many laws and regulations will be introduced which will favor the transition to a market economy. He said: In accordance with China's basic national conditions and the essential requirements of the socialist market economy system, China's next-step reform still must adopt the methods of 'follow in order and advance step by step' and 'gradual transition'. Before the introduction of each reform measure, the bearing capacity of the state and the people must be taken into full consideration, and the ability to promote economic development and social stability through reform must be ensured. He said: For instance, the common people now have some complaints about prices, which should draw attention. Of course, some problems can be overcome only gradually, by reform. However, attention should be paid to acting according to economic law, and best efforts should be made to avoid the ups and downs of the economic situation and any major fluctuation. Talking about the growth rate this year, Rong Yiren believed that the nine percent growth rate now set has quite good a foundation. He declared: "It seems that this growth rate is lower than that of last year, but actually it is not. Economic development in China should take the road of sustained, high-speed, and healthy development [chi xu kuai shu jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6615 0256 1660 4099 1455], and nine percent is a rational pace. Throughout the `Eighth Five-year Plan,' China's growth rate was set at eight to nine percent, which was precisely for the sake of being favorable to mobilizing the initiatives of various fields, and of ensuring the healthy and orderly progress of economic construction." Rong Yiren stressed that currently it is necessary to handle several relationships well, that is, the relationships in sustained, high-speed, and healthy development [chi xu kuai shu jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6615 0256 1660 4099 1455], and the relationships in reform, development, and stability. In the former group of relationships, healthy development is the crux, and only with healthy development will there be truly sustained, and high- speed development; otherwise it will possibly be false and bad development. For example, the economy grows at a high speed, but inflation also rises to an extent that the common people can hardly bear. Then what is is the good of it? Conversely, if everything is kept under tight control, the economy can hardly develop either. Among reform, development, and stability, reform is the leading factor. Without reform, there will be no development, but without stability, and without social and political stability, both reform and development are but empty phrases. Therefore, development is the objective, reform is the motive force, and stability is the guarantee. We hope to promote development through reform. Only when the economy develops and the living standards of the people are raised can there be political and social stability, and stability, in turn, pushes forward in-depth reform. These are the major experiences China has acquired in the more than 10 years of reform and opening up. Currently It Is Still Necessary To Lay Stress on Hard Struggle With regard to why China's high-speed economic development in recent years has drawn the world's serious attention, Rong Yiren asserted his belief that China covers a large territory, and has a large population. It naturally occupies a very large proportion of the world, and it is quite natural for it to draw the attention of others. However, if we analyze in a practical and realistic manner, there is an enormous gap between China's per capita income and that of many Western countries. Some people currently overestimate China's economic strength. This, plus differences in statistical methods, means that people are quite different in their viewpoints. Of course, there are two kinds of situation here. One is: People are friendly to China, and they are really happy with China's progress. The other is: People harbor evil designs. Toward this kind of situation, explanations should be made to them and those things that are not in conformity with facts should be cleared up, and exaggeration by some people who have ulterior motives also should be guarded against. Rong Yiren explained that China has made considerable achievements in economic development, but it is still quite a long way from its objective. We propose to build China into a medium- developed country within half a century, and it is now still a far cry from this objective. We still are required to keep making great efforts. He declared that China currently is still required to lay stress on arduous efforts, on thrift and hard work, and on determination to make progress, as well as to truly build China well through concerted efforts." He criticized some localities for being wasteful and extravagant after their economic conditions improved. He said that such a situation is no good and should be stopped resolutely. Rong Yiren gave this earnest advice: New China was built on the foundation of a semicolonial and semifeudal society, and the goal now is to build a modern socialist country with Chinese characteristics. It is impossible to achieve this goal without going through protracted arduous struggles, without surmounting numerous difficulties, and without undergoing repeated setbacks. The policy is: Strive for fewer twists and turns, and for more stable development. China Attaches Great Importance to the Development and Role of Hong Kong Talking about the relations between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, Rong Yiren said: "As an international monetary, trading, and shipping center, Hong Kong has very close ties with the economic development of the Chinese mainland. In the past few years, Hong Kong's volume of international trade grew considerably, and it had more and more contacts with the Chinese mainland. Investments by Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and especially by those in Hong Kong, also grew very rapidly. For years running, investments from Hong Kong occupied first place in the overseas investments drawn by the Chinese mainland -- approximately over 60 percent. Therefore, we value the development and role of this region." Rong Yiren said that only by relying on the Chinese mainland had Hong Kong been able to develop up to today. Without the support of the mainland, the daily life of the residents would be affected, not to mention banking and trading. Through the important region of Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland has developed its contacts with the international community, and Hong Kong also has gained many benefits from the frequent contacts between the Chinese mainland and the outside world. Therefore, the close links between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, were as described by Premier Li Peng: "The economies of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland have become an inseparable entirety." He said that currently more and more compatriots in Hong Kong have come to understand the relations between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, thereby developing more and more economic and trading contacts with the Chinese mainland." He hoped that this favorable momentum would continue to develop. Rong Yiren said that recently the negotiations between China and Britain on the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements had broken down as a result of the fact that the British Government did not live up to its words and took an uncooperative attitude. This increased some troubles and difficulties, and it was natural for our compatriots in Hong Kong to worry about the situation. Whatever the situation, however, the Chinese Government will uphold the principles of "one country two systems" and of Hong Kong governed by Hong Kong people, which will never change. Together with patriotic fellow-countrymen of various circles in Hong Kong, the principles of the Basic Law will be upheld, and the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong will be maintained. He pointed out that it was only a little over three years before China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong. He hoped that during this period everyone would see more clearly the situation in which Hong Kong stands, that economic and trade ties with the Chinese mainland would be developed in a better way, and that the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong would be upheld. Before the end of the interview, Vice President Rong Yiren wished, through TZU CHING magazine, to extend New Year's greetings to compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, to compatriots in Taiwan, and to fellow countrymen residing overseas, wishing all of them a happy Lunar New Year, happiness to the whole family, and that everything turns out as they wish.
