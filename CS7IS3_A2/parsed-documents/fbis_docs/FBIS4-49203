Telephone service to his home and the homes of four other dissidents was cut April 27, said Bao Ge, adding that he was "constantly followed by policemen." Also losing the use of their telephones were Yang Zhou, spokesman of the Chinese Human Rights Association, its secretary general, Wang Fucheng, as well as Fu Shenqi and Zhang Xianliang, two activists sentenced last summer to three years in a reform-through-labour camp. As for Wang, he "disappeared three weeks ago and nothing has been heard from him since," Bao said. "The situation in Shanghai is more and more tense." Chinese officials, fearing renewed antigovernment activities this May, have stepped up their repression of dissidents over the past few weeks, arresting dozens of them. China's best-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, remains under police surveillance in a hotel in suburban Beijing because, officials said, he is suspected of "new crimes." Bao also said a meeting between lawyers and the general public in Shanghai's Xiangyang Park on April 24, with the theme "Legal Advice," had been cut short by police because of the large number of complaints and insults directed against the police and the government. "This public meeting almost degenerated into a demonstration against corruption and human rights violations," Bao added. Asked about the incident by telephone, police declined to comment.
