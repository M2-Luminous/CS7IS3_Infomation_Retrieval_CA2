[Kovac] People will be able to make decisions much easier in a quiet atmosphere than under the pressure of psychological stress. In a calm atmosphere, not only will it be possible to present programs but also the public will also have a chance to ponder their content. However, if other elements enter the preelection atmosphere, the people will logically miss the essence of what individual parties are pushing for and the way they want to implement things. Emotions and irrationality could enter into the forefront when decisions are made. This is why we need to exert maximum efforts to at least make the preelection atmosphere as civilized as possible. [Minarik] What are the chances, in your opinion, that the coalition government of Prime Minister Moravcik will remain in power after the elections? [Kovac] I believe that not only Slovakia, but also other former socialist countries need coalition governments in this transitional period. In other words, they need to involve all of the decisive political entities in the historical changes. As early as last year, I called for, in no uncertain terms, precisely this solution to the internal political crisis in Slovakia. I suppose that, even after the parliamentary elections in the fall, a situation will arise in the Slovak Republic that will force the establishment of a coalition government. [Minarik] What place do you foresee for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] after the elections? It follows from the speeches of its chairman, former Prime Minister V. Meciar, that he unequivocally assumes that he will return to power.... [Kovac] In my opinion, the HZDS will remain an important political force even after the elections. I cannot estimate to what extent he will be able to acquire partners for a possible coalition government, but it seems at present that the HZDS is not exerting any special efforts in that respect. Of course, internal development continues within any party and any movement, and the HZDS is no exception--the evolution and the process of shaping continue. I really do not know and dare not guess what shape it will assume for the election in the fall. [Minarik] You participated in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Allied forces' invasion in Normandy. Was it only a commemorative act? [Kovac] It was, above all, an occasion to commemorate the Czechs' and Slovaks' active participation in this historical battle, by which they helped defeat fascism. This also was an occasion to make Slovakia more visible and not just in the eyes of the European public. For me, it was a chance to meet veterans from the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic who fought for Normandy and thank them for the sacrifices they endured. Finally, it also was an occasion to speak with supreme representatives of some states. [Minarik] What talks were involved? [Kovac] With French Prime Minister E. Balladur, we spoke, among other things, not only about certain circumstances surrounding the CSFR's partition, but also about the Stability Pact. With President F. Mitterrand, we discussed his planned visit to Slovakia. He said that he realized that the democratic forces in the Slovak Republic had to be supported. President Clinton told me that he had noticed certain positive changes in Slovakia's development. He spoke with affection and appreciation about the current efforts. He expressed, as did others, his hope that we would continue to strengthen our political stability. [Minarik] You met with President Havel for the third time in a short period during the celebrations of the invasion of Allied troops in Normandy. [Kovac] I sincerely admit that we did not discuss politics. We had a personal and friendly conversation. President Havel's attention, and mine as well, was not concentrated on our mutual relations. [Minarik] The 50th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising is drawing near. Are you inspired by the meeting on the French and British seashore? [Kovac] I watched everything closely because I will be the main host at our celebrations, and I want everything to turn out well. Of course, it would be proper to use in our celebrations part of what we saw in France and Britain. I realize that we have a unique opportunity to present Slovakia in a favorable light.
