He Jihai, vice-minister of internal trade, spoke at the opening of the trade fair, saying that from now on a national commodity trade fair will be held every spring and fall in both Tianjin and Shanghai. The official said that there are many reasons to choose these two big cities to host the nationwide trade fairs. Tianjin and Shanghai were China's trade centers in the past, he said, adding that, being locating at the mouths of big rivers, they both had developed good transport systems by air, land and water. He said that over the past few years both municipal governments have taken many forceful steps to restore their prestige as business centers. A number of large-sized markets and modern trade centers have been built in these two cities. In Tianjin there are now 22 trading centers for production necessities, with a trade volume of 35.4 billion yuan in the first quarter this year, a sturdy 65 percent rise over the total last year, the official said. In contrast, he said, Shanghai's total commodity retail sales last year reached 65.35 billion yuan, increasing 33.5 percent over the previous year. National commodity trade fairs were staged in Shanghai in the fall of 1992 and 1993. This has laid the groundwork for the city to be a business center for the country, he said. But there is a need to build another such trade center in north China around Bohai Bay, he said, adding that Tianjin appears to be the ideal choice.
