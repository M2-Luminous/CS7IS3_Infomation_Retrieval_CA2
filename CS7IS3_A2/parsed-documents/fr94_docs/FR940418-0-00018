FR940418-0-00018 FR940418-0-00006 E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions In accordance with section 175A(b) of the CAA, the State of North Carolina has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP eight years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional ten years. Final Action In this final action, EPA is approving the Raleigh/Durham O 3 maintenance plan, including the 1990 base year emission inventory, because it meets the requirements of section 175A. In addition, the EPA is redesignating the Raleigh/Durham area to attainment for O 3 because the State of North Carolina has demonstrated compliance with the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation. This action stops the sanctions and federal implementation plan clocks that were triggered for the Raleigh/Durham area by the January 15, 1993, findings letter. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. The O 3 SIP is designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the CAA and to provide for attainment and maintenance of the O 3 NAAQS. This final redesignation should not be interpreted as authorizing the State of North Carolina to delete, alter, or rescind any of the VOC or NO x emission limitations and restrictions contained in the approved O 3 SIP. Changes to O 3 SIP VOC regulations rendering them less stringent than those contained in the EPA approved plan cannot be made unless a revised plan for attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by EPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions, and changes could result in a finding of nonimplementation (section 173(b) of the CAA) or in a SIP deficiency call made pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the CAA. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any regulatory requirements on sources. The Administrator certifies that the approval of the redesignation request will not affect a substantial number of small entities. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective June 17, 1994. If, however, notice is received by May 18, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published before the effective date. One will withdraw the final action and the other will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a comment period. Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).) This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225) as revised by a Memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro to Regional Administrators, dated October 4, 1993. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
