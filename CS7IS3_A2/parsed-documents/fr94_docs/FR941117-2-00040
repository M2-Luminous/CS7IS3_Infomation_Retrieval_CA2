FR941117-2-00040 FR941117-2-00035 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Office of the Secretary Federal Financial Participation in State Assistance Expenditures; Federal Matching Shares for Aid to Families With Dependent Children, Medicaid, and Aid to Needy Aged, Blind, or Disabled Persons for October 1, 1995 through September 30, 1996 AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Federal Percentages and Federal Medical Assistance Percentages for Fiscal Year 1996 have been calculated pursuant to the Social Security Act (the Act). These percentages will be effective from October 1, 1995 through September 30, 1996. This notice announces the calculated ``Federal percentages'' and ``Federal medical assistance percentages'' that we will use in determining the amount of Federal matching in State welfare and medical expenditures. The table gives figures for each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Programs under title XIX of the act exist in each jurisdiction; title IV&hyph;A programs in all jurisdictions except American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands; programs under titles I, X, and XIV operate only in Guam and the Virgin Islands; while a program under title XVI (AABD) operates only in Puerto Rico. The percentages in this notice apply to State expenditures for assistance payments and medical services (except family planning which is subject to a higher matching rate). The statute provides separately for Federal matching of administrative costs. Sections 1101(a)(8) and 1905(b) of the Act, as revised by section 9528 of Pub. L. 99&hyph;272, require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish these percentages each year. The Secretary is to figure the percentages, by formulas in sections 1101(a)(8) and 1905(b) of the Act, from the Department of Commerce's statistics of average income per person in each State and in the Nation as a whole. The percentages are within upper and lower limits given in those two sections of the Act. The statute specifies the percentages to be applied to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The ``Federal percentages'' are for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and aid to needy aged, blind, or disabled persons, and the ``Federal medical assistance percentages'' are for Medicaid. However, under section 1118 of the Act, States with approved Medicaid plans may claim Federal matching funds for expenditures under approved State plans for these other programs using either the Federal percentage or the Federal medical assistance percentage. These States may claim at the Federal medical assistance percentage without regard to any maximum on the dollar amounts per recipient which may be counted under paragraphs (1) and (2) of sections 3(a), 403(a), 1003(a), 1403(a), and 1603(a) of the Act. DATES: The percentages listed will be effective for each of the 4-quarter-year periods in the period beginning October 1, 1995 and ending September 30, 1996.
