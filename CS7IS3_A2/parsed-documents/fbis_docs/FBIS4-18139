Giovanni Masotti reports. [Masotti] There were smiles and optimism, which was an unexpected development. Only yesterday Umberto Bossi had said no for the umpteenth time to Berlusconi's bid for the premiership. But today, following a 90 minute meeting, Bossi gave Berlusconi the go-ahead. [Begin Berlusconi recording] In this alliance Forza Italia is the major force. Berlusconi is the leader of Forza Italia, he practically created this movement. So I cannot see how there can be any doubt on this matter, and this will be confirmed to you by the Northern League and its representatives. [end recording] [Masotti] Berlusconi is pushing ahead, and hinted at what an organizational chart might look like. He also revealed that he has contacted the Center. Berlusconi did not rule out that the deputy premiership could go to a Northern League politician. He added that the National Alliance would be part of the government, although party leader Gianfranco Fini would not join the government by his own choice. Bossi has also spoken of a first, reasonably clear and positive signal. He said that they are starting from a fixed position -- that of federalism. Bossi will meet Berlusconi again on Friday [1 April], and the meeting could be decisive.
