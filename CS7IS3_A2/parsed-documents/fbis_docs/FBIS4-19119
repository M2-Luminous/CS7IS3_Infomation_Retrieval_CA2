Some observers had anticipated an even greater drop. Imports from the EU dropped by 44.4 billion Belgian francs or 2.8 percent to 1,522 billion. Since the downturn was almost equivalent in exports and imports, the trade balance's surplus hardly changed. The trade surplus with the EU eroded by 0.6 billion Belgian francs to 8.3 billion. Exports to Germany, the BLEU's main trading partner, decreased by 6.8 percent to452.6 billion Belgian francs, while imports from Germany even dwindled by 9.3 percent to 465.6 billion. Trade with France and the Netherlands, the second and third trading partner respectively, also declined. On the other hand, trade with the United Kingdom, our fourth trading partner, improved. It was the only important EU partner which achieved a significant economic growth last year. Additionally, the NIS (National Institute for Statistics) confirms that exports to the rest of the world rose sharply, while imports from third countries plummeted. During the first half of 1993, exports to non-EU countries soared by 36.2 billion Belgain francs or 7.3 percent to 531.4 billion. Imports dropped by as much as 75 billion Belgian francs or 13.6 percent to 478.4 billion. As a result, trade with third countries yielded a surplus of 53 billion Belgian francs, against a deficit of 58.2 billion in the same period of 1992. So total exports decreased by 8.8 billion Belgian francs to 2,061.7 billion, and imports by 119.4 billion to 2,000.4 billion. As a result, the BLEU had a trade surplus of 61.3 billion Belgian francs in the first half of 1993, against a deficit of 49.3 billion in the same period as the year before. The NIS already has more recent figures on trade with non-EU countries, because the processing of extracommunity trade still occurs on the basis of customs documents. These data reveal that, for 1993 as a whole, exports to the rest of the world soared by 15 percent to 1,146 billion Belgian francs, and that imports fell by 4 percent to 1,027 billion. The NIS observes that it had to deal with an incomplete declaration file and with an irregular response on the part of the companies. Therefore, and in order to have results which can be compared with the previous years, the institute touched up the recorded data. This adjustment occurred on the basis of VAT data from the Finance Ministry. Over 31,000 companies must transmit information on imports and exports to the NIS. Each of them achieves at least 4.2 million Belgian francs in intracommunity imports or exports a year, while they account for more than 98 percent of overall intratrade.
