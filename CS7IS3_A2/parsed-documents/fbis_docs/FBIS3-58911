Speaking to newsmen prior to his departure for Rome, Ciampi said that in his conversation with Clinton, who will be going to Moscow in a few days, the focus was on the Group of Seven summit to be held this July in Naples where the world's leading industrial countries will discuss Western economic aid to Russia and the continuing dialogue with Moscow. In this context, Ciampi confirmed that, in accordance with precedent, although Russia is not a part of the G-7 club, its head of state has been invited to the Naples gathering for a joint meeting with the summit participants. Asked by a journalist if he expected to still be the Italian head of government in July, Ciampi said that the Naples summit would be organized by whoever was the premier at the time. He noted that it was he, as governor of the Bank of Italy, [who was] to organize the celebrations marking the institution's 100th birthday, but that he had already left for the premier's office by the time the anniversary rolled around. Continuity was the watchword in such cases, he said. Institutions last longer than the people who keep them running. As to the NATO summit which wound up this morning, Ciampi described it as having been "extremely positive." He said he would not go so far as to use the word "historic," as that would be up to historians to decide in some 30 or 40 years' time, but that it was important in that it confirmed that NATO was an instrument in evolution, and not tied to a particular moment which, once passed, relegated it to the dustbin. Other seasons lay before the alliance now that the era of the Cold War is over. Furthermore, the summit of the sixteen alliance partners has confirmed Europe's growing weight within NATO, the American committment toward Europe and NATO's opening to the nations to the east, he underscored with satisfaction. Particularly gratifying to Italy was the fact that the NATO partners outspokenly recognized for the first time, the ever growing importance of the Mediterranean region with regard to North-South relations, Ciampi said. The Group of Seven could associate the Russia of Boris Yeltsin with its politicial decisions, while retaining the validity of the G-7-plus-one formula for the group's analysis of economic matters. The was the upshot of some of the thinking that Ciampi and Clinton did together today, according to diplomatic sources here. There was also talk of issuing additional special drawing rights to bolster Russian reforms, the sources said. Italy currently holds the G-7 duty presidency and preparations for the July summit in Naples were brought up during the consultations which, besides Ciampi and Clinton, also included Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Both sides were found to be deeply in sync on strategic matters. Ciampi and Clinton reconfirmed the political value of the current G-7 format which, since 1991, includes talks with the top Kremlin leader right after the final summit session, but they now envisage the possibility of opening up the political discussions to include Russia. As if to underscore the cordiality of the American-Italian encounter today, it was noted that Clinton will report back to Ciampi telephonically as soon as he has concluded his trips to Prague, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva. The call will be placed on January 17 and the briefing will also serve to prepare for the G-7 summit this summer, the sources said.
