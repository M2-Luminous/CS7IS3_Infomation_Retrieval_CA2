Upholding a lower court's ruling, the Seoul appellate court sentenced Chong Mong-hon, 47, vice chairman of Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., to three years in prison but suspended the jail term for five years, saying, "the accused contributed greatly to the national economic growth while serving the nation's leading conglomerate. Furthermore, he did not appropriate the secret fund for private use," although he was found guilty of having formed the secret fund illegally. On the count of violating the foreign exchange control law, the court acquitted Chong, saying his company did not borrow money from an American firm but just "stood security" for a Hyundai subsidiary in America to borrow money from a U.S. bank. Three other former employees of Hyundai Merchant Marine including former President Pak Se-yong, 54, charged in connection with the tax evasion and foreign exchange control violations, were all given suspended jail terms ranging from three to four years. Chong and the others were arrested by the prosecution and accused of evading taxes totaling 5.5 billion won (about 7 million dollars) and forming a 21.1-billion-won secret fund from 1987 to 1991 by manipulating the company's documents, including yearly project reports and the minutes of senior staff meetings.
