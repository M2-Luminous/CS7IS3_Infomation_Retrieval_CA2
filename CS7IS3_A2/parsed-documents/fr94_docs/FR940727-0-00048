FR940727-0-00048 FR940727-0-00023 48 CFR Parts 1842 and 1853 Corrections and Clarification to NASA FAR Supplement Coverage on Disallowance of Costs AGENCY: Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule clarifies who the responsible NASA contracting officer is when more than one contract is affected. This action is necessary to assure compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, ensure that NASA coordinates internally disallowance of costs and to make the NFS more understandable. The effect of this action will be better coordination within NASA. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joe Le Cren, Code HC, (202) 358&hyph;0444. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1842.801(a) requires the contracting officer to take action after receipt of a NASA Form 456, Notice of Contract Costs Suspended or Disapproved, or a DCAA Form 1, Notice of Costs Suspended and/or Disapproved under Cost Reimbursement Contracts. However, when more than one contract is cited on the notice, the NFS does not specify which contracting officer has responsibility for the action. NFS 1842.801 is changed to clarify that the contracting officer with the most dollars affected is responsible for coordination with the other affected contracting officers, including those of other federal agencies. The cross-reference at 1842.801(b) is also revised to identify the correct cite. In addition, 1853.242&hyph;72 is revised to include the correct prescription cite. Other minor changes have also been made for efficiency or clarification. Impact NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). This rule does not impose any information collection subject to 44 U.S.C. chapter 35. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1842 and 1853 Government procurement. Thomas S.
