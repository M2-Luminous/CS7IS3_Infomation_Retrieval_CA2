Talab al-Sani' had this to say about the session: [Begin recording] [Al-Sani'] The meeting follows recent political developments. This is not the first time I have called on Shaykh Yasin at the prison. I met with Foreign Minister Shim'on to press for Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's release against the background of recent political developments and Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's deteriorating health. [Unidentified reporter] Political developments in the peace process and the Israeli-Palestinian agreement must have come up during your talk with him. Where does he and the Islamic movement in general stand on these issues? [Al-Sani'] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin expressly stated that Hamas will not use violence to topple the agreements; it will use the same civilized methods used on the Israeli street. He said the opposition has the right to express itself. Hamas, said Shaykh Yasin, will respect the Palestinian police force in that it is of the Palestinian people. As for the prospects for Shaykh Yasin's release, he said it is every human being's wish is to be free and that freedom is a natural right for every human being. However, he is in detention because he believes in the Palestinian people's right to freedom. He also argues that people under occupation are entitled to resist occupation. Shaykh Yasin said he supports the principle of a just peace that guarantees the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. He is opposed to occupation and the shedding of innocent blood on both sides. [end recording]
