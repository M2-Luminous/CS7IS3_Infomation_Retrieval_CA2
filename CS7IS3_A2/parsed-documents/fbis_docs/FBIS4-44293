But even Dehaene's main sponsor, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is inclined to put Dehaene on ice. It is called realpolitik. In the United Kingdom, Major's opposition to the 11 other member states is being described by a considerable section of his party as proof of bravery in the face of a steamroller, steered by treacherous continental Europeans. The British prime minister was applauded in his parliament. What does Major reproach Dehaene for, because after all he has to give some reason to justify his veto? That he is an enthusiastic state interventionist and moreover a convinced European federalist. Of course, in this country it does not have to be explained that Dehaene is not a fanatic neoliberal. But it is hard to imagine that his ideas are so far more to the left than those of the Socialist Jacques Delors. The point about being a European federalist is a very different story, because here it is about the British way of seeing Europe, or rather above all of not seeing it. The United Kingdom, and certainly the present government there, want to limit Europe to being as big a free-trade zone as possible. Free trade, all the rest is superfluous or even highly undesirable in the eyes of these British. There should be no European works councils for large multinationals, preferably no monetary union and no social legislation. Sometimes it gives the impression that the British joined Europe to prevent a power bloc forming in continental Europe within which they would have no say or would only play second fiddle. Therefore it is high time to give the United Kingdom what it is apparently asking for: A special status somewhere on the outside track, in such a way that the other countries, those which want to go further, do not suffer any nuisance from it. In fact it is already following this direction. The British veto against Dehaene makes it clear that it must quickly follow this path. It is a task for Belgian diplomacy among others. Because what happened in Corfu will not be forgotten lightly. Dehaene can now concentrate a little more on the problems in his own country. Dehaene's prestige has increased. He has evolved from being an electoral risk factor to someone who can be put forward in elections by his party. In Europe, only the British do not want to know about him, but what credibility do the British still have in Europe? Two major possibilities remain. Either Dehaene and the Christian People's Party decide that it would be better to immediately follow through on the impetus of the European elections and not give the Flemish Liberal Democrats any chance of recovery. That would mean early elections soon, but they are not immediately conceivable in the prime minister's present mood. Probably the choice will be for continuation, preferably to the end of 1995. That presupposes a government which does more than just wait for its policies to bear fruit and then reap the harvest. Therefore it requires a very serious budget for 1995, not a paper operation which avoids the problems and reforms of the social security system to give it real chances of survival. Very quickly it should become clear if that is impossible, in which case it would be better to give up immediately.
