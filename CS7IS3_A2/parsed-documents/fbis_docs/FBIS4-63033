The Chief Of Staff Was Not Allowed Into The President's Office"] [Text] Signs are that the fate of Russian Federation presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov has been sealed. In the next few days he will leave his post. The chances of his retaining the post are extremely slim. Yesterday a senior official in the presidential apparatus, speaking in a confidential conversation in the State Duma, told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that an edict about Mr. Filatov's resignation has been signed by the president and that only the date and the document's registration number have not yet been stamped. Mr. Filatov himself in an interview with INTERFAX denied reports about his upcoming resignation, stating that "some quarters stand to gain from putting about rumors about all sorts of resignations, dismissal, and reshuffles in the upper reaches of power. The aim of this permanent campaign is to impede reform and prevent consolidation of society." Yet indirect confirmation that Mr. Filatov has fallen from grace came after the State Duma's plenary session Wednesday decided to summon Sergey Filatov. This was because at its previous session, on 13 May, Ruslan Orekhov, chief of the State Legal Directorate under the Russian Federation president, failed to respond to many of the State Duma deputies' questions. State Duma Deputy Speaker Mikhail Mityukov phoned Filatov at the deputies' demand and invited him to the Duma session. According to Mityukov, Mr. Filatov agreed but said he wanted to ask the president's permission for the visit. No permission was obtained because Mr. Filatov, by his own admission, was not received by the president, which is very strange for a chief of staff. According to information in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's possession, at the current point in Russia's state history only Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, Yuriy Skokov, Viktor Ilyushin, and Yuriy Baturin have free access to President Yeltsin's office.
