This situation has enabled authorities to arrest many users in each operation it conducts, but limited detention facilities present authorities with problems in holding users longer for rehabilitation. Ramil Abdul Samad, president of the Association of Former Drug Users (PENGASIH), said that the influx of users is because the capital for more than 10 years has been the center of the drug trade. He said the drug traffic around the capital has become the focus of users from Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, and Johor, whereas users from the north gather in Pulau Pinang to get supplies. "Users from those areas gather in the capital because of the ease in obtaining supplies, and they become vagrants living in dark lanes and under bridges," he said. He explained that limited detention space forced the Enforcement Directorate of the Kuala Lumpur City Council (DBKL) to release 40 of the 56 vagrants detained at the beginning of this week. In a joint operation by police and the Public Welfare Department (JKM), vagrants were arrested in the act of injecting drugs into their own bodies or in a state of hallucination after taking drugs. Some of them were among those released. Ramli said that districts around the capital where small-scale drug traffickers gather to provide supplies to users include Puduraya, Bukit Bintang, Petaling Street, and the Chow Kit area.
