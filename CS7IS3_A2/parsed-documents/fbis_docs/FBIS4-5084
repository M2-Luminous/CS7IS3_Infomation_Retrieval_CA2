FBIS4-5084 "dreas067_c_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 North Korea ROK Student Security Violation Arrest Decried ROK Student Security Violation Arrest Decried SK0704052894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0509 GMT 7 Apr 94 SK0704052894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Hysterics of Dictator Under `Civilian' Mask" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- It is entirely unjustifiable that the South Korean authorities inflicted penalties upon the chairman of the General Student Council of Kwangju University, the ex-director of the department for solidarity of the general student council of Chonnam National University and the ex-chairman of the national reunification committee of the university on charges of exchanging letters with students of Kim Il-song University and leading demonstrations, says NODONG SINMUN today. The reunification movement conducted by South Korean students to put a period to national division is a praiseworthy patriotic act and it can by no means be incriminated, the news analyst says, and goes on: The criminal is none other than the Kim Yong-sam group itself which, seeking confrontation, not national unity, has broken up inter-Korean dialogue which continued even under the military dictatorship and has left no stone unturned in obstructing and suppressing the pro-reunification patriotic movement of students and people. It is a brutal act bereft of human nature, let alone an iota of national conscience, for the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique, the very criminal, to brandish the sword at the students who conducted righteous activities. This time the Kim Yong-sam group again invoked the notorious "National Security Law" in imposing penalties upon the patriotic students. The "National Security Law" is a most reactionary anti-communist fascist law that violates all the freedom and rights of the people and defines the fellow countrymen in the North as an "enemy" and incriminates any contact with them. The Kim Yong-sam group still keeps that kind of law and uses it as a tool for maintaining "power", ignoring the unanimous opposition of the people at home and abroad. This proves that it is a group of human dregs and hooligans who are clean indifferent to the desire of the nation and the trend of the times. The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to find a way out in bringing anti-reunification storm, following outside forces. But it is a foolish dream. The Kim Yong-sam group must stop anti-reunification suppression at once.
