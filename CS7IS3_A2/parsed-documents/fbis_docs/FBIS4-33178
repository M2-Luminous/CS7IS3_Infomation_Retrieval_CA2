As in other Cuban industries, refinery officials are trying to find a partner with whom they can jointly operate the enterprise. This would lead to the securing of adequate amounts of crude oil, to stable production, and to a market for that production. This was confirmed to Radio Havana Cuba by Jose Luis Garcia, the refinery's deputy director in charge of economic affairs. Garcia said the Mexican side, along with Cuba, would make investments needed to help the plant improve its efficiency. [Begin recording] [Garcia] This is a primary refining plant. We need a secondary process -- in other words, heavy processing -- to guarantee higher percentages of clear derivatives which garner higher prices on the world market. This would make the plant more competitive. [Betancur] On our way here, we noticed that smoke was coming out of the chimney. Obviously you are refining oil. I would like to know what kind of oil you are refining right now and how the operation is going. [Garcia] Right now, during the first four months of the year, we have had fairly stable refining of crude oil and a stable yield of oil byproducts for national use. [Betancur] When you say crude oil, you are not talking about national crude oil, but about the crude oil we import, right? Do you refine Cuban crude oil here also? [Garcia] So far we have been refining imported crude oil, not national crude oil. [Betancur] How many derivatives can this refinery produce? [Garcia] We have the ability to produce 3 million tons of refined fuel annually. We also produce the following derivatives: GLP, or normal liquid gas; naphtha; regular and premium gasoline; kerosene; diesel; and fuel oil. These are the derivatives. We also can produce elemental sulfur in our sulfur plant. [Betancur] I understand you have two oil pipelines. What are these for? [Garcia] At this plant we have two oil pipelines. One guarantees the stability of crude oil supplies from the Matanzas supertanker station. This is a 182 km-long pipeline. This pipeline links us to the port of Matanzas, a supertanker port, a port for deep-draft ships. We also receive crude oil at our docks. This is the oil we are using right now. [Betancur] But this does not get here through an oil pipeline, does it? This is brought here from the local docks. [Garcia] The other pipeline we have is for moving fuel oil to the Thermoelectric Central Plant next to our enterprise. [Betancur] The smaller pipeline is for taking refined products to the Cienfuegos Thermoelectric Central Plant? [Garcia] That is right. This pipeline was built to reduce fuel transportation costs from here to the Thermoelectric Central Plant. [Betancur] How much savings does this pipeline represents? [Garcia] More than $2 million annually because of the reduction in transportation costs and in the time ships spend unloading the product. It also contributes to protect the bay. We have a clean bay. This is possible because we have a very efficient plant for processing residuals. It keeps petroleum residuals at internationally acceptable levels. [end recording] I want to report that in addition to the oil pipeline and the plant for treating residuals, the Cienfuegos Oil Refinery hosts the country's largest chimney, which is 192 meters tall -- tall enough to keep gases expelled by the furnaces from polluting the environment.
