According to the bill, a minimum monthly pension benefit in Russia is fixed at 19 thousand roubles from May 1 and all other pension benefits will be increased 1.3 times. Inflation compensation of 19700 roubles will be paid in addition to pension benefits as before. The difference between maximum and minimum benefits will increase twofold (comparing to 1.85 times at present). The bill, which is also to be approved by the Federation Council, the upper chamber, will provide the adjustment of pensions to the price growth, taking into account the financial resourses of the pension fund. In spite of many critical remarks and proposals, the lawmakers decided to endorse the bill allowing the payment of new benefits to begin from May 1, but the work to improve the pension laws will continue. However, some proposals, including on the government's power to fully regulate pensions, were withdrawn from the bill.
