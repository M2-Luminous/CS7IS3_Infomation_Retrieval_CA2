When thanking Mr. Malek, who had become a little too talkative for their liking, President Liamine Zeroual, and through him the Army commanders, sent out a very clear message, namely, that it is they, and not the civilian leaders, who are responsible for managing the crisis. It is they, and not the "politicians," even if they are the actual government leaders, who will decide what attitude to adopt vis-a-vis Islamist groups. This change does not necessarily imply that an ideological turning point has been reached. The departure of Redha Malek is totally in keeping with the (khaki-colored) "cleansing" precedents at the top. His predecessor, Belaid Abdesalam, who was held in contempt by the French-speaking elite, which had described him as a "secular assimilationist," was not merely a victim of his political opinions. In the eyes of the military, his main failing was that he had not managed to succeed in regaining the confidence of leaders in Western capitals, whose financial support has become crucial for the country. Paradoxically, it is quite for the opposite reasons that Redha Malek, a career diplomat who prided himself on being on a particularly good footing with the United States, was cruelly forced to resign. His resignation came two days after Algiers had sent a "letter of intent" to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a prelude to the signature of an agreement opening up the way for new loans and the rescheduling of Algeria's foreign debt. In other words, Mr. Malek's mission had virtually been fulfilled. The military commanders, who were anxious that their "protege" should not become too important in the political arena, preferred to retire him early. On Sunday, the press was raising the prospect of an imminent ministerial reshuffle. Fueled by rumors, political circles had, for several days, already imagined that the prime minister might be on his way out. The last week's dispute opposing the former prime minister and the secretary general of the Assembly for Culture and Democracy (RCD), Said Sadi, was not enough to save Mr. Malek. Distancing himself, somewhat belatedly, from the modernist camp, he did not succeed in convincing the authorities of his neutrality and his loyalty to the army. The fact that he recently described the Islamist groups as "barbarians," "traitors," and "anti-nationalists" irreversibly classed him among the so-called "eradicators" who are hostile to a dialogue with the heirs of the former Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). By adopting this position, he could not but embarrass the military hierarchy, which is more determined than ever to save the appearances of unity and cohesion.
