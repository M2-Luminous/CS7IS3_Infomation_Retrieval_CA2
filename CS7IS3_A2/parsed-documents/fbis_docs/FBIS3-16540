Joining the RCDU group today are six people, mainly from the Yabloko faction. It also has members of Russia's Choice, however, in particular Gleb Yakunin and Vitaliy Savitskiy. According to Borshchev, the RCDU group is not trying in any manner to effect a split in the democratic forces of the Duma. On the contrary, it will be trying to bring closer together the positions of Yabloko, Russia's Choice, and the Union of 12 December in a bid to create a single reformist bloc. A platform for such an association, Borshchev thinks, could be the results of voting on the political amnesty issue. KURANTY has already reported that the amnesty was not supported by all three factions.
