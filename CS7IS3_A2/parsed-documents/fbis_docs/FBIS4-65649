On the contrary, as PDS Secretary Occhetto explained: "We were ready to be in the opposition, we expected Berlusconi to obtain a majority eventually, in the same way that he managed to obtain one when [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio was elected. However, a month after that vote was taken, the result is an unexpected confirmation of the opposition's resilience in the face of the intense maneuvering that has taken place. It was clearly apparent from Berlusconi's speech (you could tell from the tone he used) that he believed he had a safer majority in the bag. The situation, however, is rather different: The newly formed government is the expression of a slender majority, and it will not have an easy life." Occhetto had no doubt. As he got ready to put the finishing touches on his contribution to today's debate in the lower house, he confidently expounded a line of reasoning which was both a "What is to be done?" for the PDS and a polemic against those who had been tormenting him over the past few weeks: "This vote," he explained, "represents a twofold advantage for us. On the one hand, it sanctions the transition to a democracy based on alternation: We have witnessed the formation of both an executive which has the mandate to govern the country, and an opposition which has the duty to control the executive's performance. On the other hand, the vote confirms that the government has come into being in a situation of serious numerical, as well as political, weakness. The opposition can rely not only on the 60 percent of Italians who did not vote for the right-wing coalition, but also on a strong, solid base in parliament. This confirms that the Left's great and shattering defeat which is being spoken and written about is not, after all, so great and shattering. This much is apparent from the figures, and only the majority's rhetoric and self-flagellation which some people indulge in on the Left," Occhetto added with his numerous critics in mind, "can lead anybody to believe the contrary." The PDS leader was thus pleasantly surprised and doubtlessly satisfied at what he defined as "the Italian Popular Party's [PPI] resilience." He stressed that this was an important fact, "an encouraging factor for those who aim to open a new political stage in our country." The Knight [Berlusconi nickname] did not win over the center, and this "highlights the element of political weakness in the Right." "Clearly," Occhetto argued, "the Right is beset by serious political and programmatic contradictions. During the debate, Berlusconi unsuccessfully tried to overcome them by means of rhetorical and propagandist subterfuges, instead of providing politically convincing answers and clear indications about his platform. But probably there was little else he could do." However, Occhetto was very cautious when it came to suggesting any political indications from the PPI's confirmed intention not to join the Knight's bandwagon: "After this vote," he explained, "we will be able to do whatever can rightly be done with the PPI. Overall, the opposition's strength and solidity have been confirmed. However, it is important for us not to get jumbled together in a single melting pot -- which indeed the PPI is not prepared to do -- and to fully respect each party's identity and autonomy while developing a rigorous, serious, and purposeful opposition. This, of course, does not rule out the possibility of finding important areas of agreement with the center. In particular, I hope we can agree on institutional matters and on the equally decisive issue of safeguarding democratic guarantees." From Palazzo Madama [Senate], Cesare Salvi [progressives floor leader] and [PDS Senator] Claudio Petruccioli echoed the secretary's words: "The government only made it by one vote, the usual single vote," remarked Calvi. "But, despite the resources at its disposal, the majority will find it increasingly difficult to find such a vote every time a vote is taken in the Senate -- which basically means always..." Petruccioli also referred to "a second edition of Scognamiglio's election," but he added that "the government must become aware that it does not have a majority here, and that it cannot seriously contemplate continuing to resort to this kind of expedient in the future, as it has done once again on this occasion. Above all," the PDS senator concluded, "the government must renounce the arrogance of believing that it owns the assembly, which, as mater of fact, it does not, because it does not have a majority..."
