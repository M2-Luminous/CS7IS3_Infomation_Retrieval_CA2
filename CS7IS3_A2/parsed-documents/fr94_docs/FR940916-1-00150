FR940916-1-00150 FR940916-1-00016 (3) An inspection shall be made to determine that the brakes apply on each car before releasing them and proceeding. (b) A train movement exceeding 20 miles or that is not a transfer train as defined in §232.5 shall have a Class 1 brake test in accordance with §232.309 prior to movement. §232.319 Running test. When motive power or engine crew has been changed, a running test on each locomotive in the train equipped with dynamic brakes shall be made, to determine the condition of the dynamic brake, as soon as the speed of the locomotive or train permits. §232.321 Freight single car test and periodic freight brake test. (a) A freight single car test or periodic freight brake test, as defined in §232.5, shall be conducted on each car with conventional air brakes as required in subpart G of this part. (b) A railroad introducing new train brake system technology shall follow the procedures given in Subpart J of this part to develop a freight single car and periodic freight brake test for the new technology equivalent to the ``freight single car test'' or ``periodic freight brake test'' defined in §232.5. The periodic freight brake test and freight single car test shall: (1) Provide air brake testing equivalent to the tests defined in this section and §232.5; (2) Provide tests of any new train brake system technology used that is not covered in §232.15; (3) Ensure the car or train set brake system is 100 percent effective and is functioning as designed; and (4) Incorporate train brake system performance standards developed under the guidance of §232.901 where applicable. §232.323 Train brake system tests conducted using yard air. (a) After January 1, 1996, all equipment used to produce yard air shall be equipped with an operative air dryer capable of producing a 30-degree F dew-point depression at a flow rate of 100 cfm. (b) When a train air brake system is tested from a yard test plant, an engineer's brake valve or a suitable test device must be used to provide any increase or reduction of brake pipe air pressure at the same, or slower, rate as an engineer's brake valve, and the yard test plant must be connected to the end of the train or cut of cars that will be nearest to the hauling road locomotive. (c) When a yard test plant is used, the train air brake system must be charged and tested as prescribed by §232.309(a) and when practicable should be kept charged until road motive power is coupled to train, after which, an automatic brake application and release test of air brakes on the rear car shall be made. (1) If the cars are disconnected from a supply of compressed air for more than four hours, before these cars may be added to a train, they shall be retested in accordance with §232.309(a). (2) Yard test plant air pressure must be 90 psi. (d) Yard test devices and gauges shall be calibrated annually. Gauges or other devices providing air-pressure control shall be accurate to within # 3 psi. (e) If used to test a train, a yard air test device and any yard air test equipment shall be accurate and function as intended. Subpart E_Inspection and Test Standards for Conventional Passenger, Commuter, and Excursion Train Brakes Systems §232.401 Test and inspection standards for conventional passenger locomotives. The inspection and test standards for brake systems of standard passenger locomotives are identical to the standards for conventional freight locomotives stated in §232.303. §232.403 Written procedures for conventional passenger, commuter, and excursion train brake system tests. A railroad shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request written test procedures for correctly performing all train brake system tests for conventional passenger, commuter, and excursion trains operated by that railroad. At a minimum, these procedures shall include: (a) Instructions for performing the tasks stated in §§232.407, 232.421 and 232.425, when applicable, regarding Class 1 brake system tests. (b) Instructions for performing the tasks stated in §232.413 regarding Class 2 brake system tests. (c) Instructions for performing the tasks stated in §232.415 regarding running tests. (d) The steps outlined in §232.905(d)(1)(i) for equipment that includes new brake system technology. (e) The procedures for maintaining records of brake system tests aboard the trains. §232.405 General requirements of Class 1 train brake system tests for conventional passenger trains. (a) Conventional passenger train Class 1 brake system tests shall be performed only by qualified brake system inspectors meeting the requirements contained in §232.207 or §232.209. (b) A Class 1 brake system test shall be performed on conventional passenger trains prior to departing any initial terminal point as defined in §232.5. §232.407 Required tasks of Class 1 train brake system tests for conventional passenger trains. (a) The following tasks and procedures shall be required as part of the Class 1 brake system test of a conventional passenger train: (1) Brake pipe leakage shall not exceed 5 psi per minute. The brake pipe leakage test shall be conducted as follows: (i) Charge the air brake system to within 15 psi of the setting of the feed or regulating valve on the locomotive, but to not less than 85-psi at the rear end of train; (ii) Upon receiving the signal to apply brakes for test, make a 20-psi brake pipe service reduction; (iii) With the brake valve lapped and the pressure maintaining feature cut out (if so equipped) and after waiting 45&hyph;60 seconds, note the brake pipe leakage as indicated by the brake pipe gauge in the locomotive. (2) The inspector shall position himself/herself, taking positions on each side of the car if necessary, so as to be able to examine and observe the functioning of all moving parts of the brake system.
