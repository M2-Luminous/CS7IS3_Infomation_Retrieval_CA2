These were the words of Chief of Police Vincenzo Parisi, speaking during a news conference given by Interior Minister Roberto Maroni. "The largest grouping," he stressed, "comes from the fringes of the extreme left, particularly from the autonomous workers as well as other organizations. These groupings have 12,114 members (included in census returns) who are spread throughout 570 offices. The extreme right wing has a few hundred members, divided into three main branches, some of whom are quarrelsome and violent."
