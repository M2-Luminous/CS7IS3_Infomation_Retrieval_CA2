Mulino said: "Gelbard's statements are not specific and shed no light on the faults committed by Panamanian authorities." The foreign minister said that "the administration's report does not give names and places where the illegalities occur." Mulino said: "The case to which the document alluded was the raid on the Gil Cafe Company, but added there was no sustaining evidence in the fact." [sentence as published] For his part, Supreme Court Magistrate Jose Manuel Faundes cited "the strange U.S. attitude of discrediting Panama's image before the concert of nations." Faundes stressed the national authorities' cooperation against drug trafficking, a situation that can be brought up in the face of any accusation on the part of the United States." [no opening quotation mark as published] The magistrate said: "Panamanian international financial centers have controlled money laundering, something to which U.S. banks can attest." A U.S. delegation is visiting the country and being escorted by Olegario Barrelier, president of the National Banking Association (ABN). This visit will last until 11 April, according to Barrelier's agenda.
