The session discussed problems related to the situation in the Abkhaz Svanetiya and in the Zugdidi region (western Georgia), as well as the convocation and holding in the near future of a congress of Abkhazia's Georgian population forced to leave the zone of conflict (the congress, in the opinion of its organizers, is to proceed under the aegis of Liberation of Abkhazia, an organization that has been operating in Tbilisi for several months now). The session stressed the need to take prompt action for the Georgian side to retain control of the high mountain villages in the Kodor Canyon that have come under massed artillery bombardment by the Abkhaz side. The session criticized the activity of the Georgian leadership and the government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia (the reference is to the Georgian administration of Abkhazia, temporarily based in Tbilisi). It was suggested that the government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia work not in Tbilisi but in Zugdidi, closer to the temporary location of tens of thousands of refugees from Abkhazia. The session also heard demands for the resignation of the incumbent government of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic based in Tbilisi. Boris Kakubava, Liberation of Abkhazia chairman, noted that in the view of the organization's council and deputies of the Georgian parliament elected from Abkhazia, Georgia's current Vice Prime Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili should combine the post of Georgian vice premier with the duties of chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic, which, in the opinion of the session participants, will facilitate coordination of actions aimed to bring Abkhazia back under Georgia's jurisdiction and ensure the return of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
