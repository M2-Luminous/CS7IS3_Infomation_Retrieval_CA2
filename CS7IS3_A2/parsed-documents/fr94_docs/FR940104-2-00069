FR940104-2-00069 FR940104-2-00046 [Release No. 34&hyph;33391; File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;91&hyph;11] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Method for Execution of Cross Transactions December 28, 1993. I. Introduction On August 26, 1991, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change relating to the method for the execution of cross transactions on the PSE. On June 7, 1993, the PSE submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify certain terms used in the original filing. 3 On August 18, 1993, the PSE submitted Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify its interpretation of certain provisions regarding specialist participation in cross transactions. 4 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from Kenneth, J. Marcus, Director, Equity Surveillance/Compliance, PSE, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated June 3, 1993 (``Amendment No. 1''). 4 See letter from Kenneth J. Marcus, Director, Equity Surveillance/Compliance, PSE, to Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated August 9, 1993 (``Amendment No. 2''). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29712 (September 20, 1991), 56 FR 49217 (September 27, 1991). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change, including both amendments on an accelerated basis. II. Description of the Proposal Exchange Rule 5.14(b) outlines the traditional method for the execution of cross transactions on the PSE. 5 Under that rule, a member effecting a cross transaction must first assure that all existing bids or offers by the specialists, in the books or at the posts, at or better than the cross price, are filled at their limits. 6 Thereafter the member must publicly announce both sides of the cross; the member's offer must be higher than his or her bid by the minimum trading differential permitted for that security. 7 Rule 5.14(b) then allows the member to execute the cross transaction at his or her bid or offer. Under this method, however, another member can ``break up'' the cross by trading with either the bid or the offer side of the transaction when it is presented to the crowd. 5 In a cross transaction, a member who holds an order to buy and an order to sell an equivalent amount of the same security wishes to execute the orders against each other. See PSE Rule 5.14(a). Because he or she already holds both sides of the trade, the member does not want the orders to interact with other market interest. 6 As a general matter, the bid/offer entered at the best price ( i.e., the highest bid or the lowest offer) is entitled to priority over bids/offers at inferior prices; similarly, the first bid/offer clearly established at a given price is entitled to priority over other bids/offers at that same price. See PSE Rule 5.8(c). 7 PSE Rule 5.3(b) sets forth the minimum trading differential for securities listed on the PSE. The Exchange proposes to formalize several policies that its Equity Floor Trading Committee previously developed to encourage the execution of cross transactions on the PSE. Specifically, the proposed commentary to Rule 5.14(b) will codify the PSE's policy that all efforts should be made to facilitate the execution of crosses; and will clarify which orders a member must satisfy before he or she can execute such a transaction. 8 The proposed commentary also will interpret Rule 5.14(b), together with the PSE's priority rule, 9 to prohibit the specialist from participating in a cross to establish or increase his or her position, 10 unless the member effecting the transactions gives the specialist permission to do so. 8 Among other things, see supra note 6 and accompanying text, a member effecting a cross first must satisfy the interest the specialist ``publicly displayed and verbally stated'' at the time of the cross. 9 See PSE Rule 5.8(e). Under this rule, an order originated on the floor to establish or increase a proprietary position must yield to any order originated off the floor. 10 According to the PSE, this policy initially was established on May 2, 1984. In conjunction with this filing, the Exchange has clarified that the specialist will be able to participate in a cross transaction in order to decrease his or her position. See Amendment No. 1, supra, note 3. Under those circumstances, the specialist's participation will be subject to the additional restrictions discussed below. See infra, notes 11&hyph;13 and accompanying text.
