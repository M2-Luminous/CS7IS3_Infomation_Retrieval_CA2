One should use every opportunity to create a permanent work tone in our cooperation, said today in Tbilisi the President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan. At a press-conference following immediately their private meeting with Eduard Shevardnadze, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who came here with a single-day visit, observed that practically all problems of mutual interest were concerned during the visit. Much attention has been given in particular to the regional problems, to situation in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh. "Together with Eduard Shevardnadze we came to a conclusion that there is no alternative to the peaceful settlement of such conflicts, declared Ter-Petrosyan. He also noted that it is highly undesirable if the Armenians living here would be involved in the ethnical conflict in Georgia. Answering the SNARK's question, what is the position of Armenian President to the idea of a Caucasian 3+1 [Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia plus Russia] dialogue, proposed earlier by the Georgian head, Ter-Petrosyan told: "We have confirmed our intention to organize the meetings at high-level between Armenia, Turkey [as received] and Azerbaijan in presence of Russia. They must become traditional".
