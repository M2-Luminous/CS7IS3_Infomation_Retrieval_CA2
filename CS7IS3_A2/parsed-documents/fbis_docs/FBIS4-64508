The EU will not produce any differences for agriculture. The structural rationalization of agriculture will continue, regardless of Finland's relationship to the EU. "It is difficult to say how rapidly changes will take place if we were to remain outside the EU, but I do not think that the difference would amount to much," Prime Minister Esko Aho said. The Center Party leader, who will soon reach age 40, said that it is difficult to say how many farms will remain in Finland in the event of EU membership. For we do not know what will happen to national agricultural policy in the future. "But I remember very well what has happened since 1970. Then we had around 200,000 milk producers. Today we have perhaps 40,000. We have in other words had drastic structural changes, and I believe that this will continue if Finland joins the EU," Aho said in an interview with a group of Norwegian journalists on the third anniversary of assuming the office of prime minister. The date of the Finnish referendum on the EU has yet to be fixed. Most people are thinking along the lines of 2 October, even though the prime minister says that he has not receive any negative responses to his question of why Finland should not hold its referendum on the same day as Sweden -- 13 November. "We have our practical reasons to think about the same date as Sweden," the prime minister said, without providing any more detailed explanation. The government in Helsinki will reach a decision on the date for a referendum once the European Parliament has dealt with the membership agreements on 4 May and once the national support package for the foodstuffs industry and sections of agriculture are complete. This support package is to complement the EU agreement on points where Finland did not achieve the goals laid down when the Eduskunta approved Finland's membership application. If the support package is satisfactory, the prime minister also feels sure that this will be a majority in favor of the EU at the Center Party's national congress in June. Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein, Norway's "no" queen, is also expected, among the almost 3,000 delegates and 2,000 guests. Could Finland be the only Nordic country to join the EU? "In principle that is not impossible, but in practice it would be another matter if only one or two countries out of the four ratify the agreements. I am also looking at this from the EU's point of view. There is only one alternative when it comes to the date for becoming a member. So everyone who wants to join must ratify the agreement before them." Prime Minister Aho made it clear that Finland will naturally take into consideration the decisions its Nordic neighbors reach, "even though it is in principle our own decision." A Swedish no to the EU would create a new situation, he admitted. Nevertheless, he declined to speculate about how his government would handle such a situation. "Our assumption is that all four countries will accept the agreements," he stressed. If only Norway says no to membership, will there then be problems for the other three countries that want to become EU members? "Much will depend on Sweden, for Sweden will be the biggest net contributor to the EU. Sweden's role is therefore more important than those of Finland or Norway," said Aho, who also believes that the so-called Zhirinovskiy effect means much less than many people believe for the Finns' desire for EU membership. In the past the Finnish Center Party's leading bodies have given positive assessments of the EU agreement even though, according to the opinion polls, the majority of the party's voters are in the no camp. When Prime Minister Aho last weekend left a party meeting to celebrate his mother's 70th birthday, Paavo Vayrynen, his former foreign minister, took the floor and succeeded in a maneuver to bring in some new and more critical assessments. "There is no suggestion of substantial change of view of any significance. I would also have approved this assessment of his," Aho said, trying to smooth over the internal conflict in the Center Party. What is most important among your political priorities -- getting Finland into the EU or winning the election in March next year? "If we do not succeed in dealing with our economic problems, we cannot even take on the challenge EU membership would represent. If I can deal successfully with these two things -- improving the economy and Finns' living conditions, and EU membership -- I would probably also do quite well in the next Eduskunta elections. I have no reason to prepare myself for an election defeat," the prime minister said, well aware that the opinion polls are now giving the Center Party only 19 percent of votes -- as against 24.8 percent in the elections three years ago. But behind him he has fresh economic figures which show that unemployment, currently at over 20 percent, is beginning to fall.
