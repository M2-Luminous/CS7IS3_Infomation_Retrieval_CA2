During a news conference in Santo Domingo, Pena Gomez said the maneuver consists of satisfying the demands of the opposition parties by giving them a forged voter list with 200,000 less voters, which obviously does not correspond to the electoral list that was used on election day, 16 May. "What needs to be done is for the JCE to deliver photocopies of the lists used at each of the tables on 16 May," according to Pena Gomez and fellow party member Tirso Mejia Ricart, elections director of the PRD. These lists can easily be distinguished because they are sealed with a mark that states: "voted," according to the PRD leaders. Likewise, Pena Gomez said that as part of his party's international campaign to denounce the electoral fraud, his candidate for vice president, Fernando Alvarez Bogaert, will attend the Latin American Foreign Ministers Conference in Belem, Brazil, to explain the situation. "The damage caused to continental democracy with the shameful events that took place during the Dominican election process is serious as can be proven by the international observers who attended the elections, including the Christian Democrats," Pena Gomez said. While the JCE estimates indicate that President Joaquin Balaguer, from the Reformist Social Democratic Party (PRSC), won the elections with a 1-percent advantage (30,000 votes) over Pena Gomez, his followers maintain that fraud took place to ensure the reelection of Balaguer, twice president and seven times a candidate. Pena Gomez added that he had received a letter from Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres informing him that the four Central American presidents and their respective foreign ministers had agreed to endorse Alvarez Bogaert's participation in the conference at Belen, Brazil. The other presidents are Carlos Roberto Reina of Honduras, Ramiro de Leon Carpio of Guatemala, and Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua. If Dominican Republic Foreign Minister Aristides Taveras Guzman objects to Alvarez Bogaert's participation to report the alleged fraud, the Costa Rican foreign minister will present him as a member of his delegation, Pena Gomez reported. In this respect, the PRD candidate recalled a previous case when during Anastasio Somoza's dictatorship in Nicaragua, Father Miguel D'Escoto participated in a conference as a member of the Costa Rican delegation. Finally, Pena Gomez announced that leaders of his party will be sent on other missions. One mission will go to Jamaica to request the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) to not recognize the possible proclamation of Balaguer as the newly elected president of the Dominican Republic. Another PRD delegation will go to the EU to report "the scandalous fraud committed against the democratic rights of the Dominican people," he concluded. Analysts agree that the post-electoral Dominican panorama continues to "be tangled and complicated."
