The fall of the socialist bloc and the disintegration of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact have enabled the United States and its allies to act with impunity against their real adversaries and those who have never been their adversaries but whom they "do not like." In order to do that, they have widely used international organizations, particularly the UN Security Council. Within the framework of that organization they are trying to materialize their doctrines and strategies. There are no better means, as actions are sanctified by making them legal. We must listen to silly arguments, such as the interpretation given to "preventive diplomacy," a term they find attractive (and which sometimes is a real "excuse") to prevent a conflict the CIA previewed or simply to prevent one from worsening. This can result in the use of force, especially by those who are stronger. Washington's "preventive diplomacy" is not new. It has its roots in gunboat policy, in U.S. multiple military interventions throughout the world, especially in Latin America. In Cuba we were victims of that diplomacy on many occasions. In 1898 they had to intervene to prevent "chaos and anarchy," after which they imposed the Platt Amendment on us, which enabled them to continue to intervene. Under the excuse of preventing worse evils, they also intervened in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama, etc. For many years, through our ancestors, we learned of the peoples' struggle for sovereignty, for which men gave their lives in many countries. For any dignified man, defending his country's sovereignty was reason enough to make any sacrifice, even offering their lives. With regard to our country, Lieutenant General Antonio Maceo said that "whomever tries to take over Cuba" will pick up its soil covered by blood, if he does not die in the attempt." That was the concept of sovereignty for the Titan of bronze: it was a matter of pride. We could make an endless list of men who have maintained similar positions with regard to the sovereignty of their native land and others who as internationalists have fallen under other skies defending the sovereignty of other countries. During the 48th period of sessions of the UN General Assembly in 1993, however, a document was approved which states that absolute and exclusive sovereignty is no longer valid and that it has never had any legal basis. Following that logic, the UN Security Council can decide to intervene in any country under the pretext of maintaining peace, or simply to restore it, as the case may be. Actions can also be preventive, in other words to prevent a problem: covering the pimple with a bandage before it bursts. Although the road to hell is paved with good intentions, there could be good intentions behind this, depending on how we look at it. Applying "preventive diplomacy" could mean that the UN Security Council could demand that the United States unconditionally lift its blockade on Cuba to normalize the situation in the Caribbean and put an end to the policy of hostility toward Havana. That however, would be asking for the impossible. Although the document is not of a compulsory nature, its application is considered legitimate. Also making an appearance was the so-called "humanitarian intervention," the one that links four bags of beans to thousands of tons of bombs, and while a person is eating, thousands others are dying. With this trend, phrases such as "humanitarian bombings," "humanitarian artillery preparation," humanitarian surgical strikes," and "humanitarian raids" [previous word in English], among others, will soon make an appearance as well. For example: It is a fact that worldwide strategic changes have forced the U.S. Department of Defense to cut its budget, and this is why a quantitative reduction of the armed forces has been proposed, but it is also true that the United States will not renounce its international leadership, which allows it to stick its nose wherever and whenever it pleases. This is why quantitative reductions should not affect these at all. The new strategy establishes four basic points: strategic dissuasion, advanced presence, reaction to crisis, and reorganization. -- Strategic dissuasion: They maintain their defensive and offensive strategic forces at levels above those of current international reality. Moreover, they continue to prepare and train the use of force despite changes that have taken place in the world and agreements signed on this matter. -- Advanced Presence: In areas near Cuba, to mention only that which affects us most, they maintain about 10 vessels of all kinds and a similar number of planes day after day under the pretext of fighting against drug trafficking. As part of their blockade against Haiti, the Navy and the Coast Guard maintain no fewer than 10 vessels and several planes only a few km off our coastline. They are joined by naval and aerial units currently participating in the Fleetex Exercises off the U.S. eastern coast and in the Caribbean, involving thousands of soldiers, and with this, and Agile Provider '94, they will keep us under the tension created by the "villains" throughout April and May, and "God knows" what they are up to. -- Reaction to Crisis: 79 percent of their ground forces are kept in their territory and they are ready as the "firefighters" of McNamara, and given that there is no longer an enemy in Europe, it seems that the Pact of Varsovia died...? Who is this package of forces in the West aimed at? -- Reorganization: It is very easy to announce cuts and maintain 89 divisions, 4,600 tactical fighters, and an industrial plant [potential] that allows it to start producing at full force in a relatively short period of time. For example: In little more than 60 months, between July 1940 and August 1945, they produced 86,000 tanks, 120,000 pieces of artillery, 1,200 combat vessels, 82,000 landing craft, 96,000 bombers, 88,000 fighters, 23,000 transportation planes, among others. All basic elements of the U.S. military strategy are intrinsically linked to a number of principles that foresee the maintenance of a number of units with high-combat readiness, represented by the contingency forces, which allow them on the basis of technological superiority, to maintain the principle of "decisive force," which means accumulating as much force as needed to crush the adversary in a short time, even if this involves killing a goat with a B-52 bomber loaded with 27 tons of bombs. Thus, as others in the world are truly disarming, the "supermen" maintain the principle of force and are ready to fight, are trying to avoid substantial cuts to not affect the quality of personnel training and the superior technology of their armament and equipment, and their industrial potential is also ready. They will not get rid of this regardless of the cost involved. These figures, in the end, reflect no real cuts. They rationalized intermediary, noncombative positions, closed obsolete bases, and cut certain costs that had always been superfluous and unnecessary, but these measures are not commensurate with the true dismantling being carried out by the alleged enemies they maintained throughout the "Cold War," whose end is only theoretical. In sum, "preventive diplomacy" needs these forces.
