Developed in collaboration with the Micro-Vett company of Imola, Electric Porter has been presented in the four or six-seater minibus version, a transport van with a 500-kg load capacity, and a pick-up garbage truck with a 400-kg load capacity. All the versions have a compact and silent M100 electric engine developed by Mico-Vett, which has a 10 kw capacity practically without any need for maintenance. The management of the engine unit is handled by a high frequency electronic control unit that is highly reliable and silent and that permits the vehicle to provide a more than appreciable performance in urban traffic. In order to maximize its acceleration and range the maximum speed has been contained at 55 km per hour. In addition to the normal braking system, Porter Elettrico has an electric braking system which, in addition to slowing down the vehicle, transforms part of the kinetic energy that develops when braking into electric energy that goes to automatically recharge the batteries. Particular emphasis has been placed on the range of the vehicle. It is exempt from car ownership tax and its insurance rate has been reduced by 50 percent, therefore it costs only 50 lire per kilometer. The on-the-road selling price for the minibus version of Electric Porter is 35,280,000 lire. Sales will begin in January from Piaggio's sales network.
