Gaviria, in a letter sent to the State Council, which has asked him for explanations, has said the presence of U.S. military personnel on the Pacific Coast and in the eastern plains is in accordance with international treaties that have been formally accepted by Colombia in the past. In a long document, Gaviria rehashes the legal evolution of the international law and the Colombian legislation, saying the operations of mutual defense and military assistance do not require authorization from the Senate or State Council. Gaviria refers to the work by the U.S. soldiers at the beach town of Juanchaco (Valle Del Cauca Department), where they are building a school, a medical center, and a road, and in Puerto Lopez (Meta Department), where they are building a river port. "The U.S. soldiers are not in the country to execute warlike activities against third parties," but their presence is in accordance with agreements for technical cooperation to supply logistic support so that the Colombian authorities may fight crime, he adds.
