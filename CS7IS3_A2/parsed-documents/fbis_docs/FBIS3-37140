Meshkov Met With Admiral E. Baltin"] [Text] Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Crimean Republic, on 7 February met with Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, in Sevastopol at the Black Sea Fleet Headquarters. Yu. Meshkov pointed out that the Black Sea Fleet "has been and continues to be a guarantor of stability on the peninsula." In his opinion, the problem of the Black Sea Fleet must be resolved in the interests of all CIS members, taking into account the expression of will of the peoples residing in the Crimea and of its supreme legislative and executive bodies. "The question of the fleet, Sevastopol, and the Crimea is a triune problem of the relations between Russia and Ukraine," stressed Meshkov. Admiral E. Baltin, in turn, expressed the hope that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet would be resolved as soon as possible. He is convinced that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet will be resolved "with an account of the opinions of the Black Sea sailors and residents of Sevastopol."
