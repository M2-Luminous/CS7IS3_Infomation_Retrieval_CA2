FR940912-2-00002 FR940912-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Forest Service Environmental Impact Statement, Port Houghton/Cape Fanshaw Timber Sale(s), Tongass National Forest, Stikine and Chatham Areas, Petersburg and Sitka, AK AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The Stikine and Chatham Areas of the USDA Forest Service propose to harvest 123 million board feet (MMBF) of timber volume (net sawlog) from the Port Houghton/Cape Fanshaw area of the Tongass National Forest, and to construct 84.2 miles of road and one log transfer facility (LTF). The timber would be harvested from 94 units covering 5,860 acres. The harvest units were selected from a unit pool of 186 units containing a total of 225 MMBF of timber volume (net sawlog) over 10,904 acres. The roads associated with the proposed action were selected from a road pool of 174 miles for the entire project area. The proposed action would offer timber in one or more sales. (A map of the unit pool, the proposed action, and roads is available from the address provided.) The project area includes Value Comparison Units (VCUs) 79 through 89 on the Mainland in southeast Alaska, encompassing approximately 193,000 acres. VCUs 80&hyph;89 have been allocated by the Tongass Land Management Plan to Land Use Designation (LUD) IV, emphasizing primarily commodity or market resources. VCU 79 has been allocated to LUD III, emphasizing a variety of uses, both commodity and amenity, to provide the greatest combination of benefits. The purpose of this project is to provide 110 to 125 MMBF of timber for harvest according to direction described in the Tongass Land Management Plan, to meet the Federal obligation to make timber volume available for harvest by timber operators, and to improve the timber productivity of the project area by harvesting mature stands of timber and replacing them with faster growing stands of second-growth timber. The decision to be made is whether to make timber available for harvest and improve timber productivity in the Port Houghton/Cape Fanshaw Project area while also providing a combination of recreation, fish, water, and wildlife for the resource uses of society now and into the future. This decision will be made by Abigail R. Kimbell, Forest Supervisor of the Stikine Area. If timber is made available for harvest, the Forest Supervisor will also decide (a) the volume of timber to make available, (b) the location and design of the timber harvest units and log transfer facilities, (c) the location and design of associated mainline and local road corridors, and (d) appropriate mitigation measures for all alternatives in the project area. EFFECTIVE DATE: Public scoping will begin in September 1994 and will continue over the life of the analysis. The Draft EIS is scheduled for publication in June 1995 and the Final EIS in January 1996. Written comments concerning this proposed action should be received within 30 days of the date of publication of this Notice in the Federal Register , estimated to be September 16th. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The Port Houghton/Cape Fanshaw analysis is being conducted by Parametrix, Inc. under contract to the Stikine and Chatham Areas of the Tongass National Forest. Questions and written comments and suggestions concerning the analysis should be sent to Pamela Gunther, Team Leader, Parametrix Inc., 5808 Lake Washington Blvd N.E., Kirkland, WA 98033, phone (206) 822&hyph;8880, fax (206) 889&hyph;8808. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A public scoping letter will be sent to all persons indicating an interest in the project by responding to the Stikine Area Project Schedule or Chatham Area Schedule of Proposed Actions, or who otherwise notify the Stikine or Chatham Areas that they are interested in the Port Houghton/Cape Fanshaw Timber Harvest project. Public scoping meetings will be scheduled during the last week in September in the communities of Wrangell, Kake, Petersburg, Juneau, and Hobart Bay. The EIS will evaluate a number of timber harvest alternatives ranging from a no-action alternative to harvesting 110 to 125 MMBF of timber. Action-alternatives are likely to vary according to volume of timber (110&hyph;125 MMBF), the amount and location of roads, the number and location of log transfer facilities, the number and location of harvest units, and the silvicultural methods applied to each unit. Each action alternative will be designed by selecting units and roads from the unit pool and road pool, and each alternative will fulfill the purpose and need for the project and will respond to at least one of the significant issues. Preliminary issues include: 1. Soils: Portions of the project area are mapped as rough mountainous land characterized by steep rocky slopes, icefields, and glaciers. High soil hazard classes also occur in the project area. How will the alternatives be designed to protect the area from landslides? What effect would each alternative have on the soil resources? 2. Fisheries/Watershed: Harvest operations could affect water quality, sedimentation, and fish passage. Mass-wasting of sediments from cut-and-fill slopes can deliver sediment to streams. Harvest adjacent to streams without fish may increase water temperature in waters what would ultimately drain to Class I and Class II streams. How will fish streams be protected from direct and indirect impacts caused by harvesting timber and building roads? What effect would each alternative have on fisheries and watershed? 3. Wildlife: Several goshawks and their nests have been located in the project area. Mountain goats inhabit the rocky mountain terrain. Marbled murrelets are well distributed in the project area and use the Sandborn Canal and Port Houghton Salt Chuck for foraging. How will these and other wildlife be protected? How will travel corridors among high-intensity use areas be preserved? What effect will each alternative have on wildlife? 4. Subsistence: A preliminary review of subsistence use in the Port Houghton/Cape Fanshaw project area has identified eight subsistence resources (deer, harbor seals, salmon, fin fish, waterfowl, marine invertebrates, mountain goat, and mammal trapping) by three different communities (Petersburg, Wrangell, and Kake). How will these resources be protected either from loss of the resource or overuse due to increased accessibility that may occur from road construction? To what extend will each alternative affect subsistence resources and use within the project area? 5. Recreation: Recreation sites at the project area occur as natural, unmodified environments with little evidence of human activity. Most of these sites occur along shoreline areas and include boating, camping, hunting, and fishing. What affect would the change from primitive to semi-primitive roaded recreational opportunity have on existing and future uses? How will the alternatives address future recreational uses while preserving the type of opportunities used historically? 6. Cultural Resources: A total of 47 cultural sites have been documented at the Port Houghton project area through field investigations conducted this summer. One site consists of well preserved artifacts that date as early as 10,000 years old. How will these resources be protected from timber harvest, road construction, and potential vandalism? What effect would each alternative have on the cultural resources in the project area? 7. Visual Resources: Timber management activities will alter the appearance and perceived visual quality of the project area and vicinity. What type of mitigation measures will be developed to reduce impacts to the visual quality of the area? What effect will the alternatives have on the visual quality?
