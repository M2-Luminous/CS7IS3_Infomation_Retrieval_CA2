The 15 June civil defense exercise will consist of the sounding of the air-raid siren, the residents taking refuge into shelters, control of motor vehicles, emergency rehabilitation work in preparation for the power outage and cut-off of water-supply, and the exercise in preparation for chemical, biological, and radiological warfare. The Home Ministry has also decided to check all the facilities in preparation for war, such as some 223,000 shelters and some 59,000 emergency water-supply facilities across the country. This is the first time that all the war-time shelter facilities will be checked across the country. The Home Ministry has also decided to distribute pamphlets through neighborhood meetings on 25 June guiding the people as to how they should act in a time of war, including a nuclear war. The government has also decided to conduct the Chungmu Exercise, a regional general crisis management exercise, in Seoul and its vicinity for six days beginning 22 August. Eight government ministries, including the Home Ministry, will participate in this exercise to be conducted by the State Contingency Planning Committee to check the ability to cope with disasters, such as power outages, cut-off of water-supply, and food shortages.
