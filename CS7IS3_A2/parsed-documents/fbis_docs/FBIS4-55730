We had a very fruitful discussion with President Kiro Gligorov and Defense Minister Vlado Popovski. We wished to hear their opinions, which will also help the United Nations determine future moves -- especially as regards the stability of borders and the improvement of economic and political stability, Akashi said. I discovered, unfortunately, that Macedonia was in an unenviable economic situation due to its strict adherence to the economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, and because of the embargo imposed by Greece against Macedonia. I will convey President Gligorov's message to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. President Gligorov has suggested that the Greek-Macedonian dispute be examined by the UN Security Council. Akashi particularly stressed that the talks provided an opportunity for a thorough analysis of the situation along Macedonia's borders -- especially the sections monitored by UNPROFOR. Akashi also met UNPROFOR representatives in Macedonia in the course of his one-day visit.
