Other issues discussed in the meeting with the "head of government" of the church state were the enlargement of the European Union, and the role of United Nations in international hotspots, Vatican Spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said. Bilateral issues, such as the relationship between the church and state in the FRG were also broached. Kohl, who is due to return to Bonn on Tuesday night, asked Sodano to convey to Pope John Paul II his best wishes for recovery on behalf of the Federal Government. Originally, the chancellor was scheduled to meet the pope, but the private audience had to be canceled due to the church leader's hip operation on Friday. Upon his arrival in Rome on Monday night, Kohl paid tribute to John Paul's role in the reshaping of Europe. The pope made "an essential contribution to overcoming totalitarianism and the division of Germany and Europe," Kohl said at a reception in the German Embassy in the Vatican.
