We do not want to sacrifice our town for a war that will never occur." Seiho Kina (age 68) of Motobu, Okinawa, sighed in front of the construction site of a Maritime Self-Defense Force [MSDF] communications facility for "P-3C" antisubmarine patrol planes. The Motobu communications facility is planned as a hookup station between P-3C's in operation and the antisubmarine warfare operation center (ASWOC) on the MSDF base in Naha. The Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau [DFAB] has already secured 96 percent of the construction site. ASWOC's have been built in Hachinohe, Atsugi, Iwakuni, and Kaya; however, the last one in Okinawa is facing strong resistance from local citizens. Kina is the leader of the Motobu residents who oppose the communication facility. About 10 local people stay in a watch-house every day so as not to allow DFAB officials access to the construction site. Nevertheless, a high-ranking MSDF officer stressed that construction plans for the Motobu communications facility will not be dropped, saying: "Okinawa's ASWOC cannot perform even half of its functions if the Motobu communications facility is not available." He added that antisubmarine warfare (ASW) by P-3C's is the lifeline of the MSDF. The MSDF is planning to procure 100 P-3C's (it currently has 94). When the MSDF obtains its goal, Japan will have the world's second-largest lineup of P-3C's after the United States; this will be even larger than the total of all NATO member nations, except the United States. As a matter of fact, the heavily equipped lineup is intended for coping with the military power of the former Soviet Union. Explaining the lineup of 100 planes, a senior member of the MSDF Staff Office said: "We need 20 P-3C's to patrol deep seas, 60 for coastal sea areas, and 20 for sea lanes. The lineup of 100 planes is the minimum strength for covering all patrol areas once a day." The main concepts of Japan's sea lane defense are to secure the nation's maritime traffic and protect U.S. fleets from (former) Soviet submarines in southwestern and southeastern sea lanes in case of emergency. In connection with the second concept, the above-mentioned MSDF officer noted: "If we cannot have Okinawa's ASWOC, we cannot cover the southern sea lanes, and this will ruin Japan's entire ASW network." However, Russian naval forces have become less active since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Some believe submarines of the Russian Pacific Fleet, including nuclear-powered submarines equipped with ballistic missiles, have already been reduced to around 40, or 50 percent less than the lineup in the Soviet era. The MSDF Staff Office member said "we still have to exercise precaution," but acknowledged the changes in Russia's posture, saying: "We probably need other reasons to justify the lineup of 100 P-3C's." Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's advisory "Defense Issues Council" held its fourth meeting on 30 March. At the meeting, members noted "excessive equipment has been observed" in the Air Self-Defense Force [ASDF] and the MSDF. They said heavily equipped ASW by P-3C is included among the questionable fields. The council is currently reviewing the National Defense Program Outline of 1976, focusing on reducing Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF] troops. The "threats" surrounding Japan have been downgraded to "uncertainties," and the ASDF and MSDF are also expected to be involved in discussions regarding Japan's arms reduction. At the 30 March meeting, the Defense Issues Council referred to ASDF and MSDF arms reduction for the first time. In Motobu, the Naha DFAB will shortly begin construction of the communications facility. Kina looked up from the watch-house at a P-3C and said: "I will stop the construction work at the risk of my life."
