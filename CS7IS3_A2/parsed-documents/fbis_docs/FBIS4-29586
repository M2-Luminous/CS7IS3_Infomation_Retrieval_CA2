"Such remarks may create misunderstanding in the international community," Kono told the party's prefectural chapter meeting in Miyazaki, southern Japan. Hata told reporters Friday it is "certainly the case that Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not made them." The prime minister said Japan has abstained from doing so in line with its obligations as a nonnuclear power under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. "How could the prime minister make such comments when every nation is making efforts to resolve (the issue of) North korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program?" Kono said. He also said A-bomb victims and other concerned people in the only atomic-bombed nation have a severe perception about nuclear weapons. Hata made the comment in connection with a remark he reportedly made in a House of Councillors budget committee meeting earlier Friday. It is believed to be the first time for the Japanese Government to directly acknowledge such potential, either in the Diet or publicly.
