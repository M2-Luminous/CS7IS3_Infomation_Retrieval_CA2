This has been stated by the members of the first two Japanese delegations to visit Cuba as part of the Union Tourism program. They showed great respect and admiration for the attitude of the Cuban people in resisting and overcoming the U.S. blockade. The visitors belong to the provincial and municipal unions of the governments of (Tokaona), (Logano), (Tuyana), and Hiroshima and the public workers organization of Tokyo's administration. The Japanese delegations were received by Norma Ortega, secretary general of Cuba's Public Administration Union. The Japanese delegations made cash donations for the Cuban people. Both Japanese organizations showed interest in the current situation of Cuba, and stressed the advantage that it is to live under the social justice existing in Cuba.
