"Are people dressed in black always Thai?" asked director-general Don Pramutwinai of the Foreign Ministry's East Asian Affairs Department. "Thai rangers may wear black but they would not be so stupid as to wear their uniform while helping the Khmer Rouge," he said. Mr Don was commenting on remarks by Cambodian Information Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse who implied that Thais were among the foreigners dressed in black who had fought for the Khmer Rouge. Mr Don questioned the reliability of field reports received by officials in Phnom Penh and urged them to refrain from making remarks based on them. "Are they sure that what they say benefits Cambodia, their own situation or the attempt to build better relations with neighboring countries?" he asked. Unsubstantiated remarks "only cause ill-feeling" and Thailand would not pay attention to groundless allegations, he said. Cambodia might want to draw attention from other countries but should be more constructive about it. Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to settle any doubts in a diplomatic manner, he stressed. He cited a recent phone call from Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut to Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri.
