He exchanged views with them on the realignment of the political world. According to a participant in the gathering, Ozawa said: "Prime Minister Hosokawa is a great man who knows his priorities. The JNP should also be confident in its support of the administration." Also present at this meeting were Diet members Toshio Yamaguchi and Naoto Kitamura. Ozawa had also met with other JNP Diet members on 7 and 10 March. On the other hand, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (head of Sakigake [Harbinger]) attended a study group of Sakigake and JNP members on information and communications on the morning of 15 March. He said in his speech, "While I will not attend the general meeting of Sakigake Diet members, I intend to deal actively with party affairs," thus impressing his listeners with his enthusiasm for party affairs. Because Ozawa has been actively approaching JNP Diet members, Takemura apparently feels that it is not enough for him to "concentrate on administrative affairs." The tug-of-war between the two men to form an alliance with the JNP is expected to grow in intensity.
