Seoul officials unanimously welcomed North Korea's decision to reallow IAEA inspections but agreed it marks only a beginning, with even tougher negotiations than before probably still ahead. It's progress since the IAEA can at least resume safegaurds activities in North Korea and reload batteries and film in inspection cameras that stopped functioning months ago. The chief aim is to check whether nuclear materials at North Korea's seven declared facilities have been diverted for non-peaceful purposes since the last full-scale inspection in February last year. Just verifying that there have been no covert nuclear activities in North Korea will significantly ease international concern for the present. North Korea and the United States are now closer to holding the next round of high-level talks, an event that should defuse the threat of war and give peace a chance. But the situation has only returned to that of before last March 12, when North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non- proliferation Treaty (NPT). In fact, the situation is in deeper limbo since North Korea and the IAEA intentionally haven't settled whether Pyongyang has fully returned to the NPT. The wording of the North Korea-IAEA agreement leaves this issue in a vague state. North Korea claims it isn't party to the NPT and thus not obligated to permit routine IAEA inspections. Its decision to accept IAEA checks is purely voluntary, it maintains. The agency insists otherwise, asserting that inspections are part of NPT obligations. The compromise was not reached to settle this dispute. The IAEA is simply going into North Korea to reload the inspection cameras and to check on possible nuclear materials diversion. Under the compromise, the IAEA got the scope of inspection it demanded. North Korea, in return, saved face by not admitting to having NPT obligations. While the agreement on inspection breaks the present impasse, North Korea can always refuse further inspections because it never admitted to the obligations. Once talks get underway for full-scale inspections, North Korea and the agency will have to tackle this dispute once again. It has been Seoul and Washington's policy to take one step at a time. The immediate goal was to re-enter North Korea to find out if there is cause for concern about its suspected covert nuclear weapons program. The North Korea-IAEA agreement assures just that. But officials here see higher mountains to climb -- special inspections of North Korea's undeclared sites and inter-Korean talks that must reopen before the United States will hold high-level contacts with North Korea, for starters.
