For health reasons you are not attending your trial as a participant in the August 1991 putsch. How, then, can you take part in sittings of the Duma? [Lukianov] I am genuinely sick, suffering from complications linked with pneumonia, which is why I will have to return to the hospital in two weeks. That explains my absence from the trial. However, as you know, in the Duma every vote counts and costs dearly. That is why I preferred not to take my temperature or spare my efforts to place myself at the service of the Duma. Furthermore, contrary to all expectations I have been appointed the senior representative of the block of independent representatives. Consequently, I will have to shoulder the responsibility of temporary president of the chamber while awaiting the election of the real president. [Celerier] You were president of the Supreme Soviet, the parliament of the USSR. What common points do you see between that body and the Duma? [Lukianov] Our Duma is an institution which has barely seen the light of day, but it still bears traces of its Soviet predecessors. Above all, it defends the interests of the people who elected it. Thus, the voters are entitled to recall their deputy if he fails to respect the urgent mandate entrusted to him. The deputy is bound by an indissoluble link with the people who elected him. [Celerier] And the differences? [Lukianov] In the era of the Supreme Soviet and the supreme body of the Congress of People's Deputies, the multiparty system only appeared at the very last moment, just before our Soviet system was destroyed. Unlike in the West, back then our parties had emerged from political groups that had broken away from the Communist party. With the Duma, for the first time in more than 70 years, party- based elections have been held. In the future, many issues will have to be settled by agreement between these parties. [Celerier] Is it possible that the Communists and the agrarians, of whom you are one of the leaders, will join forces with the ultranationalists led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy? [Lukianov] You are wrong, the only group with which we could really collaborate is the democratic party of Nikolay Travkin. For, you will be surprised to hear, in my considered opinion, the positions adopted by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy are closer to those of the Choice of Russia (the presidential party - LE SOIR editor's note) than to ours. For instance, he supported the new Constitution and its presidential regime as well as the abolition of the old Supreme Soviet by the coup d'etat in October. All these being measures that we fought, but which fit in remarkably well with the slogans of the "democrats." "The West Should Not Try To Destabilize Us" [Celerier] How do you value Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow? [Lukianov] This meeting with Mr. Yeltsin is necessary, but it will only prove beneficial if the U.S. President understands that our president did not succeed in winning a vote of confidence in the elections of 12 December. Unfortunately, I fear that the U.S. Administration is not ready to take account of the new hand that has been dealt, or of the fact that in Russia the specter of politics looms much larger than the "democrats" in power would like to have them believe. If I could meet with President Clinton I could ensure him that we are not anti-American. However, on the other hand, neither the United States nor Europe should try to destabilize our geopolitical position, especially with NATO. [Celerier] Precisely, how do you see Bill Clinton's efforts at mediation in the dispute between Russia and the Ukraine on nuclear weapons? [Lukianov] In private I would dissuade him from becoming involved in either our internal or external affairs. However, if he really wants to lower the popularity of Boris Yeltsin, then he should by all means interfere. Remember Gorbachev. Any foreign arbitrator in a conflict involving two Slavic countries runs the risk of being sorely disappointed. Nonetheless, I wish him good luck.
