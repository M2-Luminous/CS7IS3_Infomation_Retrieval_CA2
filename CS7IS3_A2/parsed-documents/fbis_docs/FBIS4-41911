A representative of the presidential candidate's team at the news conference said the outcome of the first round demonstrated that "the new course proposed by Kuchma enjoys popularity among the people." The candidate himself added: "It also shows that most of the other deputies are using none other than my program in the preelection contest." Leonid Kuchma underscored that opportunities to use the state mass media in the preelection campaign were not equal. Asked about his own use of the private mass media in Donetsk and Kiev and his appearance on Ostankino TV, Mr. Kuchma replied that "Leonid Kravchuk did it on a much larger scale". The outcome of the election in Crimea was described by Mr. Kuchma as crucial. There, as we know, over 83 percent of the electorate voted in favor of his candidacy. "Crimea has proved to be an absolutely normal part of Ukraine," Leonid Kuchma said. "My aim is not winning. My aim is, under the conditions of an information blockade, communicating to the public at large my own views and opinions on the situation in the state," Leonid Kuchma concluded.
