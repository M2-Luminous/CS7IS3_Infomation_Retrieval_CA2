The paper notes, however, that decisive results are still a long way off because the Israeli negotiators have not announced Israel's willingness to withdraw fully from the occupied Arab territories. Withdrawal, the paper asserts, is the key to a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. TISHRIN goes on: Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday acknowledged the importance of peace with Syria. Rabin had been denying this fact since the Oslo agreement. The paper adds: Developments have proven that there can be no peace in the region without Syria. Syria has over the past two years made tremendous efforts to advance the peace process. It presented a working paper during the sixth round, which to date is the only formal paper for the Washington talks. Syria has repeatedly rescued the U.S. peace initiative from Israel's ploys. The Geneva summit was the apex of Syria's serious endeavor to establish a just, comprehensive, and durable peace in the Middle East. TISHRIN underlines U.S. President Clinton's praise for Syria's relentless efforts and his adoption of President al-Asad's call for the peace of the brave in the region. Syria did all of this out of its love for, and belief in, peace, and not to convince Israel of its true desire for peace. Israel is the party that should do this. Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN asserts the need for Israel's withdrawal from all of the occupied Arab territories, since this would give the peace process great momentum and expedite the achievement of tangible, decisive progress on the path to the just aspired-for peace. Syria is only demanding its territory and what is its right. Its position is completely in line with UN resolutions, the Madrid conference foundations, and the principles of international law. Israeli occupation, on the other hand, violates resolutions and principles. The aggressor should certainly prove its goodwill. Under the headline "The Touchstone," AL-THAWRAH says: Despite the optimistic atmosphere that prevailed the world following the Geneva summit and one week after the Washington talks at the level of the heads of delegations, Israel alone has continued to adhere to its methods that obstruct any concrete progress. Israel alone is the source of pessimism about prospects for making concrete progress, by avoiding giving any clear and definite answers to the question of full withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied Arab territories, which is the basis of a just and comprehensive peace. AL-THAWRAH affirms that maneuvering has continued to be the distinguishing feature of Israel's policy. This is despite the fact that the Geneva summit has convinced the whole world, primarily the United States, of the true Arab desire for a just and comprehensive peace, and despite everything that Syria has done throughout the peace process, including the important Geneva summit, to prove its goodwill and tireless efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace that restores to the Arabs their land and rights and preserves their dignity. AL-THAWRAH adds: No doubt, Israel was the biggest -- not to say the only -- loser after the Geneva summit. Israel did not want the Geneva summit to convene in the first place. It wanted the Zionist voice to be the only voice in the ears of the U.S. Administration. The paper goes on: The Geneva summit has accentuated the need for a just and comprehensive solution in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. It has also bolstered Syria's key role in the region, especially in the peace process on all of its tracks. The paper concludes: Amid this climate, the Washington talks are continuing. These talks put the Tel Aviv rulers to the test, as to whether or not they are going to respond to the will of the international community and that of Washington in implementing Security Council resolutions and acknowledging the requirements for a just and comprehensive solution. Based on this touchstone, the international community will be responsible for implementing its legitimacy and putting an end to Israel's rebellion. Under the headline "The Margin for Israeli Maneuvering," AL-THAWRAH writes in another commentary: The results of the historic Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton have placed Israel in a tight spot and face to face with the challenge of peace. Israel has only one option: Either to accept a just, comprehensive peace and respond to its requirements and conditions -- enshrined in the resolutions of international legitimacy and stipulating withdrawal from all of the occupied Arab territories and acknowledging the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people -- or to reject this peace and bear the consequences for passing up this historic opportunity. AL-THAWRAH asserts that the world is now convinced that Israel is the party that is creating obstacles to hinder and blow up the peace process and deny this hot, unstable region any peace and stability. This is because Israel's creed and strategy and the reasons for its existence contradict this situation. The paper concludes: All indications, and the conduct of the Tel Aviv rulers, point to one fact: The Israeli rulers are not in the business of making peace. They are absolutely not interested in making the peace process succeed. Quite the opposite is true.
