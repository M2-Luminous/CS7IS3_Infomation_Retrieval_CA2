Wages for the Workers, and the Sack for the Bureaucrats"] [Text] About 200 delegates from 37 oblasts, 6 republics, and 2 krays, as well as 175 delegates of the "Working Capital" congress from Moscow and the Moscow region, participated in the Second Congress of the "Working Russia" All-Russia Sociopolitical Movement, which took place 23 April in the city of Reutovo, Moscow Oblast. Viktor Anpilov's report "On the Socioeconomic Situation in Russia," the coreports by well-known scientists Boris Khorev and Aleksey Sergeyev, and the delegates' speeches noted that further enforced capitalization of the country will exacerbate the crisis, compound the already desperate situation in which the workers find themselves, and turn Russia into a colony of the developed capitalist countries. The congress expressed an unequivocal view: Only a complete change of the country's political and economic policy and the restoration of workers' power from top to bottom in the shape of soviets will extricate society from the crisis. "Working Russia" has always been against private property and the implementation of the predatory privatization program which has brought poverty, unemployment, and social inequality to the majority of the working people. Each increase in the percentage of the country's unemployed should be matched by an identical reduction in Russia's administrative apparatus, which has increased greatly and exceeds the number of administrators in the whole of the Soviet Union's structures, the delegates said. Another slogan which was ardently supported was: "Wages for the workers, the sack for the president and the bureaucrats!" The congress adopted a package of documents, having confirmed its policy to organize a general political strike in Russia. Advocating peace and stability in society, the delegates demanded that the powers that be respect existing laws and that President Yeltsin be dismissed immediately. A public committee to investigate the tragedy of 3-4 October was formed and Russian People's Deputy Yuriy Slobodkin will head it. The congress supported the "Working Capital's" decision to nominate Viktor Anpilov as a Russian presidential candidate. Anpilov himself is categorically against the institution of the presidency which is incompatible with true democracy, and is joining the battle for the post of president with the sole aim of abolishing the institution of the presidency which is hateful to the people and bringing back the soviets of working people as his very first act if he is elected. Oleg Shenin, chairman of the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU Council Political Executive Committee; Timo Lahdenmaeki, chairman of the Finnish Communist Workers Party; Eric Trevet, general secretary of the new Communist Party of England; Yeoryios Mavrikos, member of the Communist Party of Greece Central Committee, Sergio Rubens, member of the Brazilian "8 October" Revolutionary Movement Coordination Committee; Bill Doris, member of the U.S. Workers' World Party Central Committee; and others ardently welcomed "Working Russia's" heroic struggle to resurrect the Soviet Union, socialism, and Soviet power. "Working Russia" called on all working people to hold a May Day demonstration under the slogans: "Authorities Without Criminals," "Life Without Speculators," "Stable Prices," and "Unity of the USSR's Peoples."
