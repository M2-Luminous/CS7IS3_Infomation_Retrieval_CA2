The meeting has heard expositions and opinions on a total of 11 draft laws and draft legal decisions. After making earnest deliberations, we have adopted resolutions on four laws and relevant legal issues. While holding the meeting, we have also attended the commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth centenary. The adopted Company Law is a very important law in a socialist market economy. Its formulation and implementation will be a major event in the development of China's legal system. The law has an important significance in specifying the legal status of companies which are the main bodies of a market, in regulating a company's organizations and behavior, in establishing a modern enterprise system, and in enhancing the healthy development of a socialist market economy. The meeting's adoption of the Draft Amendment to the Accountants Law and the decision on the applicability of relevant interim taxation regulations to foreign-funded and foreign-owned enterprises will play an important role in improving the legal system governing accountants and the taxation system, in protecting the market's economic order, and in improving China's investment environment. The meeting has adopted a decision to submit the Draft Budget Law to the Second Session of the Eighth NPC for deliberation. It has preliminarily deliberated the Draft Foreign Trade Law, the Draft Law on Protecting Taiwan Compatriots' Investments, the Draft Law on Eugenic and Health Care, and the Draft Provisions on Severely Punishing Criminals Who Organize and Smuggle People Across China's Borders. It has also heard a report on opinions concerning the Draft Securities Law. Furthermore, the meeting has heard and deliberated the State Council's reports on the work regarding economic relations and trade with foreign countries; on improving the safety and work of civil aviation; and on inspecting the implementation of the Decision on Punishing Crimes of Production and Sales of Fake and Shoddy Commodities. The meeting has adopted a decision to hold the Second Session of the Eighth NPC. We have over two months before the Second Session of the Eighth NPC is held on 10 March 1994, and we should do earnest and down-to-earth preparatory work. We must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; strive to make the forthcoming session a meeting of democracy and unity, as well as a meeting to seek truth, and discuss practical problems, opening up, and forging ahead; and further mobilize people of various nationalities across China to make concerted efforts and seize opportunities to accelerate the pace of reform and opening up and bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. The year 1993 is approaching its end. Through our joint efforts since the First Session of the Eighth NPC was held in March 1993, the NPC Standing Committee has made considerable progress in economic legislation. We have made 16 decisions on formulating and amending laws, and on adopting relevant legal issues; 12 of them concerning socialist market economy issues. We are intensifying the inspection and supervision of law enforcement. The NPC Standing Committee and various special committees have successively sent out 33 law-enforcement inspection teams to check the implementation of 18 laws and decisions, and the inspections had a certain effect. Our work in other aspects has also produced good results. The year 1994, which is approaching soon, will be one in which we shall face more concentrated tasks of reform and must implement in an all-round way the "Decision on Certain Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy" made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. All reform measures that we take will be of vital importance, and therefore they require that we be meticulous and act with caution. We must succeed in their implementation; we cannot afford to fail. Our fundamental method is to base our work on the interests of the masses and to win their understanding and support. We must make the masses really understand that successful implementation of these reform measures are, in the final analysis, beneficial to them and conducive to accelerating economic development and to improving the people's living standards. In this connection, it is necessary for the NPC and the people's congresses at all levels to look upon expediting the implementation of various reform measures as their own tasks, to conduct surveys and study by immersing themselves among the masses and by going deep into the realities of life, to listen attentively to the views of the masses, to show concern for the masses who encounter temporary difficulties, to take notice of and understand various factors that may possibly affect social stability and the smooth progress of reform at all times, and to actively help the putting forward of constructive views on solving various problems under the leadership of the party. Meanwhile, they must supervise the implementation of all reform measures which have been adopted according to the law, take the initiative in a timely manner to make suggestions on improving our work, and unite and lead the masses of the people to successfully fulfill our reform tasks during the whole year. In 1994, the people's congress standing committees must continue to place legislation and, in particular, economic legislation at the top of their agenda. They must make efforts to closely coordinate legislative work with the steps of reform and use laws to guide, promote, and protect reform in accordance with the requirements set by the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. They must in a timely manner sum up the experiences gained from implementing adopted reform measures, and they must finalize and standardize them by using as many legal forms as possible. They must make a clear distinction between the order of importance and urgency of the laws to be made next year, make proper arrangements, and create the laws that are badly needed ahead of other laws. For example, laws on finance, banking, bank bills, and securities are more urgent than others, and close attention should be paid to their legislation. To carry out major legislative work in a planned way and to enable a framework of the legal system for a socialist market economy to evolve during the current tenure of the people's congresses, the [NPC] Standing Committee is mapping out a five- year legislation plan and is taking vigorous steps to this end. The five years are an important period for China to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy; all fields of endeavor call for the formulation of a number of laws. A legislation plan must be based on the Constitution; it must take into consideration both the possibilities of the realities and the objective needs of reform, opening up, and modernization; and it must make the focal points stand out while giving consideration to other points. The current [people's congress] standing committees must treat as their primary task the effort to formulate the laws on standardizing the main part of the market, maintaining market order, strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, and improving the social security system. Meanwhile, they must also make arrangements for the legislation of the laws on strengthening the building of socialist democracy, improving the system for the organization of state organs, punishing criminals for various criminal activities, maintaining social order; promoting the development of education, science, and culture; protecting our environment, and strengthening the national defense buildup. In addition, they must amend or abolish at the right moment laws incompatible with the establishment of a socialist market economy. It is necessary for all departments to make concerted efforts and to coordinate closely with each other to map out a legislative plan. The people's congress standing committees must strengthen guidance for legislative work and work successfully in coordinating and supervising the drafting of laws under the unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee. We definitely must acquire a new concept compatible with the socialist market economy, conduct intensive study of the new situations and new problems existing in the realities of life, boldly explore and practice, and solve the difficulties and problems encountered in legislation with the spirit of reform so that legislation can catch up with the pace of reform and opening up. After a law is enacted, it must be resolutely implemented. The failure to implement an enacted law is tantamount to the nonexistence of the law. The basic principle of our socialist legal system is to have laws, abide by the law, strictly enforce the law, and see to it that violators of the law are punished. To ensure a sound legal system, none of these four links are dispensable. Because China has a history of several thousand years of feudal society, people have a relatively weak sense of law. Some comrades are accustomed to relying on administrative means to manage economic and social affairs, and they do not attach sufficient importance to the role of the law. Some of them even abuse power and openly violate the law merely to benefit their own localities, departments, or organizations. Such a practice is incompatible with the establishment of a socialist market economy. So, we must not only pay attention to legislation. We must also attach great importance to implementing laws and ensure that everything is done strictly according to the law. Great efforts should be made to improve the situation of some departments, cadres and, people who "know nothing about the law, know about it but fail to implement it at all, or fail to implement it strictly." Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out that an important thing in strengthening the legal system is to carry out education, and it is necessary to enhance the sense of law among the people. We should strive to publicize the law and make it known to as many people as possible. Television and radio stations, newspapers, journals, and other media should make it their day-to-day important work to publicize the law. All departments and localities should persistently publicize the legal system to educate the cadres and the people, and to increase their sense of law and their ability to act according to the law. It is necessary to establish the authority of the PRC Constitution and other laws in society, and to ensure that the Constitution and other laws are implemented to the letter. Leading organs and leading cadres in particular should take the lead in studying, understanding, and abiding by the law, and know how to manage economic and social affairs according to the law. It is also necessary to keep improving the judicial system and the administration's law-enforcement mechanisms, and to raise the standards of both. The people's congress standing committees at all levels should attach importance to inspecting and supervising the implementation of laws. The stress of the inspection for a period to come should be placed on major issues concerning reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, as well as the issues about which the people have strong complaints. More attention should be paid to inspecting and supervising the implementation of the laws concerning the socialist market economy and striving to improve the results of inspection. If any problem is discovered, the departments concerned should be urged to resolve it seriously so as to win the people's trust. In short, we should conscientiously carry out the duties bestowed on us by the PRC Constitution and other laws. We should work in a down-to-earth way to make greater progress in promoting the socialist democracy and legal system. I hope that our comrades will make their due contributions during the struggle waged by the whole party and the people across the country to win new victories in reform and construction next year. Last, because New Year's Day is just around the corner, I would like to take this opportunity to say Happy New Year to you. Thank you.
