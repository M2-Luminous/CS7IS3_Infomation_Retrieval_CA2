FR940707-2-00051 FR940707-2-00029 [Docket No. CP93&hyph;437&hyph;001] Northwest Pipeline Corp.; Petition To Amend June 30, 1994. Take notice that on June 24, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84158, filed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;437&hyph;001 a petition to amend the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued September 13, 1993, in Docket No. CP93&hyph;437&hyph;000 to upgrade the horsepower of the Snohomish and Sumner Compressor Stations on its mainline transmission system in Washington, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Northwest proposes to upgrade the existing compressor unit at Sumner from 4,000 horsepower to 6,350 horsepower instead of the 5,200 horsepower authorized in the September 13, 1993, order. It is stated that the previously authorized increase would not be sufficient to achieve the desired capacity increase because of compressor cylinder limitations. It is stated that the previously estimated cost of $1.08 million for the upgrade would remain the same. It is asserted that the proposed increase in horsepower would increase Northwest's capability to receive Canadian gas supplies during off-peak periods and would enhance Northwest's flexibility in utilizing receipt point options under existing transportation agreements. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition to amend should on or before July 21, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 384.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16386 Filed 7&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
