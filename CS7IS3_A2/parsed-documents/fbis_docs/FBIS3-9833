When we addressed her at Schwechat airport, she was willing to answer our questions. [Melicharkova] Where were you when you learned that you had been appointed as the government member responsible for economic policy? [Schmognerova] I did not expect that the no-confidence vote in the former prime minister, on the basis of which the former government resigned, would have an impact on my personal life. At that time, my colleagues and I were on a trip in the United States. During this trip, I visited several institutions. I learned about the fact in Los Angeles. Immediately after my return to the center, I phoned my husband, and he told me about the proposal by the people who were forming the government. Of course, I wanted to make my situation clear. I spoke with Peter Weiss, chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, and with Prime Minister Moravcik. On the basis of the conversation with them, I accepted the proposal. [Melicharkova] What was the purpose of your visit to the United States? [Schmognerova] My trip was expected to take six months. It was a working visit organized for future professional politicians. This program has been running for three years. It is financed by the Pewtery Double Trust company. The Pew Freedom Economic Fellow program has three parts--the academic one, visits to various institutions and organizations, and the practical one, which is carried out in some government organization or international financial institutions, or in private institutions, as the case may be. [Melicharkova] As deputy prime minister, you have participated in debates in the IMF, in several international financial institutions, and with U.S. Treasury Department representatives. Could you tell us what are the IMF conditions for approval of the so-called standby credit to the Slovak Republic? There were rumors that the former government had prepared a supplement to the already approved IMF memorandum on the economic policy of the Slovak Republic Government. What is going on in this sphere? What are the new IMF conditions? [Schmognerova] The memorandum on economic policy was drafted last year. It is a program outlining the Slovak Republic's 1994 economic policy. After the IMF visit in January and February of this year, the IMF decided, on the basis of the results of the 1993 budgetary and monetary policy, to complete the memorandum with additional conditions in the sphere of financial and monetary policy. As far as I know, in the sphere of monetary policy, the National Bank of Slovakia has already accepted these conditions. The former government did not succeed in drafting on time a supplement to the memorandum on the financial policy. One of my intentions was to find out to what extent the IMF would insist that we exactly meet the demands that were formulated in that supplement. Certain parts of the talks regarding this matter were really complicated. We succeeded in achieving one thing. The IMF will be open to discussion with the new government of the Slovak Republic. It is important for us to achieve the goals of the 1994 economic policy. They will also be open to our suggestions regarding the way we would like to attain these goals. I believe this is an important step. [Melicharkova] Do you have any idea to what extent the economic policy of the current government will build on the economic policy of the former government, and to what extent this policy will change? [Schmognerova] We will continue working on the basic tasks that have been set out in the program of economic policy. During the talks in the United States, I tried to explain that our government was determined to achieve these goals. Our efforts will be aimed at searching for measures that will allow us to meet our objectives. We will certainly have quite important differences here, compared with the former government. [Melicharkova] It seems that the 1993 state budget deficit is much higher than estimated two months ago. Without the deficit in the health care and the education system, it amounts to some 30 billion korunas. Do you know how to sort out the deficit-related problem and its impact on the economic policy? Many people are afraid that it would affect, once again, the poorest people.... [Schmognerova] We have to look at the reason our deficit increased so much in the last months of 1993. Basically, there are three reasons. First, our deficit was mostly affected by the payment of our debt to the Czech side outside the clearing system. Second, certain National Property Fund claims in the banking sphere had to be paid. Third, there were higher expenditures from the stage budget. In certain spheres, spending substantially exceeded the projected figures. Each of these spheres requires a specific attitude and a specific solution. In every case, we will have to make efforts to prevent such a situation from arising in the course of the year or at the end of 1994.
