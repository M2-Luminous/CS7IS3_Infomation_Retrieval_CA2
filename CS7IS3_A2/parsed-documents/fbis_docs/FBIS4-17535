Feliks Kovalev, the roving ambassador who is heading the Russian delegation, said this in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. Summing up the results of the Geneva round, he disclosed that, on behalf of the United Nations and the Russian Federation, "options for a compromise were proposed, and the parties expressed readiness, in essence, to adopt them as a basis for further discussions." "The next session will be held in Moscow on 10 May, and we may be able to make a little more progress there than we have managed on this occasion." Two documents proposed by the mediators will be discussed at the meeting in the Russian capital. The first deals with "political and legal elements of a comprehensive settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict." The second concerns "proposals on the establishment of a coordinating commission." The documents were jointly prepared by UN and Russian diplomats. Kovalev said that the Russian delegation "made a substantial contribution." Is there any chance the two sides will reach an agreement? "It is very difficult to answer this question," F. Kovalev noted. "Judging by their drafts, they have not budged from their original positions. In fact, they are going backward rather than forward." The main problem is connected with Abkhazia's political status. "One side wants to regard itself as an independent state entering into a treaty relationship with another state. That is the Abkhazian starting point. The starting point of the Georgians is to keep everything roughly as it was before the conflict started," the diplomat said. The United Nations and Russia are proposing a "union state." Their proposals also say that the parties recognize the territorial integrity of the entity they might establish as a result of the talks, Kovalev concluded.
