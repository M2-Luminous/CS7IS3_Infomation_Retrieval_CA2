The president said he most probably made a mistake by persuading the parliament not to dissolve the Vilnius City Council last year. "It seemed then that new city leaders are emerging, and it was expected that conclusions would be drawn. But this did not happen," Brazauskas said. Sharply criticizing activities of the capital's municipal authorities, the president recalled an incident with the French Lyonnaise des Eaux company, which suggested to create a joint water-supply company in Vilnius, but the proposal was rejected in a rude manner. Brazauskas said the Vilnius council mixes politics with municipal problems. "One party even has its headquarters" in the municipality building, he said. In Brazauskas' view, activities of Vilnius authorities defame the entire country because they fail to keep promises to foreign embassies, diplomats have to look for premises themselves. The president emphasized that the city council is fully responsible for the present situation in the capital and added that the council's dissolution may have to be discussed soon. Brazauskas also urged the parliament to draft a capital city law.
