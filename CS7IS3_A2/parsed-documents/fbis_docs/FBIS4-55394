This is a conclusion prompted not by the interests of the SDS as a political formation, but by the need to lead Bulgaria out of the critical situation in which it finds itself, and the grave consequences of the rule of the present government. Therefore it is necessary to effect a decisive change, prompted by a new political will that is able to implement changes in the direction of the reforms -- a direction the SDS advocates in the name of the nation. The SDS National Conference discussed the issue of adopting a categorical position against the existing government and the creation of a similar one, and against continuing the activity of the current parliament. The SDS's decisive organs are the conference and the National Coordinating Council. [end recording] According to the changes in the SDS statute as adopted by the conference, certain restricting texts were adopted regarding the future SDS people's representatives. Those texts apply also to the current members of the National Coordinating Council. They cannot be former members of the Union of Active Fighters Against Fascism and Capitalism, active figures in the totalitarian regime, or people who have submitted requests to join the former Bulgarian Communist Party. According to the document that was adopted, if the current government remains in office, the SDS will begin massive extraparliamentary protest actions, combined with a parliamentary boycott. The forms of those actions are yet to be specified.
