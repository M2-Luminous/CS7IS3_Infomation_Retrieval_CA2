According to Mr. Kirakosyan, the Republic of Armenia's current permanent representation in Moscow does not have a legal basis since it does not fall under any of the agreements signed between Armenia and Russia. Essentially, it is still a "representation of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR under the USSR Council of Ministers." Naturally, its status has to be changed sooner or later. There are reasons to assume that the presidential edicts on the creation of a diplomatic representation and appointment of a Republic of Armenia charge d'affaires in Russia will be signed in the very near future.
