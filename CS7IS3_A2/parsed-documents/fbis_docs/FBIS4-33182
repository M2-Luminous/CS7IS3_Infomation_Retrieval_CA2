As part of an accord signed earlier this year, the agreement has three purposes: 1) to amortize the Cuban debt with official Brazilian entities, 2) to make a cash payment, and 3) to purchase Brazilian products. According to sources, the first delivery of medicines was completed in mid-May. Via this transaction, Brazil hopes to receive approximately $3 million to cover the debts, the greater part of which are lines of credit from official banks for exporting products from Brazil to Cuba. Brazilian imports from Cuba traditionally include about 25 products, including soybeans, poultry, engines, tires, and polyethylene. Cuba began delaying paying its Brazilian debt in 1989 during the process process that brought about the disappearance of the Soviet Union, which had been Cuba's leading trading partner and top supplier of commodities and spare parts. In 1933, Brazilian exports to Cuba reached $9 million and imports from Cuba $21 million. To reactivate trade with Brazil, Cuban officials have offered $300 million in products, mainly medicines.
