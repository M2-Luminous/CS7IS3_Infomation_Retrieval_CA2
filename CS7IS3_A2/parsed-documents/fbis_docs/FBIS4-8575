The resolution stressed that "pressure on the Cabinet is still indispensable" and recommended the Union Strike Headquarters to outline a scenario for further activities, preparing the union to the possible "mass protest action." Solidarity Leader Marian Krzaklewski told journalists that the battle can last for months. Spokesman for the National Commission Piotr Zak explained that the collection of money for a strike fund and preparations for at least a several-day long protest are the basic task facing the union at present. The government does not care about strikes in plants that are anyway on the verge of bankruptcy, he said. He warned that "one does not need many people to paralyse the life in the country." He also announced that other forms of protest, namely demonstrations, pickets in front of the office of the Council of Ministers and the Parliament and distribution of leaflets, would be carried out. The National Commission made amendments to rules governing the supervisory board of Solidarity Economic Fund and adopted a schedule for union training. It also resolved that the sixth national congress of Solidarity delegates would be held in Mielec, Rzeszow Province, between June 30 and July 2. The national Commission also examined the main points of a draft constitution worked out by the Constitutional commission of the union.
