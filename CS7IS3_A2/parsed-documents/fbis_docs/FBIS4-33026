The "National Newscast" has learned that this afternoon the prosecutor will tell the Constitutional Court that the decree is unconstitutional. This will be announced in the next few hours. Over the past two years, the government has issued internal disturbance decrees eight times. The most recent implementation of this measure was to prevent a mass exodus of inmates from Colombian jails. The arguments the prosecutor could wield to call for a ruling that such decrees are unconstitutional are as follow: 1. He says that eight internal disturbance decrees have been used to undermine the rights of due process of many inmates who, because of the expiration of deadlines, should have been released from prison a long time ago, as stipulated by the Penal Procedures Code. 2. He criticizes the state for being unable to conduct investigations on people facing drug-trafficking and terrorism charges in an efficient and timely manner. The court has already rejected a request from the prosecutor that it delay its ruling on the most recent internal disturbance decrees. The official ruling will be handed down in 20 days.
