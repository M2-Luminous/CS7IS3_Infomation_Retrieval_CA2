FBIS4-43272 "drweu115_o_94008" FBIS-WEU-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 CYPRUS Discusses Meeting, Abou's Statement Discusses Meeting, Abou's Statement NC1406203994 Nicosia BRTK Television Network in Turkish 1630 GMT 14 Jun 94 NC1406203994 Nicosia BRTK Television Network Turkish BFN [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the main problem of the talks on Cyprus is the inclusion of the concrete rights that will be recognized to the Turkish-Cypriot side in the document, dated 21 March. President Denktas stressed that the document, dated 21 March, or the draft ideas, can be changed. He recalled that the UN General Secretariat has made a promise to the Turkish Cypriot side on that matter. Denktas received Gustav Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative, at 1600 today. Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur; Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasit; Under Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Ozer Koray; and Presidential advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun also attended the meeting. In a statement after the meeting, which continued for nearly 45 minutes, President Denktas said: [Begin Denktas recording] We are working on the matter. We have been unable to conclude our work today. I could have asked Mr. Feissel yesterday to come back on Thursday [16 June]. However, I hoped that we would be able to conclude our work today. We have not been able to do so. Therefore, he will come back at 1000 on Thursday. The situation has not changed. They have put forward requests on the access road [to Maras] and the area. Their requests are common knowledge. They want us to withdraw one mile or one kilometer from each side of that road. We have agreed to withdraw up to 400 meters. Furthermore, we have agreed that our military troops will not be seen in that area. We are holding talks on the question of the transfer of the police post, which is known as the police house, from the eastern to the western part of that area. The military troops must be able to perform their normal duties in the area. In view of that, the Greek Cypriot demand for a document on how and when crossings will take place is not practical. We are working to try to determine whether or not alternate means can be found. As far as we are concerned, the main problem is whether or not concrete Turkish-Cypriot rights will be included in the document dated 21 March. That is the main problem and we insist that the reply is affirmative. Otherwise, we cannot be satisfied because a comprehensive agreement has to be signed. It should not be divided into two parts. A letter by the UN secretary general confirming the rights to be recognized to the Turkish-Cypriot side cannot be regarded as a part of the comprehensive agreement. That would be meaningless. Such a letter cannot be regarded as being of equal strength. It would create many legal disputes in the future. I believe that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis' statement that the document, dated 21 March, cannot be changed is not valid because it has been described as containing a set of draft ideas. Work is carried out on a draft document in order that it can be finalized and converted into an agreement. That means that certain points can be changed. The UN Secretary General has promised us that it can be changed. However, it has suggested that the change should be realized through a letter. We have responded by saying that what they have described as a document on draft ideas should be changed and converted into an agreement. [end recording] For his part, Gustav Feissel said after his talks with Denktas that they tried to clarify certain points. Following his statement on the talks he held with Gustav Feissel, President Denktas assessed the intervention of Serge Abou, the European Union's observer on Cyprus, on the implementation of the package of confidence-building measures. Denktas stressed that Abou was wrong to take sides as an observer. He said the following: [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Abou is reported to have said today that he believes that the document, dated 21 March, is valid and must not be changed. We did not expect a coordinator or an observer to involve himself in the problem in such a clear and biased fashion. Some of our officials were undecided as to whether or not we should hold talks with him. Considering his statement, we thank God that we did not agree to meet him. Obviously, he has been influenced by the Greek Cypriots as a result of his contacts with them. He has taken sides on a matter that does not concern him. Consequently, he has already begun to do everything he can to influence the EU in favor of the Greek Cypriots. That is a regrettable development. His appointment was wrong. It was asked for by the UN secretary general on behalf of Glavkos Kliridhis. It was unnecessary. Obviously, something was required to reinforce the Greek-Cypriot side's approach. That state of affairs is regrettable. The adoption of a position by observers to harm one side of the issue is unthinkable. We hope that Mr. Abou will not make a similar mistake in the future.
