Negotiations between the members of the Freedom Alliance are becoming very lively. Last night the Alliance held its first meeting since the election of the parliamentary speakers. Donato Bendicenti reports: [Bendicenti] [Passage omitted] Roberto Maroni from the Northern League said that he was willing to talk about increasing the Freedom Alliance's majority in the Senate. [Begin Maroni recording] I said that we ought to find an agreement with Mario Segni's Pact for Italy and with individual parliamentarians. I do not think that we should be looking for political alliances with the Italian Popular Party. It seems to me that this view is also shared by the leaders of the Pact for Italy so we are in agreement on this point. [passage omitted] [end recording] [Bendicenti] Finally Silvio Berlusconi arrived. Some speculated that his late arrival was due to a secret meeting with Mario Segni. However, this was denied by Berlusconi. [Begin recording] [Berlusconi] This is not true. [Unidentified correspondent] So you did not meet Mario Segni? [Berlusconi] No. I heard that he had said some things, but there is nothing that concerns our relations with Segni. He is asking and replying to his own questions. [passage omitted] [end recording] [Pierferdinando Casini from the Christian Democrat Center shown on video being interviewed by correspondent Fulvio Damiani] [Begin recording] [Damiani] The relationship between the Freedom Alliance and the opposition parties -- are there going to be new developments? Tomorrow the voting for the deputy speakers of the parliamentary chambers will take place. How will you face up to this relationship? Is the relationship one of opposition, or will the Freedom Alliance be holding out a hand to the opposition? [Casini] We are holding out two hands, but not to individual parliamentarians because this is the logic of old-style politics. We are holding out a hand to other political groupings, particularly the Italian Popular Party. There are two opposition slates in parliament: one which is antagonistic, that of the Left and the Progressive Alliance, and the other is an opposition with which we have much in common. However, the Italian Popular Party must reply to these signals. These signals are political and allow them to differentiate their position from that of the left. [Damiani] How are the plans for the government going along? It is said that certain names have already been mentioned in relation to certain ministries? Is this true? [Casini] Some ministries already have names attached to them, but the problem is not that of names but of policies. It is precisely in policy issues that we in the Christian Democratic Center are posing some problems, although of course each party poses its own problems. The government must not be a sort of boat that just floats; it must instead be sure of planning a long and calm journey. [end recording] [Announcer] The replies of the Italian Popular Party and Mario Segni's Pact for Italy, which is scheduled to hold a meeting very shortly with regard to the invitations of the Freedom Alliance, are still negative. The Italian Popular Party has reiterated its decision to remain in opposition. Mario Segni has also ruled out supporting the new government. He said that the Pact's opposition would be firm, but not full of prejudice and closed like that of the Party of the Democratic Left.
