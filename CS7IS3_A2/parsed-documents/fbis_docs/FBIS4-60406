The Spokesman noted that, based on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, neither Arafat nor the PLO has any legislative power or authority. According to Article VII of the Agreement, this power will be granted to the Palestinian Authority -- once it is established and begins operating in the field. Even then, legislation must be enacted in coordination with Israel. Consequently, this statement has no legal validity. All existing military laws and orders remain in force, and are binding on all of the parties. Foreign Ministry Legal Advisor Yo'el Singer adds that from a legal point-of-view Arafat's statement is a breach of Article VII of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and that if indeed there has been any attempt on Arafat's part to change the situation, it would be invalid. He also noted that 'Oded Ben-Ami, the Defense Minister's Media Advisor, is of a similar opinion.
