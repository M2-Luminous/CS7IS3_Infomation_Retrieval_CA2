Since then, there has been a war of words across the border between Togo and Ghana. Togo says the attack was launched by dissidents based in Ghana. The Ghanaian Government denies any involvement and says the Togolese forces shelled Ghanaian territory. Now, as Ebow Godwin reports from Lome, one of the opposition parties based in Togo is insisting it had nothing to do with the attack: [Begin Godwin recording] According to the Action Committee for Renewal led by Lawyer Yaovi Agboyibor, the latest act of violence against Togo was totally undemocratic and certainly not in the best interest of the majority of the Togolese people. They said and I quote, we all reservedly condemn the latest armed attack, no matter where it comes from, because it is undemocratic, unquote. The party, therefore, appeals to the government to take immediate measures to restore the situation in Togo back to normalcy in order to create the right atmosphere for holding the forthcoming parliamentary elections. The coordinating body of the New Political Forces, which is an amalgamation of several opposition parties seeking to create a balance of power between the traditional opposition groups and President Eyadema, also described the armed attack as a deliberate conspiration meant to reverse the move toward the attainment of parliamentary democracy in Togo. A spokesman for the group, Ephrem Dokenou, accused selfish people who were unhappy about the return of peace and political stability in Togo of trying to throw Togo once more into a state of chaos and insecurity. The New Political Forces emphasized that Togo already has a credible political program in place, having already conducting presidential elections last August. The New Forces recalled that currently an international committee, comprising France, Germany, United States of America, and Egypt, were engaged in helping both the opposition groups and President Eyadema organize free and fair multiparty parliamentary elections. He said, and I quote, those who want to create chaos under the pretext that Togo has no credible political program must look elsewhere, unquote. However, the Group of [Pan-African] Social Democrats, GSP, led by Professor Messan Gnininvi, Antoine Folly, and Zarifou Ayeva, denied allegations currently being made in certain quarters that their group, which was boycotting the forthcoming parliamentary elections, was behind the recent armed attack. Our hands are clean, the group declared. [end recording]
