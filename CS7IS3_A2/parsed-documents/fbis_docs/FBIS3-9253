The goal of setting up this group -- as a party organizational structure, without legal status -- is to ensure the support of the locally elected representatives of this party by the central party leadership and the county branches, so as to enable them to optimally carry out their activity in town halls and to implement PAC policies in the sphere of local administration. A communique released by PAC announces that the meeting was attended by PAC President Professor Nicolae Manolescu, members of the Steering Collegium, parliamentarians, 47 mayors and deputy mayors, vice presidents of county councils, and the presidents of the party's county branches. In conclusion, the meeting endorsed and released an appeal to the citizens of the localities administered by the PAC representatives as well as a statement of the Group of PAC Mayors and Deputy Mayors. The statement points out that the local autonomy proclaimed by Law 69/1991 of Romania's Constitution has never taken effect. The disastrous situation of the country's localities, which are devoid of sources of income, is mainly due to the constant blocking of a package of laws of utmost importance for the normal functioning of the local councils. The statement draws the attention of the leadership of the Local Public Administration Department on the negative effects of this obstructionist policy, which is mainly felt by the population. The statement also stresses that the group of PAC mayors and deputy mayors will constantly promote the idea of the need for legislation to facilitate real local autonomy. The group considers it as its duty to appeal to all national and international forums capable of influencing the policy of the current government. In conclusion, the statement expresses the conviction that their colleagues from other parties or with similar political viewpoints will join the efforts of the PAC mayors and deputy mayors.
