The Serbs had taken away l3 of 30 artillery pieces, leaving the remainder under the supervision of Canadian UNPROFOR units who came across the cache last Sunday, Major Macdowall said. The weapons left behind included l0 large calibre mortars, four howitzers, two T-55 tanks and an anti-aircraft gun. The cache was found in Cifluk village north-west of Sarajevo. The Serbs said it was just outside the exclusion zone, basing their calculations on Sarajevo's traditional centrepoint the cathedral. But UNPROFOR's map used a reference point one kilometre (slightly more than half a mile) to the west, putting Cifluk within the exclusion zone, Macdowall noted. The matter was sorted out late on Monday at Pale, stronghold of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, in talks between Bosnian Serb chief Radovan Karadzic and UNPROFOR's Dutch chief of staff General Adrian van Baal. The exclusion zone came into effect on February 20.
