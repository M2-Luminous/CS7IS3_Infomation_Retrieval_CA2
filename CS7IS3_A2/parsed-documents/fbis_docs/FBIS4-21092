Abreu categorically rejected this possibility. Nevertheless, he said he would carefully review this issue. Denying the document that circulated in the United Nations, the foreign minister stressed: "There is not a single possibility for Uruguay to be a drug trafficking center." For his part, Jose Luis Ovalle, the Free Trade Zones national director, said this document is almost one month old. This information has been picked up from the press, he said, adding that the entire issue is inaccurate. [passage omitted]
