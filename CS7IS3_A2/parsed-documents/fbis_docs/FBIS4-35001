Meanwhile, the State Prosecutor's Office has arrested 127 members of the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations [CEOIC] who have occupied seven estates. Constantino Kanter and the president of the State Federation of Small Rural Owners, Fidel Enrique Culebro Trejo, have confirmed they will stage a sit down protest in front of the Government Palace tomorrow to demand that the state and federal authorities clear at least 200 estates that have been occupied since the beginning of the armed conflict by Zapatists or CEOIC members. Laura del Carmen Mayagoitia Penagos, owner of the Granja de la Paz Estate in Simojovel Municipality, has announced she will start a hunger strike. Culebro Trejo said that even though they will not obtain positive results to their demands, they will avoid a confrontation with the Zapatists and the CEOIC squatters inasmuch as "this would be a mistake." In this struggle, we will defend ourselves legally. To this effect, Constantino Kanter has said the Zapatists have again started to collect war taxes for the mobilization of animals or traffic, which, in addition to the lootings, has increased uncertainty because there are no kinds of guarantees. Both men have said they will be joined in their protests by at least 1,200 Tzotzil, Tojolabal, and Tzeltal Indians who have fled to avoid being enrolled in the EZLN ranks. These Indians live in unhealthy conditions, even though they have homes in which to live, but these are in the area of conflict. Meanwhile, early this morning, public security officials and judiciary policemen began to clear out the seven estates that grow export products. They arrested 127 people and charged them with private property damage, association with criminal intent, and misappropriation. During the operation to clear out the estates of Ojo de Agua, Chiquita, Chacatelje Tobruc, Argelia, and Pinotepa, all in Mazatan Municipality, the authorities arrested 102 people and 25 others on the El Rincon Coffee Plantation. All of these individuals were turned over to the Attorney General's Office by State Prosecutor Arturo Becerra Martinez and Police Coordinator General Augusto del Pino Estrada. During the operation to clear out the estates, the police seized machetes and knives and destroyed rustic shacks that had been built of wood, palms, and plastic. The shacks had banners reading: "We demand respect for land occupations; CIOAC [expansion unknown], CNPA [National Coordinating Board for the Ayala Plan], CEOIC. We will win with the unity of the poor." According to a spokesman for the State Prosecutor's Office, the operations to clear out the estates were ordered following the charges raised before this office. The land and estates were returned to Rodolfo Flores Garcia, Rolanda Stivajet Corral, Roberto Fourzali Moises, Alfredo Sanchez Gomez, Pedro Rene Bodegas, and Bernardo Pholenz Krauze. Police Coordinator General Augusto del Pino Estrada has reported that to prevent further land occupations, special surveillance measures will be established in Mazatan Municipality to guarantee security. Hermino Verdugo Munoz, regional CEOIC leader, has advised if they have not received clear responses to their requests by tomorrow, they will take over the international bridges linking Mexico with the Central American Isthmus, and they will block entries to six municipal capitals of the coastal area.
