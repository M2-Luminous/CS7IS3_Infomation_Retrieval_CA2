At our request the director discussed one of the institute's most recent research studies--of the present state of the Ukrainian Army. [PESTI HIRLAP] Sir, why was your institute established? [Gazdag] The purpose of a research institute within a ministry's staff organization is to offer ideas and analyses to the ministry's political leadership, to demonstrate processes, and perhaps to prepare forecasts. It follows from the Defense Ministry's functions that we have to concern ourselves primarily with questions of national defense and security policy. In other words, the ministry's purview determines our work. Consequently, we are interested in all questions related to our country's defense and security and its system of relations with countries both near and far. We are studying particularly the questions of Hungary's security and also Central European, European, and global security. [PESTI HIRLAP] How systematic are your relations with the Ministry of Defense? How frequently does the ministry request analyses from your institute? [Gazdag] Regrettably, a system of bilateral relations has not yet fully evolved. We prepare annual research plans, which are approved, respectively, by all the main departments within the ministry and by the state secretaries. Thus we have an approved research plan that is based in part on the types of research the ministry needs; we also suggest certain research topics. To tell the whole truth, however, our institute was established in 1990; we first have to develop and deploy our capacities, and only then will this bilateral process be able to function. At present, the ministry itself often does not know what it needs. Despite the substantial investment, one can never be certain about the return on it. After all, our research results appear in long-term studies, analyses, and books. [PESTI HIRLAP] What is your budget? [Gazdag] We receive 20 million forints annually from the ministry, and our entire staff consists of 12 people at present. If we take into consideration that, since 1990, the ministry's budget has been declining gradually in real terms, it is conceivable that there will be changes at our institute within the foreseeable future. [PESTI HIRLAP] What are the institute's current research programs? [Gazdag] I think it will suffice to list our principal directions of research. The first principal direction is the evergreen topic of the defense of the Republic of Hungary. The second principal direction is the security of Central Europe and of Europe proper. Incidentally, we are now preparing a conference, and a large volume of conference reports, both to be called The Security of Central Europe 1994 [Kozep-Europa biztonsaga 1994]. New challenges, new dangers, and risks is what we call our third principal direction of research. We have to take into account that the world, or at least the immediate world around us, has not become any more secure, even though the bipolar system has disintegrated, the period of great military threats is over, and NATO and the Warsaw Pact are no longer confronting each other. Instead of the great nuclear threat, there now are many small but real threats. These threats involve many things that are not military factors, yet researchers must take note of them. The problem of refugees, for instance, also has security implications. Our fourth principal direction of research is the process of modernizing combat materiel and the structure of armed forces. Such research is definitely for the Hungarian Armed Forces. There is also a fifth, interesting and new area of research in which we are investigating the connection, the system of relations, between the armed forces and society. Research in this area became known in Hungary only a few years ago. Over and above the principal directions of research, each of my colleagues has a favorite research topic he likes to pursue. Andras Balogh, for instance, is investigating the relationship between minorities and security; a lengthy article of his on this subject appeared in VALOSAG not so long ago. Another colleague is investigating the psychological aspects of security-policy conflicts; he, too, published his results recently in what has become the well-known Braun report. Of course, we are also allowed to investigate topics that are not so prominently in the forefront of everyday thinking. Let me give you an example. Much as it is desirable for us to take part in European integration, it also raises many factors of uncertainty. Therefore it is our duty to investigate already now, for instance, what burdens would devolve on us from the realization of Hungary's strategic objective of attaining NATO membership. The average NATO country is spending 3 percent of its national income on defense, whereas Hungary is spending merely 1.6 or 1.7 percent. Which means that we would have to at least double our military budget if we wanted to upgrade the Hungarian Armed Forces ideally to NATO standards. [PESTI HIRLAP] Is the distribution of your institute's studies and reports restricted to the Ministry of Defense, or do members of the opposition also have access to them? [Gazdag] Members of the National Assembly's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committees, and central agencies receive our reports by virtue of their office. Upon request, we gladly make our research results available to the expert of any party, regardless of his party affiliation. At the moment we are distributing our publications free of charge to officials on our distribution list, but we are also planning to make our publications available for sale to the interested public. As an example, let me mention that, with the help of NATO's Information Department, we recently published the NATO manual that explains how NATO functions. The manual was so successful that we have decided to print a second edition, but we will be charging a small fee for its copies, instead of distributing them free of charge. [PESTI HIRLAP] What are your relations like with other institutions of the Hungarian Armed Forces and with civilian research institutes at home and abroad? [Gazdag] Research work is interactive. When someone discovers something, he is in contact with very many people and is working in a system of constant feedback. Most of my colleagues are teaching at universities, both civilian and military ones. We regard the Hungarian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense as our customers whose requests we try to satisfy as comprehensively as possible. We like to rely on the work of our partner institutes, primarily on the Foreign Affairs Institute and the World Economy Research Institute. Our relations are outstanding with similar institutes in the neighboring countries. We often receive guest researchers; most recently, for example, we had colleagues visiting us from Poland. [PESTI HIRLAP] To our knowledge, members of your institute visited Ukraine recently. What experience have they gained there? [Gazdag] There are very many forms of cooperation, including the mutual exchange of research materials, analyses, and studies. Last fall, for instance, a delegation of the Ukrainian General Staff's Scientific Directorate came to our country for consultations lasting several days. In return, Hungarian security policy experts were invited to Kiev for discussions, on 26 through 28 April. Representing our institute, Colonel Dr. Laszlo Nagy was a member of the Hungarian delegation. Besides meetings with the official Ukrainian delegation, he held talks also with the heads of the International Research Institute of Regional and Global Security and with the military-policy adviser to the Ukrainian minister of defense. During the consultations, our experts gained much valuable information on Ukraine's security policy and the state of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. They established that Ukraine is in an extremely difficult situation. The recession, inflation, insolvency, and dependence on Russia are very serious. Yet our partners in the consultations were a bit more optimistic than a year ago. They told us that the recession had bottomed out in some areas and that the country had not collapsed under the successive crises. The rate of inflation has slowed slightly. The parliamentary elections took place without any serious disruptions, and four-fifths of the 450 seats have been filled. The institutions of public administration have become stabilized, and the legislative backlog has been reduced to some extent. Although disputes with Russia are continuing with undiminished intensity, matters have not come to a head, and there remains the possibility of a negotiated settlement for every controversial issue. Ukraine's international political assessment is improving, and its bilateral relations with the neighboring smaller countries are good. During the past two years and also at present, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been undergoing substantive reform, but the process is by no means a smooth one. The trouble started with Ukraine's inheriting a randomly grouped part of the Soviet Armed Forces that happened to be on Ukrainian territory when Ukraine became independent, rather than an integrated army that gradually evolved in the course of Ukrainian history, in organic unity with society. According to our Ukrainian partners, their concept of having to reform their inherited armed forces was a mistake. It would have been better to aim immediately for complete reorganization and reconstruction. This realization was two years late in coming; the euphoria of the initial period after declaring independence was not always accompanied by well-founded decisions, and a comprehensive conceptual plan was lacking. Work was hampered, for instance, by the decision that in 1992 the personnel of the Ministry of Defense could be brought up to only 50 percent of its original size. The strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces gradually declined, from more than 650,000 at the time of independence to about 450,000 at present. In addition to the Army, there is also a National Guard about 50,000 strong. On the American model, the National Guard is able to reinforce the police primarily in emergency situations, without actually having to deploy the Army itself. [PESTI HIRLAP] In the case of Ukraine, nuclear weapons pose a separate problem. [Gazdag] That is true. The trilateral agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in January, on Kiev's accession to the START I Treaty, has calmed tempers. Two shipments of nuclear warheads have already arrived in Russian since then, and Ukraine has received the promised fuel for its nuclear power plants. Kiev has undertaken to fully disarm itself of nuclear weapons, in accordance with the schedule specified in the START treaties. (In other words, Ukraine--unlike Russia--will not be retaining any nuclear weapons.) On the other hand, Ukraine is not yet willing to accede to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, although Ukrainian aversion to it seems to be diminishing. It is conceivable that Ukraine might revise its standpoint in the near future. Ukrainian policy on nuclear weapons, which is not always clear, has another aspect. In conjunction with the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow, there is a Ukrainian notion that appears to be spreading among military policy experts. It holds that only mediation by a third party could offer hope of any progress in resolving the controversial questions between Ukraine and Russia. The advocates of this theory would like to involve at all cost a third party in the dispute over Crimea and the Black Sea fleet. The ideal third party would be the United States; should it decline to participate, however, the United Nations or some other international organization could also come into consideration. This theory is dangerous in the sense that Ukraine might try to delay its nuclear disarmament in an attempt to persuade Washington to enter the Ukrainian-Russian dispute. Although the United States has categorically stated on several occasions that it would not let itself be blackmailed, the possibility cannot be excluded that Kiev might resort to the questionable method of a tie-in sale. Such a step would considerably destabilize relations primarily between Russia and Ukraine, which would not be indifferent from our country's point of view. Otherwise, Kiev regards as reassuring the development and existence of parallel European structures (the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, North Atlantic Cooperation Council, Partnership for Peace, etc.), but finds all this inadequate to offset Moscow's growing efforts at reintegrating the Soviet republics. Incidentally, Ukraine is the only associate member of the CIS beside the Commonwealth's 11 regular members. [PESTI HIRLAP] The information you have just outlined is merely of general interest at present. But how useful is all this to the SVKI? [Gazdag] It is very useful in our work, primarily in developing optimal conceptual plans for our country's security policy. I have already mentioned that the SVKI is organizing an international conference on Central European security, to be held in Budapest on 16 and 17 May. Perhaps the most important item on the conference's agenda will be a comparative analysis of the conceptual security policy plans of the countries within the region. I will cite merely one fact to illustrate how serious this conference will be: NATO Headquarters in Brussels, and also the Marshall Center--an American research base established in Germany last year--have already informed us that they would attend.
