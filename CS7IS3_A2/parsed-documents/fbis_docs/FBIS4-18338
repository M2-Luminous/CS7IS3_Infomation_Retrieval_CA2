After the electoral defeat, polemics are raging. Carmine Mancuso, who was reelected senator by a narrow majority, was asking for the "head" of the movement's regional coordinator, Pippo Russo. Antonino Caponnetto resigned from his post as chairman of the town council, although he still remains a councillor. In no uncertain terms, Mancuso accused Rete's coordinator and "some friends of his" of having used all means at their disposal to push him aside. "In the meeting of Rete's town councillors," Mancuso stated, "Russo said that I should be massacred politically; I was supposed to be a sacrificial victim, that has not been sacrificed." And again: "The day after my defeat, the Mafia would have liquidated me." These are heavy words which testify to the somber mood within Rete where, according to Mancuso, there are some "characters whom I know very well, who have proved they have no charisma and no personality, and who have boycotted me systematically." These characters "believe that democracy is made only of words, and are only aiming to get a seat, in order to wield more power. They must now step down." Mancuso's polemic and accusations, however, made no reference to [Rete Secretary] Leoluca Orlando and the Jesuit Ennio Pintacuda. Antonino Caponnetto handed in a long letter of resignation, in which he explained that "I have given matters a lot of thought before reaching a decision which is right and proper -- and is irrevocable, irrespective of any considerations on the outcome of the elections." Caponnetto said: "An irrefutable fact clearly emerges from all this: the determination shown by the majority of voters in excluding, from the new parliament, the men who are most representative of a commitment and a struggle which today more than ever must be pursued vigorously and resolutely -- men like myself, Alfredo Galasso, Claudio Fava, Gaspare Nuccio, Pina Grassi, and, in Milan, Nando Dalla Chiesa."
