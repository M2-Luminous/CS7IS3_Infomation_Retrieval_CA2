FR941216-2-00145 FR941216-2-00086 IV For the foregoing reasons, the NRC staff has concluded that the licensee's proposed increase of the 2-year time interval for performing the Type C Leak Rate Tests of the valves specified in the application until the Cycle 7 refueling outage will not present an undue risk to public health and safety and is consistent with the common defense and security. The NRC staff has determined that there are special circumstances present, as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such that application of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.3 is not necessary in order to achieve the underlying purpose of this regulation. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is, otherwise, in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants the Tennessee Valley Authority exemption from the requirements of Section III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 for Unit I as requested in the submittal. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant adverse environmental impact (59 FR 63387). This exemption is effective upon issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of December 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Steven A. Varga, Director, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30934 Filed 12&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
