The statement is included in a document prepared by the Coordinating Board of Peruvian Labor Federations, which is led by Teodulo Hernandez. The document, signed by Peruvian union organizations, states that the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) believes that the Peruvian Government "is seeking to compete with U.S. manufacturers by using a system based on an overworked, cheap work force." "This," the document adds, "is not a model compatible with the needs of a reasonable, productive trade integration." The document admits that these conditions could be brought to bear upon the Peruvian Government by recommending the suspension of duty-free imports of Peruvian products by the United States. [passage omitted] The U.S. Government could fall into the trap of pressing for the elimination of our labor reform by threatening to take retaliatory measures. The document notes that the USTR is expected to make a decision in June in which he could affect approximately $300 million worth of Peruvian exports. The document states that this could happen "unless the Peruvian Government makes substantive corrections in its policy toward trade unions." The document says that U.S. officials have received reports that "Peruvian union representatives" may have been "publicly threatened by representatives of the Fujimori government" with being "brought to trial before military courts and sentenced to life on charges of treason to the fatherland." [passage omitted] The Peruvian trade unions state that their demands are designed to bring about changes to "restrictions imposed upon the free action of unions in our country, or otherwise face the exclusion of Peruvian exports from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)." [passage omitted]
