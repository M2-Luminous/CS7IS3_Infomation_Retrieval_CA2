Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the terrorist, who wielded a Galil rifle and a copy of the Koran, called out God Is Great and fired at the troops. They fired back, critically wounding the assailant. Army and Border Police troops summoned to the site cordoned it off and launched an investigation. Three armed fugitives, members of the Fatah Hawks, were captured in an undercover unit operation in Gaza's al-Shaykh Radwan neighborhood last night. When captured, the fugitives had a Carl Gustav submachine gun and two handguns in their possession. Their detention was followed by riots in the neighborhood. IDF troops detained eight local residents who tried to prevent the arrests.
