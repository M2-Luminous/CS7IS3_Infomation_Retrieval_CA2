He said: The current congress will strive to accomplish the following tasks: 1) To implement conscientiously the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 2) To review and sum up Hubei's practice and experience over the last five years, and especially its experience over the last decade, since the reform and opening up; 3) To define clearly the future tasks and goals; 4) To elect a new provincial party committee and a new provincial discipline inspection commission; 5) To mobilize the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people in Hubei to further emancipate their minds; open up new vistas; forge ahead into the future; firmly grasp the current historic opportunity; vigorously press ahead with reform and opening up; push Hubei's economic development onto a new stage; and achieve the grand goal of having a comparatively well-off livelihood in Hubei by the end of the century. Guan Guangfu's work report was entitled "Emancipate the Mind, Grasp Opportunities, Vigorously Push Ahead With Reform and Opening Up, Strive To Attain the Grand Goal of Achieving a Comparatively Well-off Livelihood in Hubei at a Faster Pace!" It was divided into the following three parts: 1) A Review of Past Five Years; 2) Strategic Goals and Main Tasks for the 1990s; 3) Step Up Party Building and Improve Party Leadership. The work report contained approximately 25,000 characters. Reviewing Hubei's work over the past five years, Guan Guangfu said: Over the past five years, the broad masses of cadres and people in Hubei have implemented comprehensively the party's basic line; have acquired an in-depth understanding of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; have further emancipated their minds; have made constant efforts to explore, in light of Hubei's realities, new ways and means aimed at deepening reform, expediting development, and smoothly attaining the strategic goal of making Hubei rise in central China; have persistently deepened all reforms; have further expanded opening up to the outside world; have gradually accelerated the pace of economic development; and correspondingly have improved people's livelihood. Over the past five years, party committees at all levels in Hubei have grasped persistently and simultaneously the two key aspects of work; have taken the overall situation into account; and have united and guided the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people in unswervingly forging ahead and constantly opening up new vistas. After fully affirming Hubei's achievements in four main sectors in the last five years, Guan Guangfu stated: Now that the entire country is accelerating the pace of reform and opening up, and now that many fraternal provinces and municipalities are accelerating their economic development, we face increasingly keen market competition. Should we fail to accelerate our own development, we soon will find ourselves lagging behind. In view of this situation, we should strive to develop a sense of crisis, of urgency, of historical responsibility; we should seize each and every opportunity; accelerate development; catch up with and overtake others; safeguard Hubei's position as a strong industrial base; and live up to the ardent expectations of the more than 50 million diligent and talented Hubei people. Guan Guangfu maintained that Hubei's practice over the past five years has fully attested to the great importance of adhering to the party's basic line under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should work in a creative manner and in light of Hubei's realities. Speaking specifically, we should focus on the following six work aspects: 1) To vigorously step up theoretical study and ideological transformation and to constantly emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts; 2) To more clearly understand that development is the last word [fa zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810] and to unswervingly unify speed, efficiency, and reserve strength; 3) To deepen reform, expand opening up, and build a socialist market economic structure in a more expeditious manner; 4) To make overall arrangements and constantly optimize Hubei's train of thought and strategic layout; 5) To continually allow overall policies to create a micro-atmosphere and bring into full play the enthusiasm and creativity of all areas and all quarters; 6) To carry out party building successfully and to grasp both key aspects of work firmly and at the same time. Speaking of Hubei's strategic goals and main tasks for the 1990s, Guan Guangfu observed: In the 1990s, Hubei should strive to attain the following 11 basic goals: 1) To maintain average annual gross national product growth at or above 9.2 percent; 2) To gradually push economic growth onto three new stages; 3) To have tasks outlined in the province's eighth five-year plan fulfilled by 1994 -- one year ahead of schedule; 4) To have gross national product quadrupled by 1997 -- three years ahead of schedule; 5) To raise gross national product to more than 200 billion yuan on the basis of constant prices recorded in 1990; 6) To rapidly raise total rural social output value, industrial output value, and tertiary industrial output value; 7) To raise the technical and equipment level of all major trades and professions to or near the country's advanced level; 8) To strengthen overall scientific and technological capacity by a large margin; 9) To have nine-year compulsory education basically implemented, juvenile illiteracy eradicated, and labor quality comprehensively improved across the province; 10) To extend afforestation and improve the ecological environment to a great extent; 11) To raise the net per capita income of peasants to 1,400 yuan, eradicate poverty in poverty- stricken areas, and raise the average net per capita subsistence income of urban residents by 6 percent or more annually. Guan Guangfu stated: In order to attain all grand goals set for the 1990s, we should make every possible endeavor to accomplish the following 13 major tasks: 1) To vigorously press ahead with all reforms; 2) To rapidly build a socialist market economic structure; 3) To expeditiously expand opening up to the outside world; 4) To energetically expand the proportion of the export-oriented economy; 5) To readjust and optimize the economic structure; 6) To improve the overall provincial national economic quality, as well as its structural efficiency; 7) To further perfect the province's regional economic layout by devoting more energies to developing and exploiting the Changjiang economic belt; 8) To comprehensively implement the strategy of developing Hubei by virtue of scientific, technological, and educational development; 9) To actively and persistently build socialist democracy and the legal system; 10) To firmly grasp both key aspects of work at the same time; 11) To step up socialist spiritual civilization building; 12) To conscientiously implement all basic national policies, such as family planning, land management, and environmental protection; 13) To constantly heighten people's living standards and improve the quality of their livelihood. Speaking of stepping up party building and improving party leadership, Guan Guangfu noted: Stepping up party building and improving party leadership are the key to enabling Hubei to enter the market economy orbit, to attain the desired economic construction goals, to consolidate and develop a lively political situation of stability and unity, and to promote two-civilizations building to a new stage. Thus we should make unreserved efforts to concentrate on the following nine work aspects: 1) To profoundly study the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 2) To build strong leading bodies,as well as competent contingents of cadres; 3) To step up the building of party style and clean government and resolutely further the anticorruption struggle; 4) To build strong party organizations, as well as competent contingents of party members at the grass-roots level; 5) To persist in the system of democratic centralism and strengthen vitality of the party organizations; 6) To strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work, and create a favorable social and public-opinion environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction; 7) Party committees at all levels in Hubei should adhere to economic construction as the center, take overall interests into account, and have the overall situation well in hand; 8) To strengthen unity within the party and among the whole people so as to consolidate and develop a patriotic united front in the new historical period; 9) To constantly improve work style, seek truth, and carry out work in a down-to-earth and thoroughgoing manner. Guan Guangfu concluded: As we are facing onerous tasks and shouldering heavy responsibilities in the 1990s, we should implement the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in an in- depth manner; mobilize the broad masses of party members and people in Hubei; work with one heart and one mind; constantly strive to become stronger; vigorously forge ahead into the future and improve work; firmly grasp the current golden opportunity; bring about a historic revolution with regard to reform and opening up, a great leap forward in economic construction, and gradual improvement of people's livelihood; strive to successfully fulfill all tasks laid down at the current congress; and greet the forthcoming 21st century with a new attitude!
