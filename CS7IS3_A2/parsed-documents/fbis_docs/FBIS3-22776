Armored Missile Train Lost in Perm Forests"] [Text] An abandoned rail-based strategic missile system has been discovered on the railroad tracks near Perm. The discovery by the group of Perm journalists headed by the department chief of the oblast newspaper MOLODAYA GVARDIYA, Oleg Andriyashkin, was the result of an investigation they conducted: The reporters' attention was drawn to the fact that electronic equipment intended for "defense purposes" had begun to appear on the local market, and then they found the RS-22. After the journalists contacted the leaders of the missile forces, the six-car train was placed under guard. Yesterday the KOMMERSANT-DAILY editorial staff learned the details of the incident. The Perm journalists reported to the KOMMERSANT-DAILY editorial offices that at the Kurya Station of the Perm Railroad they had discovered a six-car train which, they thought, contained an RS-22 rail-based strategic missile system. The rail-based RS-22 strategic system is better known as the SS-24. It is usually "disguised" as passenger cars or refrigerated cars. One system contains up to 10 strategic missiles with a target radius of up to 10,000 km. These systems were produced in Ukraine in Dnepropetrovsk. They have now been removed from production. At the present time they are still on combat alert. As the Perm journalist Oleg Andriyashkin told a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the reporters managed to freely enter two cars whose doors had been opened (nobody was guarding the equipment). The first of the cars was an electric power plant and the second was the main command post. The doors of the other four cars, which presumably contained missiles and missile fuel, were blocked. The journalists noted that there had been some looting of the equipment in the cars. Most likely it was not foreign spies who had found their way here but thrifty citizens of the country who were interested in the instruments, which contain gold and silver and other valuable metals. In Andriyashkin's opinion, saboteurs would not be able to use the missile system for its intended purpose. The danger came from the marauders, who could carelessly set one of the cars on fire. Similar railcars are to be found in any railway stop. Today, little remains of the "electronics" aboard the train.. As the deputy chief of the Perm Oblast administration, Yevgeniy Sapiro, told a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the missile system that was discovered is now being used as a training facility of the Perm Higher Military School of Missile Forces. Representatives of the training institution refrained from commentary, alluding to a leadership conference that was taking place at that moment. In the press group of the Main Commissariat of Strategic Missile Forces (RVSN) they said that they had no information on this question: "These missile systems are on combat alert and are guarded reliably enough." A worker of the press service of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, Vladimir Murashkin, said that the Federal Counterintelligence Service knows about the military school's written-off training train located at the Kurya station of the Perm Railroad, which contains training missiles with the warheads removed. From the standpoint of state security the system is of no special interest to foreign intelligence services--the American military were familiarized with similar missile systems not very long ago.
