The issue has been deliberated within government circles for some time, the sources said. The governing coalition has been under pressure to clarify the purpose of the tax in light of the rapid aging of Japan's population, they said. It is also being argued that a name change could help win support for raising the current rate from 3 percent, a move that is strongly opposed by the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest party in Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government. The idea has met with criticism from some people engaged in various welfare programs, who fear that the amount of tax collected under that name might be regarded as a ceiling for welfare spending.
