The letter says: Your foundation's 7 April letter "regarding holding consultations to handle the Qiandao Hu boat disaster" has been received. Regarding the issue raised in the letter, replies have been made in the 9 April statement of a responsible person of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office as well as in our association's 4 April letter and 6 April telephone conversations. The letter points out: The personal and property safety of the vast number of Taiwan compatriots are protected by the law when they visit their relatives, travel, invest, and participate in various exchange activities on the Mainland. Relevant authorities are putting in great efforts to find out the cause for the unfortunate incident of the "Hairui" tour boat accident. Your foundation and our association should consider the overall task of making joint efforts to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait as well as developing cross-strait relations. The two sides should rationally and calmly handle the relevant issue and not allow ARATS-SEF cooperation and the development of cross-strait relations to be affected. The letter says: In cross-strait exchanges, many incidents involving the loss of lives and property of Mainland and Taiwan compatriots have occurred. Our association has always paid close attention to this sort of issue. We suggest that ARATS and SEF hold talks after making necessary preparations. As for dealing with the aftermath of the "Hairui" tour boat accident, our association is willing to listen to your foundation's opinions, and convey them to relevant departments.
