Khmer Rouge Lieutenant General Sok Peab told reporters at a border site 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Aranyaprathet of fighting in Battambang and Bantay Meanchey provinces. He said the Khmer Rouge had received word that the government was preparing a major offensive for January 5-7, coinciding with the 1979 installation by Vietnam of a friendly government in Phnom Penh headed by Heng Samrin. The government has brought up personnel, heavy arms and tanks for an offensive in the northern and eastern border provinces, but Khmer Rouge forces are ready to counter the offensive, Sok Peab said. [passage omitted] Sok Peab reported fighting between Khmer Rouge and government forces in northeastern Cambodia, within 25 kilometers (15 miles) of the Thai border. Mortar and artillery fire could be heard at a great distance from the scene of the battles, he said. He gave no indication of casualties.
