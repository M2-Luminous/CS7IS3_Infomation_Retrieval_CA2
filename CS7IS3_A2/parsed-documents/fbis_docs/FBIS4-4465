"I say that the Indonesian Government will not resort to shock therapy, nor will we adopt a TMP (/tight money policy/) again," Saleh Afiff, coordinating minister for economy, finance, and development supervision, said after receiving World Bank President Lewis Preston at his office on Monday (21 March). According to Afiff, such measures would not be conducive to macroeconomic development and would tend to ignore the principles of caution. Thus, the government prefers safer measures to maintain strong economic stability. He admitted the current economic situation is difficult. "Our economy has been facing many challenges since early this year," Minister Saleh Afiff said. According to Afiff, unpredictably fluctuating oil prices and their downward trend are one of the challenges. Prices are expected to drop even further to $13 per barrel. The benchmark prices are set at $16 per barrel. Inflation in the first two months of 1994 was quite high at 3.01 percent. This means the government must keep inflation below 7 percent in the remaining 10 months. In addition, non-oil and non-gas exports -- especially textiles and textile products -- have experienced slower growth. The export of textiles and textile products grew by 2.8 percent between January and November 1993, representing 21.89 percent of total non-oil and non-gas exports. The figures were in fact higher than the previous year, but it is feared that this position may affect state revenues. Afiff further said that the growing appreciation of the yen against the dollar is the most serious situation. "The appreciation may increase our /debt stock/," Afiff said. He said that Indonesia's debt stock may increase by $3 billion if there is a 15 percent appreciation. Thus, Indonesia's current debt stock of $87 billion would swell to $90 billion if there is an appreciation of that proportion. This will, of course, be an extremely heavy burden because 40 percent of Indonesia's total foreign debts are in yen. This situation reminds us of the importance of maintaining self- reliance in development. We must reduce the role of foreign loans as much as possible, although the government has been able to manage the foreign loans. Loans received by the government -- 60 percent of total foreign loans -- are divided into three categories. 1) Soft loans repayable in 25 years with annual interest of 3 percent. These loans are arranged through the CGI [Consultative Group for Indonesia]. 2) Loans in the form of export credits repayable in 20 years with annual interest of 7 percent. 3) Commercial loans repayable in at least five years at market interest. "The government has been able to manage the three kinds of loans. It is rather difficult, however, to manage foreign loans obtained by the private sector," Afiff said. The private sector is currently expected to play a major role in development. As such, the government does not prohibit the private sector from seeking foreign funds. The government merely asks that they refrain from seeking excessive loans. Regardless of the current situation, the World Bank has praised Indonesia's economic policy, especially the one taken in 1993. World Bank President Lewis Preston praised strategic measures such as the various deregulation packages, which he said had relaxed the TMP and overcome other obstacles. In addition, inflation has been kept below 10 percent.
