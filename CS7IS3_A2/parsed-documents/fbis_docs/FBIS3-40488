Since it was the first meeting after the formation of the coalition administration, MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and the heads of the electric power industry met to discuss future issues concerning nuclear power facility siting. In addition to Minister Kumagai, attending from the MITI side were both parliamentary vice-ministers (Sadao Wada and Motohiko Endo), Agency of Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) Director General Tomio Tsutsumi and Deputy Director General Yasuo Hayashi. The electric power industry side was led by Kohei Abe, chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPCO), and included presidents of all the electric power companies from Hokkaido to Okinawa as well as the Japan Atomic Power Company and the Electric Power Development Company. In his opening statement, Minister Kumagai emphasized the importance of environmental and other problems and, maintaining that the coalition administration will continue the fundamental policy, stressed that ``Promotion of nuclear power generation is extremely important.'' Minister Kumagai also asked the electric power industry to make ``even greater efforts to ensure safety and to gain the understanding of the local population in the work of promoting nuclear energy.'' He also expressed the thinking that ``It is important to promote the nuclear fuel cycle on the basic premises of peaceful use of nuclear energy and the ensuring of safety.'' In response, FEPCO Chairman Abe stated that the industry side would ``work on the best mix of electric power resources,'' and explained the status of progress on the nuclear fuel cycle. The electric power company presidents individually reported on the status of electric power resource sitings, especially for nuclear power generation, and requested more support for regional promotion.
