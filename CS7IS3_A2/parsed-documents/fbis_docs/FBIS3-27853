The lawsuit, filed with the Tokyo District Court, also demands the mass-circulation daily publish an apology. The written petition of the suit said the reports libeled Kajiyama, 67, an LDP House of Representatives member, and were detrimental to his credibility. On January 9, the ASAHI SHIMBUN carried a front-page story that Mitsui Construction Co. gave 10 million yen to Kajiyama to gain his influence in obtaining a public works contract. The money was handed over around the spring of 1991 after a Kajiyama representative allegedly asked then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi to favor Mitsui Construction in bids for a 25 billion yen dam project, the article said. The ASAHI said Takeuchi, 76, related the transaction to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, which is investigating a series of scandals involving politicians and general contractors over public works projects. Mitsui Construction asked the Kajiyama side to exert influence on the governor so that the dam contract would be awarded to the company, the report said. Also on January 14, the paper reported that prosecutors began questioning executives of Mitsui Construction in connection with the suspected payment to Kajiyama. Lawyers for Kajiyama released a statement Monday that he never requested nor received money from the Tokyo-based construction firm. Kajiyama himself will soon hold a press conference to prove his innocence on the issue, his office said. The lawyers also criticized the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office for leaking false information to ASAHI SHIMBUN reporters. According to the lawyers, Kajiyama has decided not to file a complaint against the prosecutors office over the alleged leak, saying the case will not be investigated fairly. Tetsuzo Hori, head of the City News Department of the ASAHI's Tokyo headquarters, said the reports are based on sufficient coverage and the paper is confident they are true. Kajiyama, elected eight times since 1969 from Ibaraki Prefecture's No. 2 Constituency where the dam is to be built, has served as home affairs minister, international trade and industry minister, and justice minister. For two years from December 1990, Kajiyama was the LDP's chief parliamentary strategist as chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee. He later served as LDP secretary general between December 1992 and last August. Takeuchi was indicted last year for allegedly taking a total of 95 million yen in bribes from major contractors Hazama Corp., Shimizu Corp., Kajima Corp. and Tobishima Corp. A former vice president of Mitsui Construction is on trial for allegedly giving a 10 million yen bribe to former Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii.
