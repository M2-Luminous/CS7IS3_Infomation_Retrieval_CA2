FR940825-1-00050 FR940825-1-00008 Executive Order on The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the provisions of this proposed rule, while affecting the composition and well-being of families, are strictly the result of the statute that imposes the restriction. The only families upon whom the statute and the rule have an impact are those containing individuals with ineligible immigration status who are not receiving the benefit of assisted housing, or whose continued receipt of assisted housing is not necessary in order to avoid the division of the family. However, even for families that contain members with ineligible status, the rule strives to maintain the unity of the family under the regulatory provisions concerning special assistance to mixed families. Regulatory Agenda This proposed rule was listed as sequence number 1525 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20433), under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
