When massacres like the one in Hebron take place, it means that there is increasingly less room for talks and then all hopes will vanish." Faysal al-Husayni does not hide his pain and anger. "What happened," he stressed, "is horrible not only because of the size of the massacre. Hundreds of unarmed people were there to pray and had entrusted themselves to the protection of the Israelis. The result is there for everybody to see. Now, do not tell me that this was the isolated act of a 'madman': It would be an offense against common sense and an insult to the memory of the victims. The evidence that we have collected is clear-cut: More than one person fired, an authentic commando that acted with lucidity and that had planned the criminal act." [De Giovannangeli] At such a dramatic moment, what requests are you making to the Yitzhaq Rabin government? [Al-Husayni] Words of condemnation do not help. Concrete acts that demonstrate the real willingness of the Israeli authorities to strike at the extremist colonists and the extreme right-wing Jewish groups are needed. We are asking for the immediate opening of an inquiry that will not merely shed full light on who the executors and the instigators of the massacre are, but that will also ascertain the responsibility of the Israeli military authorities who had to guarantee safety in holy places. This is only the first step; it should be followed immediately by others... [De Giovannangeli] Which? [Al-Husayni] Israel must acknowledge without reserve that the colonist movement is now a paramilitary organization that has chosen terrorism as its tool of political action. We are asking Rabin to ban these groups and to arrest the leaders who in these years, and even after the Washington accords, have acted undisturbed, openly disseminating proclamations of war, and organizing authentic "Arab manhunts." We are saying to the Israeli prime minister: Any further hesitation in acting against the terrorists of the settlements, any further postponement in the implementation of the Washington accords, could definitively cancel the positive things that have been constructed over the past months. [De Giovannangeli] Is a ban on extremist groups sufficient to save the negotiations? [Al-Husayni] It is the minimum condition, a basis for facing the issue in depth: the dismantling of Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank. Rabin has always wanted to postpone discussions on this point, which is decisive for achieving real peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. After the Hebron massacre any delay in resolving this problem would sound like an objective act of complicity with the extremists. We know well that not all the colonists are terrorists, but we also know that -- and this fact certainly does not escape the Jewish military authorities -- that the settlements have now been transformed into operational bases for Israeli paramilitary groups: It is where they train themselves, it is where they keep large quantities of weapons. For this reason the settlements should be dismantled already during the transition phase. It is the mere presence of the colonists in the territories that creates tension and fuels violence. [De Giovannangeli] In which terms does the Hebron massacre reintroduce the issue of safety in the territories? [Al-Husayni] Israel has always seen this problem from a unilateral point of view, like a fact that concerned its citizens only. And this definition has weighed heavily upon the Taba negotiations. Rabin deceived himself by thinking that he could get everything and the opposite of everything: The accord with the PLO and the support, or at least the non-ostracism, of the colonists that have always supported the nontransferability of "Judea and Samaria." On the other hand, the Hebron massacre bears witness to the impossibility -- which moreover was repeatedly denounced by the PLO -- of entrusting the safety and the life of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank to the Israeli troops. An immediate initiative by the United Nations is needed and in particular by the United States and Russia, the "cosponsors" of the negotiations on the Middle East: We are asking that the Palestinian population in the territories be placed under international protection until the withdrawal of the Israelis is completed. Only in this way can new massacres be avoided.
