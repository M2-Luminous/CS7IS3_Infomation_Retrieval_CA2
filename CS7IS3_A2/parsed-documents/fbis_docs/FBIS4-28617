The secretary said, "South Korea and the United States have already agreed on gradual sanctions, and it is wrong to interpret these gradual sanctions as appeasement or a retreat." Although the UN resolution would not be strongly worded, he added, it would involve practical measures against North Korea rather than carrying only symbolic meaning. "The UN Security Council also considered the Chinese position, among others, before deciding its course on adopting a resolution on gradual sanctions," he said. Reports that China would give military support to North Korea if war broke out on the Korean peninsula are based merely on rumor, he said. Russia has proposed an "eight-way conference" to solve the nuclear problem, but it is not a precondition for Moscow's participation in sanctions against North Korea, according to the official. "I don't think that Russia would oppose the UN Security Council resolution on gradual sanctions," he predicted.
