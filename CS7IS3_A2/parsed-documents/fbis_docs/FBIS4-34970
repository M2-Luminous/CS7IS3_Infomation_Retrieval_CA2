This statement was made today in the mountains by Division General Ramon Espinoza Martin, chief of the Eastern Army, upon concluding a tour of FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] military units and agrarian and livestock enterprises in Guantanamo Province. Div. Gen. Espinoza remarked that increases in military personnel and combat measures have recently been observed in the U.S. military enclave, where maneuvers were carried out early this month and where there has been an increase in the arrival of ships and aircraft. These movements may reflect preparations for a possible military invasion of Haiti. If this action takes place, it will worsen tensions in the Caribbean region, so FAR must be alert for any eventuality, Div. Gen. Espinoza said. The visit began at the Antonio Maceo Border Guard Brigade, which is in charge of protecting the line of demarcation with the Yankee base. The visitors were able to observe the high morale that prevails among the fighters, who each day become more alert and prepared to reject any aggression.
