Dr. Panya Sonkhom, the Director of the Department of Medical Sciences of the Ministry of Public Health, said that 116 water samples had been taken from the waterways which pass by the various factories in the Maptaphut and Laemchabang Industrial Estates and flow close to populated areas. The samples had been taken each month for 14 months [sic] from March 1991 to February 1992. They were analyzed for toxic chemicals which would be dangerous to the health of the people in these watersheds. The analysis did not find any PCB's in any of the samples, but lead was found in 37 of the samples or 31.7 percent, and mercury was found in 19 of the samples or 16.4 percent. Dr. Panya said that among the samples in which lead and mercury were found, there were samples which exceeded the standard for the maximum level allowed for waste water, namely, there was one sample with lead over 20 micrograms per deciliter, and there was one sample with mercury over 0.5 micrograms per liter. Even though this survey did not find any PCB's, a cancer causing substance, and found lead and mercury which exceeded the standards set in only one sample each, nevertheless the department would continue to check for toxic chemicals in the environment, and it had requested assistance on a continuing basis from other units involved to help keep track of environmental pollution in order to support the development of the eastern seaboard and to avoid health hazards for the people in this area in the future.
