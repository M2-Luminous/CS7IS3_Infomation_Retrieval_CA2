The source said that 47 Thai timber merchants have concessions in Burma but the Rangoon government decided last December to end them in a bid to save natural resources. The Thais have been hauling logs out but some fallen logs remain in the concession areas and it may not be possible to remove them by the deadline. The source added that Thai timber concession holders have submitted their proposals to remove the fallen logs, but the Burmese government is still considering them. [passage omitted] The Foreign Affairs Ministry source said that Burma's State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), in consultation with several ministries, has outlined the following policies on the timber trade: -- The government will extend timber trading until March for the fallen 4,777 logs as an exception in the Maw area within the Northeastern military command; -- The Forestry Ministry will exclusively carry out timber trade. The Forestry Department will report transactions to the government for which the forestry ministry will draw up a yearly reverse sales plan, decreasing sales by 50 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent respectively; -- The Forestry Ministry will also oversee all timber production within Burma, shutting out local and foreign private enterprises; -- Internal timber trading and will be done on tender basis [as published]; -- Cooperatives and private enterprises will not be allowed to export timber but will be allowed to process and export wood products; -- People holding stakes in joint ventures will also be able to buy timber under a tender system based on current prices abroad; -- The military will not be allowed to deal in timber trading; -- Cooperatives and private enterprises will be encouraged to produce processed wood for export.
