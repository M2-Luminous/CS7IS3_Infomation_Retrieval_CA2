The province's specialities industry earned a total of 3.83 billion yuan last year, some 25 percent of the total output value of its farming sector. Jilin has a good climate for growing some 20 special products, including ginseng, mushrooms, flowers, fruits, vegetables, frogs, silk and herbs. Over the past few years, it has built 1,207 frog-raising centers, with a total output of 680 million frogs worth 300 million yuan. The areas for growing fruit trees, ginseng and flowers have doubled or tripled. Some four major growing projects, including fruit trees and vegetables, have earned three billion yuan. About 1.3 million households in the province have developed the "courtyard economy", under which farmers make money by selling special products they grow in their courtyards or gardens. This added 1.1 billion yuan to the farmers' pockets. In Tonghua City, a ginseng home, as it is called by many, the cash crop planting area last year reached 40,000 hectares, with the output value totalling 2.4 billion yuan. The income of 150,000 farmer households increased by 600 yuan. Farmers in Fusong County also exported a wild herb to countries such as Japan, raising their per capita income by 100 yuan last year.
