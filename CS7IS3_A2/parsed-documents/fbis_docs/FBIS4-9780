Maneuvers included loading, unloading, launching mines, and accurately mapping the bay's minefields, which shows what resources the Cuban people's naval units have to counter a possible military blockade and the systematic deterioration of the bay. The maneuvers, which involved embarkment, cruising, attack, and operations against enemy mines were described as positive, as were the organization, discipline, and interest shown by the sailors of the outstanding municipality of Nuevitas. Camaguey was able to host this meeting as a result of having obtained, for seven consecutive years, first place in the emulative competition of the Eastern Army's naval command and the zone of operations in question. The exercise showed that the people of Camaguey are capable of thwarting any enemy action against our coasts.
