FR941025-0-00026 FR941025-0-00005 To prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) For airplanes on which the sync-lock installation [specified in paragraph (b) of this AD], sync-lock wiring modification [specified in paragraph (c) of this AD], or Production Revision Record (PRR) 35105 has not been accomplished: Within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 hours time-in-service, perform adjustments and tests of the thrust reverser system that are specified in Section 78&hyph;31&hyph;00 of the Boeing 737 Maintenance Manual to verify proper operation of the thrust reverser system, in accordance with that section of the maintenance manual. If any discrepancy is found, prior to further flight, accomplish either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this AD. (1) Repair any discrepancy found, in accordance with procedures described in the Boeing 737 Maintenance Manual. Or (2) Deactivate the associated thrust reverser in accordance with the existing provisions and limitations specified in the Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL). (b) For airplanes on which the sync-lock feature was not installed during production or as a modification in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;78&hyph;1053, dated December 17, 1992: Within 5 years after the effective date of this AD, install an additional thrust reverser system locking feature (sync-lock installation) in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;78&hyph;1053, Revision 1, dated July 1, 1993; Revision 2, dated February 17, 1994; or Revision 3, dated June 30, 1994. Installation of the additional locking feature constitutes terminating action for the tests required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (c) For airplanes listed in Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;78&hyph;1058, dated July 1, 1993: Within 5 years after the effective date of this AD, modify the sync-lock wiring in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;78&hyph;1058, dated July 1, 1993; Revision 1, dated February 17, 1994; or Revision 2, dated July 7, 1994. Modification of the sync-lock wiring constitutes terminating action for the tests required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (d) At the times specified in paragraph (e) of this AD, accomplish the ``Thrust Reverser Sync-lock Integrity Test'' specified below to verify that the sync-locks are not failing in the unlocked state. If any discrepancy is found, prior to further flight, accomplish paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this AD. (1) Repair any discrepancy found, in accordance with procedures specified in the Boeing 737 Maintenance Manual. Or (2) Deactivate the associated thrust reverser in accordance with the existing provisions and limitations specified in the MMEL. The sync-locks installed on the deactivated thrust reverser must remain operational. ``Thrust Reverser Sync-lock Integrity Test 1. General A. Use this procedure to test the integrity of the thrust reverser sync-locks. The procedure must be performed on each engine. 2. Thrust Reverser Sync-Lock Test A. Prepare for the Thrust Reverser Sync-Lock test. (1) Do the steps that follow to supply power to the thrust reverser system: (a) Make sure the thrust levers are in the idle position. (b) Make sure the thrust reversers are retracted and locked. (c) Make sure these circuit breakers on the P6 circuit breaker panel are closed: (1) Engine 1 thrust reverser cont sys (2) Engine 2 thrust reverser cont sys (3) Engine 2 thrust reverser cont sys-alt (4) Engine 1 thrust reverser ind sys (5) Engine 2 thrust reverser ind sys (6) Engine 1 Sync-lock (7) Engine 2 Sync-lock (8) Engine 2 Sync-lock-ALTN (9) Landing gear air/gnd relay and lights (10) Radio ALTM&hyph;2 (d) Make sure this circuit breaker on the P18 circuit breaker panel is closed: (1) Radio ALTM&hyph;1 (e) Supply electrical power. (f) Remove pressure from the A (for the left engine) or B (for the right engine) hydraulic system. B. Do the thrust reverser sync-lock test. (1) Move and hold the manual unlock lever on the upper actuator on both thrust reverser sleeves to the unlock position. (2) Make sure the thrust reverser sleeves did not move aft. (3) Move the left (right) reverse thrust lever up and rearward to the reverse thrust position. (4) Make sure both thrust reverser sleeves move aft (approximately 0.15 to 0.25 inch). (5) Release the manual unlock lever on the upper actuators. Warning: Make sure all persons and equipment are clear of the area around the thrust reverser. When you apply hydraulic pressure, the thrust reverser will extend and can cause injuries to persons or damage to equipment. (6) Pressurize the A (B) hydraulic system. (7) Make sure the thrust reverser extends. (8) Move the left (right) reverse thrust lever to the forward and down position to retract the thrust reverser. C. Put the airplane back to its usual condition. (1) Remove hydraulic pressure. (2) Remove electrical power. D. Repeat the thrust reverser sync-lock test on the other engine.''
