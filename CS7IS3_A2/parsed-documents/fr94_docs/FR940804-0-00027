FR940804-0-00027 FR940804-0-00012 Before the Memphis and Shelby County area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled the applicable requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for O 3 nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Memphis and Shelby County area is classified as marginal (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.334). The State of Tennessee submitted their request for redesignation of the Memphis and Shelby County area prior to November 15, 1992. Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the State of Tennessee must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c) and 176, and the requirements of subpart 2 of part D, which became due on or before November 12, 1992, the date the State submitted a complete redesignation request. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) to mean that, for a redesignation request to be approved, the State must have met all requirements that became applicable to the subject area prior to or at the time of the submission of the redesignation request. Requirements of the CAA that come due subsequent to the submission of the redesignation request continue to be applicable to the area ( see section 175A(c)) and, if the redesignation is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements. B1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172. Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator but no later than three years after an area is designated as nonattainment. EPA had not determined that these requirements were applicable to classified O 3 nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1992, the date that the State of Tennessee submitted a complete redesignation request for the Memphis and Shelby County area. Therefore, the State of Tennessee was not required to meet these requirements for purposes of redesignation. Upon redesignation of this area to attainment, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions contained in part C of title I are applicable. On June 24, 1982, the EPA approved the State of Tennessee's PSD program (47 FR 27269). B2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Plan Provisions. Section 176(c) of the CAA requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by states must be consistent with federal conformity regulations that the CAA required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the state revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's ``General Preamble for the Implementation of title I'' informed states that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)). The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993, (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993, (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that states adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of Tennessee is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, Tennessee is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation request. B3. Subpart 2 of Part D. Under section 182(a)(2)(A) areas that retained a designation of nonattainment for O 3 under the amended CAA and that are classified as marginal or above were required to fix their pre-amendment VOC RACT SIPs. Tennessee submitted the VOC RACT fixups for purposes of redesignating the Memphis and Shelby County area. These were published in the Federal Register on April 18, 1994, and became effective on June 17, 1994. Under section 182(b), several requirements were due for marginal O 3 nonattainment areas on November 15, 1992, such as VOC RACT catch-ups, Gasoline Vapor Recovery, New Source Review, and Emission Statements. Tennessee failed to submit these measures for the Memphis and Shelby County area. On January 15, 1993, EPA made a finding of failure to submit these measures by letter from Patrick M. Tobin, Acting Regional Administrator, to Ned McWherter, Governor of Tennessee. However these requirements are not applicable for purposes of considering the State's redesignation request. For purposes of redesignation, EPA must consider whether the State has met all requirements that were applicable prior to the time the state submitted the redesignation request. Since Tennessee submitted the redesignation request for Memphis and Shelby County on November 12, 1992, these measures are not relevant for purposes of redesignation. Therefore, all subpart 2 requirements that were applicable at the time the State submitted its redesignation request have been met. The VOC RACT fixups and the Alternate Emission Standards were published in the Federal Register on April 18, 1994, and were effective on June 17, 1994. The PSD regulations were approved on June 24, 1982. 3. The Area Has a Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the CAA Based on the approval of provisions under the pre-amended CAA and EPA's prior approval of SIP revisions under the amended CAA, EPA has determined that the Memphis and Shelby County area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above.
