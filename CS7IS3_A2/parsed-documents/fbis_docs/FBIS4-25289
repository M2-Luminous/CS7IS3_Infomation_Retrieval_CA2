The visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic exchanges as the U.N. Security Council considers implementing sanctions on North Korea over its suspected nuclear development program. Han's two-day visit will officially start with an 8 a.m. breakfast with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. North Korea, suspected of building a secret nuclear weapons program, has refused international inspections of its experimental nuclear reactor, thus violating the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of which it is a signatory. On Tuesday, North Korea's army Chief of Staff Choe Kwang met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in what was believed to be a meeting concerning the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, South Korea's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY quoted Han as saying in New York on Tuesday that North Korea will be unable to avoid Security Council sanctions if it fails to change its stance on the nuclear issue. Han, speaking to South Korean reporters shortly before leaving New York for Beijing, reportedly said the situation surrounding the nuclear dispute could change for the better within days if Pyongyang cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the issue of nuclear inspections. "If not, North Korea could not avoid U.N. economic sanctions," Han was quoted as saying. He said an overwhelming majority of Security Council members had indicated they are prepared to take strong action against North Korea, though a Council resolution would not come until after next week.
