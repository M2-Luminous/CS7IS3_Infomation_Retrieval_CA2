FR940913-1-00019 FR940913-1-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;06&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH (ECD) Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH (ECD) Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 series helicopters. This proposal would require a modification of the latches on the transmission and engine cowlings access doors. This proposal is prompted by five occurrences of an engine or transmission cowling access door becoming loose in flight. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the transmission and engine cowling access doors from opening in flight, being struck by the main rotor blade, and subsequently, separating from the helicopter and being ingested by the main rotor or tail rotor system resulting in a loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Comments must be received by November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;06&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from American Eurocopter Corporation, 2701 Forum Drive, Grand Prairie, Texas 75053&hyph;4005. This information may be examined at the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Samuel E.

Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;06&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298. Discussion This notice proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD), that is applicable to Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH (ECD) Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 series helicopters, serial numbers (S/N) 7001 through 7201. Since 1986, there have been five reports of the engine or transmission cowling access doors opening in flight which, in several cases, resulted in damage to the main rotor blades. The FAA has reviewed and approved MBB-Helicopters Alert Service Bulletin ASB&hyph;MBB&hyph;BK 117&hyph;20&hyph;104, Revision 1, dated December 8, 1989, that describes procedures for removing and modifying various latches of the access doors of the transmission and engine cowlings, installing new locks, and providing the cowlings, firewalls, and fuselage with appropriate mating components. Transmission and engine cowlings that open in flight can damage the rotor systems and, therefore, create an unsafe condition.
