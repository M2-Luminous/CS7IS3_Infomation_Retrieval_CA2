Another ceremony took place at the Asuncion mayorship wherein the Romanian premier was declared "illustrious guest" and was given the key to the city. The string of protocolar meetings included Premier Vacaroiu's attending a solemn session of the National Congress, the Paraguayan Parliament. The fact obviously came to the fore from these protocolar ceremonies that Premier Vacaroiu's current visit, the first at such a level made by a delegation from Central and Eastern Europe, represented an opportunity for the development of bilateral relations. Referring to the meeting between President Wasmosy and Premier Vacaroiu, the secretary-general of the Romanian Government, Viorel Hrebenciuc, who is accompanying the Romanian prime minister, said "the talks have proved the usefulness of the Romanian delegation's visit in assisting the Romanian businesses to penetrate these markets. Prime Minister Vacaroiu delivered to the Uruguayan President Wasmosy an invitation to visit Romania on behalf of the Romanian president. The meeting focussed on economic matters, opportunities of cooperation in various domains, especially power engineering and transport. Also, considering the very big Paraguayan deposits of phosphates and methane and the cotton resources, cooperation will be possible in chemistry, fertilizers, urea and ammonia, cement, light industry and furniture. The same forms of cooperation were referred to also during the talks of the Romanian ministers of industries and trade with their Paraguayan counterparts, who also analyzed the possibility of new multilateral actions. Paraguay may become for Romania a turntable to the countries in the region. It is a member of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South], an economic space counting over 200 million consumers. In this context, the opening is planned for next year of a Romanian trade office in Asuncion.
