This problem cannot be resolved simply by pre-treating the liquid, owing to the presence of abrasives, chiefly in the form of ferromagnetic particles. The latter cause wear and lower the efficacy of the systems. Analysis of the principles involved in the filtration of such liquids indicates that the most simple and effective solution to this problem lies in the use of fibrous filter materials which are also carriers of a magnetic field. However, the mechanism of filtering liquids have not yet been sufficiently studied. Similar materials have not been widely disseminated owing to the lack of an economically feasible technology for forming elastic fibers from magnetically hard materials. In the present work data are presented on the filtration characteristics of polymeric fibrous materials which are also sources of a constant magnetic field. The materials were formed from a polymer melt filled with a magnetic substance by drawing out fibers with the aid of a gas stream, fastening the fibers to a substrate with adhesive, and subsequently treating it in a magnetic field. A well known extrusion-filler technology for making sheet fibrous polymeric materials was ineffective. The filters were tested with a model working liquid consisting of a petroleum oil containing arizona dust (fine grained powder of known particle size distribution) and barium ferrite as artificial contaminants. Filtration characteristics were assayed by photometric analysis of the liquids. The tests showed that the filters cause only an insignificant drop in filtration pressure while performing an almost uniform degree of purification to the working liquid. Another area of effective application of fibrous magnetic filter materials lies in the treatment of industrial and municipal effluents. A feature of these systems is the significant concentration of iron-containing contaminants which cause direct and progressive corrosion and wear to equipment, buildings, etc. Figures 2; references 8: 6 Russian, 2 Western.
