Sowing is unprofitable this year, their leaders say. Bank loans are extortionate and the state does not buy your output. The renaming and reorganization of kolkhozes is not saving them from collapse. Meat and milk production is a loss-maker under current economic conditions. For instance, the "Ptitseprom" owes more than 10 billion rubles for mixed feed, and poultry factories are on the point of collapse. Requests from farmers for partial compensation for their expenditure and for concessionary rates for energy fall on deaf ears. The oblast administration considers its most important task to be not to ensure stable provision of home-produced food to the population, but to divide up the land, creating a huge number of landowners...with spades.
