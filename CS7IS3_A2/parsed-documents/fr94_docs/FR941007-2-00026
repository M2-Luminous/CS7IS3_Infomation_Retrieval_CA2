ACTION: Denial of a Scientific Research Permit Applied for by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (P45N). On May 19, 1994, notice was published (59 FR 26211) that an application had been filed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (P45N) to take listed shortnose sturgeon for hatchery and genetic research. Notice is hereby given that on September 2, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543), NMFS denied this application for the above taking.

This application was denied in accordance with and is subject to parts 217&hyph;222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. The application, letter of denial, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following offices, by appointment: Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226 (301&hyph;713&hyph;2322); and Southeast Region, NMFS, NOAA, 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702&hyph;2432 (813&hyph;893&hyph;3141).
