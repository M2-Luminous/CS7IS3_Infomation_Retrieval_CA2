Slatinski regrets that the institutions and officials directly involved in Bulgaria's foreign policy and national security have not shown the necessary coordination and have created an impression that there can be changes in this country's clear-cut and categorical policy. Bulgaria is in favour of a peaceful settlement to the crisis and has repeatedly declared a firm resolution for non-intervention in any form in developments in former Yugoslavia. It has appealed to all countries in the region to respond in the same way, the letter stresses. Slatinski believes that in this critical situation there can be absolutely no change in the Bulgarian stand. In his capacity as National Security Committee chairman, he expresses a personal negative view of the possibility of air strikes and believes no sensible Bulgarian politician would support such action. Slatinski asks the president to more decisively exercise his constitutional powers for the coordination and integration of efforts by political leaders, legislators and the executive to uphold the national position on the Yugo-crisis. First Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Gatsinski today briefed parliament's Foreign Policy Committee on the latest developments in former Yugoslavia and on Bulgaria's joining the Partnership for Peace Initiative. The committee decided to ask the President's Office to provide the text of the message by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to President Zhelev to familiarize the committee members with it.
