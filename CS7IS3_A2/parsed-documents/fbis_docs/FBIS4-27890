The spokesman said: The International Atomic Energy Agency recently published a communique to the effect that it did not call in question the discovery of a large amount of unaccounted-for plutonium in Japan. This fully reveals the partiality and irresponsibility of the agency. The agency claims that it had known the accumulation of a fabulous amount of plutonium "in the form of dust and waste" at the tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant of Japan. But facts clearly prove that it had been in the dark about it in actuality. According to a media report, when the South Korean authorities requested the clarification of the background of the discovery of the unaccounted-for plutonium in Japan on May 12, Japan herself admitted that 70 kg of unaccounted-for plutonium had been discovered at the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant. The donen (the power reactor and nuclear fuel development business), the operator of the Tokaimura plant, informed the ITAR- TASS on May 10 that the plutonium in question was discovered in April by inspectors of the agency during their scheduled inspection of the plant. The Japanese paper JAPAN TIMES said the agency would have never known that hidden raw material was being prepared in Japan for nuclear bombs, unless a secret report of the U.S. Nuclear Control Institute tipped it off about that. The director of the U.S. Nuclear Control Institute pointed out in a more explicit term that though high-tech facilities supervising the amount of remaining plutonium are installed in the plant, the inaccuracy of measurement is high and the amount of plutonium that might be accumulated in that course is fabulous and, in view of this, the agency cannot confidently declare that plutonium enough to make one or more nuclear bombs has not been diverted from the plant and the problem is that the agency's safeguards cannot detect the possible crafty divergence of plutonium at the nuclear fuel plant. Nevertheless, the agency, without so much as a proper explanation about the case, claims that it had known of the plutonium in question at the Tokaimura plant and it is now under its safeguards. We are quite surprised at this absurd claim. While maximizing and taking issue with a tiny amount of reported plutonium of the DPRK which was extracted for experimental purpose, the agency is zealously defending the ridiculous amount of unreported plutonium of Japan which is undeniably high in the possibility of diversion and, ignoring the demand of the world community for the clarification of the truth, refuted it off-hand with a sheet of communique. This irresponsible act has brought into bolder relief the partiality of the agency and its application of a double standard and makes us feel a stronger doubt as to its mission and credibility. By defending the case, the agency itself has, after all, given the strong impression that its inspection depends on political considerations. Since the case occurred when Japan has not definitely renounced its excessive stockpile of plutonium and, worse still, her nuclear armament has reached a practical danger line, the agency, true to its mission, must call it in question and discuss it at the board of governors and take a measure for an overall and strict inspection of all the facilities of Japan, thus dispelling the serious concern of the world community over the nuclear armament of Japan and her conversion into a military power. We will follow the move of the agency.
