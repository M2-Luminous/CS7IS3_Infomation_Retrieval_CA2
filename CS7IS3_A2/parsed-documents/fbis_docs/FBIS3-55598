Latvia will, however, seek possibilities to sign bilateral military cooperation pacts with the alliance's member states, like the Jan. 3 accord with Denmark, Kirsteins said. Kirsteins described as absurd a country's request for acceptance to the NATO while it is still occupied by a foreign army. The Latvian government received an official invitation to join the NATO summit in Brussels next week, which is scheduled to consider the participation of the East European states to the Partnership for Peace program. The Latvian army could act in the NATO framework regardless of its newness and poor ammunition, noted Kirsteins. Latvia would have the chance right after the projected Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion receives budget funding, and Latvia and Russia reach a final accord on troops' withdrawal, said Kirsteins. The Latvian army cannot expect the NATO to extend funds for the purchase of weapons unless the foreign troops are pulled out from its territory. Kirsteins staunchly rejected any possibilities for Latvia to cooperate with Russia in the military sphere because Russia was presently "the sole military force threatening to the Latvian security." As reported, the Latvian Foreign Ministry made a statement Jan. 5 urging the NATO to grant security guarantees to countries that expressed a wish to integrate into the organization. Latvia puts a foreign political priority on political and military cooperation with the NATO and its separate member states to get accepted to the alliance in the future, the ministry said. As reported, Lithuania officially asked for the NATO membership Jan. 4.
