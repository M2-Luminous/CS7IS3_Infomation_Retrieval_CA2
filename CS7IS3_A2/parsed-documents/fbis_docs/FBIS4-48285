Perhaps most influential among the juggler's assistants was Mandela's own organisation, with the ANC's highest body, the National Working Committee [NWC], insisting on retaining control over several key portfolios despite massive pressure from the National Party and Inkatha for him to relinquish them. Among the cabinet positions the ANC was determined to hang on to were those related to security, including the defence, police, and justice ministries, and land, key to the party's reconstruction development programme. ANC members have also been named as deputies in key ministries the party relinquished to their coalition partners. Said one cabinet insider: "We have a watchman in any ministry with relevance to the future." "Watchmen" include trade union heavyweight Alec Erwin as deputy finance minister to the Nat's [National Party, NP] Derek Keys, ANC legal advisor Penuell Maduna as deputy to Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Valli Moosa at Provincial Affairs under Roelf Meyer, which will be key in the development of the federal system, and Thoko Msane at Agriculture, which is headed by the Nat's Kraai van Niekerk. The ANC can expect to install a second level of "watchmen" when the directors general are appointed. These could include Cheryl Carolus at welfare, and John Samuel at education. Lawyer Nicholas "Fink" Haysom was reportedly offered the top South African Police position, but turned it down in favour of a counsellor's post in the President's office. The appointments of Winnie Mandela and Bantu Holomisa as deputies in the education and environment ministries respectively relates directly to their standing in the ANC. Mandela appears to have found it impossible to ignore their popular followings. Buthelezi's appointment to the Home Affairs ministry -- formerly Interior -- was criticised by Inkatha spokesman Ziba Jiyane as "the only substantial ministry we got". He said Buthelezi "was very hesitant right up to the last moment", but had told colleagues they could take cabinet positions if they wanted to. Buthelezi had argued in Inkatha for an opposition role, saying the ANC would use the cabinet as a "rubber stamp" for its own policies, "messing up the country" and then holding everyone responsible. But the opposite view that it was "important to have a foothold in decision making on things that affect people on the ground" prevailed, said Jiyane. Although the Home Affairs Ministry is regarded as a very senior portfolio and Buthelezi's appointment is a clear sign that Mandela intends to continue with his policy of national reconciliation, ANC insiders insisted the Inkatha chief would not be allowed to run future elections. Although this function has traditionally resided within the Interior Ministry, several senior sources said a permanent independent electoral commission would be established. The NP argued strongly for the defence, correctional services, justice, and police portfolios, saying the appointment of one or more senior Nats who enjoyed the trust of the security forces would smooth the transition. But the ANC's top committee was unwilling to relinquish the ministries, arguing that the NP's human rights record made it impossible to give them the justice portfolio. Similarly, reservations surfaced on the Nats' willingness to root out the "third force" inside the security forces. "They want the security forces to know right away who is boss," said one Nat source. Added to the equation was the ANC's intention of leaving General Johan van der Merwe in charge of the police and General George Meiring at the head of the military for the time being. They are seen as powerful leadership figures, particularly for white members of the security forces who need to be led gently to integration and transformation. Balance required ANC people to head these ministries as long as the old guard stayed in uniform, argued the NWC. While Sydney Mufamadi's appointment to head the law and order ministry -- renamed "safety and security" -- was almost universally welcomed within the SAP [South African Police] and the ANC, former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- spear of the nation, ANC military wing] commander Joe Modise's nomination to the defence portfolio was more controversial. Senior SANDF [South African National Defense Force] officers made their preference for Modise clear, but ANC members have criticised his endorsement of the generals' demands for an end to defence cuts. He has also not fully lived down criticism of his failure to prevent human rights abuses in MK camps in Angola in the 1980s. But Modise enjoys the loyalty of the MK hierarchy, many of whom can expect to take senior uniformed and defence ministry positions in the near future. His conduct of the integration negotiations and TEC [Transitional Executive Council] defence subcouncil have been positively received. The appointment of Inkatha's Joe Matthews as deputy minister of safety and security is both a concession to Buthelezi and a calculated strategy by Mandela, who is keen to show the kwaZulu Police that their long-term interests are best served by integration into South Africa's future security establishment. A former ANC member, Matthews is seen as intelligent and flexible, and ANC security experts believe it will be possible to establish a good working relationship with him. The ANC's insistence on retaining the main security portfolios -- correctional services ultimately went to Inkatha's Sipho Mzimela -- cost constitutional affairs expert Kader Asmal a key position as provincial affairs minister. The portfolio, vital to shaping the federal relationship between central and regional government, went to the NP's Roelf Meyer in return for Nat acquiescence on the security ministries. The land portfolio was almost lost to the ANC when the NP insisted on heading the agriculture ministry, which has traditionally included land matters. Mandela was reportedly preparing to withdraw his nomination of Derek Hanekom last Friday when the NWC stepped in. Saying the ANC was the only party with a coherent policy on land, and pointing to its central importance for the party's reconstruction and development programme, several NWC members insisted on splitting land and agriculture. Hanekom's nomination to the portfolio was also contentious, with some arguing that a ministry responsible for the emotive issues of resettlement, land redistribution and compensation should go to a black. Former ANC Women's League general secretary Baleka Kgositsile as mentioned as a possible minister. Although regarded as a political heavyweight, Kgositsile was felt to lack experience in land issues. Hanekom, whose expertise and struggle credentials are unquestioned, was championed by several NWC members. "Competence won out over political correctness," said one participant. Inkatha is understood to have had its eye on at least one senior security position as well as health and housing. The two departments are key to improving basic living conditions, and represent areas in which there is potentially much political hay to be made in the runup to the 1999 election. Recognising their importance, Mandela stuck to his original choices of Joe Slovo for housing and Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma for Health.
