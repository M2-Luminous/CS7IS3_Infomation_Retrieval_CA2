Regional Linkages Projects Project Objective The purpose of Regional Linkage projects is to support inter-state or multi-state partnerships that will expand the scope and enhance the effectiveness of technical assistance services regionally available to small and medium-sized manufacturers. Projects may be assistance service-led, or industry-led partnerships to provide assistance services that cross institutional and political boundaries. Assistance service-led partnerships, for example, can include shared assistance services that cross state boundaries, or electronic networking. Industry-led partnerships can include linkage activities between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers, creating a multi-state network of suppliers, program planning for multi-state assistance delivery, or other activities that improve the interactions between manufacturers.
