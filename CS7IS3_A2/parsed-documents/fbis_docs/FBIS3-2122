Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, who had just completed investigation and study tours in Hulun Buir, Hinggan, and Jirem Leagues, gave a report on his investigation and study activities to the responsible comrades of the autonomous regional party committee, people's congress, government, committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and pertinent departments, and gave opinions on the next step of efforts to deepen reform and accelerate development. In view of the reality in Inner Mongolia's reform and development, Comrade Wang Qun emphasized that all localities and departments should further emancipate the mind, seize the opportunity to increase dynamics of reform, and promote development through reform to realize a big leap in our economic construction in the new year. Comrade Wang Qun summarized his impression gained after the investigation as an excellent situation, but heavy tasks on a long journey. He pointed out: This year will be a crucial year for Inner Mongolia's reform and development. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we should comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th national party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, accelerate establishment of the socialist market economy system, and correctly handle the relationship between reform and development on the one hand and unity and stability on the other. He said: No work can be placed on a par with reform and development. Leaders at all levels should enhance the sense of reform and fully understand that only through reform can we have a way out. He pointed out: In Inner Mongolia's reform this year, new breakthroughs should be made 1) in deepening rural and pastoral reform, with the focus on establishing and improving rural and pastoral socialized overall service systems; 2) in the reform of industrial, commercial, grain, and foreign trade enterprises; 3) in the reform of financial and tax systems; 4) in the reform of banking, investment, and price systems; and 5) in institutional reform. Wang Qun pointed out: The key for state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises to transform the operating mechanism lies in strengthening leadership. Leaders at all levels should raise spirit, pioneer the way forward, refrain from procrastination and reliance on and waiting for the assistance of higher levels, and pursue development in the process of deepening reform. If leaders fail to update their concepts and if the operating mechanism and functions are not changed, enterprises' endeavor to get rid of difficulties will be merely idle theorizing. Comrade Wang Qun proposed that a leading group composed of leaders of the autonomous regional party committee and government be organized to strengthen the leadership over the reform of industrial and commercial enterprises and concentrate efforts on improving efficiency. The gap between Inner Mongolia and advanced areas should be narrowed as soon as possible through reform and development. Speaking on Hinggan League's establishment of a green food production base ahead of others, Comrade Wang Qun urged: To conform to the market economy system, the rural economy should undergo the transition from the past small-scale peasant economy and small-scale production economy to large-scale agriculture and the market economy. Based on market demands, cadres at all levels should provide favorable conditions for peasants and herdsmen to march toward the market, use market information to lead peasants and herdsmen to the market, and take the road of developing high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture and commercializing production. We should exercise integrated management of foreign trade, industry, and agriculture; make planting, breeding, and processing a coordinated process; adopt the farming and livestock breeding structure that coordinates agriculture, industry, commerce, technology, and foreign trade, which encourages enterprises to operation on as large a scale as possible and which suits market demands; and make use of local resources to develop the economy to turn advantages in resources into economic advantage. Leagues and cities should accelerate establishment of rural and pastoral socialized overall service systems, with the focus on towns, townships, and sumu. Township enterprises should diversify their structure and develop whatever conducive to economic development. After affirming the experiences in the reform of the three leagues in eastern Inner Mongolia, Comrade Wang Qun emphasized: Leaders at all levels should combine the endeavor of emancipating the mind with the scientific approach of seeking truth from facts and make an important step this year in the reform designed to establish the socialist market economy system. Enterprise reform should help invigorate state-owned enterprises, and agriculture and animal husbandry, foreign economic relations and trade, township enterprises, and nonpublic sectors of the economy should be promoted. We should select and send younger cadres of party and government organs who are competent and know management to the forefront of production and construction to help with the work or to assume posts in order to promote the economic development of all localities. Leagues and cities should coordinate improvement of grass-roots units with institutional reform, transfer and divert the personnel of administrative units and institutions to the fields of production and distribution in a well-organized manner, and raise office work efficiency. We should further strengthen party leadership and persistently attend to two tasks simultaneously and be competent in both to create a good and stable environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction. In accelerating banking, financial, and tax reform and stabilizing prices, we should follow the arrangements of the party Central Committee and the State Council, explore bravely, and adopt new ideas, new measures, and new methods. We should intensify research of policies to counter the new conditions and new issues in Inner Mongolia's reform and development, especially the issues closely related to people's life. We should implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth autonomous regional party committee. Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the autonomous region, gave a report on the investigation activities. Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and chairman of the regional government, and Qian Fenyong, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and chairman of the regional CPPCC committee, also spoke.
