FR940812-0-00009 FR940812-0-00004 The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 2,100 producers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes under this marketing order, and approximately 60 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period was prepared by the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of fresh Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. The Committee met June 7, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $99,879, $937 more than the previous year. Increases of $2,737 for salaries, $300 for telephone, $200 for postage, $500 for meetings and miscellaneous, and $200 for Federal payroll taxes will be partially offset by a decrease of $3,000 for reserve/auto purchase. The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.0026 per hundredweight, the same as each year for the past decade. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 32,000,000 hundredweight, will yield $83,200 in assessment income. This, along with $16,679 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the Committee's authorized reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period, estimated at about $60,000, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal period's expenses. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the fiscal period begins on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal period apply to all assessable Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
