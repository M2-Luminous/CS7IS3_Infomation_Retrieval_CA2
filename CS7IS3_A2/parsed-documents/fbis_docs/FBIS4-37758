This came in a statement issued by the party at the end of an ordinary meeting held today. The meeting was devoted to discussing the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan and the tragic events there as a result of the bloody armed clashes between the traitors and agents belonging to the humiliated Barzani and Talabani as well as the ongoing events in fraternal Yemen whose national unity is threatened with secession and apostasy. In its statement, the party emphasized that despite all the imperialist conspiracies and intrigues and the mean 30-state aggression as well as the subsequent traitorous and treacherous chapters--which have continued incessantly in the form of the continued blockade on the Iraqi people's Arabs, Kurds, and other fraternal nationalities--the Iraqi people, by virtue of their steadfastness and endurance, have managed to foil all forms, links, and chapters of the conspiracy and preserve their national unity with their heads high behind the banner of God is Great. This banner is carried with all vigor and loftiness by the unique President leader Saddam Husayn. In the statement, the party said that such traitors and agents as Barzani and Talabani are symbols of agentry and crime. The forces of the U.S.-Zionist evil and aggression deputized these agents to implement a subversive and criminal conspiracy against the Iraqi people after they failed to achieve their objectives during the brutal 30-state aggression and its successive chapters with the aim of isolating Iraqi Kurdistan from Iraq, the mother homeland. These forces also lured these agents into giving them a free hand in the region and fulfilling their sick dreams at the expense of the struggle, blood, and martyrs of the Iraqi Kurds who continue to be a true sword defending the unity of both lofty Iraq and its people as part of a unique autonomy. No Kurds in any world state have been granted such autonomy. The statement also pointed to the risks posed by the continued unfair blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. This blockade has gravely harmed the Kurds, exactly like other nationalities in Iraq., This harm threatens death as a result of the scarce food and medications in addition to the serious situation the Iraqi Kurds are experiencing due to the ongoing bloody fighting between the symbols of agentry; namely, the Talabani and Barzani groups [words indistinct] tens of Iraqi Kurds everyday. With regard to the ongoing events in fraternal Yemen, the KDP stressed the need to halt all forms of foreign interference in Yemen's internal affairs. The party described this interference as a grand conspiracy which is targeting Yemen's unity and which is not less heinous than the brutal 30-state aggression on the Iraqi people. The party renewed its support for the just legitimate and constitutional struggle which the fraternal Yemeni people are waging in defense of their national and historic unity against the secessionist and renegade forces.
