FR940314-0-00040 FR940314-0-00007 III U.S. EPA_Ventura County APCD Agreement for Delegation of Authority for Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations (40 CFR Part 55) The undersigned, on behalf of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (``VCAPCD'' or ``the District'') and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), hereby agree to the delegation of authority from EPA to VCAPCD to implement and enforce the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations (``OCS'') (40 CFR part 55) within 25 miles of the state's seaward boundary, pursuant to section 328(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''), subject to the terms and conditions below. EPA has reviewed VCAPCD's request for delegation and has found that VCAPCD's regulations meet the requirements for delegation set forth at 40 CFR 55.11. This delegation includes authority for the following sections of the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations: ␣ 1Section 1Title 55.1 Statutory authority and scope 55.2 Definitions 55.3 Applicability 55.4 Requirements to submit a notice of intent 55.6 Permit requirements 55.7 Exemptions 55.8 Monitoring, reporting, inspections, and compliance 55.9 Enforcement 55.10 Fees 55.13 Federal requirements that apply to OCS sources 55.14 Requirements that apply to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries by state. EPA is not delegating the authority to implement and enforce §§55.5 (Corresponding onshore area designation), 55.11 (Delegation), and 55.12 (Consistency updates), as authority for these sections is reserved to the Administrator. In addition, VCAPCD does not have SIP-approved PSD regulations, nor has it received delegation of authority from EPA for implementation and enforcement of the federal PSD program. Therefore, EPA shall retain authority for the PSD provisions of part C of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder at 40 CFR 52.21. Under section 328(a)(3) of the Act, EPA may delegate authority to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations to a state if that state is adjacent to an OCS source and the Administrator determines that the state's regulations are adequate. The State of California is adjacent to a number of OCS sources. For the OCS sources for which the Ventura County APCD has been designated the corresponding onshore area (COA), the State has submitted VCAPCD's regulations to EPA and requested that EPA delegate authority to VCAPCD to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations. VCAPCD's regulations have been reviewed by EPA and determined to be adequate for implementing and enforcing the delegable sections of 40 CFR part 55. The OCS regulations set forth the following criteria for delegation at 40 CFR 55.11: (1) The state has adopted the appropriate portions of 40 CFR part 55 into state law_VCAPCD adopted Rule 72.1, Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations, on December 22, 1992. This rule incorporates the provisions of 40 CFR Part 55 that EPA is delegating to the District. (NOTE: Section 55.5, corresponding onshore area designations, was adopted by VCAPCD but EPA will not delegate authority for this section, as provided by §55.11(a)). (2) The state has adequate authority under state law to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_According to the State Attorney General's January 12, 1993 letter which was forwarded to EPA, VCAPCD has the authority to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55. (3) The state has adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_VCAPCD has submitted information documenting that the District has adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55. (4) The state has adequate administrative procedures to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55, including public notice and comment procedures_VCAPCD's administrative procedures have been reviewed by EPA and found to be adequate. The following rules were submitted by VCAPCD for review to meet this requirement: Rule 8␣Access to Facilities (Adopted 5/23/72, renumbered 11/21/78) Rule 9␣Arrest Authority (Adopted 11/21/78) Rule 17␣Disclosure of Air Toxics (Adopted 4/17/90) Rule 25*␣Action on Applications (Adopted 1/10/84) Rule 26.7␣New Source Review (Adopted 12/22/92) Rule 29␣Conditions on Permits (Adopted 10/22/91) Rule 31␣Public Disclosure of Data (Adopted 11/22/77) Regulation␣VIII Emergency Action (Adopted 11/22/77) *District Rule 25 contains procedures for processing permit applications.
