According to an editorial in the 26 March edition of the same daily, "history clearly shows" that the "belligerence of [those engaged in] agriculture does nothing to promote sociopolitical stability or harmony," reminding the government at all levels that "it still has the time and tools available to respond" to the crisis. "The increasingly surly statements" by organizations representing Argentine agriculture and the "emergence of new movements with even more vehement protests" are a "clear sign" that many in the farming industry think that the difficulties they are suffering are "neither fully understood nor addressed by current economic policy," continued the LA NACION editorial. "It was obvious from the beginning," explained the editorial, "that the rules of the game on which the stabilization of the currency is based" would call for a restructuring of the agriculture industry, and that this restructuring would demand, "at the very least," adequate financing and tax relief, halting the erosion in the productive capacity of the industry, two requirements, which were "never met." Designed to better represent smaller producers represented neither provincially nor nationally, the newly created Buenos Aires Agriculture Front (FAB), according to the editorial, has vowed to "denounce the restructuring proposed by the government," saying it is "valid only for powerful industries." Argentine Rural Society (SRA) First Vice President Enrique Crotto is not afraid of foreign competition, reported the 12 March Buenos Aires daily LA PRENSA, "even from countries that subsidize" their products, as long as Argentine producers have access to the same "tools" as their competition, such as a long-range agriculture policy, comparable tax burdens, and internationally competitive credit, "none of which is within our reach." According to Crotto, the proposed wealth tax is equivalent to the former assets tax under another name and, although the government-backed Rural Mortgage Securities (CHR) sounded good when they were announced, no one seems to be able to explain why so few loans have been granted, in spite of all the promises. Argentine Rural Confederations (CRA) head Manuel Cabanellas has complained about the lack of regularly scheduled meetings of the National Agriculture Council (CNA), presided over by Secretary of Agriculture Felipe Sola, reported the 12 March LA NACION. The industry's four main organizations--SRA, CRA, Argentine Agrarian Federation (FAA), and the Agricultural-Livestock Intercooperative Confederation (Coninagro)--with representatives on the council, "consider it to be the natural forum" to address problems that plague the industry, such as indebtedness, high production costs, low international prices, the VAT (value-added tax), and the proposed wealth tax. According to the same 12 March edition of LA NACION, a recent report put out by Coninagro, entitled "The Cost of Stability," contended that the agriculture industry is making "extreme sacrifices" in the name of stability, while others, such as the automobile industry, enjoy trade protection. LA NACION of 5 March pointed to the decline in economic activity in the regional economies, which to a great extent revolve around agriculture. For that reason, continues the daily, it is no wonder the Confederation of Buenos Aires and the Pampa Rural Associations (Carbap), a grouping of 107 farming societies from the two provinces with approximately 34,000 members, has warned that it will "take to the streets," if necessary, to achieve the solutions the industry requires. The 19 March LA NACI0N added that the agriculture industry is "dusting off" threats of future protests. FAA President Humberto Volando at the Chacra Expo said that both the leadership and the producers in Coninagro, Carbap, and the FAA were talking about organizing a "large national protest" before the end of the year. "We're beginning to get mad," declared Eduardo de Zavalia, head of the Argentine Rural Society (SRA). On 31 May 1993, the SRA presented the government with a "Plan of Assistance for Restructuring the Argentine Agriculture Industry," reports the 26 March LA NACION. The SRA document warned about the crisis in the industry and proposed specific measures to stimulate credit, financing, production, and trade expansion, which the organization felt would facilitate restructuring. Recently, however, the SRA has "toughened" its stance, heretofore more supportive of government economic policy. The organization released a public statement criticizing the government for its "incomplete, late, and clearly inadequate" responses, reflecting a "lack of understanding" of the "seriousness" and "urgency" with which the industry's problems must be addressed (LA PRENSA, 23 March). The document also pointed to the "absence of valid alternatives," leaving farmers and ranchers increasingly "discouraged and angry, their just demands ignored, while special programs for other industries are implemented."
