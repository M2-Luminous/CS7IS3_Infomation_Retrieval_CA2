He has fought courageously. "He has been a man of dialogue" but he should have submitted to Congress a permanent reform and not a provisional measure on reducing cuts on taxes collected by states. The economic team is highly criticized. There are "philosophical conflicts among them" said the presidential adviser adding ironically: "You cannot put too many peacocks in one room because they are unable to show off their feathers." If Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso leaves the government, there will be chaos with an escalation of the inflation rate, falls in the stock markets, and recession. The Federal Revenue Department secretary "is good at collecting taxes" but because of ethics, he cannot be finance minister. The presidential adviser said: "He would not have sufficient elbowroom which would transform his administration into a permanent arm wrestling match with powerful businessmen." Professor Mario Henrique Simonsen's warnings to the effect that the stage in which the URV [Real Value Unit] will serve as the economy's leading reference index should be skipped are being studied. Accusations heaped on Congress over the last few days have been exaggerated. The finance minister's party [Brazilian Social Democracy Party, PSDB] is also blamed, especially [Ceara] Governor Ciro Gomes [PSDB] -- "an impulsive man." Moreover, the whole government is blamed for paying no heed to "the silent majority in Congress" made up by deputies who are totally ignored by ministers, even when the former's requests do not involve an increase in government spending. The blame for the passing of the decree on the agricultural debt is mainly laid on government leaders in Congress and parliamentary advisers. "No minister or president is omniscient. They must be kept informed by government leaders and advisers about projects that are of interest to the government."
