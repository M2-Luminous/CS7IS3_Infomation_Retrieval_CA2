FR940802-2-00114 FR940802-2-00059 A Conforming Products List (CPL) will be updated and published periodically. It will include a list of alcohol screening devices that were submitted with the proper certifications and found to meet or exceed the Model Specifications. One commenter requested that manufacturers should be permitted to commercialize their products as soon as they receive notification from NHTSA that their product has been found to meet or exceed the Model Specifications, rather than wait until the CPL listing their device is published. NTSHA intends to notify manufacturers that their devices meet the Model Specifications, and manufacturers may receive such notices and an evaluation report prior to the publication of a CPL listing their instrument. A decision about the point at which it would be appropriate for manufacturers to commercialize their instruments, however, is outside the scope of this notice. NHTSA intends to modify and improve these Model Specifications as new data and test procedures become available and to alter the test procedures, if necessary, to meet unique design features of a specific device. For each such modification, NHTSA would provide notification in the Federal Register and would retest devices when necessary. OASP is the point of contact for information about acceptance testing and field performance of devices. NHTSA requests that users of these devices provide both acceptance and field performance data to OASP when such data are available. Information from users will help NHTSA monitor whether alcohol screening devices are performing according to the NHTSA Model Specifications. If information gathered indicates that a device on the CPL is not performing in accordance with the Model Specifications, NHTSA will direct VNTSC to conduct a special investigation. An investigation may include visits to users and additional tests of the device obtained from the open market. If the investigation indicates that the devices actually sold on the market are not meeting the Model Specifications, the manufacturer will be notified that the device may be removed from the list. In this event, the manufacturer will have 30 days from the date of notification to reply. Based on the VNTSC investigation and any data provided by the manufacturer, NHTSA will decide whether the device should remain on the list. If the device is removed from the list, the manufacturer will be permitted to resubmit an improved device to VNTSC for testing when it believes the problems causing its failure have been resolved. Upon resubmission, the manufacturer must submit a statement describing what has been done to overcome the problems which led to failure of the device. If information gathered indicates that the manufacturer of a device on the CPL does not comply with the requirements in FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulations for devices used for medical purposes or that the device's label does not comply with the requirements in FDA's Labeling regulations for devices used for medical purposes, NHTSA will investigate the matter in consultation with FDA and will notify the manufacturer that the device may be removed from the list. The manufacturer will have 30 days from the date of notification to reply. Based on any data provided by the manufacturer and investigative findings, NHTSA will decide whether the device should remain on the list. If the device is removed from the list, the manufacturer will be permitted to resubmit a self-certification, certifying that the manufacturer complies with these FDA requirements when it believes the problems causing its non-compliance have been resolved. Upon resubmission, the manufacturer must submit a statement describing what has been done to overcome the problems which led to non-compliance. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and it has been determined that it has no federalism implication that warrants the preparation of a federalism assessment. In accordance with the foregoing, the Model Specifications for performance testing of alcohol screening devices are set forth below. Authority: 23 U.S.C. 402; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501. Michael B. Brownlee, Associate Administrator for Traffic Safety Programs.
