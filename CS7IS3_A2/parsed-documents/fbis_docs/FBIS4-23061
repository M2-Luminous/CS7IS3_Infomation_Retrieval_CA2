Sklyarov; UDC 681.7.068] [Abstract] A new two-position optical lightguide switch has been developed. The new switch is smaller and faster than conventional optical switches based on electro-optical and electro-acoustic effects. Specifically, the switch has a relatively high speed, high beam deflection (on the order of 30�), and low (no more than 0.1 W) control signal power. It consists of a lightguide that serves as a common channel, has the customary core and sheath, and is positioned coaxially with a second lightguide. The plane of the exit end of the first lightguide is sloped to its axis at at angle of (_ps_-�)/2-_P_, and the plane of the entry end of the second lightguide is normal to its axis. Alongside the second lightguide is a third lightguide whose axis is sloped to the axis of the first two lightguides at some angle _a_. As is the case for the second lightguide, the entry end of the third lightguide is plane and normal to its axis. The exit end of the first lightguide is located some distance from the entry ends of the second and third lightguides and forms an air gap. The lower part of the gap is filled with an immersion fluid whose refractive index n[.sub]1[/]' is selected to equal the refractive index of the core n[.sub]1[/]. The amount of liquid is such that its surface is below the lightguides' core. The path of radiation entering and leaving the first lightguide is determined by whether or not the fluid in the air gap expands to fill the entire gap, thus blocking access to the entrance end of the second lightguide. The fluid's expansion is in turn dictated by the temperature to which the fluid is heated. The influence of the capillary effect that is inevitable given the dimensions of the lightguides used in fiber-optic communication is eliminated by filling the space under the fluid with air at a positive pressure of 1.5-2 atm. In addition to eliminating any capillary effect, this positive pressure also helps accelerate displacement of the fluid to its initial position after the heating has ceased. Quartz lightguides with a refractive index of 1.48 may be used for all three lightguides, and ordinary anhydrous glycerin with a refractive index of 1.478 may be used as the immersion fluid. The serviceability of the new switch as a common, coaxial, and side channel was confirmed experimentally by using lightguides with a core diameter of 200 �m. It was stressed that the immersion fluid need not be vaporized in order for the switch to be serviceable; heating to temperatures of 50-70�C is sufficient to increase the fluid's initial volume sufficiently so that it will reach the top level. Such temperatures may be reached in only 10-20 ns with a pulse energy of no more than 10 �J, which is easily accomplished by using widely available semiconductor lasers.
