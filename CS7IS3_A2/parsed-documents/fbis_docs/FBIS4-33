KOREA/CHINA ROK-PRC: Emerging Issues in Bilateral Trade, Investment ROK-PRC: Emerging Issues in Bilateral Trade, Investment SUMMARY: Both the South Korean and Chinese press confirm a growing Korean surplus in bilateral trade, although there is some question as to the exact magnitude of the trade imbalance. Press sources attribute the surplus to structural differences in the two countries' foreign trade regimes. Bilateral investment has been hampered by problems in China's investment environment and is currently dominated by the ROK. To address the situation, the press suggests that China adjust its export mix and the type of investment it attracts, while South Korean firms focus more on participating in China's market. Recent articles in the South Korean and Chinese press discuss basic structural problems that are contributing to the growing imbalance in bilateral merchandise trade and limiting the scope of bilateral investment. The articles also suggest several measures to address the problems. Trade South Korea ran a $2.31 billion trade surplus with China in 1993, according to statistics published in the 2 February issue of Seoul SILMUL KYONGJE, the journal of the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade. (Official Chinese customs statistics as cited by China Economic Information report this figure as $2.5 billion.) SILMUL KYONGJE predicted that in 1994 South Korea will enjoy a bilateral trade surplus of $3.86 billion, with exports to China projected at $8.73 billion and imports at $4.87 billion. By contrast, Korea Trade Promotion Association statistics as cited in the 27 February Beijing JINGJI CAKKAO BAO are much lower, putting South Korea's 1993 trade surplus with China at $1 billion, with South Korea exporting $4.8 billion to the PRC and importing $3.8 billion. Furthermore, the association projects a 1994 bilateral trade imbalance of only $2.1 billion in favor of South Korea, with ROK exports to the PRC expected to total $6.6 billion and imports from the PRC $4.5 billion. Articles from both the Chinese and South Korean press have attempted to analyze the causes of the bilateral trade imbalance. According to the 9 February Seoul CHUGAN MAEGYONG, a business weekly, the trade imbalance is a result of Chinese products being diverted to domestic markets instead of export markets, of large- scale foreign investment in the PRC, increased plant imports by foreign-funded PRC firms, and lower PRC import tariffs. An article in the February Beijing GUOJI MAOYI WENTI, the University of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade monthly, however, pointed to basic inequities in the composition of bilateral trade as contributing to China's growing deficit. For example, the PRC monthly noted four categories of processed products--fiber products, chemical products, iron, steel and metal products, and electronic products--account for 90 percent of ROK exports to China, while four categories of mainly primary commodities--agricultural products, mineral products, nylon products, and chemicals--account for 85 percent of Chinese exports to South Korea. The 2 February SILMUL KYONGJE also indicated that growth in Chinese exports to South Korea has been at a standstill since 1991 precisely because ROK demand for these imports has plateaued. The December issue of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation journal, GUOJI MAOYI, noted that another factor in the trade imbalance is the trend to shift ROK labor-intensive industries to China, which necessitates large-scale imports by the PRC of equipment and raw materials for processing. SILMUL KYONGJE also pointed out that most ROK investment in China has centered around manufacturing industries--such as textiles and footwear- -which have lost competitiveness in South Korea. The February GUOJI MAOYI WENTI article also mentioned the lack of competitiveness of Chinese products and limited access to ROK markets as other causes of the bilateral trade imbalance. Not only are prices of Chinese products becoming less competitive as Chinese domestic labor prices rise, these exports still cannot measure up to ASEAN exports in terms of quality, packaging, and other non-price factors. Furthermore, "overly low" domestic prices in the past have led to "over exporting" of certain commodities to South Korea, and, in response, South Korea has raised tariffs and adopted other measures to limit Chinese imports in order to protect its domestic industries. The lack of ROK market access, according to the article, contrasts with China's efforts to open its own markets and drop tariffs in preparation for entry into GATT. The 11 January Seoul HANGUK ILBO discussed the possible impact of China's currency and financial reforms on ROK exports. China's recent unification and devaluation of its currency is expected to strengthen the price competitiveness of Chinese goods in overseas markets for which both ROK and Chinese goods compete. Furthermore, the paper noted that, while these reforms bring China's trading system closer to international norms, and thus may increase its exports in general, they will also likely curb PRC imports. Chinese currency devaluation and the imposition of a higher VAT and a new consumption tax will act as a "double trap" for South Korean exports to the PRC. However, ROK firms in China who manufacture for export will see their price competitiveness improve. Investment Bilateral investment is very one-sided, according to press reports from both countries. An article in the December issue of GUOJI MAOYI cited 1992 bilateral investment figures showing that, as of the end of 1992, South Korea had invested in 259 projects in China, with investments valued at $159 million. These figures contrast sharply with Chinese investments of only $4.86 million in South Korea. Furthermore, ROK investment continues to increase. According to SILMUL KYONGJE, ROK direct investment in China totaled $213.6 million (26 projects) in 1992, some $507 million (550 projects) from January through November 1993 and is expected to reach $875.4 million (970 projects) in 1994. In addition, GUOJI MAOYI claimed that a generally poor investment environment in the Bohai region--including the two provinces of Shandong and Liaoning, which account for 75 percent of ROK investment--is responsible for the "decreased enthusiasm" of ROK investors targeting China. The investment environment is marred by low productivity, poor discipline, high turnover of Chinese workers, and an "over-concentration" of investment zones in Shandong and Liaoning, according to the journal. Moreover, these negative aspects of the PRC investment environment have been exacerbated by the high concentration of ROK investment in China's labor-intensive processing industries, which accounted for 90 percent of ROK investment in the first half of 1992. South Korean investors have also favored small and medium- sized projects with quick returns. GUOJI MAOYI indicated that the average size of ROK investment projects on the Shandong peninsula as of the end of 1992 was $750,000. SILMUL KYONGJE reported that the average size of ROK direct investment projects in China was $800,000 in 1992, rose to $1.4 million in 1993, and is projected to drop to $900,000 in 1994. SILMUL KYONGJE also cautioned that the higher cost of imported raw materials and labor deriving from PRC currency devaluation will affect ROK firms' production activities in China. In the long run, SILMUL KYONGJE expects to see large-scale ROK investment aimed at China's domestic market rather than the traditional export-oriented investment that takes advantage of low wages to produce labor- intensive goods. Suggestions Both of the Chinese think tank journals outlined steps China can take to improve its trade deficit with South Korea. The February GUOJI MAOYI WENTI article, for example, maintained that China cannot equalize the trade imbalance by simply increasing the quantity of its exports to South Korea. It must also increase the per-unit value of exports. The article went on to suggest increasing exports of technology-intensive products such as electronics and machine parts. The December GUOJI MAOYI article cited two other areas of possible export growth--microcomputers and numerically controlled machine tools--in which China is already competitive on the world market. It further recommended that specialized Chinese organizations conduct pricing and consumer research in South Korea and pass the information to Chinese enterprises so that they can tailor their prices and products to the ROK market. On the noncommodity trade front, GUOJI MAOYI WENTI noted that South Korea is an excellent market for Chinese labor exports, especially for laborers from nearby Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning provinces while GUOJI MAOYI proposed targeting ROK conglomerates to invest in projects worth over $10 million or ceding equity in cash-strapped Chinese companies to ROK conglomerates to attract capital. GUOJI MAOYI called for encouraging investment in finance, commerce, tourism, and real estate while discouraging investment in projects that are energy- or capital-intensive or that produce rough-wrought products with little value-added content. As for indirect investment, GUOJI MAOYI suggested attracting ROK mutual funds and even setting up a "Bohai Start-Up Fund" to be issued directly in the ROK. GUOJI MAOYI also stressed the importance of encouraging ROK investment in technology-intensive industries, such as machinery and electronics, chemical, and automobile industries. The journal further recommended that China trade market share for capital and technology and that commodities from ROK-invested enterprises could "take the place of imports" or fill gaps in domestic production. South Korean publications have stressed the importance of upgrading investment in China and managing the bilateral trade relationship well. CHUGAN MAEGYONG noted that China's economic reforms will give less preference to foreign investors and foreign- invested firms in the future and suggested that ROK firms could benefit from breaking away from investments focused on using China's cheap labor and raising their image and participation in the local market through technological investments. The business weekly recommended that ROK firms increase their investment in transportation, real estate, and social infrastructure markets in order to expand their exports, profits, and opportunities. SILMUL KYONGJE advocated big increases in large-scale investments targeting the domestic Chinese market and noted that ROK investment has moved recently into cement, automobiles, machinery, petrochemicals, and other capital-intensive sectors. SILMUL KYONGJE commented that, as South Korea's trade surplus with China continues to expand, adjusting the bilateral trade imbalance will become an issue. To reduce this friction, South Korea must work to balance exports to China with imports from that country. At the same time, competition for markets in the United States, Japan, and the EU will become "even more heated." China is already revising aspects of its foreign trade system that act as stumbling blocks to its participation in the global market. These reforms, coupled with future GATT membership, would further strengthen China's competitiveness. For this reason, the journal deemed South Korea's prospects for exports to developed countries as not all that bright, even if there is economic recovery in those countries.
