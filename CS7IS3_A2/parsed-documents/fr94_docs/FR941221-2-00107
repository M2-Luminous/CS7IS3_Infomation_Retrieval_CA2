FR941221-2-00107 FR941221-2-00075 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;35103; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;10] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Amendments to Rule 127 (Block Positioning) and Rule 72(b) (``Clean'' Agency Crosses) December 15, 1994. I. Introduction On March 17, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend Exchange Rule 127 on Block Positioning and Rule 72(b) on ``clean'' agency crosses. 1 15 U.S.c. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34302( July 1, 1994), 59 FR 35161 (July 8, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. II. Description NYSE Rule 127 outlines the current method for executing block cross transactions at a price that is outside of the NYSE best bid or offer. Under Rule 127, a member must inform the specialist of his intention to cross block orders at a specific price (the ``clean-up'' price) and determine the extent of the interest the specialist has in participating in the transaction. 3 The member then announces the clean-up price to other members in the trading crowd (``Crowd'') and files at the clean-up price all public orders limited to the clean-up price or better. 4 The member then crosses the remaining shares at the clean-up price. 5 3 Rule 127 states that there should be no intervening trades by the member between the time the member informs the specialist of his intention to cross block orders and the trade or trades to clean-up the block, except that a member may trade with the exposed bid or offer if the clean-up price is one-eighth of a point outside the current quotation and the member is holding only agency orders on both sides of the market. 4 A limit order to buy or sell stock for a particular price is said to be ``limited to'' the specified price. Therefore, a limit order ``limited to the clean up-price'' is an order to buy or sell stock for the same price at which the block transaction is proposed to be executed. For example, if the current quote is 20 to 201/8 for a stock traded in 1/8 minimum variations and a member announces a clean-up price of 195/8, he must fill at the clean-up price 195/8 all public orders to buy limited to 20, 197/8, 193/4, and 195/8. This allows these public limit orders to receive the benefit of the clean-up price. 5 Technically, the member makes a bid and offer according to NYSE Rule 76. See infra note 6. If the member determines, however, that the amount of stock needed to trade with other public limit orders excessively interferes with the proposed block cross, the member may adjust the clean-up price or may elect to announce the original clean-up price again and inform the Crowd that it will not be given stock at the clean-up price. After such an announcement is made, the member proceeds to make a bid and offer for the full amount of the block cross pursuant to NYSE Rule 76. 6 After filling any market interest at the bid, the member crosses the block orders for the remaining shares at the clean-up price. 6 Under NYSE Rule 76, the member makes an offer higher than the clean-up price by the minimum variation permitted in such security. For example, if the clean-up price is 195/8, the member would make an offer at 193/4. If the block cross represents agency orders on both sides, a member that does not fill at the clean-up price public orders limited to the clean-up price or better may exercise its right to precedence at the clean-up price based on size. 7 Rule 127 currently provides that, regardless of precedence at the clean-up price, the member must fill public orders limited to the clean-up price that are on the specialist's book, up to a minimum amount of 1000 shares or 5% of the total amount crossed at the clean-up price, whichever is greater. 8 In addition, if all or any portion of the block will have the effect of establishing or increasing the member organization's position, the member representing the block orders must fill at the clean-up price the public orders limited to the clean-up price or better before any amount may be retained for the member organization's account. 7 If a member has precedence at the clean-up price, it is not required to execute other pre-existing orders limited to the clean-up price. See NYSE Rule 72(c), which provides that, when no bid is entitled to time priority, all bids for a number of shares of stock equaling or exceeding the number of shares of stock in the offer are on parity and entitled to precedence over bids for less than the number of shares in the offer, except that if it is possible to determine the order of time in which the bids with precedence were made, such bids will be filled in that order. 8 Because this stock is assigned rather than acquired as the result of priority, precedence based on size, or a match in a parity situation, the specialist does not follow the normal policy of assigning executions to orders in the priority of receipt, but rather assigns 100 shares to each order on the book.
