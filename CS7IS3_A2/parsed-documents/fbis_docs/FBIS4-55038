Striking again at the dignity of the legally elected local authorities and violating once again the laws of this country's Parliament -- above all the law on local administration, according to which the local authority is invested with autonomy in decision-making and local representation of the state institutions -- the Romanian Government, by dragging out the issue and setting almost absurd conditions for granting an entry visa to His Majesty King Mihai I as a private person, has not only expressed a position full of contempt for the monarchic institutions but also violated one of the main rights of every citizen, namely the right to visit his own country. The major reason for of this unqualifiable attitude is the current leadership's legitimacy complex. This is new proof that Timisoara, the symbol of democracy and of a civilized attitude toward the world and its development, represents for those in power a source of fear, an area that generates anxiety compared with the sweet comfort of their own position. Dear Timisoara citizens, they have not forgiven us for the fact that the wave that overthrew the entire order to which the current leaders are still devoted started here. We do not wish to damage the status of this town, and so we defy this attitude of the government that is detrimental to Timisoara's reputation! Expressing my deepest regret at the government's attitude and convinced that their Majesties Mihai I and Queen Ana will not extend their sorrow at this reaction of frightful reserve to us, I nurture the hope that the time will come when the bells of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Timisoara will chime to welcome its founder, Mihai I of Romania. God bless us all! Viorel Oancea, mayor of Timisoara
