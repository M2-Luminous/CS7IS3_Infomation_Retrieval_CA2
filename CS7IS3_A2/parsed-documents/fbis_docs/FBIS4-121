I was supposed to be joined by Mr. Sam de Beer, who I'm told is locked in meetings, but I have with me here Philip Dexter. Good evening and welcome to you, Sir. [Dexter] Good evening, Leslie. [Mashokwe] The task group of the TEC, what did it find in Lebowa? [Dexter] Well I think the most striking feature of what we saw in Lebowa was that there was a complete and total collapse of all services. And I think that the extent to which that has happened has now become a crisis. [Mashokwe] Is that despite the fact that Fourie's men are in the area, trained to sort out the mess? [Dexter] Well I think one of the things that we certainly uncovered was that despite the intervention of the minister's department, none of the problems have actually been able to be solved. Now I'm not trying to imply that that's the minister's fault, all I'm saying is that the intervention doesn't seem to have achieved any of the objectives that we would have thought it was supposed to. [Mashokwe] I want an objective view here: What did you find out about the views of the people there with regard to Ramodike's governance? [Dexter] Well we consulted, firstly, with the striking workers, who were the only people there when we arrived, myself and Minister de Beer. After that, we went back to Johannesburg and arranged a meeting with the heads of departments and came back to Lebowa to meet them. Thereafter, we spoke to the cabinet and to the chief minister himself, and I think what we discovered in talking to all these various groups was that it was clear that none of them were going to be able to solve the problem. I don't think the workers who are on strike have the ability to solve the problem. The heads of departments clearly can't, and it seems to me that the cabinet has also been rendered ineffective by the situation that is currently prevailing. [Mashokwe] I want you to tell me what exactly the problem is in the area? [Dexter] Well, if I were to be honest I would have to say that it's difficult to actually find out what is the problem, because there are so many claims by different parties, people accusing one another of various things. And I think, in all fairness, what has happened is that you have a situation that is now simply a huge political dispute, and it's quite clear that, as I said before, none of the parties involved in the dispute would be able to solve it. [Mashokwe] Having listened to the debate that preceded this discussion that we're having now, Mr. Ramodike conceded that he gets paid for not working, or he gets paid for working in exile -- if you didn't find him in his offices? [Dexter] Well, we did actually find the minister, the chief minister, in his offices, but I think the point is that nobody is able to do any work because everybody is on strike. But I think that's not really the issue. The issue is that we can all dance around technicalities, but what we need is a solution to the problem because there are patients in the hospitals who are not being cared for, there are government vehicles which have been liberated by people, and in one case... [Mashokwe, interrupting] Liberated? [Dexter] Well we saw -- in one case, we witnessed children driving a government vehicle. [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, let me come back to you. You said to me you're still the chief minister of that area -- children driving cars, government has collapsed, you called to the TEC to come and take over financial control. Why did you not resign if you thought that the government was not worth being there? [Ramodike] Well, if I had to comment Leslie -- you are aware of the fact the political authority, power and functions, were removed from my administration since September last year. [Mashokwe] You're shaking your head. [Fourie] Well its simply not true. I mean, the chief minister admitted that he is the chief minister. He's got a government. He's being paid for the job. He is the government. All I did was -- we took over the control of the finances. We took the checkbook and the order book in simple terms, and we are checking that whatever decisions are being taken, that it is properly tended for -- if there is services required that there is money budgeted for in terms of any decisions being taken, and then we ensure that the right payments are made. Just a last remark ... [Mashokwe, interrupting] It's almost like you are saying he is not -- he was spending money without proper budgeting. [Fourie] Just a last remark. To resolve this problem of the police -- he took this absolutely incredible decision to take 2 million rand from Legislative Assembly pension fund to transfer it to the Police Benefit Fund and to give every policeman a check. Now that is robbing Peter to pay Paul. Who is going to repay the pension money? [Ramodike] To come in Leslie, that is irreconcilable of the minister. You will recall that, a few months ago, he said that funds accruing from own resources of the self-governing territory, like the 3 million rand that was used to purchase a jet in kwaZulu, these he said he doesn't have control -- a say over this, but when it comes to Lebowa, because we are his political opponents and they came down here for a political ploy and political posturing, then he would like to control everything. The decisions he is referring to -- there is no decision that we can take and it doesn't interfere with our decisions. For an example, the items of expenditure -- very important, essential services that are to be rendered to our people, he stopped everything and that is not only a question of financial control. If he goes out there to stop the project like the erection of (Mankueng) Nursing College, like the tarring of roads, like stopping the old age pensions because all our old age pensioners, as I'm speaking now, have not as yet received their pensions. Now is that my fault? How can you give a man administrative accountability and remove political accountability, political authority, political power, and political functions. [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, I am running out of time. Why did you remove 2 million rands from the Legislative Assembly's pension fund to the police. [Ramodike] Those monies and three other accounts are directly under our control in spite of the fact that the minister took over the financial control. He doesn't have a right to tamper with money accruing from our resources. [Fourie] Just two remarks. He just now accused us of a blatant lie. I want to say that it is a blatant lie if anybody says we stopped the pension monies. I want to say categorically, especially to the pensioners in Lebowa, the money is lying in the bank. The reason why the pensioners are not getting their money is because the civil servants do not pay it out to them. The last remark I want to make is, just for an example, if President de Klerk would take 2 million rand from the parliamentary pension fund and hand it out to the police in South Africa, do you not think that would be a banana republic decision. [Mashokwe] Ramodike? [Ramodike] Well, I think that could be said by an inexperienced minister. It does happen that if you have got a crisis in one department, then you could always shift funds from one department to the other department and when the next year's financial year comes, then that other department would make provision on its budget to refund the amount taken from other departments. It happens. On several occasions, since the days of the late Dr. (Pathudi), and the minister then accepted that bona fides and we resolved such problems amicably. What is the point of keeping money in the bank when people are dying out there in the hospitals when there is a lot of looting, when our poor old mothers are suffering, and you just say I cannot rearrange my plans, and I don't see any wisdom in such type of leadership. [Mashokwe] OK, I want Mr. Dexter to come in to this discussion. [Dexter] You want me to comment? Well, obviously I think that this is precisely the problem that we have. It seems that there's no way the parties involved will be able to resolve the problems. That's why the TEC council met today and has actually taken a resolution on this matter and we believe that that will actually assist in solving the problem. [Mashokwe] We will talk to you about that, but I want Mr. Ramodike to explain one thing to me very quickly: Why don't you resign if you think that the TEC must take over the governance of your area? [Ramodike] Yes, that's very simple. In fact I think first and foremost you should know that the Legislative Assembly is placed...[pauses] the cabinet, I mean, is placed in power by the Legislative Assembly, and in order for the cabinet to be dissolved then the state president should be requested by either my cabinet or the whole Legislative Assembly to dissolve it. We have long requested, after we got fed up -- with all humility -- with the takeover by Minister Fourie. We made a submission requesting the state president that he should dissolve the Lebowa Legislative Assembly.... [Mashokwe, interrupting] Why don't you resign? Why don't you resign? Oupa Gqozo did it without a Legislative Assembly. [Ramodike] I'm not going to resign, Leslie, because I'm aware that once I resign now together with my cabinet and the other members of Legislative Assembly remain in place, then Minister Fourie may convene a special session of the Legislative Assembly and place his own puppets or surrogates in our position. [Fourie] May I reply to that please? [Mashokwe] Minister, why don't you let Ramodike... [Fourie, interrupting] I want to be given... [Mashokwe, continuing] Wait a minute. Let me ask a question. Why don't you let Ramodike run his cabinet? Why do you meddle in his affairs? Is it political mileage that you are trying to make for the National Party? [Fourie] I've got to meddle in his affairs because they made a total mess of the financial administration. They haven't got money left. I want to give a guarantee tonight to Mr. Ramodike. I will not use the act to appoint anybody else into the position if he resigns. I will support him if he resigns, and we ask the TEC to appoint co-administrators to administer that territory from now until the election. I give him that guarantee then he must just resign so then we can get order back into that place. [Ramodike] Well my response to that, Mr. Minister, is that you have been a stumbling block towards my way of resignation all the time. Set an example because you are the first stumbling block in terms of this monster called apartheid, then once you resign, let me give also a guarantee -- resign tomorrow and I will follow suit. [Fourie] I must resign for what? I challenge Mr. Ramodike to appoint any commission, to appoint the TEC -- I am prepared to appear before the TEC on every single decision and administration that we have taken, and if anybody can fault me I will resign. [Mashokwe] Mr. Fourie, I made mention earlier on of the fact that you are making political mileage out of this -- it's almost like saying the Nats [National Party members] are the good boys. They are coming to sort out the mess. Would you care to comment on that? [Fourie] You see Leslie we happen to be the government in South Africa, and there is an act in terms of which the self-governing territories are operated, and the act says quite deliberately: If in the opinion of the state president, any decisions are taken in a self-governing territory that places an unfair burden on the taxpayer of South Africa, or there is not proper administration, we've got the right to go in there and to rectify things. So if I wanted to act why didn't I act against Samuel Khumalo of Gazankulu, or Mr. Zitha in Kangwane, or Mr. James Mahlangu from Kwandebele. They...[pauses] at least I've got a good relationship with them, but when we tried to help Mr. Ramodike ... [Mashokwe, interrupting] So you don't have a good relationship with Mr. Ramodike? [Fourie] No, no. When we tried to help him he didn't want to give his cooperation. [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, you are laughing there. [Ramodike] Yes, well if the reason for taking over the administration really is because he doesn't have good relationships with him [as heard], I wanted to remind Mr. Minister, with all humility, that it is common cause that politicians should at times cross political swords, and for that matter we should not make enemies. [Mashokwe] Tell me, are you being singled out because of your connections with the ANC, do you think? [Ramodike] Repeat that. [Mashokwe] Do you think the government is singling you out because of your connections with the ANC? [Ramodike] Yes, well I've got evidence. For an example, Minister Fourie held secret meetings in (Leisdorp), Harmony Plot, (Mokhetse), (Leisitele), where he attacked on me and the African National Congress. [Mashokwe] What's wrong with that. He's a politician. You are a politician. [Ramodike] I'm a politician, and I could not begrudge him for that. I mean, the people -- confidentially, from (Sikororo) area, (Mujaje) -- into the bushes, because they were afraid to face us as ANC -- in the (Sikororo) area, (Mujaje), and up to now I mean, we are still making a call ... [Mashokwe, interrupting] OK, let him respond to that quickly. I want to bring in Philip Dexter here. Let him come in. Respond quickly to that. [Fourie] Can I just make a remark in lighter vain. Mr. Ramodike at one stage challenged me to oppose him as the governor of the north. I am now the number one on the National Party list, and he is somewhere number 78 on the ANC list. I am not worried about him. I am campaigning in the northern Transvaal yes, and I am holding meetings all over, right through Lebowa, and not Mr. Ramodike or anybody will stop me from that. [Mashokwe] The political section of this debate is over. Let's go over to the TEC. The people out there are in need of services. Are you going to step in? [Dexter] Well, absolutely. The decision of the TEC today was that it's become -- well, due to the crisis -- it's become clear that something would have to be done and the TEC has decided that the management committee should take immediate steps to ensure that there is an effective administration in Lebowa. [Mashokwe] What does that mean? [Dexter] Well, I think that that gives the management committee the right to look into the matter and make a decision as to what part they would follow. That could include the appointment of administrators. [Mashokwe] What are you saying to us? Are you going to appoint administrators? [Dexter] Well, as I said, it's the management committee of the TEC that will take that decision, but clearly they have been empowered to do so by the council itself. But could I just add another point? I think that part of the problem that we've identified is that there are all these deep-seated grievances in the region, you know. And I would submit that one of the things that I've certainly learnt myself from watching this dispute is that it's very difficult to understand how people could allow a crisis like this to continue and not actually do something constructive about it. And I think that in that respect, you know, that I think we'll have to all accept some kind of accountability for that situation. [Mashokwe] OK, your reaction to the TEC's position. [Fourie] I would gladly support the TEC, but 100 percent. I must tell you Leslie.... [Mashokwe, interrupting] Will you move out? [Fourie] No, what do I move out? I say that if they appoint administrators, somebody must do the financial administration. I don't think the TEC has got the capabilities to do that. They haven't got the staff to do that. But if they appoint two administrators and the civil servants go back to work and I'm satisfied that the money will be in good hands, I will most definitely move out. [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, your reaction. [Ramodike] Well, first and foremost, it would be (?wrong) for the minister to prescribe to the TEC. I've got full confidence in the TEC and it has got experts in the Subcouncil on Finance and as a matter of fact I have already made a request, that the TEC Subcouncil on Finance should take over the financial administration in Lebowa, and hamba kahle [goodbye] Mr. Fourie. And I will further welcome that the administrators be appointed. [Mashokwe] And you resign? [Ramodike] They should be appointed by the management committee.... [Fourie, interrupting] No, he must resign then. [Ramodike] If I've got to resign, I am saying again, Mr. Fourie you are equally...you have equally failed in administering Lebowa. In fact, you have made things worse. I think you should be bold, you should have audacity to quit your cabinet, and then I will follow. [Mashokwe] Thank you, Mr. Ramodike, Mr. Fourie, Mr. Dexter. Thanks for talking to us.
