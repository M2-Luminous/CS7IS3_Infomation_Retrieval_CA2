Demetrius told reporters that the delegation, which is scheduled to stay here till May 28, will only talk about technical issues of replacing nuclear fuel rods. He stressed that IAEA had not rejected DPRK's invitation to observe the replacement of the fuel rod, but the agency expected to carry out overall inspection on DPRK's nuclear equipment. Since its demand had not been met, the IAEA did not deny that the delegation would hold negotiations with the DPRK about the precondition of nuclear inspections, Demetrius added. He said that there were considerable disagreements between the IAEA and the DPRK on the issue of inspecting nuclear equipment and he hoped that the possibility of carrying out the program would emerge after the negotiations.
