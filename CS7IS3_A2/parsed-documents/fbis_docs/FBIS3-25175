The CD, which was in the forefront of a campaign last year for recognition of the results of June 12 civilian presidential elections annulled by the army, said it would work for "the immediate termination of the Abacha dictatorship." In a statement released here after a national convention of the Campaign last week in Ibadan, north of Lagos, the movement "condemned in the strongest terms possible the unwanted and unwelcome coup of General Sani Abacha of November 17, 1993." Abacha ousted an unelected, short-lived civilian interregnum "at a time when what the majority of Nigerians desired was the upholding of the June 12 election adjuged the fairest and freest in the nation's history." The CD convention called for the "immediate" setting up of a national government including "popular and credible representatives of various social, professional and ethnic groups" in Africa's most populous nation, which has some 89 million inhabitants. The CD, whose convention brought together 120 delegates from 70 movements working for democracy, is essentially based in the Yoruba southwest of the country, the home base of the Moslem millionaire believed to have won the poll last June, Moshood Abiola. Its statement "decried the slavish, easy and unprecedented capitulation of the political elite...to the Abacha regime," blaming members of both Abiola's left-leaning Social Democratic Party and the rival National Republican Convention. "This was demonstrated by their failure to resist the dissolution of all democratic structures," including the federal parliament and the two political parties themselves, by Abacha on his seizure of power, the CD said. Politicians had nevertheless chosen "to embrace it (the regime) by grabbing appointments at the state and federal levels without regard to the aspirations of their (party) members and the socio-political destiny of Nigerians in general." On seizing power with a pledge eventually to restore civilian rule, Abacha managed to enlist a number of prominent Abiola supporters into his governing team. The CD said the "main agenda" of the new government it wanted should be to prepare for a "Sovereign National Conference (SNC) that shall deliberate on all national issues it deems fit without any derogation or interference whatsoever by the government." The conference should devise a new "popular" transition programme to bring about a "genuinely democratic order through free and fair multiparty elections." Then military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the June 12 poll alleging irregularities, though international observers had billed it a clean race, and plunged Nigeria into turmoil after its latest decade of military rule.
