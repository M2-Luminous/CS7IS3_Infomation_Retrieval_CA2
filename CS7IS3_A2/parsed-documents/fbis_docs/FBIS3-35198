There are reports of the largest and most prestigious transnational corporations proposing to invest in India. There are reports also of smaller firms coming forward with project proposals. The fact of the matter is that international investors are now thinking of pumping in funds into India which had until now shunned the country. The figures released by the union Industry Ministry of late on foreign direct investment proposals so far having been cleared by the government in the last two and a half years show a distinct spurt. No less than 131.6 billion rupees of investment proposals have been approved since the reform program was launched. Of these proposals, the largest amount originated from the United States, notwithstanding the periodical outburst of the U.S. Government on various issues touching India and its concerns. If anything, the pragmatism of the U.S. investors goes to show the inherent attractiveness of India as the land for growth. As such, the growth potentials of the developed countries are limited in various sectors and fresh opportunities could be explored only in the developing third world. Among the Third World countries almost all agree on the context of being an oft-repeated cliche, only two countries have growth opportunities, that is, India and China. The figures released also indicate that the interest in India is fairly widespread. If, as the largest economy, U.S. will have a natural interest in all major markets, smaller countries looking for investment of their surplus also think it fit to take a go in India. Oman, for example, has sought approval for investment to the tune of 5.43 billion rupees in various projects in the country. The Foreign Investment Approval Board has cleared proposals for investment from United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Netherlands, Japan, Mexico, Ireland, France, Mauritius, Italy, and Hong Kong. The willingness of the Non-Resident Indians [NRI's] have also changed remarkably. The figures reveal that from a figure of over 38 billion rupees in 1992, the NRI's have mooted investments of over 88 billion rupees. Translating these foreign investment proposals calls for spending up the Indian bureaucracy to an altogether new mode of functioning. After all, actual investments could come to pass only if several other conditions are also fulfilled. The process of liberalization should make sure that the administration does not sit over small procedural matters. At the same time,it is imperative on the authorities to be more vigilant about the flow of such funds. In the wake of the liberalization process, ardent advocates have emerged who are lobbying for indiscriminate entry of all. They have argued that the investments should be allowed wherever the investments want them to be and then the market forces will in the long run decide what survives. There is certainly some logic in allowing funds in. After all, India does not suffer much and the foreign direct investment will willy-nilly create assets in this country only. Hence, investments might be as well allow inactivities which have so far been considered not core sectors [sentence as heard]. But, the question arises in the end whether there is any room for indigenous technology, preferences or entereprise in this country. Do we have to take hamburgers rather than samosas [a popular Indian hot dish] or sweetened aerated water manufactured by multinational corporations exactly in the way the world does?
