FR940414-0-00013 FR940414-0-00001 (xi) In the event the Licensor becomes unwilling or unable to furnish support required by the Contract for the Licensed Software, the Licensor shall, upon written request of the Licensee, provide with the greatest possible dispatch all Licensed Software back-up documentation including proprietary information other than agreed excluded documentation. In this event, (1) the Licensee shall be permitted full use of all Licensed Software and documentation as long as the System is operational and (2) the Licensee may modify, or have modified, the Licensed Software for feature enhancement or proper equipment operation and becomes the owner of such modifications for all purposes, including patenting, copywriting, sale, or license thereof. Agreed excluded documentation is Licensed Software back-up documentation described in the first sentence of this section (2)(xi) which (A) is proprietary information of a third party, (B) was specifically described at the pre-bid technical session and individually identified in an attachment to the Bid, and (C) REA and the Licensee agree, before bids are opened, may be excluded from the requirements of this section (2)(xi). In the event the Licensor furnishes agreed excluded documentation and the Licensee exercises its rights under this section (2)(xi), the Licensor shall use its best efforts to provide such agreed excluded information to the Licensee, or obtain continuing support agreements from the parties retaining legal rights to the excluded documentation. Licensor agrees that certain Licensed Software cannot be excluded from the requirements of this section (2)(xi) including, but not limited to, software, the absence or improper operation of which would significantly impair the operation of the System, would significantly impair the ability of the Licensee to generate revenue, or would pose a risk to REA loan security. (xii) A breach of this License by the Licensor is a breach of the Contract. Therefore, the remedies specified in the Contract shall apply. (xiii) The Licensee shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the Licensor to correct any breach of this License. Damages payable by the Licensee for its breach of this License shall not exceed the total Contract price. The Licensor shall not terminate this License unless: (A) The Licensor has given REA sixty (60) days notice before termination; and (B) REA agrees with the Licensor that termination is the only method available to prevent significant harm to the Licensor from additional Licensee defaults. (xiv) The obligations of Licensee and Licensor and any successors in title under this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and continue after any termination of rights granted hereunder. (xv) Licensee and Licensor agree that it will not, without the prior written permission of the other party, use in advertising, publicity, packaging, labeling, or otherwise, any trade name, trademark, trade device, service mark, symbol, or any other identification or any abbreviation, contraction, or simulation thereof owned by the other party or any of its affiliates or used by the other party or any of its affiliates to identify any of their products or services, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. (xvi) This Software License Agreement shall prevail notwithstanding any conflicting terms or legends which may appear on or in the Licensed Software. (xvii) If any Section or part thereof, in this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction in which this Agreement is being performed, then the meaning of such section or part shall be construed so as to render it enforceable, to the extent feasible; and if no feasible interpretation would save such section or part, it shall be severed from this Agreement and the remainder shall remain in full force and effect. However, in the event such section or part is considered an essential element of this Agreement, the parties shall promptly negotiate a replacement therefor.
