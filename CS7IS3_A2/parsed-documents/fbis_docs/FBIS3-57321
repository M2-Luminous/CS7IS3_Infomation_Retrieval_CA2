If that document had the form of an agreement or treaty, it would certainly affect our internal law, which would enable the parliament to resort to its favorite weapon, impeachment. "I have no doubts whatsoever about the legitimacy of what was done by the executive branch. However, it is up to the Supreme Council to examine how this was done," said Mr. Chalyy, chief of the legal department at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. Thus, the Ukrainian parliament will have to ratify START I with no reservations and join the nonproliferation treaty to implement the agreement. Ideally, the legislature should endorse START II, that is, to give the go-ahead regarding the destruction of nuclear arsenals so that the Moscow agreement is legally binding. Silenced by top officials of our state, this question somehow remains nothing more than rhetoric. It is strange that the agreement's appendix provides for the decommissioning of most of the modern SS-24 missiles within 10 months and not the SS-19's whose short expiration terms cause much concern. The agreement signed in Moscow will surely be extended by a long chain of negotiations, and its contours -- now pretty vague -- will have to become more specific. Nuclear Fuel "Enriched uranium contained in nuclear arms is a matter of a purely commercial nature," said Bill Clinton at a news conference at the Boryspil Airport. It was agreed that within seven years, Russia would process -- at our expense -- highly enriched uranium into fuel for atomic power stations, one portion of which will be immediately shipped to Ukraine (100 tonnes of low-activated uranium in the first 10 months), while another part will be sold to the United States for $1 billion. Ideally, Washington should send this billion to Kiev. However, Russia also claims its portion of the nuclear pie as a country tasked with processing the uranium. So far, details regarding the division of this billion-dollar tidbit are inaccessible. Debts for Energy Sources The information that came in last Friday [14 January] about Moscow's pledges of fair play in negotiating the $2-billion indebtness with Kiev have not borne out entirely. Looming ahead is the perspective of endless blanket-pulling and difficult inter-governmental talks. According to a dark vision by government officials, instead of the entire debt, Russia will agree to forgive only its small portion. The point is that structures with looser dependence from the state, such as the "Gazprom," were also engaged in energy supplies. This kind of "debt canceling" is more profitable for them. Support of International Financial Organizations This support is possible only when Ukraine devises clear-cut plans for getting out of an economic crisis. In other words, only staunch optimists can count on it at the present time. For example, propped up by the United States, Russia is expecting $1.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund and $500 billion from the World Bank. This is a modest sum considering the size of Russia, and would remain so if allocated to Ukraine. Hypothetically, even with credits on hand, Ukraine should be prepared for high interest rates. Tactical Weapons This appears to be the biggest "white spot" in all this nuclear business. The agreement does not offer a clear statement on compensation for tactical weapons removed from the three ex-Soviet republics to Russia. Officials warily say that "experts are now working on this issue." Support for Weapons Destruction Process This support was offered by the Nunn-Lugar plan initiated in December 1991 and will be financed by U.S. Defense Department resources. The plan's basic provisions envisioned for 1993 fiscal year spendings for dismantling and destruction of nuclear weapons, establishing aid funds for disarming CIS countries, and humanitarian aid, which is $800 million, $100 million, and $410 million, respectively, for all nuclear successors of the Soviet Union. Of this amount, $175 million for technical assistance in weapons destruction was promised to Leonid Kravchuk by then-President Bush in December 1992. This promise was also confirmed by Bill Clinton at the meeting with the Ukrainian president in Kiev. The American side is relying on its experience of scrapping similar 300-missile complexes in 1992 that needed $300 billion for destruction. Foreign Ministry officials claim that if the process "gets rolling," Americans are ready to provide additional funds to Ukraine. On the other hand, the Nunn-Lugar program contains quite a few discriminative limitations. One of them, for instance, says that the CIS country receiving this aid should also put in its own money to finance the destruction of nuclear weapons. So disarmament will definitely put a squeeze on the more than meager Ukrainian budget. In addition, Ukraine will be able to use the $175 billion only for U.S. and Ukrainian (practically nonexistent) technologies and experts. The United States will definitely reap most of the profits coming from the nuclear deal. Bill Clinton returned to the White House with another victory. The United States will cash in on buying cheap fuel for atomic power stations practically without spending their budget dollars for the important cause of "peace in all the world." Ex-Soviet republics safeguard the quiet sleep of Americans because the spread of nuclear technologies and weapons to unreliable Asian regimes -- so much feared by America shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union -- appears to be unrealistic now. Russia, America's strategic partner, achieved its goals by bashing Ukraine on the nuclear issue. The issue of energy debts -- one of the leverages over Ukraine -- remains unsolved; now even fuel supplies to Ukrainian atomic power plants depend on Russia. So what has Ukraine gotten from the deal except for international acknowledgment? For now, we can definitely point to a great relief for our state budget from a huge burden imposed by servicing nuclear complexes. In addition, preliminary estimates show that the 100 tonnes of fuel for atomic stations, due within 10 months, will keep our plants going for two years.
