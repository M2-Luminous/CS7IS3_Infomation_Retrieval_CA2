In the group's opinion, the "education act in its present form is absolutely unacceptable for the Hungarian community. It (the law) enacts an obvious and unspeakable discrimination against the ethnic minorities in Romania, and at the same time, a flagrant violation of the constitution." The main objections UDMR has against the draft law is the restriction of the constitutional right to learn in the native tongue in all the objects of study, the abolition of the existing structures of specialized education in minority languages, the interdiction to train in higher education institutions specialists in social and economic sciences, the inacceptance to have the confessional schools reorganized and re-established. "The ruling (Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR) is visibly the prisoner of extremist political forces. The government's lack of political will to solve these problems hampers the building of a climate of social peace, destabilizing the Romanian society," says the UDMR lower house group statement.
