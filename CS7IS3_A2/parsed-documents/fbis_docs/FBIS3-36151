Certification of Counterintelligence Leadership Has Begun" -- place and date not given] [Text] At the end of January an organizational session of the of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service's Certification Commission took place, chaired by Security Council Secretary O. Lobov. At the end of the session O. Lobov gave an exclusive interview. [Mikhaylov] What is the composition of the Certification Commission? [Lobov] It includes counterintelligence service director Golushko and his first deputy Stepashin, as well as the president's national security adviser and officials from the presidential administration and the Security Council apparatus. The commission has the right to invite other people and demand any materials related to certification. [Mikhaylov] What criteria will be used in certifying the officer corps? [Lobov] Careful vetting will be ensured, based on criteria which are set on officers of this service, primarily professional requirements. Also their ability to operate under new conditions, their knowledge and experience. And naturally their political views: to what extent a person wishing to work in the new service supports the reform course. The commission's task is to pursue an extremely objective approach in this process. [Mikhaylov] A certain lull around the counterintelligence service arouses concern not only within this department itself but also around it. Many are interested in knowing when the certification will end and when the department will be able to get down to real business. [Lobov] I do not think that there should be any break related to the commission's activity. Subject to certification are approximately 200 to 250 top officials who are to be approved under a presidential edict. This work is fairly responsible. Therefore we believe that the commission must not be rushed. The president signed his edict on 21 January and gave us until 1 March. No one should get nervous. I would like to say that even those who will be dismissed -- for age or health reasons -- will have considerably greater privileges than those that existed in the what is now known in the country's history as the period of stagnation. There should not be much anxiety that the commission has been set up to undertake any radical turnabouts. It is to ensure a qualified selection of cadres without the participation of those political structures that were earlier involved in such work. [Mikhaylov] Being head of the Security Council, what would you like the Russian Counterintelligence Service to be? [Lobov] I think that it should be a service protecting Russia's new interests. It must uphold the reforms and democratization. This service must support the president. For the first time Russia has presidential rule. It was not born easily. Even now it is confronted with tremendous difficulties, but the counterintelligence service is called upon to defend this new presidential rule. Russia's economic interests are also becoming one of the top priorities. Because it is not easy to understand the meaning of the ruble zone or whether a union with Belarus is beneficial. What about the interests of Russian-speakers in the neighboring states or the former socialist countries? What should interrelations and economic links be like today? This is very complicated work. I would like the counterintelligence service to meet the demands of our times.
