On the basis of production development, the living standards of the urban and rural populace continued to improve somewhat; the GNP was 10.1 billion yuan, up by 9.5 percent from the previous year, exceeding the 8 percent growth rate in the national plan. The accomplishments evidenced the fact that all measures adopted by the provincial party committee and government centering around building the socialist market economic structure, accelerating the exploitation of resources, and pushing the province's economic development were very effective. Entrusted by the provincial government, Xia Luodi, provincial finance department director, made a report on conditions of implementing the 1993 provincial financial budget and initial arrangements for 1994 financial revenues and expenditures. In the report, he said that in financial work in 1993, the provincial government earnestly implemented various central measures for macroeconomic regulation and control, organized revenue and controlled expenditure with great efforts. Year-end results in executing the plan were better than expected. The annual budgetary expenditure was 2.377 billion yuan, and financial revenue fulfilled was 1.135 billion yuan, being 130.5 percent, or 319 million yuan more than, the annual revenue target of the yearly financial plan. Those items with increases in financial revenues were mainly industrial and commercial taxes, which enjoyed a 356 million yuan increase, in addition to agricultural and animal husbandry taxes as well as other income from special items.
