The 20 Romanians working for a cement factory are to move from the southern Asyut region to the northern city of Alexandria until the situation calms down, ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana [name as received] said. The engineers were on board a bus that was hit by gunfire on Monday near Asyut. They were unhurt, but the next day they received threats from the al-Jama'ah saying the shooting was only a warning. The Egyptian authorities and the Romanian Embassy in Cairo were studying ways of protecting the 200 Romanians working in "sensitive" parts of the country, Geoana added.
