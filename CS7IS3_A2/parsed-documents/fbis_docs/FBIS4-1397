FBIS4-1397 "drafr082_c_94011" FBIS-AFR-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AWB Members Among Suspects AWB Members Among Suspects MB2704160694 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1550 GMT 27 Apr 94 MB2704160694 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- Thirty-one suspects -- some of them members of the AWB's [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] elite Ystergarde [Iron Guard] unit -- have been arrested and are being held in connection with several bomb blasts which have hit the Witwatersrand and Pretoria areas since the weekend. Two of the men are policemen, one a serving member and the other a reservist. All those arrested are being held at different places and investigations into further connections, perhaps at leadership level, are in progress. This was announced by the commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, at a special media conference called at a Braamfontein, Johannesburg night club on Wednesday afternoon. A confiscated pipe bomb and its explosives were exhibited to the media and a special video tape was released to SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV and other television journalists. The blasts caused the death of 21 people and the injury of 173. "Investigation teams have been working around the clock over the past few days to hunt down those responsible for recent terror blasts and in an attempt to prevent further blasts," Gen Van der Merwe said. This team effort, co-ordinated and executed nationally, had resulted in a remarkable breakthrough, he said. "The achievement again illustrates the will, commitment and ability of the SAP [South African Police] to maintain law and order and should also be seen as a strong warning to those who wish to achieve their aims through violent means. Using violence to achieve their aims is not only futile and pointless, but will ultimately lead to their own destruction," he said. The media conference was shown 4kg of fertiliser explosive which police experts said was "amateur" but the effect of which, packed in a 12cm diameter by 60cm steel pipe, was "utterly professional". The pipe bomb had been confiscated in a roadblock at which suspect was expected. "The breakthrough must be attributed to the sheer hard work and determination of the investigation teams involved, as well as exceptional intelligence work," the police commissioner said. The breakthrough apparently started with the first arrest. A suspect was detained under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act on Sunday. Regular arrests then followed in Rustenberg, Ventersdorp and Pretoria, involving some members of the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging's elite Ystergarde. Some suspects had given themselves up. Police were confident that those arrested were the brains of the group but it could not be excluded that others were involved, including leaders. This was currently under further investigation, Gen van der Merwe said. He said the suspects were being held at various locations which were being kept secret.
