Earlier, they tried to break into the Patriarchate but the Army prevented them. After consultations with Patriarch Sfayr, they were divided into groups, each made up of approximately 60 persons, and invited for an audience with the patriarch. Patriarch Sfayr told them the following: [Begin Sfayr recording] We know why you came to Bkirki today, the same reason as some others did the day before yesterday. This issue concerns all of us, in fact it concerns all people. In today's mass we have called upon all Lebanese, be they Muslims or Christians, to pray to God to give the officials, the investigators, and the judges the moral courage to reveal the truth about what has happened and is happening. We cannot but adopt this position. We must consolidate our trust in God first and in the Lebanese judiciary second until further notice. But we hope that the route through the Lebanese judiciary will be the way to reveal the truth and will help all those who want the truth reach that end. [applause] I know what you want to tell me. We are doing all we can so that the truth can be revealed, for only the truth can save those who pursue it. Jesus Christ said: If you know the truth, it will free you. This is the position that all of you must adopt; that is, to pray to God so that the truth will come out, and then we will see what can be done. May God be with you, bless you and your children, and guide you to the right path. [applause] [end recording]
