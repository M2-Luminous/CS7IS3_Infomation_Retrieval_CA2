The political battles in the capital roll down to us in gentle waves, fortunately. But the social peace is fragile. In terms of per capita income the Maritime area is in last place in the region. The gap between rich and poor is growing. A bank employee receives 2.5 times more than a worker, three times more than a teacher, and four times more than a peasant. The two minimums -- wage and subsistence -- differ from one another tens of times over. How to beat back the wave of growing social tension and prevent the eruption of a "rebellion senseless and pitiless"? Our correspondent took this question to a surgery on personal matters at the residence of Ye. Nazdratenko, governor of the kray. [Belykh] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, on her resignation Ella Pamfilova, minister of social protection, told the press that she could not deceive people. The government was adopting another decree, as a result of which a quantity of watermarked notes would be printed. They are distributed to the poor, but frequently only when prices have exceeded the posted price many times over. What is there for needy Maritimers to hope for? [Nazdratenko] The realism of government decrees is a painful subject. Is there, say, a decree on privileges for the casualties from the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station? Yes, and very handsome it is. Has the government allocated the region money? Not one ruble. People are coming to us, to the administration, for help--there is no money. Is there a decree on officers discharged into the reserve, on apartments being built for them? Yes. And there is inflation, which is devouring the funds which were at one time allocated. One apartment instead of five--that's the arithmetic. The list could be continued ad infinitum. Take if only the first edict of the president on education and the way it has been fulfilled. All this cannot fail to stoke the people's exasperation. This runs counter to my inner convictions, incidentally. Remember one of the numerous promises of Gaydar--the favorite of young people and the West, the personification of progressive thinking? "Only bikers will feel the increase in the price of fuel." It has been felt by retirees--the most defenseless group of society. We, the kray, have been able to cover them, reduce the prices, and allow gasoline benefits. We are posting the militia, we are posting the Special Militia so that the elderly individual may fill up in peace and not be humiliated by the "leather" boys. He rides away, and half a kilometer further on that same junior mafioso stops him and siphons off the gasoline. Who is to blame? [Belykh] Nazdratenko, naturally. When people voted for the new constitution, for continuation of the reforms, they voted for you also. [Nazdratenko] I am not sure that if a ballot were conducted now, I would collect as many white balls, but I would ask people to believe in one thing--the sincerity of my motives when I attempt to do something. We are working on a decree on the economic status of the kray. We are not demanding direct financial infusions into a moribund economy, but release us from the captivity of dead schemes born of anonymous government officials somewhere in Moscow! Afford us an opportunity to manage preferential quantity regulation and licensing! The Yaroslavskiy Mining and Concentrating Works is at a standstill--people have no earnings, the community is dying. Grant it the opportunity to sell products in a profitable manner, and people will have money. Money, not "compensation payments." The infrastructure would be restored, the social sphere would revive. [Belykh] The same hopes were placed in Government Decree 1001. [Nazdratenko] True, but who torpedoed this decree? It was buried here, in the Maritime region, by Bytov and Cherepkov. I was accused of blackmailing the government. The same thing will probably be repeated with the decree. According to the principle: "If a man exists, you can pin something on him." The business of the tanker filled with radioactive waste. "Nazdratenko is lobbying a Japanese company!" Very well, you don't want a cleanup by the Japanese for free, within 20 days? Accept the alternative--18 months of construction for over $2 million. But the kray would not pay this. I have no intention of taking crumbs from pensions and children's compensation to pay some firm in Moscow for secretaries and private residences. Yes, I am a lobbyist. I lobby for the interests of the Maritimers. Only not those who roll around in Mercedes and talk with competitors in the language of lampoons and grenades. The interests of normal working people, who bring their troubles to my surgery. Whom we, the authorities, are required to provide with a normal peaceful life.
