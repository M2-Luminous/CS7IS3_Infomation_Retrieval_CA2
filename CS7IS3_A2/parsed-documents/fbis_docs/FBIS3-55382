There will be no surprises. The admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak Republics to NATO would not only not strengthen European security but could, on the contrary, exacerbate the internal political situation in Russia and complicate relations between the Western capitals and Moscow. That is Paris' position, which is supported on the whole by its allies. "The entry of East European countries to the North Atlantic Alliance would be premature today. It would fundamentally alter the very nature of the North Atlantic Alliance, which agreement envisages security guarantees in the event of a bloc member's coming under attack," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe stated in conversation with your correspondent. "However, I do have a positive attitude to the strengthening of relations between NATO and the states of East Europe and between NATO and Russia," the minister went on to stress in response to a question from IZVESTIYA; "therefore we have supported in principle the American Partnership for Peace initiative. Moreover, France and Germany intend to go further and to propose that East European countries become associate members of the Western European Union." Partnership for Peace, the minister went on to explain, will not become a cordon sanitaire between Europe and Russia. On the contrary, this initiative is addressed to Moscow, whose participation will be only welcome. Premature membership of NATO for Poland, Hungary, and other countries would, on the contrary, play the role of a kind of cordon sanitaire. Given such conditions, Paris favors a more flexible form of cooperation with them. Europe has not been a peaceful and stable continent in recent years, the minister also said. Alongside the instability in Russia -- our great partner --crises continue in other parts of Europe. Therefore it is essential that we engage first and foremost in preventive activity. To that end France is calling a conference on stability in Europe, which will take place in Paris in April and to which Russia and the United States have been invited.
