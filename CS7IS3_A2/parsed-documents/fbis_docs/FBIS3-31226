No foreign planes flew over the Romanian territory to bring supplies to any side involved in the ongoing conflict in former Yugoslavia. Romania strictly observes the embargo imposed by the United Nations. The news circulated by these publications is probably part of a scenario to brainwash public, the communique reads.
