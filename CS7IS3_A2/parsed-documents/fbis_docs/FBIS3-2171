Speaking at the extended meeting of the cabinet in the Kremlin, Yeltsin described as "wrong" the slogan of "reform the economy at any cost." The people may reject a huge-burden reform, the president pointed out. The meeting is attended by government ministers, leaders of state committees and other federal executive bodies, as well as Parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders and heads of local governments. The meeting's focus is to discuss economic performances in 1993 and reform tasks for this year. "The government is facing most complicated tasks," said Yeltsin. As to the strikes in the coal-mining regions, the president said, "it is inadmissible to delay the payment of wages for several months. I am closely watching the developments and the position of the labor unions." "Of course, emergency decisions will be made, but let those who delay the payment for coal and the payment of wages be the first to shoulder the responsibility," he said. The president also stressed the need to curb the growing inflation rate, and deepen reforms in the industrial, agricultural and financial spheres.
