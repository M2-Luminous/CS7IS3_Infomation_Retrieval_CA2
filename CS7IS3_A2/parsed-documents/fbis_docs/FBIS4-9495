He said that he opposes the attempt by certain political forces to utilize the grave economic situation in the country to put pressure on the government. According to Aleksandur Tomov, to prevent the emergence of a vacuum in the government and economic stagnation, the political forces must reach a consensus on the issue of what changes are needed by Lyuben Berov's government. The GOR has serious opinions on the cabinet's economic team, but it will not participate in political haggling over ministerial posts or propose ministers, Aleksandur Tomov said.
