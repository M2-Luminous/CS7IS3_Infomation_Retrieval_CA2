FR941004-2-00024 FR941004-2-00009 Where respondent did not provide further manufacturing costs for certain products, we disregarded sales of those products in our preliminary margin calculation. Foreign Market Value In order to determine whether BKL had a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as the basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. On this basis, we determined that the home market was viable. We calculated FMV based on both f.o.b. plant and delivered prices inclusive of packing, to customers in the U.K. In light of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Ad Hoc Committee of AZ&hyph;NM&hyph;TX&hyph;FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States , 13 F. 3d 398 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from the FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market inland freight. We deducted rebates, where appropriate, on home market sales. We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. In addition, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in credit charges between the two markets, pursuant to CFR 353.56(a)(2). In calculating home market credit expense, we used the weighted-average interest rate paid by respondent on short-term borrowings denominated in British pounds. In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the weighted-average interest rate paid by respondent on short-term dollar borrowings. For a further discussion of the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation, please see Memorandum from Barbara R. Stafford to Susan G. Esserman (September 26, 1994) on file in room B&hyph;099 of the U.S. Department of Commerce. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1), we deducted home market indirect selling expenses as an offset to the U.S. commissions, but capped this deduction by the amount of the ESP commissions and indirect selling expenses. We adjusted for VAT in accordance with our practice ( see ``United States Price'' section of this notice.) Cost of Production Petitioner alleged that BKL made home market sales during the POI at prices below its cost of production (``COP''). Based on petitioner's allegations and after examining the evidence on the record, we concluded that we had reasonable grounds to ``believe or suspect'' that sales were made below COP. Thus, we initiated a COP investigation pursuant to section 773(b) of the Act. We performed a product-specific COP test, in which we examined whether each home market sale was priced below that product's COP. The Department defines COP as the sum of direct material, direct labor, variable and fixed factory overhead, general expenses, and packing expense, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.51(c). ( See, e.g., Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Polyethylene Terephthalate Film, Sheet, and Strip From the Republic of Korea (59 FR 35098, 35099, July 8, 1994).) We compared the COP for each product to the home market unit price, net of rebates, movement expenses, and indirect expenses. We relied on submitted COP information except for the calculation of financing expense. The submitted calculation was based on the combination of the financial statements of BKL and its parent company without taking into account elimination of intercompany transactions. Therefore, we recalculated financing expense using the parent company financial statements only. In accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we also examined whether the home market sales of each product were made at prices below their COP in substantial quantities over an extended period of time, and whether such sales were made at prices that would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade. To satisfy the requirement of 773(b)(1) that below cost sales be disregarded only if made in substantial quantities, the following methodology was used. For each product where less than ten percent, by quantity, of the home market sales during the POI were made at prices below the COP, we included all sales of that model for the computation of FMV. For each product where ten percent or more, but less than 90 percent, of the home market sales during the POI were priced below the COP, we excluded from the calculation of FMV those home market sales which were priced below the COP, provided that the below-cost sales of that product were made over an extended period of time. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales were at prices below the COP, and such sales were over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales of that product and calculated FMV based on CV. In order to determine whether below-cost sales had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months in which below-cost sales occurred for each product to the number of months in the POI in which that product was sold. If a product was sold in fewer than three months during the POI, we did not exclude sales unless there were below cost sales in each month of sale. If a product was sold in three or more months, we did not exclude the below-cost sales unless there were below-cost sales in at least three months during the POI.

Constructed Value For those products without an adequate number of sales at prices equal to or greater than the COP, we based FMV on constructed value (``CV''), pursuant to section 773(b)(2) of the Act. We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit, in accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act. We relied on submitted CV information except for the calculation of financing expense, which we recalculated as described in the ``Cost of Production'' section of this notice. We included in our calculation of CV: (1) the greater of BKL's general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture (``COM''), as appropriate, and; (2) for profit, the greater of BKL's profit or the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses. Currency Conversion We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Critical Circumstances Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from the U.K. Section 733(e)(1) of the Act provides that the Department will determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist if: (A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this investigation, or (ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and (B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.
