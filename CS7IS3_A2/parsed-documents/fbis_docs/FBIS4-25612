The first leap is to abolish the system of people's communes and adopt the contracted responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output. This is tremendous progress, and we must unswervingly uphold the new practice for a long time to come. The second leap will come when we successfully adapt ourselves to the needs of scientific farming and socialized production, expand agricultural operations to an appropriate scale, and promote the collective economy. This is additional great progress which can only be accomplished through a long process." I. "First Leap" in Rural Reform and Development Brought About an Historic Change in Rural Economy. As a result of the abolition of the system of people's communes and the adoption of the contracted responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, the rural productive forces have been brought well into line with production relations, rural households are gradually becoming a primary main body of the production and operation of commodities, productive forces have been freed and developed, the micro structure of the rural economy has experienced fundamental change, and miraculous growth has been registered in all major indicators of the rural economy. At present, the progress of the rural reform is giving impetus to urban reform, while the latter, in return, is pushing forward the former. The organic integration of urban and rural reform has opened up a new chapter in the history of rural economic development. The rural economic structural reform has not only brought comprehensive development to the rural economy, but also given mighty support to the rapid growth of the entire national economy. It has not only changed the economic and social structures of rural areas, but also provided us with useful experience in shifting the highly concentrated planned economic structure toward a socialist market economic structure. And it has not only brought benefits to peasants, but also provided them with democracy. The effective realization of the "first leap" in China's rural reform and development has laid a sound foundation for eliminating the backwardness and poverty of rural areas, and for providing peasants with sufficient food and clothing and then helping them attain a "fairly comfortable life." II. "Sudden Emergence and Rapid Development" of Township and Town Enterprises Is an Inevitable Result of Realization of the "First Leap," Thus Opening Up Broad Prospects for Industrialization and Urbanization of Rural Areas. Thanks to the adoption of the contracted responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, rural labor productivity was enhanced rapidly, and large numbers of rural labor forces were freed. Under the then situation of a lagging urbanization process, it was an inevitable result of the "first leap" that these freed labor forces were shifted to township and town enterprises as well as to tertiary industries. The development of township and town enterprises has not only brought peasants bigger income and accelerated the shift of rural labor forces, but it has also gradually turned the rural economy into a non-agricultural and urbanized economy, helped pure rural laborers develop themselves into professionals of a pluralistic society, and changed the unitary collective-owned economy into a diversified economy that relies mainly on the public ownership. As a product of the socialist market economy, township and town enterprises are gaining increasingly greater strength amidst market competition. Moreover, through their successful exploration of how to develop the socialist market economy, they have proved to be a new growth point in China's national economy, which is full of life and vitality. Alongside the rapid development of township and town enterprises, a number of new-type medium and small cities and townships are undergoing an expansion process. The present practice by which the majority of surplus rural labor forces are shifted to township-town enterprises and tertiary industries, while the minority make up the deficiencies of the urban manpower, has accelerated China's urbanization process and brought about a fundamental change in the dualistic urban-rural structure. What is more, it has also helped the rural market to develop from a sealed regional market into an open market which exercises management by grouping enterprises and keeps well in line with the usual practices of both domestic and international markets. Some foreign experts have acclaimed China's township and town enterprises as another great miracle created by China's successful rural reform. China has long been plagued by a situation in which the labor supply demand, a labor market has not yet taken shape, peasants are poorly informed, and the service system remains imperfect. As a result, peasants are swarming into cities blindly, creating various problems of urban management. These problems can only be solved through deepening of reform. On the other hand, due to its traditional covertness, the surplus rural labor power will not produce as huge a social pressure as that created by an unemployed urban population. However, we must not lower our guard. In 1993, the total number of China's surplus labor force in rural areas stood at about 120 million; yet by the year 2000, China's rural labor force will total about 500 million, registering an average growth of 10 million new laborers each year. According to the statistics that an average of 5 million rural laborers have shifted to non-agricultural industries every year during the past 15 years, the surplus rural labor force will reach about 150 million with the addition of the present over 100 million. [figures as published] Failure to provide appropriate guidance to these surplus rural laborers will result in a huge waste of manpower and also many serious social problems. The only way to solve this problem is to gradually expedite the urbanization process of rural areas, turn agricultural labor power into non-agricultural manpower, reform the existing dualistic urban-rural residence management system step by step, put into practice a unified system on floating residences in both urban and rural areas, and give shape to a unified urban-rural labor market. III. Gradually Realizing the "Second Leap" Is the Future Orientation of Rural Reform and Development. It is an historical process to advance gradually from the "first leap" to the "second leap." Since this process cannot be fulfilled completely in a brief space of time, there must be a transitional period which aims at further emancipating and developing productive forces. Changes have now taken place in the rural economic foundation, economic ties between urban and rural areas are becoming tighter, and rural economic reform is more exposed to the impact produced by other structural reforms, including fiscal and taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade. Under such a situation, in order to bring about the "second leap" in rural reform, instead of conducting reform only in isolated individual fields, we should uphold the reform principle of "promoting the whole while making key breakthroughs" in accordance with the general design of urban-rural integration. Firstly, we will adapt ourselves to the demands of both domestic and international markets, and promote the comprehensive reform of the socialist market economic structure. We will apply appropriate policies to protect prices of major agricultural products and at the same time establish a system for stockpiling special-purpose grain reserves as well as risk funds for grain production. Secondly, we will adopt new policies for the readjustment of industrial and agricultural investment ratios. Third, efforts will be made to gradually unfold reform of the land system. Land contracts will be extended for another 30 years after their expiration, so that farmers have the right to use their land for a long period of time. To avoid the situation in which land operations are restricted to a small scale and land is divided into bits and pieces, which is not beneficial to scale operation and technological progress, we advocate during the land contract period of the method "increasing or decreasing the number of people without increasing or decreasing the land." Meanwhile, we will establish a land circulation market, thus creating conditions for extensive application of scientific and technological results and for the socialization of production. During the course of implementation, all localities are required to act in line with the realistic development levels of productive forces, work out measures in light of local conditions, provide guidance to different types of areas, adopt a positive and steady approach, and proceed in an orderly way. We should refrain from exercising rigid uniformity and applying fixed formulas, for history has shown that by hastily readjusting production relations regardless of real development levels, we are unable to fulfill the goal of developing productive forces and improving the material and cultural lives of the people. On the contrary, such practice will lead to a negative situation and sabotage productive forces to a serious extent.
