FR941110-2-00040 FR941110-2-00010 [A&hyph;588&hyph;834] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Antidumping Duty Investigation of Stainless Steel Angle From Japan Agency: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bill Crow, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0116. PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION: We preliminarily determine that stainless steel angle (SSA) from Japan is being sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 23052, May 4, 1994), the following events have occurred. On May 23, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination in this proceeding (see ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;699). On June 2, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) issued an antidumping questionnaire to Aichi Steel Works, Ltd., (Aichi). Aichi submitted responses to the Department's questionnaire in June and July 1994. On August 23, 1994, the Department issued a supplemental sales questionnaire to the respondent. Aichi submitted its response to the supplemental questionnaire on September 19, 1994. On August 17, 1994, the petitioners, Slater Steels Corporation and United Steelworkers of America, requested that the Department postpone the preliminary determination until November 4, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c)(1994). The Department granted this request on August 24, 1994 (59 FR 44966, August 31, 1994). On August 10, 1994, the petitioners alleged that Aichi was selling the subject merchandise in the home market at below its cost of production. On August 16, 1994, the respondent submitted comments which questioned the methodology employed in the petitioners' below-cost allegation. On August 22, 1994, the petitioners revised their original cost allegation. After analyzing the petitioners' allegation, we found reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales in the home market were being made at less than the cost of production. Consequently, on September 7, 1994, the Department initiated an investigation of sales below cost for Aichi's home market sales, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.51. On this date, we presented Aichi with Section D of the antidumping questionnaire concerning cost of production. Aichi submitted its response to Section D of the questionnaire on October 17, 1994.
