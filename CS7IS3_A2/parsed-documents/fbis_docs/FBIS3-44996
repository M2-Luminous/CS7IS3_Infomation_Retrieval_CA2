Liu Jiang said: In 1993, which is about to end soon, China's agriculture and rural economy have maintained their steady development: there has been an overall increase in the output of grain, meat, eggs, milk, and aquatic products; village and town enterprises have been developing in a sustained, speedy, and efficient manner; and farmers' per capita net income has increased to a certain extent. He said that the all-round development of agriculture and the rural economy has played a positive role in ensuring the smooth progress of reform and opening to the outside world as well as ensuring the sustained growth of the national economy. Liu Jiang pointed out: The new situation regarding the reform and development of the national economy in 1994 requires that agriculture plays a greater role. Therefore, while focusing on the goal of stabilizing the supply of farm products and increasing farmers' income, the agricultural sector should strive to do the following three tasks well: First, it is necessary to stabilize the development of the output of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. On the prerequisite of basically stabilizing the sown acreage of grain, it is necessary to boost per unit area yield by relying on science and technology, continue optimizing the product mix, and improve the quality of grain; at the same time, every means should be taken to reverse the situation regarding the decline of cotton output in the past two years by restoring the planting acreage, ensuring rational geographical distribution, improving methods of controlling plant diseases and insect pests, in order to raise total grain output to the level of a normal year. Second, it is necessary to raise the "shopping basket program" to a new level by vigorously developing animal husbandry, aquatic production, and vegetable production so as to supply more and better nonstaple food to the urban and rural population. Third, it is necessary to focus on economic results in developing village and town enterprises. Liu Jiang said: To meet the need of establishing and developing a socialist market economy in rural areas, the Ministry of Agriculture has decided to vigorously strengthen the construction of an information network to store information about policies, laws, and regulations about capital construction projects, science and technology, and qualified professionals. Through this network and the storing of information about the four aspects, the Ministry of Agriculture will be in a better position to exercise overall control over the country's agriculture.
