FR940504-1-00024 FR940504-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;25&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Aircraft Limited Model 4101 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, that currently requires inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron quadrants, replacement of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. This action would require installation of new swivel bearings in the aileron quadrants, which would terminate the inspection requirement. This proposal is prompted by the development of a modification that eliminates the need to inspect repetitively. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by June 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;25&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
