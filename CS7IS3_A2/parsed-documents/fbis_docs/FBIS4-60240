He hoped it would be the start of energetic action by which Israel would amass a bank of prisoners that eventually would ease the release of Ron Arad and the missing IDF [Israel Defense Forces] men. The Tzomet party congratulated the IDF. Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan said it was the only method the Arabs understood, and such actions should be continued with determination and cunning. The chairman of the Meretz faction in the Knesset, Ran Kohen, praised the Army for its precise and perfect execution of the abduction. Normally he disapproves of carrying off people, but this time it was justified in view of the callousness and wickedness of the jailers of Israeli prisoners. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 21 May adds: "The Moledet faction praised the IDF for the perfect execution of the operation."]
