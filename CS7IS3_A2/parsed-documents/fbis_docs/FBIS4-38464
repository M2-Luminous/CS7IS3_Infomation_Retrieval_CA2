"It's not the president who needs an army, but the people who want to live and work in peace," he told the national army's flight brigade. He said he was convinced that Moldova's sound forces supported the government's efforts to consolidate the state and strengthened the armed forces. "The creation of armed forces was not a caprice, but a strong necessity, given the current complicated geopolitical situation. Obviously, Moldova cannot exist without armed forces capable of curbing encroachments on its state system, integrity and independence," said Snegur. He also said he favored further improvement in the armed forces on the basis of other countries' experience. Speaking about the armed forces' future, Snegur said that the army must be oriented to the norms and standards of the western European states with solid democratic traditions. He believes, at the same time, that Moldova must have small but well-trained and well-equipped mobile armed forces capable of ensuring Moldova's security. He is convinced that the army must not be a burden for the nation. He emphasized that despite the problems of the transitional period, the government will find ways of financing and equipping the army, and urged the armed forces to help the nation solve economic problems. Speaking about the current political situation, Snegur said that after the multi-party parliamentary elections a cardinally new political situation had taken shape, an efficient deputies' corps came into being and the Agrarian-Democratic Party formed up a reformer government. All this is expected to help the nation overcome the economic crisis. He also said that there were objective difficulties which slowed down the implementation of a resolute economic stabilization policy and measures to enhance the population's living standards, above all unfavorable weather conditions and price liberalization. He expressed confidence, however, that all of these problems would be overcome if the government were supported and understood by the entire population, including servicemen.
