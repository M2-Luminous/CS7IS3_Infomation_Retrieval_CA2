"They have nowhere to leave and pose no threat to the national security. Besides, they receive pensions from the Russian Defence Ministry", Kozyrev told Russian mass media chiefs on Tuesday. "Leaders of the Baltic republics are intelligent people and clearly realise that the problem is artificial. However, they remain hostages of the political situation", Kozyrev said and added that he is pessimistic about an early solution of the problem of Russian retired military living in Estonia. The main Russian task is that "military pensioners in the Baltics are not offended and humiliated", the minister stressed.
