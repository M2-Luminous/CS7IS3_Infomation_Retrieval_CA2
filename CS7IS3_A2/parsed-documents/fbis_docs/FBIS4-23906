The impasse is embarrassing Mr Modise by frustrating the expectations of his closest supporters, who see the SANDF opposition as a last-ditch attempt to retain white control of the military command structure. Calls for Mr Modise to exert his political authority over the generals are rising as he faces a personal test this week with a bid to persuade government leaders to appoint a deputy minister to help him restructure and re-orient the defence force. Ronnie Kasrils, Mr Modise's long-term MK ally and confidant, is favoured for the post, if the minister can break through the ceiling of 12 deputy ministers. Mr Kasrils, who has been attending official briefings at Mr Modise's side, favours moves to change the complexion and image of the SANDF with the appointment of black generals. He would give powerful support to Mr Modise in forcing the generals to compromise. The headquarters generals are insisting on pre-election agreements that appointments and ranking of MK officers could only be based on internationally accepted military standards. This would exclude many veteran MK commanders. Senior MK officers can claim 30 or more years of guerrilla warfare experience and training in African and Eastern Bloc military doctrine. But many do not have academic qualifications and the breadth of command demanded for high office by a modern conventional defence force. A Defence Ministry source confirmed this week that an MK list suggesting 17 names for leadership posts had been sent back by the SANDF with a demand that it be cut to seven names. While the arguments are centred on two vacant positions at SANDF headquarters -- chief of staff (effectively second in command) and chief of staff intelligence -- the outcome will have a direct effect on the ranking of all MK cadres being integrated into the defence force. MK officers fear that assessment boards will not recognise ranks and commissions awarded in the guerrilla army. The chief of staff position, vacant since the retirement in November of Lieutenant-General Pierre Steyn, has been widely expected to go to Siphiwe Nyanda, who succeeded Mr Modise as commander of MK. As chief-of-staff he would be heir apparent to General Meiring. Mr Nyanda, 43, a former sports journalist who returned from exile in 1988 to head Operation Vula, has spent the past two years guiding MK towards integration, but senior SANDF sources reject him because "he is not qualified". Similarly, attempts to moot MK's head of operations Lambert Moloi for the SANDF intelligence chief's post (which also carries the rank of lieutenant-general), are being dismissed "because he does not have the right background". "The generals do not realise that there is a political imperative to make provision for our people if the military is to be seen to change and be seen as legitimate by the whole country," said a ministerial adviser. "The SANDF command just cannot remain lily-white. There has to be political intervention and acceptance of affirmative action." Meanwhile, initial hiccups at the Wallmannstal assembly area for MK soldiers being prepared for integration appear to have been overcome. The number of MK cadres listed for integration has been settled at 26,864, more than double the 12,000 originally expected.
