Beside Peru, the Gran includes Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Minister Canale left for Caracas to attend a meeting of the Cartagena Accord Commission. She said Peru will resume all its commitments in the Gran "as distortions affecting regional trade are eliminated." Canale thus alluded to the fact that Peru's partners in the Gran have an external common tariff of four different scales (5, 10, 15, and 25 percent) while Peru virtually has one 15 percent rate. Before leaving, Canale said: "Instead of thinking of an urgent return to the group, we must consider how to strengthen Andean trade." She added: "We will consider returning as tariff distortions are eliminated." Peru suspended its participation in the commercial program of the Gran in August 1992, with the agreement of its partners, until December 1993 when it requested an indefinite extension. Meanwhile, Peruvian trade with the other four members of the group continues through bilateral agreements which, according to Canale, will be strengthened in the next few months.
