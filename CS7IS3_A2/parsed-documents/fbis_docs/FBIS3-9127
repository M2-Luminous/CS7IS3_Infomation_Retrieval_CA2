The parliament of Yugoslavia's Republic of Serbia on Thursday endorsed a new cabinet, headed by Marjanovic. The cabinet includes five vice-premiers, 20 departmental ministers and four ministers without portfolio. Marjanovic said in Serbian television's prime-time news programme that the new government would act immediately and felt confident that they would manage to maintain the national currency, the dinar, stable and boost production. This is only the beginning, and any substantial economic recovery should be left for later, he added. Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) has lost 25 million dollars through U.N. sanctions clamped two years ago for the country's alleged involvement in Bosnia's civil war. The figure would be much higher if the total cost had been calculated of manitaining the 600,000 refugees from the war-zones registered in Yugoslavia, 95 percent of whom have been accommodated with private families.
