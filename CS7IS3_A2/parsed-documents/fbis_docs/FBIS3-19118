Nevertheless, at the same time, he gives the Czech Republic a chance of possible membership in NATO and the European Union [EU]. He also emphasizes that the alliance's policy cannot be dictated from Moscow. Therefore, MLADA FRONTA DNES asked him for an interview. By the way, 70-year-old Kooijmans will accompany Netherlands Queen Beatrix on her visit to Prague in three weeks time. [Vesely] The Czech Republic will officially become part of the Partnership for Peace initiative this week. Do you have any idea what our next step with regard to NATO could be and when the time will come for this? [Kooijmans] The future is so uncertain that it would be better for you to banish any exaggerated hopes. The admission of individual countries into NATO would, after all, just mean a new dividing line across Europe. This could provoke a reaction from the countries on the other side of this line and lead to a threat to stability in Europe. The Partnership in its original form envisaged that all the countries of Central and East Europe would be treated equally. During consultations with you and among the allies, this concept was gradually changed. Each applicant has to progress and do something for membership. It is apparent, however, that given proper coordination among the allies, it is possible to establish a differentiated relationship between NATO and the individual partners. This gives them a chance to gradually become familiar with the alliance. The changing developments in Europe must also be taken into consideration in the future. It must be clear to everyone that countries like the Czech Republic will have closer ties with NATO than, for instance, Kazakhstan or Georgia. [Vesely] Nevertheless, Yeltsin maintains that not only the East European countries, but even other states in Europe must not give a thought to NATO before Russia. What do you intend to do about this? [Kooijmans] The alliance's policy cannot be dictated from Moscow. We must, it is true, take into consideration what Russia says, but do not forget that the Western European Union (WEU) and NATO complement each other. Each new member of the European Union must, consequently, adapt its relations with the WEU. Although a new member will only be an observer at first, it will not avoid membership later. The guarantees ensuing from this are similar to those from NATO. This means that the moment a country -- let us say, Sweden or Finland -- becomes a member, apart from the Western European [Union] partners, the United States is also indirectly interested in it. Moscow should not overlook the fact that being a member of the WEU means the same as being a member of NATO. Even so, I do not see any threat to Russia here. [Vesely] When, in your opinion, should the Czech Republic submit an application to the European Union, which is currently being expanded to include four more countries? [Kooijmans] A country may submit an application whenever it wants. It will come first to the European Commission, which has to give its point of view. If it is positive, the negotiations can begin. I understand the reasoning of the countries from your region that it is necessary to submit the application as soon as possible, since the negotiations could be long. It took a total of nine years for Spain and six years for Portugal. It has only taken two years for the Scandinavians and the Austrians, but the four European Free Trade Association countries were already participants in the agreement on the European Economic Area. It has a regime that made association with the Twelve easier. In your case, this will not only require political will, but -- in my opinion -- it will also involve a formidable process of harmonizing employment, social, ecological, taxation, and other standards. [Vesely] It is not pleasant just to be in the anteroom and wait until others make a decision for you. [Kooijmans] You are right -- if these were to be negotiations between a superior and an inferior, then, this would spoil the whole atmosphere. Fortunately, things are different: The state applying for membership is not the only one who can benefit. The entire Union will also benefit. We know that Prague has a certain tendency to proceed independently of the other countries in your region. However, although the Czech Republic will be ready for admission before others -- and this has to be taken into consideration -- the European Union will not waive the comparisons that unite all the new candidates as a group. Your advantage -- compared with the Finns, Swedes, Norwegians, or Austrians -- is that you do not have an arctic agriculture or Alps, and so your situation is more like that of the Netherlands or Germany. Despite this, it will be very difficult to draw the negotiations to an end. After all, this will involve a transition from one system to a completely different system.
