Why? [Al-Shu'aybi] It is not a threat, but an expression of our party's stand on the preparations under way by the PNA. We have serious observations about the PNA's procrastination in the adoption of sufficient and necessary measures to seriously and directly assume its role, so that an authority vacuum does not occur in the territories from which the Israeli authority has withdrawn. [Mu'addi] What are these reservations, doctor? [Al-Shu'aybi] First, brother Yasir 'Arafat and the essential PLO leading cadre should quickly return to the territories. This particularly applies to the group that followed up the negotiations with Israel on the Cairo agreement. Now that brothers Nabil Sha'th and 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya have returned, it is necessary that other brothers who took part in the formulation on this agreement return so they can directly supervise its immediate implementation. Administrative and financial issues should be completed so this authority can assume its role. So far, we still feel there is procrastination and that the question is not taken seriously. [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi, is this stand by you perhaps because of the marginalization of the FIDA status in the PNA? [Al-Shu'aybi] This is irrelevant, for FIDA has willingly selected its two portfolios. Brother Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has selected the culture and arts portfolio. I selected the youth care and sports portfolios. In fact, all those involved have selected their portfolios with complete freedom. So far, we cannot say that serious work has started in either of these two fields, or any other field. When we have made some observations public, they were intended to be addressed to all fields of Palestinian authority rather than those two fields only. I believe the vacuum resulting from the PNA's failure so far to assume its role seriously damages more than only FIDA and its representatives on the PNA. [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi, a last question: Have contacts been held with the PLO leadership, particularly Yasir 'Arafat in this regard? [Al-Shu'aybi] The FIDA representatives in Tunis are authorized to raise this issue with brother Yasir 'Arafat. I believe a special session was held in Tunis yesterday to discuss these issues, including the FIDA observations about the preparations so far. [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, member of the PNA, thank you very much. [Al-Shu'aybi] Not at all.
