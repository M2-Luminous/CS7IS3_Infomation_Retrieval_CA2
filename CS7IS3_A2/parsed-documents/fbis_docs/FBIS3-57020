The KGB chief said that this "act of international gangsterism" was possible because the KGB did not control the activities of the Interior Ministry. Vladimir Yegorov, the Interior Minister, told parliament that officers of the Belarusian Interior Ministry detained the two men in the presence of two Lithuanian law enforcement officers. He said that the Belarusian police did not have a written arrest warrant but this action had been discussed by Interior Ministry and prosecution officers, in particular by the interior minister and the prosecutor general of Belarus. In Yegorov's words, the men involved in the detention believed that an arrest warrant did exist, which is why the car carrying the Lithuanian special service men and the detainees left for the Belarusian-Lithuanian border. Pyotr Kravchenko, Belarusian Foreign Minister, said that his ministry had not received any messages that were required by the appropriate agreement between Belarus and Lithuania about the arrest.
