FBIS4-55936 "dreeu101__a94026" FBIS-EEU-94-101-A Daily Report 24 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia President's Office Rejects Allegations President's Office Rejects Allegations AU2405213694 Prague CTK in English 1948 GMT 24 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2405213694 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 24 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal Kovac's Office today described ex-premier Vladimir Meciar's allegation that the head of state violated his constitutional duty and civil rights by refusing to call a referendum as a distortion of the facts. Meciar made the claim last Saturday [21 May] that in early March Kovac refused to call a referendum on early elections and on the abolition of the mandates of "turncoat" deputies and on the origin of the money used in privatization although more than 350.000 signatures required by the constitution were collected on the petition for a referendum. Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) intends to lodge a complaint in parliament, the Council of European and at international human rights organizations. "The intention to submit the fabricated affair to international organization could only be aimed at casting doubt about Slovak Republic being a democratic country if its president allegedly violated the constitution. The HZDS leadership has placed its partial interests above the interests of the republics and its good name abroad," says a statement issued by the Presidential Office and given to CTK today. The statement points out that because of the lack of some data on the petition lists, required by the law, the number of valid signatures decreased to less than 325,000, less than legally required for a referendum. The statement says that the petition rolls are still at everybody's disposal to check the correctness of the Presidential Office's decision. These facts confirm that the president could not call a referendum and that he did not violate the constitution. On the contrary, by calling a referendum he would have violated the constitution, which the president would not do, the statement says.
