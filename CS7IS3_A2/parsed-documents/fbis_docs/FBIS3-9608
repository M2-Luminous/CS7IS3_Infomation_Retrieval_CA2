The reason the convoy was stopped, according to the announcement by the Information Ministry, was the demand by the Serbian side to be given 30 percent of the goods from the convoy as a toll for passing through the territory under its control. Such a gesture by the Serbian side at a time when the international community is exerting new efforts to find a peaceful solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina not only shows that these efforts are being ignored but that the aggressor has no intention of renouncing its blackmailing methods. By making it impossible for a convoy to pass through, one threatens the freedom and rights established by the agreement on opening blue corridors and thereby the basic principles of international humanitarian rights, it is said, among other things, in the information issued by the Information Ministry of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
