Widespread Leaks by Small Newspapers Whether or not Hsi Yang was really engaged in activity incompatible with his status as a reporter, and whether or not facts about the incident have been concealed, the outside world cannot know. But in all fairness, the "criminal evidence" revealed by the government about Hsi Yang is about two economic news items, which is very difficult to link to "national security" and "state secrets." Two of the "secrets" were fairly inconspicuous news items that appeared in Ming Pao in May and July and were said to be harmful to national security, which is very farfetched. In recent years, one could say that news of the inner workings and so forth of many economic policies and reform measures, which have been far more sensitive than the above-mentioned news items, has spread far and wide. Many domestic publications, such as JINGJI CANKAO BAO, BEIFANG SHIBAO, ZUZHI RENSHI BAO and other semi-official newspapers, have frequently revealed materials relating to economic reform policy, and even materials as politically sensitive as trade policy documents that have not yet been announced. These publications can be easily purchased by Hong Kong reporters or tourists who are visiting the mainland. Furthermore, amid international concern over human rights, national security departments should not take such drastic measures just because of a few lines that appeared in a Hong Kong publication a few months ago. However, how is it that another Hong Kong reporter has stepped on the "land mine" within less than year? How is it that Communist China has again self-righteously and with criminal evidence in hand clubbed an outside reporter? Internal Preventive Measures Have Been Strengthened Last year, after the incident of the Kuai Pao reporter Liang Huimin, China's security and propaganda departments issued an internal memo. The memo severely criticized and reprimanded party and government cadres at all levels who ignored the principles of national security and legality and provided opportunities for outside reporters to steal secrets during the historic reforms and opening up. It also reprimanded "a very small number of our own news media who sold state secrets for profit." As a result, Communist China's security departments clearly redefined the general policy on news gathering by outside reporters in China: "We must uphold reform and opening up and make friends far and wide, and facilitate normal news gathering work, and thereby actively provide guidance." However, we must also "strengthen limits and reduce negative effects," and, in particular, regarding those targeted by the security departments "we must mercilessly expose and attack the very small number of unscrupulous people (reporters) who steal state secrets and violate national laws." This internal memo instructs the national security enforcement divisions to "select suitable targets and select suitable methods" to "expose" the "illegal activities" of foreign reporters to "intimidate" outside reporters. As an illustration of this memo, Beijing's public security department sentenced Xinhua reporter Wu Shisheng, a suspect in the Liang Huimin case, to life imprisonment, and sentenced Wu's wife, Ma Tao, to six months in prison. This case raised concerns in legal and media circles in China and abroad. This time, Xi Yang is another target under attack as an outside reporter who "acted improperly." Restrictions Have Tightened, News Gathering Is Difficult The mainland propaganda departments' emphasis on the "angle of the news" is in a nutshell: "Report only the good news; reporting of bad news is prohibited." If this is violated and the violation is light, you must be investigated and cleared; if it is serious, you lose your position and publication is stopped. This is fundamentally different from the "freedom of the press" enjoyed outside. When Hong Kong reporters go to the mainland, with the exception of hot news items, they all find ways to dig out their own "exclusives" or "inside sources" to meet the needs of commercial competition among publications. Therefore, there are inevitably people who "go too fast" or "apply too much energy" and violate the taboo. Furthermore, it is a fact that some people will pay a monetary price to get news. There is only a fine line between "news" and "intelligence." Therefore, it is difficult for outside reporters in China to avoid stepping on the "mine field." There are other factors that make it difficult for Hong Kong reporters to gather news on the mainland. First, since the practice of giving news briefings began, all important news is announced through formal official channels, which therefore increases the transparency of the news. Second, widespread trade and commercial activities have led to the dissemination abroad, through various channels, of social news from all over the mainland. As a result, in recent years the reports in the Hong Kong and Taiwan media concerning mainland social problems have been numerous and detailed. Third, since 1990, the burgeoning "corps of writers" in Beijing, Shanghai and other large cities who work for outside publications are mostly active persons with many sources of information. The rumors and gossip they hear rival the special reports of reporters. All of these factors undoubtedly create pressure on the reporters and media members from abroad. They compete within their profession using only standard news gathering methods. Therefore, they must resort to developing their own sources of information. News gathering is not only tedious and exhausting, but you cannot limit your means or your price to gather news. Those in the media cannot deny this point. Developing New Sources of News Xi Yang, a native of Beijing, is a new immigrant who obtained a one-way permit to Hong Kong in the late 1980s. As a person with a mainland background gathering news from the mainland, Xi Yang was not a rarity. In fact, there are quite a few reporters with mainland backgrounds who are on the mainland under various pretexts carrying out news gathering activities without official permission. This has created an amusing result: If you openly apply to gather news on the mainland, your results are limited, whereas working in private, under the guise of visiting relatives, sightseeing and visiting friends, you can get impressive results. This is the reason that some news media are happy to hire as reporters people in Hong Kong who are originally from the mainland. When they return to the mainland to gather news, they get twice the results with half the work compared to those born and raised in Hong Kong who go to the mainland. Hong Kong reporters who return to visit relatives or friends on the mainland can find, either intentionally or unintentionally, all kinds of sources of newsworthy materials. First, by widely contacting relatives, old schoolmates and former colleagues, they can learn different views and gather different news from different levels of society and different professions, and this is very helpful in portraying certain political incidents and major social activities. Second, by choosing friends who hold leading positions or sensitive jobs and by establishing personal relations, they can have more direct access to news or more direct access to people in high positions. In recent years, there have been frequent news disclosures about previously unrevealed places on the mainland, such as prisons and labor camps, and many of these disclosures have been made possible by opportunities to interview and photograph through private channels. Third, reporters visiting relatives and friends on the mainland will inevitably have money and exchange goods, gifts or banquets, which used to be considered normal relations. Mainland cadres often make material demands on friends from abroad, and often give materials or internal information in exchange. Whether international or unintentional, once a "leaking situation" is exposed, these activities by outside reporters inevitably become "criminal evidence" used by the public security and pubic safety departments. Normal banquets and gifts can become evidence of "bribery," and conversations between friends can become "spying." The reason why the Xi Yang incident has aroused the attention and concern of the Hong Kong media is that the public security departments have not made very definite and detailed announcements, and their charges are murky. Concerned department should clearly define the difference between "secrets" and "news." Reducing Levels of Secrecy; Outside Is Relaxed, Inside Is Tight At the beginning of this year, the National Security Bureau decided to carry out necessary reforms of the national security system to meet the needs of the economic reforms. Hundreds of thousands of secret documents from central to local governments were declassified, and they redefined the standards of security classification. This was publicized in the official weekly Liaowang, and the article emphasized that "even though secrecy classification has been reduced, the maintenance of secrecy must be further reinforced." The main target of this prevention of leaks is outside reporters. The State Council's memos concerning "Reinforcing the Management of Foreign Reporters" and the "Regulations Governing Foreign Reporters and Foreign News Organizations" were disseminated to the county and regiment levels, requiring leaders at all levels to comply. There are clear guidelines regarding the approval of applications by foreign reporters to visit, and regarding which groups of applicants must be refused. In addition, the documents require that the receiving unit must "provide designated guides throughout the entire visit," that information on all activities of foreign reporters must be gathered, and that the management of outside reporters should be "relaxed on the outside, tight on the inside." Any foreign reporters singled out by security departments and placed on a blacklist will be put under the "supervision" of the security departments from the time they enter China, and all their activities and contacts will be recorded. The eyes and ears of the security departments are everywhere. They might be service workers in the hotels, they might be officials of community organizations and they could be your mainland counterparts who are working alongside you. A worker in the Guangzhou customs office admitted that because there is no comprehensive computer network, there are large holes in the information about incoming reporters. Aside from a few people who are on the security department's blacklist, ordinary incoming reporters usually are not easily controlled by the State Security Bureau. Furthermore, more and more points of entry are being opened up on the mainland, and concerned departments cannot in a timely fashion monitor incoming reporters' activities. But as soon as you step on the "land mine," you become a new target. A Planned Crackdown on the Hong Kong Media It is naive to think that after 1997 the freedom of the press in Hong Kong will not be interfered with by Communist China or the government of the special zone. As everyone knows, Beijing has already done extensive studies of the Hong Kong media in preparation for formulating policies governing Hong Kong's news media and the arts, and to provide materials to take over the arena of public opinion in Hong Kong. In the late transitional stage, the general direction of the propaganda is to "maintain a foothold in two newspapers, expand the base, unite the struggle and attack key targets." The so-called "two newspapers" are Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao. "Expand the base" refers to a number of officially colored publications continuously published by Communist China in Hong Kong, such as Zi Jing, Zhonghua Wenzhe, Gangao Dongtai and so forth, which are put out at great expense. "Attack key targets" refers to the abovementioned memos' "select opportune moments, select suitable targets and select suitable methods" to make a "frightening attack." The Xi Yang incident happened during the national security conference, and the prevention of secret-stealing by foreign reporters was originally one of the key topics of the conference. Therefore, the choice of Xi Yang as a target was very well-timed, and the so-called "state secrets" and the fact that "an open hearing could not be conducted" were merely bargaining chips in the hands of the government. After Kuai Pao, Ming Pao became another target of punishment. In the 3d plenary session of the 7th National People's Congress, the criminal code was amended to increase the penalty for stealing national secrets, from under five years in prison to death. Liang Huimin of Kuai Pao could have been given a heavy sentence, but was magnanimously released. This shows that criminal justice is a bargaining chip in the hands of Communist China. After the Xi Yang incident, this writer made inquiries to friends in Beijing several times. An official of the city public security department who understands the case refused to comment on the facts of the case, but one sentence revealed all: "It mainly depends on the attitude of the person." From this we can conclude that the official statement saying that Xi Yang has already "freely admitted the stealing of secrets," and that the Ming Pao chief's attitude changed from "firmly believing in Xi Yang's innocence" to a reversal on 10 October that clearly admitted Xi Yang's "mistaken" violation of the law, and an expression of regret, indicate that Communist China can deal with this case using the Liang Huimin model at any time, and the entire incident can be resolved. Whatever happens, it not only resulted in the effect of "killing the chicken to scare the monkey," but it was also one strike against Ming Pao. Therefore, the national security department is apparently the winner, and is also able to avoid criticism from overseas on the basis of human rights. The question is, whose turn is it next time?
