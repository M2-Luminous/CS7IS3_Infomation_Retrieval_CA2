On Saturday, in the course of his visit to the USA, Leonid Kravchuk told journalists that a stoppage of Ukrainian plants and factories because of gas shortages is real, and that it may jeopardize the implementation of all the previous accords, including the agreement concerning nuclear disarmament. According to Shmarov, "the president hinted that, if economic pressure is brought to bear on Ukraine, the expectation that all of the country's resources will be accumulated to accomplish that task would be futile." "So far we have requested Russia to raise supplies to the fixed level -- 100-105 million cubic meters a day," Shmarov said. "At the same time we urged local governments to halt gas supplies to plants and factories in order to give gas to the populace to hold out till the cold ends." Shmarov believes that Russia's actions connected with reduced gas supplies have no political tinge. The Gasprom is a joint-stock society, and our debt should be paid to it," he said. The deputy premier confirmed the reports that the first train carrying nuclear warheads crossed Ukraine's border with Russia on Saturday. According to him, in a cable sent to the Ukrainian government, Russia's Premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin, "guaranteed to ensure nuclear fuel supplies in accordance with our understanding within March." As Shmarov said, early this year Russia delivered a consignment of fuel for the nuclear-power plant in Chernobyl, but that fuel was delivered under the "goods against money" scheme. Under the agreement concerning Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, Russia supplies nuclear fuel in exchange for nuclear warheads only for the nuclear-power plants in Zaporozhye, Rovny and Southern Ukraine. "Another consignment of nuclear warheads is being prepared to be despatched from Ukraine," Shmarov said. However it will be despatched "only if we see adequate actions on the part of Russia," he added.
