The report states that according to data from Epidemiology, some 800,000 square kilometers of the country's territory has been affected by this illness and are classified as malaria zone. The report adds that some 2,500,000 persons live in this zone, many of whom have contracted the illness, and the majority are in a state of risk. The malaria zones are in the departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Cochabamba; there are also malaria zones north of La Paz and Potosi, and in areas of Tarija. With respect to Oruro, the report indicates that this district is free of the disease, due to its being surrounded by areas of other departments that do not have the disease. In recent years, 2,559 infants have been recorded as having the disease, but they are the only sector of the population counted because they are treated for one thing or another in health centers. The campaigns making vaccination of infants almost obligatory have facilitated such records, which is not the case for adults. In many cases, he added, adults who have suffered from malaria and recovered or died, have not been reported to the health centers or authorities so that this could be recorded. [passage omitted.]
