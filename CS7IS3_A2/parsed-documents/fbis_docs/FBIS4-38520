For nearly one month Malikov has been staying on the peninsula. His hopes lie with the visits to the Crimea coming this week by chairmen of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and the Ukrainian side of the joint group of the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Soviets for settling the conflict. Malikov added that at his recent meetings with Ukrainian and Crimean politicians he witnessed their desire to resolve problems in the negotiating process in a civilised way. When the desire to reach agreement becomes more insistent with every day, extraordinary turn for the worse can hardly be expected. As to the Security Service in the Crimea, which is under Kiev's jurisdiction unlike the forces of the Interior, the service will act in keeping with the Ukrainian Constitution as long as the present legality exists. If another decision is taken following the negotiations, the Security Service will obey, he said.
