FBIS4-30001 "dreas121__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-121-A Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Toyoda Reiterates Objection to Numerical Targets Toyoda Reiterates Objection to Numerical Targets OW2306094394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 11 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2306094394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Tatsuro Toyoda (president of Toyota Motor Corporation), chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, in a news conference on 21 June once again voiced his objection to insistence by the U.S. on setting numerical targets in the auto sector, saying, "My understanding is that it was agreed in the Japan-U.S. government-level talks not to discuss numerical targets." This remark was made in reference to the position of Andrew Cardo [name as published], managing director of the American Automobiles Manufacturers Association (AAMA), who emphasized the need for setting numerical targets in a meeting with Toyoda on 20 June. Speaking about a proposal on making the number of imported car dealers an objective criteria between Japan and the United States, he noted there are differences in the form of dealers existing in Japan and the United States. He warned against the U.S. position, insisting, "We will have to have an agreement (with the United States) on what dealers are." According to Chairman Toyoda, AAMA Managing Director Cardo paid a courtesy call on him on 20 June, and, on that occasion, expressed "a strong view in support of numerical targets," saying, "it is more convenient to have numerical targets to open up Japan's closed market." Chairman Toyoda told reporters, "We are against numerical targets, and I do not think the government agrees to them either." Regarding the objective criteria as a way of gauging the degree of market openness of Japan, Chairman Toyoda said, "The definition of criteria is not clear. Even with respect to the question of how many dealers sell both domestic cars and imported cars, I personally think we will have to reach an agreement (with the United States) on what dealers are. For instance, one dealer has many stores in Japan, while most dealers have only one store each in the United States. Meanwhile, regarding Japan's imports of auto parts from the United States, and in connection with the fact that it is becoming questionable if 1994's target of buying $19 billion worth of U.S. auto parts can be met, he avoided making a clear-cut comment, except to say, "With economic conditions changing, it is difficult to make a prediction. All companies are making considerable efforts." In 1993, 11 auto manufacturers in Japan imported $15.5 billion worth of U.S.-made products (14.1 percent more than in the preceding year). Asked about the offensive regarding imported cars in the Japanese market, he confidently replied, "There is no fear of imported cars becoming a dominant force yet." On the question of expanding specifications for compact cars, he said, "We would like to reach a conclusion by the end of summer."
