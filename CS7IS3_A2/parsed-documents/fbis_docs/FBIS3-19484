According to initial reports, which were denied today, details of the plan had been learned from Luigi Sparacio, a Cosa Nostra supersnitch who has been collaborating with authorities for several months. The first stage of the plan to do away with the two anticorruption prosecutors had already gone into operation, said well-informed sources, with a mysterious person paying 500 million lire (300,000 dollars) to an unnamed recipient to lay the groundwork for an attack. Little information has emerged about investigations into the case, since three sticks of explosives were found near the elevator that goes to Giorgianni's office in the Messina palace of justice. The explosives had no fuse or detonator. Security has been stepped up around the Messina prosecutor's office.
