HPCN looks at new information technology for, among others, industrial, commercial and scientific purposes. The project is researching into such possibilities as fast processing of television images, quicker processing by banks of payment requests, and an increase in production quality, while machines will be controlled faster by parallel processing (image processing and control). It is expected that the use of HPCN will improve performance in the field of information streams by a factor of 1,000. The new technology could have great significance for the reinforcement of both the knowledge infrastructure and the economic structure. With HPCN, the processors do not work sequentially -- as they do in traditional computers -- but parallel. This requires a different hardware construction, the peripheral equipment needs to be adapted, and other network connections have to be used. HPCN Centers The Interdepartmental Commission for Economic Structure Support (ICES) has recommended the HPCN project for subsidies to the ministries of Economic Affairs and of Education and Science. ICES assumes that with this financial injection the Netherlands can become one of the six future European HPCN centers. Both commercial and scientific institutions have already expressed their wish to collaborate on the development of HPCN. ICES has, however, named as a specific condition for receipt of subsidies the involvement in the project of medium-sized enterprises and research institutions. Furthermore, no HPCN institute will be created. The participants will set up an R&D infrastructure, through which participants in the project can be interconnected via networks.
