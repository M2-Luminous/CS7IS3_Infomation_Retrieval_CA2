They exchanged opinions on the political and economic situation in Croatia and the peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Asked if they had discussed the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereby the Croat-Bosniak Federation would be given 51 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent, the Croatian president said that is the only reasonable solution. Redman said that they had discussed the division only in general terms, while President Tudjman was informed about what is being attempted by the contact group and with ministers [as heard]. We are not at the stage where we can propose anything, Redman stressed, but we are working hard at it.
