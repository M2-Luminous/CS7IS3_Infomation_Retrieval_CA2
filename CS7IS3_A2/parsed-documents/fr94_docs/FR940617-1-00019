FR940617-1-00019 FR940617-1-00006 1.3 Placement Specific conditions apply to certain types of mail; for purposes of these standards, letter-size mailpieces include cards; flat-size mailpieces include letter-size pieces eligible for and claimed at a Barcoded rate for flats: a. The delivery address must parallel the length of a letter-size mailpiece unless that piece is paid at a single-piece rate. Letter-size mailpieces bearing an address oriented otherwise are not eligible for any presort or automation-based discount and may be nonmailable or subject to a nonstandard surcharge. First-Class card-rate pieces and all mail claimed at an automation rate are subject to additional standards. b. If flat-size mail is not prepared in an envelope, polybag, or similar complete enclosure, the delivery address must be placed so that when the mailpiece is held to read the address, the bound edge or (if applicable) final-folded edge of the mailpiece is to the right, the address is at the top of the mailpiece parallel with the top edge, and, for mailpieces prepared in a sleeve or partial wrapper, the open ends of the sleeve or partial wrapper are at the top and bottom of the mailpiece. c. If flat-size mail is prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper, the address must be placed on the enclosed material so that it can be read without moving the wrapper, or on both the wrapper and the enclosed matter, unless the address label is used to attach the wrapper to the enclosed matter. d. If mail including an attachment does not bear the name and address of both the sender and intended recipient on both the host and the attachment, the sender's name and address must be placed on the host piece or the delivery address label (which may also show the return address) must be used to affix the attachment securely to the host. Combination containers that have inseparable parts or compartments (e.g., cartons with letter-size envelopes completely and securely attached to one side) are mailable with the names and addresses on only one. * * * * * 1.5 Basic Addressing Basic addressing standards for First-, third-, and fourth-class mail and for Express Mail are in E100, E300, E400, and E500, respectively. The detailed addressing standards for second-class mail are in A200. Additional standards apply to overseas military mail, Department of State mail, mail in window envelopes, international mail, and mail claimed at any automation rate.

Also, on non-delivery point barcoded ZIP+4 rate mailpieces, the return address must not be in the OCR read area, and must not extend farther than one-half the length of the mailpiece to the right edge, and no lower than one-third the height of the mailpiece from the top (see Exhibit 4.5). 5.0 Restrictions 5.1 Dual Address A dual address is one that contains two delivery points, e.g., a street address and a post office box number (see Exhibit 5.1), and is subject to these restrictions: a. A dual address is prohibited in the delivery and return addresses on Express Mail, Priority Mail, special delivery mail, registered mail, certified mail, restricted delivery mail, and any mail claimed at a bulk or presort rate. b. Other mail bearing a dual address is delivered (or returned, as applicable) to the address immediately above the city and state (or to the post office box if both the street address and post office box are on the same line). If a ZIP+4 code or 5-digit ZIP Code is used in any dual address, it must correspond to the address element immediately above the city and state (or with the post office box number in the address if both the street address and post office box are on the same line). * * * * * 5.3 Post Office Box Mail The terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O. Box,'' ``PO Box,'' ``P. O. B.,'' ``POB,'' and other similar combinations refer exclusively to the delivery services provided by the USPS under D910 and D920, and the correct address for those services always includes one of these terms. These terms are not correctly used on mail intended for delivery through a private box system or to other types of addresses (e.g., rural route boxes). The USPS cannot ensure accurate delivery of incorrectly addressed mail. * * * * * A200‚ê£Second-Class Mail 1.0 Basic Standards
