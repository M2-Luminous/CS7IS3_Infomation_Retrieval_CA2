He states as his goal a strong, independent Ukrainian state and a righteous regime. Inability to bring order into the economy and the state, to safeguard it in the society, and to guarantee the legal protection of citizens and economic entities, mass corruption of the state structures, the venality, impotence, and incapacity of the highest state officials to protect and defend Ukraine's national interests--all these factors have become the cause of the all-encompassing crisis in our society. They also constitute a threat to its destabilization as well as the principal obstacle on the path of building an independent, united Ukrainian state. Catastrophe can be averted provided that we make a fundamental change in the government. New persons must take over the direction of our state--persons who will carry out a policy based on new principles: The Ukrainian national idea must become the optimal need for Ukraine, for its present-day and future ideology as a state policy. The bearers of such a policy must be patriots, fanatically devoted to Ukraine and its people. They must be prepared to make self-sacrifices in the name of this great and noble idea--for the good of our Fatherland. They must be heroes who are capable of carrying out this noble mission. And there are such high-caliber, professionally competent Ukrainian patriots in Ukraine. It is only when such persons with strong willpower take over the leadership of this state that we will be able to count on a clean-up of the power structures from the botched efforts of elements characterized by a lack of talent, responsibility, or even decency. These people must be replaced by persons with an innate sense of order, Ukrainian patriotism, and professionalism. What is at issue here is the speficific mechanism for solving the principal political problem--the problem of govermental power. In the situation which has evolved nowadays in Ukraine, it must be noted that we should form a standard, competent government--one which would be able to create the conditions for overcoming the crisis and to guarantee the security of the state; such a government would also clear away a path to a suitable place for Ukraine in the world. But to do this merely by the parliamentary path through elections has already become impossible for the following reasons: --the optimal time for elections has already been lost; --at a time of such a profound economic and social crisis, chaos, and anarchy it is difficult to hope for an objective choice by our citizens; --the criminalization of various branches and levels of the government and the economy affords us grounds for asserting that our state is being led by organized criminals--persons who would certainly have a decisive influence on the preparation and results of elections; --an incorrect sequence in the elections would not help to create better conditions for conducting them. It would be more feasible to carry out elections and a reform of the representative and executive organs of local power while simultaneously conducting a referendum on the matter of confidence or no confidence in the president; --the usurpation of such important mass media as radio and television by the president and his team--along with the spreading of disinformation--has been instrumental in forming a distorted public opinion. Masked anti-Ukrainian propaganda has reached unsafe levels for the Ukrainian nation and state; --an endeavor is being made to fill out Ukraine's political spectrum with powerful, mafia-type groups camouflaged as political parties. Such groups have very large finances at their disposal, and they have real power; --the ruinous activity of the president and the government--directed at intensively plundering our national resources by various domestic and foreign mafia-type groups--has become so dangerous that it threatens Ukraine with the loss of state sovereignty, and it requires that urgent measures be taken for the purpose of removing the president and the government from power and holding them responsible for crimes committed against Ukraine. Unless this is done in the very near future, events will develop to Ukraine's disadvantage. Such events could take the following variant courses: --the dictatorship of the mafia-type groups could finally come about under the guise of the presidential power structures; --further aggravation of living conditions could provoke a social outburst--one which could take the form of a spontaneous, uncontrolled revolt with multi-variant, extremely negative consequences. Recent events have been nudging us toward changing the government by the revolutionary path. If we fail to take advantage of this moment, we will lose a great and very propitious chance to give rebirth to the Ukrainian state. And we are sure that such an opportunity will not be repeated, for the Ukrainian nation has become too weakened, and its foes will do everything in their power to make sure that this state will be finished after this failure. The complete surrender of our nuclear weapons in compliance with the demands made by Russian and American imperialism constitutes a capitulation and abandonment of our state independence without any opposition or even objection. Without its nuclear weapons Ukraine will lack that restraining factor which is now our sole guarantee of national security. The imperialist predators will not have to take a non-nuclear Ukraine into consideration, and they will be able to act as they please, without taking Ukraine's national interests into account at all. At that time nothing will stop them any longer from applying any measures they choose--including the skillful introduction of internal instability--for the purpose of dismembering Ukraine and forever assigning to it the status of a colony without any rights. Nor was the time for Ukraine's unilateral and complete disarmament chosen merely by chance. It was a time when the primary attention of political groups was keyed to the elections, and--on the other hand--the people were brought to the extremes of exhaustion by the artificially created, intolerable social conditions. The criminal clique of the anti-state, mafia-type nomenklatura resorted to a terrible state crime in order to preserve its own social domination, relying on the support of Russian and American imperialism--which acts in a coordinated collusion against Ukraine. There can be nothing more degrading for the Ukrainian nation that what Kravchuk did on 12 and 14 January. Therefore, this culminating moment cannot be allowed to pass. Kravchuk and his henchmen must be removed from power and punished. There are certainly legal grounds for this. In the first place, he acted in contradiction to the decisions. In the second place, the mood in the society is not on his side. In the third place, while Russia is still in a weakened condition, it will not be able to mount sufficient opposition should Ukraine not wish to kneel down before it. In the fourth place, Ukraine's resistance to the imperialist desires will evoke a renewal of anti-imperialist opposition in other regions of the former USSR. In the fifth place, attempts to blockade Ukraine will not find support in the world as a whole. As to nuclear weapons, Ukraine is capable of maintaining them in a safe technical condition, and--within a rather brief interval of time and with a relatively modest expenditure of money--to develop them and take them under complete control and administer them by its own national means. Standing in the way of this is the highest state-political leadership, which is creating very great problems--and not only in the sphere of nuclear weapons. It is consciously sabotaging the process of creating a Ukrainian state. The task of the national-patriotic forces is to direct the revolutionary process into the channel necessary for Ukraine: to replace the mafia-type, nomenklatura, anti-Ukrainian government with a national-patriotic, decent, and decent one. The revolution could take place in an instant if the central government were to be replaced, or it could be done gradually--by way of replacing the regional governments and thus constricting the area controlled by the central, mafia-type regime and increasing the pressure on it until the latter is finally removed. The central leadership of the UKRP is prepared to propose a personnel makeup for a Committee of National Assistance (KNP), which could subsequently form a complete government. The UKRP is categorically opposed to the proposed candidacy of Lanovoy for the post of head of government inasmuch as this could bring about unjustifiable losses to Ukraine's national interests. On the overall state scale the UKRP advocates the resignation of the president and the government and their being held responsible for committing crimes against Ukraine. It is also in favor of eliminating the presidential power structures. As to the situation in the Lvov region, the UKRP considers that the principal cause of the crisis-type situation here is the oblast leadership. Objective conditions in the Lvov region are favorable for this area to become a model for all Ukraine in the state-creating processes, but the oblast's talentless and disorderly leaders are blocking this. Therefore, the UKRP must initiate organizational and activist measures for the purpose of removing from power--first of all--the following persons: Shpitser, the mayor of Lvov; Davymukha, the president's representative in this oblast; Horyn, the head of the Oblast Council; and Kotyk, the oblast-level procurator. The UKRP will actively participate in the election campaign, but without restricting its struggle to existing conditions. On the contrary, it intends to actively influence the formulation of sociopolitical thought in the direction needed by Ukraine. The UKRP will actively support not only candidates from its own organization, but also others, assessing each one as to how they measure up to the following criteria: a love of order, Ukrainian patriotism, and professionalism--first of all, political--and evidence of the quality of willpower. The UKRP will vigorously oppose candidates from the pro-communist and pro-imperialist organizations, as well as puppets of the mafia-type groups. As an organization of active, rather than paper-type, Ukrainian nationalists, the UKRP will evaluate candidates--first of all--by their deeds.
