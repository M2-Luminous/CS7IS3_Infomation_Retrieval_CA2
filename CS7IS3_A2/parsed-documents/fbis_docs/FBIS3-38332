The left will win--with a plurality of the votes--and the new government will be controlled by the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. "This will mean that Carlo Azeglio Ciampi returns to Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]," Davide Visani, coordinator of the PDS secretariat and the number three person at Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters, Rome] told PANORAMA, "so that he can complete the transition to the new Republic. His administration, however, should no longer be institutional in character but political, and therefore our ministers and our allies of the progressive front will be present in it." The PDS, he said, would even want some of its current adversaries to serve in the administration. "Specifically, representatives of Mino Martinazzoli's Italian Popular Party [PPI] and Mario Segni's Pact for Italy," Visani explained. "We draw the line with regard to the Lega, Silvio Berlusconi, and the MSI [Italian Social Movement]." This time, at Botteghe Oscure, they are true believers. The slogans are ready for the election campaign: "Defeat the Blundering Right" and--more simply--"Now." The left's posters bear a logo: no flowers or doves at all, just a logo. Someone conceived the idea of stitching together a gigantic banner bearing the pictures of Enrico Berlinguer and Palmiro Togliatti, to be hung on the balcony; but to play it safe they may go back to the usual drapery with the oak tree. "Today, however, we are setting out on the road to victory," Visani adds. Will the left--led by the heirs of the PCI [Italian Communist Party]--really be governing the Italy of the Second Republic? To judge by the polls, that would appear to be the case. The major research institutes consulted by PANORAMA--CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research], SWG [Integrated Research Service], and Diakron (see accompanying tables)--indicate that the left has done very well in the initial surveys and is predicted to win as much as 40 percent of the total vote. A share that ranges from 18 to 24 percent would go to a centrist group led by Segni; between 26 and 36 percent to a center-right front that includes Lega and Berlusconi's Forza Italia; and between 10 and 13 percent to the National Alliance of MSI Secretary Gianfranco Fini. There are many unknown quantities, however. "The principal unknown quantity," declares Renato Mannheimer, an expert on election trends, "is the fact that almost half of the population has not yet decided for whom to vote. Until a few years ago, the undecided were often those who wanted to keep their choices secret. Today, however, the indecision is genuine, and the forecasts could be turned upside down." CIRM Director Nicola Piepoli agrees. "The proportion of undecideds--which I put at around 30 percent--could overturn the forecasts. Moreover, these people change their minds from time to time. Today, they are aligned with the left, but within a week they could be lining up with Segni and Berlusconi." In the opinion of Roberto Weber, director of the SWG of Trieste, this uncertainty stems primarily from two sources. "The election alliances are an unknown quantity," he said. "So far there is only one coalition, that of the left. The center and the right are not getting together. Then there is the question: Who will be the candidates, and what will they say to the people?" Other unknown factors also adversely affect the forecasts. First of all, the surveys are still being conducted by the old proportional method rather than by the majority method; they accordingly indicate the orientation of public opinion at the national level but do not predict the effects within the majority constituencies. There is one exception: Diakron of Milan--which works for Forza Italia--has already developed a model that translates the poll responses into parliamentary seats and has applied it to the most recent CIRM poll presented on 10 January in MILANO, ITALIA (see accompanying table). "In fact," explains Diakron's Managing Director Gianni Pilo, "we had already used a scenario similar to that of CIRM." Based on this scenario, the left would elect 370 deputies--an absolute majority--and could therefore govern alone. Is this a credible forecast? Visani dismisses it out of hand. "It is a device used by Berlusconi to terrorize the public," he says. "Terrorism? How so?" Pilo retorts. "It is rather that the survey takes into consideration only the variable that is most favorable for the left, namely, a scenario in which the progressives are united while the Catholics are separated from the other moderate forces. We have obtained different percentages, however. If the moderates were to form a coalition, they would win an additional hundred or so seats and thereby overturn or equalize the results." Here, then, is another element of uncertainty. It would not be a battle between two opposing forces--left versus right, social democrats versus free-enterprise democrats--but rather a three-way contest among a left coalition; a Catholic center that is basically heir to the DC [Christian Democratic Party]; and a center-right coalition. It would, in fact, be a four-way contest, if you add the rightist forces of Fini. "But then we would find ourselves again with the same old parties!" declares the former assistant editor of IL GIORNALE, Federico Orlando. His is a voice that is certainly not suspect, in view of his support for Segni and of his resignation--together with that of Indro Montanelli--in a dispute with Berlusconi. How are the parties organized? For a two-way contest or for a fragmented contest? And can a party that falls behind get back on top? "The PDS is unquestionably in an advantageous position," agrees Stefano Draghi--for years the PCI's campaign strategist and currently PDS group leader in the Milan municipal government--who spent the summer in London studying the British electoral system in the British Library, "at Table G-17," he says, "where Karl Marx wrote DAS KAPITAL." "We are at the center of the left," he explains. "We are not yet facing an adversary who represents the leadership of the right. We are able to field high-quality candidates. We have the capacity to increase our membership. We are present throughout Italy: in the areas where we are strong, we shall have the Oak Tree [symbol of the PDS] with its thickets. Elsewhere, we shall support our allies." Specifically, however, how is the PDS conducting its campaign? The task force [preceding two words in English] that is coordinating the campaign is composed of Visani himself; Mauro Zani, the official in charge of organization; Massimo D'Alema, leader of the PDS deputies; and Giuseppe Chiaranti (a D'Alema ally) and Umberto Ranieri (a Migliori ally), respectively leader and assistant leader of the PDS senators. Ranieri, however, is under investigation in connnection with the Naples subway contracts. "The coalition of the left," Visani says, "will range from the Democratic Alliance [AD] to Communist Renewal. In the north--where we are competing against the Lega--we hope to involve former DC members as well. There will be an accord with respect to the platform, but not with respect to the government," he explains, so as to avoid embarrassing Rete and Communist Renewal, which are opposed to Ciampi. "The leaders will test their strength within the majority constituencies," he adds. Some candidates are already being considered: Achille Occhetto and Nilde Iotti in Rome and D'Alema in Bari. In the Milan electoral districts, the progressives will run the clinician Renato Boeri; Rete leader Nando Dalla Chiesa; and the industrialist Franco Morganti. For his part, Dalla Chiesa would like to sponsor the candidacies of the journalists Giampaolo Pansa, co-editor of L'ESPRESSO, and Corrado Stajano. "Nothing is definite," Visani says. The PDS will then propose a mechanism to ensure that the results in the majority constituencies will be reflected proportionately on all the tickets of the left. It remains to be seen whether the allies will agree to this or whether they will view it as a "protective coating." Communist Renewal, in fact, boasts of its strength in Turin, Milan, Rome, and Tuscany, and Rete does the same with respect to the south. "And we," says AD's Walter Bordon, "are a decisive factor in Trieste, in Genoa, and on the Adriatic coast." What is happening on the other fronts? On Thursday, 13 January, Segni made another overture to Lega. There are many who swear that, in the end, not even Segni will be able to remain aloof from a clash between right and left. The battle plan will be presented at a meeting to be held on 5 February in the EUR [Roman Universal Exposition] convention center. At the present time, his organization is in good shape in Latium, Tuscany, Campania, Lombardy, and Venetia as well as in Sardinia where Segni will be a candidate in the Sassari district. The representatives of the Pact for Italy will be chosen by a system of primaries and self-promoted candidacies supported by citizen petitions. Segni believes that the rift between Berlusconi and Montanelli--and the pope's appeal to Catholics--may have increased his support by 2 percent. This theory is contradicted by Diakron, which says, "Nothing has changed." The polls, however, indicate that the center is growing in strength--and that the Lega is in decline. "What is being revealed," says Weber, "is a party that benefited from the old system of proportional representation--a party that has been unable to find charismatic candidates." It is a void which the leaders of Forza Italia say they are ready to fill, and they have selected the electoral districts in Venetia, Liguria, and Piedmont in which to run their own candidates by agreement with the Lega. In the south, Berlusconi's movement is seeking to ally itself with the lay Catholic centrists. SWG and CIRM are not generous toward Forza Italia, but Mannheimer does not agree. "In my opinion," he says, "it has a 10 to 15 percent share of the electorate." A poll conducted by SWG for FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA, however, indicates that if the prime minister were chosen by direct election, Berlusconi would get 25.8 percent of the vote, compared to 22 percent for Segni and 18.6 percent for Occhetto. This time, however, the great national festival will be fragmented into many local contests. "Only 18,000 families will be needed to elect one deputy," Piepoli points out. A study made by SCR [expansion unknown] Associates marketing [preceding word in English] agency offers advice. "The candidates," it says, "should base their campaign on the personalization of their message, on direct communication, and on their ability to attract the attention of the media. A strong effort will be needed to establish genuine rapport with the public." SCR estimates the cost of the campaign at 320 billion lire, with approximately 4,000 candidates in the field. The ceiling established by law is 100 million lire per candidate. "It is an investment that should be entrusted to experts," SCR says. Door-to-door canvassing, electoral marketing [preceding word in English], and American-style consultants are making their debut in Italy. In the end, will these techniques enable the left or the right to win? [Box, p 17] A Comparison of Forecasts We present separately the results of the three most recent voter polls conducted by public opinion survey institutes, together with the unofficial PDS forecasts (all data are in percentages). In the week preceding 10 January, CIRM interviewed a total of 4,129 persons. The SWG survey--valid as of 4 January--is based on 5,600 interviews. Diakron--which works for Forza Italia--conducted its poll between 7 and ll January. Noteworthy in the CIRM survey is the seesaw performance of Forza Italia (which stood at 10 and 16 percent in the two previous surveys). SWG provides a comparison with October: the figures for the PDS are stable; the AD-Greens-Rete coalition, the Pact for Italy-PPI alliance, and the National Alliance show increases while Communist Renewal and Lega show decreases (Forza Italia was not included in the survey). In Diakron's previous survey--which was conducted between 13 and 21 December--the PDS received 19.3 percent, Communist Renewal 4.8 percent, the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] 2.1 percent, Rete 4.0 percent, the Greens 5.4 percent, and the AD 2.8 percent (for a total of 38.4 percent attributable to the left coalition); the PPI 6.9 percent and the Pact for Italy 11.5 percent (for a total of 18.4 percent); and Forza Italia 10.4 percent, Pannella 2.7 percent, Lega 15.1 percent, and the Laics 3.0 percent (for a total of 31.2 percent attributable to the center-right coalition); and the National Alliance 11.2 percent. Although the PDS has not yet set up its own polling system, the expert Stefano Draghi is developing a new model. Its forecasts do not differ greatly from those of CIRM and SWG: the progressive coalition is credited with 40 to 42 percent, with the PDS accounting for half of the total. The Greens show an increase, Communist Renewal remains stationary at 6 percent, while the AD accounts for the smallest share of the coalition's total. Among the coalition's adversaries, the Lega registers a decline--to approximately 14 percent--and likewise Forza Italia which, after having surpassed 10 percent, "is on a downward curve." The centrist forces of Mino Martinazzoli and Mario Segni register an upward trend--to 20 percent--while an increase to 15 percent is forecast for the National Alliance.
