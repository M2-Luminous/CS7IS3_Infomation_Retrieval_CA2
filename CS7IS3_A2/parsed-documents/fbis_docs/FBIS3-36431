This advisory board, as the presidential decree notes, is assigned to draft presidential decisions on republican security, plan anti-crime campaigns, consult the president on the republican health service, forecast and prevent emergencies and eliminate their effects, and advise the president on everything that concerns a state of emergency, including its imposition, extension, and repeal. The council comprises the prime minister, chairman of the commission for emergencies in the rank of deputy premier, power ministers, national guards commander, presidential administration chief, and president's national security adviser. The board, which will meet once a month, can invite the Parliament's Speaker and other persons. Conferring with the power ministers on Thursday, Akayev pointed to shortcomings in the fight against crime and said that after the credit of trust from the voters he would spare no effort to restore order in the republic. He gave instructions on drafting decrees to this effect. Akayev also had a closed meeting with the finance minister, taxation and custom service chiefs, and other officials to discuss ways of collecting taxes and securing finances. It was noted that sizable revenues were lost because many enterprises had been evading taxes. For this reason, Akayev threatened to deal ruthlessly with tax evaders, whose actions, as he put it, "undermine the security of the entire state."
