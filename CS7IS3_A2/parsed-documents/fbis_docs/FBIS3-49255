The Council discussed certain topical foreign and domestic policy issues, as well as economic subjects. The Council was informed about the meeting yesterday [5 January] between the Croatian and Bosnian delegations in Vienna and about preparations for the meeting between Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic scheduled for Saturday [8 January] in Bonn. It was assessed that Croatia's international position and reputation were good -- moreover, owing to Croatia's very constructive role in the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, that they were on the upswing. Gratitude was expressed to the command of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] which, at President Tudjman's request, had enabled [Zagreb Archbishop] Cardinal Kuharic and Croatian bishops to reach Sarajevo, where they attended the ordaining of the new auxiliary bishop of Sarajevo. In connection with the publishing of certain classified information by the press, the Council entrusted several state bodies with the task of uncovering those responsible for divulging state secrets. The participants in the session reiterated the Croatian leadership's stand on the consistent respect for legal regulations and on personal responsibility for the committing of crimes, but also warned that a person was innocent until proven guilty. It was particularly stressed that certain acts committed under wartime conditions should be viewed within the general context of the aggression against Croatia, and the fact that the war was being waged on Croatian soil where many Croats had been killed and towns and villages razed. Therefore, care should be taken that the reputation of the honorable participants in the war must not be tarnished as a consequence of irresponsible editorial practice and the actual misdeeds of individuals subject to criminal prosecution, the announcement issued by the Office of the President of the Republic says.
