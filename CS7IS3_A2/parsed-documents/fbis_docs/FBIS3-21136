The group developed a technique that uses a photochemical reaction as a pretreatment during manufacturing to untangle the carbon fibers, which enables uniform dispersion of the fibers throughout the composite material. Uniform dispersion is essential for increased strength. The group is aiming for rapid practical application of this technique as a pretreatment to achieve higher quality more easily and lower manufacturing costs. The developers are professor Akira Kojima and assistant professor Ryoichi Akabane from Gumma School of Technology, researchers from the Railway Technical Research Institute, and a group led by professor Sugiro Otani, Faculty of Developmental Engineering, Tokai University. When CFRP and carbon fiber reinforced concrete (CFRC) are manufactured, pretreatment is required to efficiently disperse the carbon fibers in resin, etc. This new technique concerns a pretreatment that neatly separates individual carbon fibers, which are usually all tangled together. In the past separation has been accomplished by oxidizing the surfaces of heated carbon fibers by electrolytic or chemical methods to break the bonds between them. This joint research group used a photochemical reaction instead for oxidation. The new method involves applying a coating to the surfaces of the carbon fibers that releases activated oxygen when it is exposed to light, and then exposing the fibers to sunlight. In the sunlight, activated oxygen, which has a negative charge and acts powerfully to break the links between carbon atoms, is formed on the surfaces of the fibers, and the carbon fibers neatly untangle and disperse. Methylene blue was used in the experiments as a coating, and after it was applied to a bundle of about 3000 carbon fibers, they were exposed to sunlight. When researchers put the carbon fibers in resin and measured the amount of dispersion (wetting strength), it was about three times greater than before the pretreatment. When researchers mixed the carbon fibers with cement and formed CFRC, the strength was 1.6 times greater than that of CFRC manufactured by past methods. Professor Kojima says, ``This new technique requires no special equipment and should be easy to implement right on the assembly line.'' Composite materials are used in golf clubs and aircraft because they are very strong and lightweight. If material costs can be reduced because of this development, we can expect composite materials to find a wider range of uses such as in railway coaches and manufactured products in general.
