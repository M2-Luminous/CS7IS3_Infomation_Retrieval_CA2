Answering HA'ARETZ's question, Domb said he had no information about a specific plan, but "recently I have been hearing too much talk too often about despair and political assassinations with regard to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, Minister Shulamit Aloni, or other ministers." Domb emphasized that he had sent his letter to Rabin as a private citizen, not as a council member or spokesman. Among other things, Domb wrote the prime minister: "Such an assassination, God forbid, would be very serious in all respects and we must do our very best to prevent it. For our part, we are making every possible effort, but I nevertheless see fit to apprise you of it." In his letter Domb analyzed the feelings of despair that bring people to such thoughts. "As far as many Israelis are concerned, the lack of solidarity on your part and on that of most other Israeli cabinet ministers with the suffering of Jews in Ashdod, 'Afula, Hadera, Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza creates a horrible sense of alienation. Many of them have translated this alienation into despair, and in some of them this despair might degenerate into extreme acts of despair with the potential to rock Israel's very foundations." Yehi'el Leiter, director general of the council's foreign desk, recently published an article abroad entitled "To Avert the Worst." Leiter asks "Is a political assassination possible in Israel today?" and his answer is no. "I wish my `no' could be more categorical. However, we can no longer ignore the possibility of a lunatic political assassination attempt by a Jewish extremist," Leiter wrote. "In the two months before the massacre in Hebron," Leiter recalls, "the assessments indulged in by political commentators were not about the likelihood of a massacre, but of the resurgence of a Jewish underground. What happened in the field totally differed from the predictions. Today, in the wake of the Hebron events, those same commentators are anxious about a second Hebron. However, this time, too, events may very well differ from predictions. What is at stake now is so fateful that a political assassination -- the most abominable and cowardly form of political opposition -- has become a real possibility, albeit appalling. A political assassination by a Jewish extremist," Leiter warns in his article, "deserves to be deplored not just on moral grounds. It will most probably spell an end to the entire settlement endeavor. "If anybody thought the attack at the Cave of the Patriarchs would be so dramatic and radical as to bring about the suspension of the talks with the PLO, he has in the meantime found the exact opposite to be true: the settlers bore the blame, while 'Arafat reaped the fruit. If a Jew tries to hurt a cabinet minister, the government will have an easier time holding all its political opponents collectively responsible, and there is no doubt that it will do that. "Such an event could also be used as an excuse to abolish the interim phase of the agreement, which is now being described by some as impractical, and proceed immediately to implement the final phase, or as the mayor of Hebron recently put it, `the final solution.'" In his article Leiter proposes that the government realize that the path it has adopted is leading to a horrible and dangerous split in the population. Addressing himself to the right wing, Leiter proposes to it to channel its wrath and anxiety into a violent civil uprising.
