FBIS4-28020 "dreas110_j_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Indonesia Government Announces New Investment Policy Government Announces New Investment Policy BK0306115894 Jakarta ANTARA in English 1614 GMT 2 Jun 94 BK0306115894 Jakarta ANTARA English BFN [Text] Jakarta, Jun 2 (ANTARA) -- The Indonesian Government Thursday announced a new investment policy granting greater liberties to foreign capital in company share ownership, geographical spread and sectoral business lines. Capital Investment Promotiom Minister Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo said under the new policy there would be two forms of foreign investment: joint ventures and companies 100 percent owned by foreigners or foreign corporate bodies. Explaining the main provisions of Government Regulation Number 20/94 on share ownership in companies set up under the foreign investment scheme, he said Indonesian ownership of shares in joint ventures had now been fixed at a minimum of five percent. Previously the ratio of share ownership in such ventures after 20 years of operation had to be 51 percent Indonesian and 49 percent foreign. Under the new regulation foreign share-holders are still expected to transfer part of their shares to Indonesians after 15 years of operation but no specific percentage figure has been stipulated. "If the Indonesian and foreign partners agree to a 50-50 shares division, that would be all right. If the foreign share-holders decide to transfer only one percent, that would be ok too," Sastrowardoyo said. The new regulation further does away with the old requirement that to set up a 100 percent foreign-owned company, investors have to sink a minimum of one million US dollars in it. Now the foreign investors only need to provide initial equity in an amount as required by the needs of their business. The minister said 100 percent foreign investment projects may now set up in any part of the country, while previously they had been restricted to Batam Island or bonded industrial zones. Joint ventures under the new policy are now permitted to operate in the production of goods or services deemed vital to the state and affecting the needs of the majority of the Indonesian people , Sastrowardoyo said. They included ports, electricity production and distribution, telecommunications, shipping, aviation, drinking water, railways and mass media. However, these areas remain closed to 100 percent foreign-owned companies. Based on the new government regulation, companies set up under the foreign investment scheme will be given business licences valid for 30 years reckoned from the date they begin commercial production. On the same occasion Industry Minister T. Ariwibowo said that after Indonesia allowed the entry of foreign capital, many neighbouring countries that used to be closed to foreign investors had followed suit. "Therefore, we should review all our economic policies so that we can maintain the pace of our development effort," he said. He pointed out the country's population growth should be anticipated by the creation of new job opportunities and to this end Indonesia should achieve an economic growth rate of six percent a year. "Government Regulation Number 20/94 is aimed at setting a condition for the creation of new jobs that will in turn increase the national income through taxes," he said. The government was also hoping that the new policy would accelerate the transfer of technology and management skill to Indonesians, Ariwibowo said. Minister/State Secretary Murdiono told the same press conference, under its sixth five year development plan Indonesia plans to induce investments totalling rp [Rupiah] 660 trillion, 73 percent of which is expected to come from the private sector. This was why the government was giving more opportunities to national as well as foreign businessmen, he said.
