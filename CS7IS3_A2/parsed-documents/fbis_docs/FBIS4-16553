An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from well-informed sources that in the first half of today U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and told him that NATO aircraft were preparing to carry out strikes against Serbs firing on Gorazde. Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special representative, who was in Pale, a Bosnian Serb-controlled suburb of Sarajevo, was informed of the content of the conversation between Christopher and Kozyrev. Following his contacts with the Bosnian Serb leadership and UN forces command, V. Churkin announced that Serb shelling of Gorazde was not an issue. Only four mortar explosions had been recorded in the town, and UN observers were unable to determine precisely which side had fired them. In addition, General Ratko Mladic, the Serb Army commander, has assured V. Churkin that Serb forces do not intend to storm Gorazde or bring artillery fire to bear on the town. Information received from the Russian president's special representative was forwarded to W. Christopher, after which the order for NATO air strikes on Serb positions near Gorazde was rescinded, the abovementioned sources said.
