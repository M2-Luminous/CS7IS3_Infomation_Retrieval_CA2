Participating in a seminar on strategic planning in international cooperation, Maira labeled such a program an "urgent need" despite the fact that from the political viewpoint the Chilean Government does not have among its short-term priorities the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with the Fidel Castro regime. Bilateral links were broken in 1973 after the military coup headed by General Augusto Pinochet, who overthrew the socialist government of Salvador Allende. Relations were resumed at the consular level in 1990, after the installation of the Patricio Aylwin administration. Maira said that Chile, after surpassing the $3,000 per capita income level, has been excluded from the industrialized countries' financial cooperation aid list, and has entered a stage of transition from receptor to provider of this type of aid. He said that within this context, Chile is beginning to be seen, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, as "a rich country." This has created a growing demand from that region for cooperation aid, which should somehow be arranged "despite the budget limits and restrictions" affecting the country. "It is difficult to avoid these demands," said Maira, who added that the demands come mainly from Cuban and the Dominican Republic. Maira said that in the case of Cuba it is necessary to have a growing degree of cooperation "on the basis of the progress and internal situation of Cuba and the presence on the island of several private Chilean companies." Maira added that Chile is one of the Latin American countries with the largest investment programs abroad, especially in the region, and this should be taken into consideration in the government's action.
