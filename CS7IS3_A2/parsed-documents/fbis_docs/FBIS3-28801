He talked about our Republic's nuclear armament, and stressed that Japan must examine countermeasures to cope with an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula, saying that if North Korea takes a military action, it is a big problem. We can never overlook the fact that this fellow, who is known as an influential person in Japanese political circles, has created a spirit of hostility against us, thus libeling us. The absurd remarks by Ozawa are an open challenge to our Republic's dignity and authority and, also, show as it is the indiscriminative madness of the Japanese reactionaries who suffer pains because they cannot crush [apsal] our Republic, thus being frightened at the might and invincibility of the popular mass- centered socialism of our country. Why he made such remarks by picking a quarrel with us is not because Japan is actually threatened by someone. Even Yohei Kono, president of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, has denounced him, saying that his remarks are intended to agitate the people by striking terror into their hearts. The Japanese reactionaries' systemized bad habit are to achieve their heinous goal by persistently sticking to their insistence. Through a shock and strategic propaganda against the so-called threat from North Korea, Ozawa has tried to make an excuse for the Japanese arms build-up, in particular, for the acceleration of its nuclear armament and has also attempted to lead the Japanese public opinion to justify its goal. It is well known that Japan's nuclear armament has already been in the level of danger. Japan has largely accumulated plutonium to use for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and has continued to increase its nuclear reprocessing capacity. The Swedish paper SVENSKA DAGBLADET has recently reported that Japan possesses everything -- such as plutonium, an electronic explosion device, and technicians -- capable of immediately producing nuclear weapons, and that it has already produced nuclear warheads which can be operated when they are filled with plutonium as much as they need. Even the recent papers of the United States, Denmark, and Finland reported that based on their documents, the British Defense Ministry and U.S. Central Intelligence Agency have proven that Japan actually possesses nuclear weapons. Japan's nuclear armament and its goal to become a military power, which are earnestly pushing ahead with, gravely pose a threat to peace and security in the Northeast Asia, including the Korean peninsula. Nevertheless, they are talking about a threat from someone. These are preposterous remarks. What we cannot overlook is, particularly, the fact that Ozawa has openly claimed that Japan must examine countermeasures to cope with the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. When we remind of his previous remarks that if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces must be sent there as a member of the UN forces, it is very clear what his real intention is. This means that Japan must prepare for taking military action on the presumption that it should participate in a war in case it breaks out on Korea. Availing themselves of this opportunity in which the great powers' positions have been reduced after the Cold War ends, the Japanese rulers attempt to achieve their domination-oriented goal by militarily advancing in the Asia-Pacific region. As the first target of their overseas military invasion, they have selected Korea. It is clear that to make an excuse for their aggressive military action, they pick a quarrel with us by saying that we can take military action. This is an act similar to a thief shouting "stop thief." We cannot but be alert to the reckless remarks and acts of Japanese reactionaries, who are unsteady in their mind because of their ambitions for nuclear armament and reinvasion. Our people will never allow anyone to infringe upon the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic. They will resolutely confront aggressors. The Japanese reactionaries must know the consequences arising from their reckless act and act with discretion.
