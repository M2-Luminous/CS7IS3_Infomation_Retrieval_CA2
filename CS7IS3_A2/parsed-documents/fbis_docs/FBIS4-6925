When he organized the so-called Ozawa study group during his days in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and resolutely proposed national security measures and constitutional revisions for Japan, I made or published comments in response to a number of requests from newspapers and periodicals. At that time, coupled with my impression that he might be someone who thought out matters much more thoroughly than the leftist politicians, frankly speaking, I was greatly perplexed that he might be a new type of politician not found in the traditional LDP. My intuition that the stereotyped criticisms against the traditional LDP politicians were not applicable to him was not mistaken even in the light of his subsequent actions. Thinking that carefully thought-out logic must be readied when criticizing Ozawa, I had deferred finalizing comments on Ozawa. My thoughts were further strengthened after comparing my publication, Political Reform (Iawanami Shinsho), which did not sell as well, but which was published at about the same time last year as Ozawa's bestseller, Blueprint for Building a New Japan (Kodansha). As though he perceived my perplexity, Takashi Mikuri (Tokyo Metropolitan University professor), a political scientist whom I respect, submitted the following comments to the YOMIURI SHIMBUN readers' section: "Above all, the most striking parts of Yamaguchi's book (Political Reform) and Ozawa's book (Blueprint for Building a New Japan), which should basically assume antithetical positions, are the aggressiveness shown in the desire for reform. The views toward `reform' of Yamaguchi, who is farthest from power, and Ozawa, who has been in the center of power, are in agreement to an astonishing degree. Thus, `reform' proposals by amateurs and professionals will begin to coincide on a concrete level before Japan reaches the 21st century" (5 July 1993 issue of YOMIURI SHIMBUN). For Competitive System Rather Than Linkage It is true that regarding criticisms against closed politics under the 1955 setup, which I will touch upon later, my assertions and Ozawa's arguments have many points in common. However, I cannot get rid of the feeling that I want to avoid the role of waving the political reform banner by siding with Ozawa-style "political reform." What is necessary now for political scientists is to present a vision of creating a healthy competitive system within Japanese politics. If Ozawa's paradigm becomes the next fixed framework of Japanese politics, Hosokawa's coalition regime would become a repetition of Konoe's supportive government and if I link up with this trend, then I would probably be called a "pocket edition" of Sadaji Yabe (Tokyo University professor--then, Fumimaro Konoe's "brain"). I do not know with what intention Mikuri wrote that comment, but if only Ozawa's paradigm existed in 21st century Japan, that would be termed a great tragedy. At any rate, at present, when the one-party rule by the LDP has ended and reorganization of the party system has entered the second round, the stage of discovering common points in criticism against the old system and marshaling energy to destroy the old setup is ending. Of course, as indicated by the difficulties in passing the political reform bill, great political efforts are needed to eliminate long standing abuses, but the task that is called for hereafter is the development of various ideas regarding a political design under the next party system. Also, when that task is undertaken, the Blueprint for Building a New Japan will be an unavoidable publication presenting concepts for the next generation. When the political force to oppose Ozawa's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] group is organized, too, the plan for the new political force will probably be formulated in refutation of this book. As mentioned frequently, there might be a question as to whether this is Ozawa's individual work, but as long as it is a book published after his perusal and in his name, it is not improper to treat him as a political theorist or strategist. The very fact that he gathered outstanding brain trusters and published the book with precise timing might be said to be a testimony to his excellence as strategist. In view of Ozawa's performances and activities as a politician, particularly in relation to corruption, I do not deny the importance of the type of criticisms (so-called "settlement disputes"), which cast doubts on the credibility of his arguments, but a number of scathing articles have already been written about that point. Here, I want to accept the publication at face value and consider future Japanese politics through internal scrutiny of Ozawa's assertions. Assessment of 1955 Setup and Postwar Generation As a premise to this discussion, there must be clarification as to the type of problems that existed in postwar Japanese politics, particularly in politics under the 1955 setup, and the reform courses that are considered necessary. Also, as mentioned earlier in relation to Mikuri's comments, I believe that shared, rather than confrontational, awareness is stronger between Ozawa and me regarding this point. For example, the following section of Blueprint for Building a New Japan is practically the same as my criticisms of the 1955 setup: "Entrusting the maintenance of international order entirely to the United States, Japan concentrated solely on economic development and distribution of assets resulting from it. Things went smoothly if budget allocations were made as fairly as possible, considering opposition parties' demands. Reaching such consultative agreements was the essence of politics. There were no serious discussions about the path Japan should pursue nor truly intense confrontations regarding policies. (Omission). Unnoticed, the democratic principle that there should be a change between ruling and opposition parties was forgotten and the existence of a perennial government party and perpetual opposition party was no longer considered strange" (page 65, said publication). Regarding such summarization of postwar politics by Ozawa, as to whether there is agreement or perhaps, reluctant acceptance of the statement, or conversely, opposition, I feel that rather than differences in individual feelings, differences between generations in how they interpret postwar politics begin to show. For example, Takeshi Kobo (Nagoya University professor), a political scientist born in 1954, states in an outstanding article on Ozawa expressing his personal viewpoint, "Can Leftists Oppose Ichiro Ozawa?" (monthly periodical JOKYO, November 1993): "As a person committed to the reformist or leftist side, I have a number of objections to such summarization of postwar politics but, ultimately, it is a hard fact that the opposition could not alter such a structure so I believe that the foregoing generalization must be accepted basically." Disillusioned With Allotted Roles As for myself and my juniors, who were born at about the same time as the formation of the 1955 setup, we have watched consultative politics since our childhood. Those of us who were born after the mid-1950's are not directly aware of postwar reformist glories, such as the protect-the-Constitution movement and the 1960 Security Treaty demonstrations. Also, we haven't had the experience of peering at the true nature of political movements and power displays through college student uprisings. While harboring various dissatisfactions with real politics, we had been greatly frustrated by the absence of a political entity to replace the LDP regime. While hoping for political reform through changes in government reins, we had been expecting the emergence of a reformist force led by the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ). However, upon observing that the opposition to administration, which should traditionally be an indispensable element in democracy, was nothing more than an allotted role, as scripted in the 1955 setup, disillusionment with the existing reformist political party only deepened. Generational differences in viewpoints on the role to be performed by the reformist force are serious and the differences were accentuated suddenly when the coalition regime was formed. Evaluation of the coalition regime and assessment of Ozawa's awareness of the times are closely related. For those of us born in the 1950's who believe the historic roles of the LDP and SDPJ have ended, Ozawa's criticism of the 1955 setup might be said to have an appeal because of its explicitness. Structure of Postwar Democracy and Nonuse of Power Ozawa's criticism of consultative politics also thrust upon us the issue of political power in postwar democracy that had been shelved for a long period. During the days when the one-party rule by the LDP was an axiomatic premise, persons critical of the LDP followed, though regretfully, the stereotyped thinking that those in power were the rascals on the other side and that clean, just persons were all opposed to power. Neither power nor leadership was a subject taken up seriously in postwar political discussions. Of course, the framework to protect people's rights is inadequate in Japan and the importance of the "freedom-from-power" issue has not diminished, but the thinking was never prevalent that laws and systems should be altered by having the side which respects rights gain the majority or take over the government. On the other hand, the LDP government which had the power did exercise physical force, at times, to protect the setup but generally, rather than settling matters by using power, it took steps more often to cajole by saving the honor of the opposing side. Politics lost the capability to handle problems with entangled interests and the reality that vested rights, once acquired, cannot be disposed of in spite of the criticisms of numerous citizens is deeply tied to the tradition of postwar politics to evade the use of power. To use a phrase that was popular in the past, Japanese politics is a hollow structure and it is impossible to tell where power resides. Formulate Plan for Freedom To Gain Power In contrast, Ozawa points out the crime of not using power. Also, he proposes reforms in cabinet organization and election system to create strong authority and clarify responsibilities. As is well known, regarding this point, there are criticisms about suppression of minority views and stage setting to achieve strong authoritative rule. However, in light of the development of Japanese politics which has been tossed about since the 1980's by foreign pressure such as "input from the flank" (Takeshi Sasaki, Tokyo University professor), mentioned in an article, and because subjective identification and solution of problems had been abandoned, the creation of political leadership through the choice of the people themselves has become a task of far more importance than ever before, as pointed out by Ozawa. In other words, together with freedom from power, a concrete plan for "freedom to gain power" is probably being sought by the people. In the first place, under the parliamentary cabinet system, like in Japan and UK, the majority party in the parliament controls the legislature and simultaneously wields the administrative power. In other words, the fusion of the two powers, legislative and administrative, takes place through the ruling party. The basic image of party politics under the parliamentary cabinet system is for the party, which took over the government reins, to strive for the implementation of policies that it pledged to the populace by using its powerful authority and for the people to pass judgment at the next election and replace the ruling party if its performance is found to be unsatisfactory. In that sense, Ozawa's assertion is not in any way an irrational argument to support dictatorship. This form of parliamentary cabinet system will not destroy democracy only if there are multiple political forces competing ceaselessly for power. It is not unreasonable if many intellectuals should consider it a nightmare if, within a framework of strengthened leadership, the party led by Ozawa should continue a lengthy one-party rule as the LDP did. The problem is whether there is a political force that can vie for governmental power with the party led by Ozawa. Arguments that the past system of rivalrous politics or zoku Dietmen politics are less harmful than the deployment of Ozawa-style leadership will not stand up, at all, against his reform proposal. It is the urgent task of those engaged in Japanese politics to propose changes through substantive policies and concepts while cooperating with the effort to eliminate from political arenas, such as the cabinet and Diet, the obstacles which traditionally curtailed creativity and responsiveness in Japanese politics. External Policies and National Model for Japan When envisioning another design to oppose the paradigm portrayed by Ozawa, the most significant confrontational point is the question of Japan's national image and position in the world. Views regarding this point are closely intertwined with the question of how the locus of postwar Japan should be assessed. Earlier, I stated that I agree with Ozawa's criticisms of the 1955 setup, but what becomes a problem is the disparity between overall postwar politics and the party politics arrangement called the 1955 setup. According to Ozawa, postwar Japan was a "special country" which fervently pursued prosperity for its own country without hardly bearing any costs for peace and freedom and if so, politics under the 1955 setup would be the ultimate in special politics suited to a special country. However, it seems that condemning postwar politics in such a manner is a one-sided viewpoint. It is a fact that postwar Japan was successful in its development because it enjoyed the world's public assets without, charge but it is not particularly strange for a developing country to be exempted from shouldering the costs of international public resources. In the future, Japan may have to take the initiative in fulfilling its responsibility to provide international support but in that event, it is probably necessary to analyze the positive and negative aspects of the locus of Japanese development with the intent of furnishing a model for succeeding countries. Also, when presenting the Japanese experience as a universal model, the important factor must not be overlooked that Japan avoided spending resources on the military under the postwar Constitution and followd the course of a "civilian power" (Yoichi Funabashi, ASAHI SHIMBUN's U.S. Bureau chief). It can be said that Ozawa's hyperintense irritation with postwar Japan is giving the impression to many persons that is trying to repudiate all facets of postwar peace. One-Nation Peace Doctrine and Santa Claus Ozawa will probably refute this by point saying people are misinterpreting his arguments. However, upon reading his Blueprint for Building a New Japan," one will notice that there is a contradiction in his attitude toward the "one-nation peace doctrine" that he should be criticizing. On the one hand, he is admonishing Japanese who have become accustomed to prosperity that "the world is not that generous"; but on the other hand, he is saying that maintaining the wealth of Japanese is the mission of politics and is making big promises to people about tax reductions and public investment increases. The one-nation peace doctrine is not a patent of the SDPJ, which had been an opposition party, but actually the paradigm built up by successive LDP regimes which had exercised national power. Ozawa himself had received training as a politican within this paradigm. Plans to augment the Shinkansen lines and expressway network, which are described in the said publication, are only rehash of the "Japanese Archipelago Reconstruction," a plan that should be considered bankrupt. Since he is the disciple of Kakuei Tanaka, he probably cannot detach himself from the maxim of LDP politics since Tanaka that "development is good." If he is claiming that Japan must pay more of the costs of world peace and freedom, he should explain carefully to the people that politics is not the function of passing out benefits freely to various regions and groups in the country. With respect to the tax reform bill to reduce income taxes and secure public works revenues by increasing the consumption tax rate, he has presented plausible estimates. However, for example, if running costs, subsequent to the construction of generally unprofitable Shinkansen lines and expressways, are to be paid for through the citizens' taxes, the burden on the people will certainly increase beyond his estimates. To undertake international contributions externally and to spread benefits internally, like in the archipelago reconstruction scheme, is simply following the past LDP's all-inclusive party course of currying the favor of all groups. Isn't the strong authority sought by Ozawa intended to serve in establishing policy priorities clearly and not in enacting the role of a generous Santa Claus for all groups? Also, if I were asked what point we should really reflect on in postwar politics, I think that the biggest mistake was to believe that quantitative expansion of the economy was of utmost value and to ruin our country through indiscrimate granting common public works, In order to polish the image of postwar Japan, the task to reassess the prosperity and development course pursued until now will be essential in the search for the next political direction. Changes in Confrontation Over Constitution Assessment of postwar Japan is linked closely to the interpretation of the postwar Constitution. Ozawa's contribution to the discussions on the Constitution deserves special attention. His greatest achievement is the breakdown of the pattern that "conservatives are forces for constitutional revision" and the presentation of concrete proposals toward realization of his concept of the constitutional doctrine. In other words, support of the Constitution is no longer the exclusive right of the Constitution protection forces and they, too, are being pressed to present concrete ideas on how to carry out the constitutional principles. In the Blueprint for Building a New Japan, the importance of values advocated heretofore by progressives, such as respect for individuals and decentralization of control, are emphasized so Ozawa should probably be regarded as someone who shares the basic principles associated with politics, such as human rights and democracy. I welcome the fact that from the hardened confrontational pattern of pro- and anti-Constitution revision forces under the 1955 setup, a competitive arena to deal with constitutional principles is finally emerging. At a glance, Ozawa's contention appears to be extremely universal. In particular, his proposal to maintain a standby UN force in Japan and to conduct overseas actions of Japanese armed units only under UN supervision is clearly different from the policy of expanding externally in pursuit of national interests. Actually, a similar idea had already been presented in 1959 in the midst of the Cold War by Yoshikazu Sakamoto (presently, an associate member of International Christian University's Peace Research Institute) in his essay, "Defense Concept for a Neutral Japan" (carried in the publication, International Politics in the Nuclear Age, by Iwanami Shoten). (There are differences between the two parties on the extent to which Japan should participate in UN police activities.) There is historic irony in the fact that this idea gained reality with the collapse of the Cold War structure and, moreover, is being presented by the standard bearer of the new conservative party. Thus, it must be recognized that there is a certain logic in Ozawa's externally directed thoughts. Therefore, when criticizing them, it is unfair to disbelieve what he has stated explicity and to denounce his probable intentions by imagining what he has not written. To criticize his policies, it is essential to carefully consider his situational awareness on which his views are premised. Ozawa Thinks Constitution Is "Commandment" As far as I can tell, Ozawa's perception of the current situation is as described below. With respect to nonuse of military power in international society, postwar Japan spent half a century compliant and confined. However, now that Japan has become a great economic power with worldwide influence and the possibility of cooperation among the big powers, centered on UN, has widened with the end of the Cold War, it is essential for Japan to reenter international society by stepping out of its confinement and participating in various activities, whether military or nonmilitary, in order to "occupy an honorable position in international society." Meanwhile, as far as the current situation of the international society is concerned, the control of the superpowers has loosened with the collapse of the Cold War structure and conditions are closer to anarchy than heretofore. Therefore, military power is still required to resolve conflicts and preserve order. It might be said that for Ozawa, the constitutional stipulation of pacifism is only a commandment imposed on Japan, which was defeated in World War II, to refrain from using military power for national interests. Therefore, there are no restrictions, at all, for Japan to participate in military activities under the UN flag. Allegory of the Fall of Carthage The question is whether or not it is correct to apply to the constitutional pacifism or demilitarization concept the special interpretation that it was a "commandment" imposed on Japan in 1945. That is related to the assessment of military effectiveness in the post-Cold War international society. It seems that Ozawa is thoroughly convinced that it is a natural state for international society to be ruled by power. For example, he draws on the allegory of the fall of Carthage to warn the Japanese who are accustomed to peace. "Unlike Venice, this country (Carthage) built up its military force with mercenaries assembled through unsparing use of its wealth. For this reason, it was eventually defeated by the Roman army made up mainly of farmers. Carthage had far greater wealth than Rome, but the thinking that it could defend the country only with money proved fatal" (page 106, Blueprint for Building a New Japan). The implication is that the rule of international society in the late 20th century has not changed much since the days of Rome. The singular change probably noted by Ozawa is that since it has become difficult in the late 20th century for any country to secure its national safety with only its military force, there is an urgent need to establish a joint force with each country contributing. Proof That Power Is Secondary However, it can also be said that this type of thinking, which appears at a glance to be realistic, is really overlooking the changes in the world. The biggest change is that establishment of rules through negotiations between past enemies, as shown by the reconciliation between Israel and PLO and the abolishment of apartheid in South Africa, has become the motivating force to create peace. To guarantee observance of the rule, some force might be needed but, in any event, power is secondary. Conversely, as shown by the internal wars among African nations, peace cannot be secured no matter how the advanced countries try to intervene militarily as long as the concerned parties want to fight. To put it extremely, for settlement of the stalemated regional conflicts, the only solution might be to wait for an antiwar feeling to emerge after warring parties get tired of fighting like at the time of Germany's Thirty Year War. Also, Japan's ineptness in the Gulf war seems to have left deep scars internally in Ozawa, but even in the Gulf war the United States was unable to exercise military power to force upon Iraq the order that it desired and had to be satisfied with the liberation of Kuwait. Idealism and Realism Twisted As for making peace through negotiations, it can be said that, learning from experience, human beings are making progress slowly. It can also be said that, as for continuing rapacious killings for ethnic and religious reasons, human beings have not made any progress. In either case, the effectiveness of military power as a means to resolve conflicts has been diminishing with the passage of time. In that sense, the demilitarization concept of the Constitution is pointing the direction that times should follow. That is definitely not a commandment that Japan, blamed for an aggressive war, had accepted reluctantly. The thinking that international cooperation based on good intentions will build peace was called an unrealistic dream in the past by conservatives. However, looking at the world today, one will realize that sustainable peace will emerge only though such a process. In that sense, it is important to maintain idealism. However, in the case of Ozawa, his overoptimism that use of military power, based on international cooperation, will create freedom and peace is a matter of concern. One should be cautious that a "peace creation strategy," based on good intentions, might bring about unintended results. It is not certain whether Ozawa's concept, which delved into the military sphere of national security, will truly lead to the creation of peace. What Is an Ordinary Country? According to Ozawa, international society is still in a natural state and Japan should become an ordinary member of international society, bearing responsibility for security by arms. The symbol of an ordinary country has an attractive ring to people who are dissatisfied that Japan only accumulates wealth and does not gain any respect from international society. The will to despise fanatical devotion to money is important, but the question that must be considered is what constitutes ordinariness. Actually, in a changing world society, it is not clear what can be regarded as ordinary. Of course, no matter how enthusiastic he is about military contributions, Ozawa must not be considering military superpowers, such as the United States or PRC, as the ordinary countries he is aiming for. Then, are countries like UK and France, which are permanent members of the UN Security Council, possess nuclear power, and conduct skilled diplomacy, to be considered as ordinary? Or, are countries like Sweden and Canada, called the middle powers, which participate in UN policing actions but maintain a certain distance from the military strategies of superpowers and contribute to peace, the ordinary countries? Or, are countries like India and Brazil, which wield strong political and military influence in their respective regions, the ordinary countries? Solution Not Found To Resolving Complicated Conflicts In Ozawa's vocabulary, an ordinary country means a country which shares costs necessary to provide international support, including military assistance, but the extent of participation in contributing support in the area of military power differs greatly with countries. In ways to participate, there is no single formula or a simple "ordinary" way; many countries are participating through various means. You cannot say that, because a country took the lead and participated in a large-scale armed intervention, like in the Gulf war, it is ordinary. In fact, the views of many researchers are in agreement that the scenario of obvious aggression followed by the simple act of subjugating villains, as in the Gulf war, is not likely to occur frequently in the future. How to cope with much more complicated regional conflicts is still an unsolved question. UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's plan for a peacekeeping force, which is believed to have influenced Ozawa's "peace creation strategy," is not likely to be implemented smoothly, as shown by the Somalia case. There is widespread public agreement that Japan should play a bigger role in solving conflicts in various parts of the world and in eliminating hunger and poverty. Also, it seems that arguments are strengthening in politics to move toward approval of Japanese participation in UN police actions when those engaged in conflicts desire peace and try to establish an orderly framework through negotiations. I believe that what is essential now in discussions on foreign policies is the clarification of Japan's independent stance regarding provision of international support, particularly the setting of a ceiling on commitment to military forces. The term, "ordinary country," is still a vague symbol and many persons naturally fear that Japan would be dragged into a quagmire of military interventions when they hear the term. Political Reorganization and Formation of Anti-Ozawa Forces By the time this article is published, the issue of the political reform bill would probably have been settled. Regardless of the outcome of the political reform bill, looking at the hard feelings created among the political parties during deliberations on the bill, I think it is certain that Japanese politics will move toward the second round of reorganization. When that happens, the ruling parties which make up the coalition regime will probably be unable to unite. The SDPJ will be split, the LDP will also be wavering, and the groping toward a new political party will continue for a while. In that process, it appears certain that the group comprised of Shinseito, led by Ozawa, and Komeito will take the initiative. In the media and press, comments are made often that there is fear Ozawa and Taisaku Ikeda would grasp the power in Japan. However, to think that a united Shinseito-Komeito force can establish a stable one-party rule like the LDP in the past is an overestimation of Ozawa. It might be said that Ozawa's power is growing even more because journalists and scholars overrate him and fear him for no reason. Ozawa is undoubtedly an outstanding theorist, but his excellence is best shown in his bold criticisms of and disregard for the common sense and long standing rules of the special political circle called Nagata-cho. Therefore, those who are most knowledgeable about his excellence are politicians in the circle, reporters of political departments that act as the circle's organ, and scholars who conduct studies of the circle. For the general populace which is unfamiliar with the internal conditions of politics, he appears as an interesting or dangerous politician who attacks the old framework recklessly and creates disturbances. When he uses "strong-arm tactics," Nagata-cho insiders stand in fear, but the average citizen ignores him with unexpected coolness as during the 1991 Tokyo gubernatorial election. Perhaps his justification for trying to destroy the old order is not understood by the people. Although he was able to clear himself of suspicion in the publicized general contractor scandal, because of the "undefinable nature" that Ozawa has, the possibility remains that the Ozawa group might become, in political terms, a "denial party" (a party from which even citizens who are not interested in politics want to deny votes). To avoid that, he must polish the national image that he is aiming for; to evade the criticism that his acts belie his words, he must present specific policies to materialize the values of personal freedom and independence. In any event, our task as we approach the 21st century is to form a political force which can present a vision and national image to counter his ordinary country and to create the competition for governmental power.
