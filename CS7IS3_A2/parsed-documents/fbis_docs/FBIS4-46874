After Meeting Representatives of Donbass's Tsentralnyy Rayon, Ukraine's President Ordered Creation of a Commission Which Is Obliged To Undertake Measures in Ten Days To Save the Coal Sector"] [Text] Everyone remembers the miners' rebellions and strikes. The miners shook the government like a pear tree. And, they gained something for themselves. It wasn't for the good life that representatives of one of the most difficult and essential professions left their jobs. And then, speaking of wages and improved working conditions, they hoped and believed that the government would really do something about the sector. Because without energy independence the young state cannot develop normally. But the government quenched the conflict without getting into the root causes. By hook or crook they managed to raise wages in the mines. But the government's measures had no effect on the main thing--stabilization of the operation of the sector. Now it is on the verge of collapse. This was stated by representatives of labor collectives of Donbass's Tsentralnyy Rayon at a meeting with Ukraine President L. Kravchuk. What's the problem? Payment failures have paralyzed production. Since the start of the year, the mines have not been paid 3 trillion karbovantsy [Ukrainian rubles] for coal shipped. Under these conditions, naturally, the mines can't even maintain production. And in order to boost production, new mine faces have to be opened. But there's no money. The work front is declining, as is the motivation to work. "It all started with talk about the market," said O. Kalfakheyan sadly (he's the general director of Dzerzhynskvuhillya Association). "We have state orders, but we get nothing for state prices. The businessmen are living off the state and the working people. We have nothing to work with, the sector has been artificially paralyzed." L. Kravchuk: "What do you suggest to get out of the crisis?" "The state needs to extend credit." "What will it be spent on?" "Settling our debts." After that brief dialogue, there was a pause in the meeting. Extending credit means settling the debts of the past; there are nonpayments for 1992 and 1993. How are people to live now? There is no easy answer. One good thing, however, is that the fault of the state for the sector's problems was acknowledged. And the next step was taken: the government cannot just put out the fire, it has to draw up an integrated plan to solve the sector's crisis. In the presence of the miners, L. Kravchuk created a commission to study the situation and draw up specific proposals. It is supposed to submit a concrete program of action in 10 days. Everything seems to be fine and logical. But I should like to make this comment. None of the troubles in the coal sector, which is so essential to Ukraine's economy, took shape overnight. The government failed to act. The idea of meeting with the miners didn't come up on the day of the meeting, either. Hence, the commission could have been created earlier so that its proposals could have been discussed at the meeting, but this was not done. Time is being lost, and problems are getting worse. We don't seem to know how to look ahead. We operate on the principle, "The peasant doesn't cross himself until he hears the thunder."
