The head of the Belarusian Parliament thanked the U.S. President for his great personal contribution to the protection of human rights and highly assessed the Partnership for Peace cooperation program proposed by Bill Clinton. Speaking about the situation in the republic, Stanislav Shushkevich said he is advocating a democratic development of the state, early elections of supreme legislative bodies, and economic reforms. He expressed hope that the new constitution -- the Supreme Soviet is to consider it at its current session -- will assist in this. Bill Clinton, in his turn, said the United States wants to support democratic processes which are under way in the Republic of Belarus, and is ready to provide technical aid in holding early elections. Bill Clinton said the United States is allocating an additional $25 million in order to implement the process of withdrawing the strategic nuclear forces from Belarusian territory. He also said that an American business center will be opened in Minsk, possibly in the next two months. The Treaty on Encouragement and Mutual Protection of Investments between the Republic of Belarus and the United States, signed today by Stanislav Shushkevich and Bill Clinton, will help to develop economic cooperation between the two countries.
