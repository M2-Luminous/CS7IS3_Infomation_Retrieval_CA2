The prices, agreed upon by the executive committee of the Council of Ministers are: 1.20 pesos per liter for special gasoline; 1 peso per liter for regular gasoline; 75 cents per liter of gas oil or diesel. The resolution establishes that the money will be collected when the private-use fuel ration cards are issued to consumers in the places designated by the enterprises that are authorized to operate the service centers. The fuel ration cards will be given out, in the same manner as before, according to Cuba's fuel supply. The enterprises that will supply and charge for the fuel ration cards for private use will guarantee that they have no expiration date and that those not used by year end, for any reason, can be renewed during the period that the said enterprises establish. A private vehicle owner who has a 1994 fuel ration card when the new prices become effective can renew them before 31 July 1994 in the same place where he got them. He will have to pay the difference between the old and new prices.
