Through CADESCA, the Central American Program for the Stabilization of the Agricultural Frontier, the EEC will support the ministry by promoting a development project that will ease the pressure on the agricultural frontier in the Bosawas area. To this end, MARENA officials submitted a proposal for the Bosawas region in which they identified the areas to be monitored. They are the basin of the Bocay River, including mestizo communities, the development area in what used to be Resistencia de Ayapal, and the Sumo communities in this 800-square kilometer zone. The project will help support the communities in awarding land titles. The British Government will be supporting MARENA by using satellite photography to determine the advance of the agricultural frontier. Although an agreement has not yet been signed with the British Government, the head of MARENA, Dr. Jaime Incer, indicated that Nicaragua may have access to the service this year. The issue arose during a visit by the British ambassador, who was impressed by the amount of information handled by MARENA's forest inventory center, Incer said. The project will furnish regular satellite photographs of Nicaragua, showing where forests have been burned, where trees are being planted, etc.
