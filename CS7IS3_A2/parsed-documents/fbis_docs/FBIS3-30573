Good evening to you. What should Croatia expect from tomorrow's meeting of EU [European Union] foreign ministers in Brussels, or to put it briefly, will sanctions [against Croatia] be imposed or not. [Granic] I believe they will not be imposed. Bosnia-Herzegovina was placed on the agenda earlier. We are aware that Denmark will put forward a proposal to impose sanctions but we believe that this will not take place. It is possible that they will discuss taking away some privileges. We believe that the meeting tomorrow will end with a declaration that will call on all three sides to do all they can to achieve a cease-fire and an agreement. Additional pressure on Croatia is also possible but I believe that sanctions are not probable. [Announcer] Two days ago Croatia received a statement issued by the UN Security Council chairman. What is Croatia preparing as a reply. I noticed that the Council for National Defense and Security held a meeting yesterday. What now? [Granic] The statement issued by the UN Security Council chairman represents additional pressure on all three sides, Croatia in particular. It followed a letter sent by Haris Silajdzic [on the regular Croatian Army's intervention in Bosnia] and was accompanied by pressure exerted by Islamic states. The statement is toned down in comparison to its first version. Its intention is of course to press the Croatian side in doing its best to reach a lasting cease-fire and an agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia is prepared to do all it can because of its own interests, the interests of the whole region, and the international situation. We were urged to do so in all other contacts we had, by the Holy See, and all other important states. Croatia will accept the supervision of the borders and it has proposed the supervision of all borders between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia and all the other borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia has also proposed the supervision of all of its military units, and it will propose the same to the Croatian Defense Council, telling them to invite international inspections. We claim that 2,000 volunteers from Croatia are fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina to protect their homes, but in any case, we will accept all the results of the inspections. It is known that regular Croatian Army units are deployed in the area north of Dubrovnik [inside Bosnia-Herzegovina's Trebinje municipality] in agreement with the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. In any case, Croatia is prepared to do everything it can to continue negotiations on an unconditional cease-fire and to achieve a lasting solution as soon as possible. [Announcer] You visited Rome and the Vatican this week. This was followed by a report from Rome that Italian Foreign Minister Andreatta was prepared to host a meeting between President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic. [Granic] Yes, the Italian side is prepared to organize such a meeting and we have conveyed this to the Bosnian side. It was agreed that Prime Minister Silajdzic and I will hold a meeting in Geneva on Wednesday. If any progress is made a decision will be made on a meeting at the highest level and its venue. [Announcer] A meeting of Bosnian Croats is taking place in Sarajevo today and another one will take place in Livno. You will go to Livno as President Tudjman's envoy. What do you think about the meeting in Sarajevo. [Granic] We understand the delicate and specific position of the Croats in Sarajevo, and that is why the meeting in Livno is taking place as a meeting of all Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- those expelled, those in free territory, or those in Posavina -- are in different positions in comparison to the Croats in Sarajevo. I hope that these meetings will be meetings of unity of the Croatian nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they will not harm Croatian state policy and the basic Croatian interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Announcer] After the next round of Geneva negotiations there is another meeting in store. The deputy prime minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is expected to visit Zagreb on 12 February. [Granic] Yes, this meeting will take place in Zagreb, and it is planned that an initial meeting of the joint commissions for finding missing persons, humanitarian issues, and refugees will take place. We will also discuss all details about the opening of [diplomatic] offices in Belgrade and Zagreb, and all other important political issues in connection with the normalization of Serb-Croat relations will be on the agenda. Tomorrow we expect to sign seven agreements with the Slovenian Government, and as early as tomorrow we will also resume negotiations on all unresolved issues with the Slovenian Government.
