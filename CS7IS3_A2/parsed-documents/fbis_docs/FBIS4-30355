Mr. Chairman, what do you think of Prime Minister Hata's decision on the general resignation of his cabinet? [Yonezawa] The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] submited a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet shortly after the fiscal 1994 budget bill was enacted in the Diet. Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has demanded that the Hata cabinet resign en masse. Prime Minister Hata has chosen the path of resigning with his cabinet en masse in a bid to overcome a difficult political situation. I would like to highly praise Prime Minister Hata's decision. To overcome the difficult political situation, the prime minister had only two options -- the dissolution of the House of Representatives or the general resignation of his cabinet. If the House of Representatives is dissolved, a political vacuum would be created under this difficult political situation and political reform would be left halfdone. I believe the prime minister made a last-minute choice, taking into account all those things. I would like to express my respect for Mr. Hata's decision and highly rate his decision. [NHK] How do you think the next government will be formed? [Yonezawa] The Hata cabinet will resign en masse. The prime minister decided on the general resignation of his cabinet in response to the LDP which has claimed the Hata cabinet deserves to be voted out in the Diet, and the SDPJ that has demanded that the Hata cabinet resign en masse. I believe that a situation will be created wherein all political parties discuss how to form a new government. I also believe that debates will be held on the formation of a new government and the choice of prime minister. Our party will watch how the political situation will develop in the future. [NHK] Does the DSP plan to make immediate moves toward forming a new government? [Yonezawa] Our party was subject to the no-confidence motion and, as a partner of the Hata government, it was asked to resign en masse. The Hata cabinet has just resigned en masse. Our party, therefore, will not make any immediate moves. We will watch how the political situation develops in the future.
