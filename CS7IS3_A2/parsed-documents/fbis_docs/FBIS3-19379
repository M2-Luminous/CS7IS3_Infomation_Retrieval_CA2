This was announced by Federal Spokeswoman Heide Schmidt at a press conference in Vienna on Tuesday. She justified this step by pointing out that the principle of proportional representation, which is set down in the Constitution, has been violated. Schmidt thinks the fact that in Salzburg about 10 percent of the votes in one constituency are required for a basic mandate and thus for entering the diet is a distortion of democracy. The LF will challenge the election results in Salzburg and, demonstratively, also in the provinces of Styria and Carinthia, where there are similarly high thresholds. In addition to contesting the elections in the Constitutional Court, the LF will also petition the Austrian Government to challenge the election laws in those provinces where the principle of proportional representation is violated. Schmidt stressed that her party had already announced its intention to challenge the elections before election day and would have done so even if it had entered the Diet. Regardless of this challenge, the LF also opposes the way in which declarations of support must be presented for a party to be permitted to run in elections.
