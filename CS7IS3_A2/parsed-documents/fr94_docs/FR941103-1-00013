FR941103-1-00013 FR941103-1-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [KY&hyph;069&hyph;6105b; FRL&hyph;5089&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Commonwealth of Kentucky AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky through the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet approving the redesignation to attainment and maintenance plan of the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas because they meet the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements. EPA also proposes to approve the 1990 baseline emissions inventory of the two areas. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the Commonwealth's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so at this time. DATES: To be considered, comments must be received by December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Scott Southwick, at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the documents relative to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations.
