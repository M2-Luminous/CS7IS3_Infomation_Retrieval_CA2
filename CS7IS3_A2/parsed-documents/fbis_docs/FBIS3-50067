After nearly an hour of talks with the Serbian president, Djindjic said that no party could at this moment take the responsibility for forming the government, and particularly not, as he stressed, the party that had so far formed all Serbian governments. He said that they did not discuss the post of the prime minister, but added that it had been stressed during the talks that he had to be "a man of consensus." The DS believes that the new government's program has to be different from all those we have had so far, Djindjic said. According to him, the Serbian president said that the future government's composition will not be determined by party allegiance. Commenting on his impressions of the talks with the Serbian president, Djindjic emphasized that the government would be some kind of a government of national unity, which should have an all-party support and a nonpartisan program. The DS stance is that the president of the new Serbian National Assembly should be an opposition deputy, and we hope that this will be the case, Djindjic said. He added that the president of Serbia "has a somewhat different opinion." According to Djindjic, the Serbian president said that the Socialist Party of Serbia, as the strongest party, had the right to the post of the president of the Serbian Assembly, while the opposition parties could have the posts of deputy presidents. The DS insists that "the parties [as received] have indisputable control of the finance, media, and internal affairs," Djindjic said. "If we are not in the position to control for 24 hours a day the banks, state media, and the police, and in particular the struggle against crime, there is no point in talking about a new government and a new coalition," Djindjic stressed. Djindjic believes that the new government will not be formed in the next two weeks. After Djindjic, Vuk Draskovic went in for talks with President Milosevic. Before that, he briefly said to reporters: "I have come to meet him and to talk."
