Here follows the statement of his excellency, the secretary of commerce: [Brown] [passage omitted] This week, I will also be visiting Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and the West Bank. My mission is aimed at encouraging economic development and commercial relations which will help stability in this region, create economic variety in the Arab Gulf, expand commercial relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, and consolidate the peace process. [passage omitted] The economic strategy of the Clinton administration is based on fledgling and changing markets such as in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries. We believe that these markets have got a huge potential to develop in coming years. Moreover, it is important to reach a wide-ranging shift toward a free trade policy between the United States and GCC countries, whose officials I will meet tomorrow. There are a number of U.S. companies eager to conclude partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, while these Gulf countries are aspiring to diversify their economies, which are based on oil. The proceedings of dialogue I am to open tomorrow will focus upon reducing the number of barriers to build more sound commercial relations between our two countries, reducing tariff barriers and expanding protection of cultural heritage. All these are naturally among our priorities. During my meetings with the Saudi leadership, I am hoping to have talks that will strengthen commercial relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia. [passage omitted] Thank you, and I am now ready to hear your questions. [end Brown] In reply to a question aircraft which Saudi Arabia was intending to buy from the United States, his excellency Mr. Ronald Brown indicated that during his visit to the Kingdom last May his excellency spent a long time discussing with Saudi Government officials commercial interests between the two countries. His excellency said: "One of the issues raised then was the purchase of aircraft and this issue is going to be included in our agenda during this visit." His excellency added that his excellency was happy with the progress achieved on the subject. [passage omitted] His excellency further said: "We see an enlargement of participation in this agreement and in view of our close relationship and strong economic and commercial links with Saudi Arabia, we see the latter joining in." His excellency indicated that specific questions were raised concerning the Kingdom and his excellency expressed his confidence that these questions would be settled. His excellency added: "These are some of the items we will discuss during my visit." [passage omitted] His excellency also described his previous visit to Saudi Arabia as great and said: "This is why I returned to visit the Kingdom after only eight months. This highlights the importance the United States attaches to its relations with Saudi Arabia." [passage omitted] His excellency further said: "I believe progress has been achieved as regards our trade relations. This has been done with the promotion of joint solidarity projects, U.S. investments, and improvement of trade relations between the two countries."
