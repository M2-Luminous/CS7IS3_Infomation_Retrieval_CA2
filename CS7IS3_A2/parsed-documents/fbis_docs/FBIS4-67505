FBIS4-67505 "jpten013___94028" JPRS-TEN-94-013 JPRS Environmental Issues 5 May 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA Ministry Formulates Strategy for Utilizing Waste Ministry Formulates Strategy for Utilizing Waste LD0505122794 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1028 GMT 5 May 94 LD0505122794 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The collegium of Russia's Environment Ministry has approved a draft program called Waste, worked out in accordance with government instructions and designed to a formulate a unified national policy toward handling production and consumption waste. To be implemented before the year 2000, the program will require financing worth more than one trillion rubles (over 800 million dollars). The funds are to come from the federal budget, from the Federal Ecological Fund, from regional budgets and ecological funds, as well as from enterprises and commercial structures. About 7 billion tons of waste is formed in Russia annually, with only 28 percent put to use. The total quantity of the accumulated toxic and ecologically dangerous waste has reached 1.6 billion tons. The program provides for utilizing the waste containing mercury, one of the substances most dangerous to human health. This waste will be processed at the smelting plant of the Krasnodar mercury mines--the only facility of this kind functioning in Russia. According to the authors of the document, one of the gravest problems is to utilize the waste of chromium-related production, no country in the world has resolved yet. According to last year's data, Russia has accumulated 9 million tons of this kind of waste, which is stored at the Khrompik plant in Sverdlovsk Region and at the Novotroitsk chromium combinations plant in Orenburg Region. As the authors of the program said, should the reservoirs containing such waste get damaged because of wear or natural disaster, the toxic chromium may create in the basin of the Rivers Chusovaya, Volga and Ural a catastrophic situation comparable with the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear-power plant. The authors believe that the problem of utilizing the waste of chromium-related production in Russia can be partially resolved by means of introducing special technology, which makes it possible to transmute chromium into a non-toxic substance and obtain from it building materials for covering floors and tiling. This method was devised by a research center in Yekaterinburg. Furthermore, the Waste program provides for processing and utilizing some other kinds of production and consumption waste, particularly zinc-containing waste and the waste of the cellulose and timber industries.
