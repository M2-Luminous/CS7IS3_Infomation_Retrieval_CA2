A study conducted by a large retail loans bank indicates that losses to the financial system could reach $10.4 billion. It is estimated that the new currency might reduce the monthly inflation rate to about 2 percent by May. This upheaval will force the financial institutions to gain money with new products, adjust their fees to higher rates, and indirectly streamline their structures. Its impact should be similar to that caused by the Cruzado Program in 1986, although the financial system has already had to go through extensive belt-tightening since then. Arnoldo de Oliveira, the National Bank executive board superintendent, emphasizes: "It will be a painful process because it will end with a dishonest system. And after this the system's profitability will decline." By a dishonest system we understand the following: The bank overlooks the huge profits yielded by floating funds -- the unused money that remains in the current accounts. And the customer, in turn, pretends that the bank does not have any operational costs. Out of a total $18 billion in profits, this sector gained $4 billion through the use of floating funds.
