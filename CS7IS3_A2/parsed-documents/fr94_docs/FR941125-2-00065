ACTION: Notice of approval. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) approves the revisions to the State of Michigan's federally approved wetland program resulting from the reorganization of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) by Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Douglas Ehorn, Chief, Wetlands and Watersheds Section, U.S. EPA, Region 5, 77 W. Jackson (WQW&hyph;16J), Chicago, Illinois, 60604. (312) 353&hyph;2308 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On October 2, 1984, EPA published notice of its approval of the State of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program pursuant to Section 404(g)(1) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344(g)(1). 49 FR 38948. Michigan's program became effective October 16, 1984. 49 FR 38948 (October 2, 1984). 40 CFR 233.60. 40 CFR 233.16 requires that EPA review and either approve or disapprove of any revisions to a state's Section 404 wetlands program based upon whether the revisions comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations. 40 CFR 233.16(d)(3) provides that, if EPA determines that a program revision is substantial, EPA must provide public notice and an opportunity for public hearing on the revision. Michigan's original program description submitted to EPA on October 26, 1983 specified that the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) was the agency responsible for implementing the permitting and enforcement components of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. The Michigan Water Resources Commission (MWRC) was specified as the agency responsible for insuring that wetland permitting was coordinated with state, interstate and federal-state water related planning and review processes.
