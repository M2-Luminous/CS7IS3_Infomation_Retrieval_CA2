This nuclear power plant's information department told Interfax that after the first unit was switched off on January 18 following a water leek, the second unit worked at a capacity of 1300 megawatts. The same source announced that the second unit had been shut down following the failure of the manual control system for the reactor's stages (a button on the control board went out of operation). The administration of the nuclear power plant stated that despite those malfunctions, the system of automatic control and the safety equipment remained in a working condition. The reactor was shut down according to the safety regulations. The radiation situation did not change, says the administration's official press release. Repair work has been done already and preparations are underway for putting the reactor back into operation, presumably on Friday. In view of the 2nd unit's stoppage, Lithuania experienced a shortage of energy on Thursday, Lithuania's Deputy Minister for Energy Saulius Kutas told Interfax.
