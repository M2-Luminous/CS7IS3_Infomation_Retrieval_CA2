[passage omitted] Addressing the meeting, Basang, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and vice chairman of the autonomous regional committee of the CPPCC, said: Since the first meeting of the Sixth Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Committee of the CPPCC, the committee, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, has been conscientiously implementing guidelines set by 14th CPC National Congress, the third plenary session of the 14th Central Committee, and the fifth (enlarged) meeting of the fourth autonomous regional party committee; holding high the flags of patriotism and socialism; persisting in the principles of long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, and treating each other with all sincerity and sharing weal or woe; fully promoting socialist democracy; seriously exercising the functions of political consultations and democratic supervision amid economic construction; and making its due contributions toward the region's political stability, reform and opening up, economic development, and social progress. As this year will be an important year for China's on-going reform, opening up, and modernization drive, "seizing the opportunities, deepening reform, opening wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability" will be the overall strategies for the entire nation." Within the realm of these overall strategies, we in the CPPCC must first identify our position, select a favorable perspective, and bring out our superiority before we offer plans and ideas for stabilizing the situation and promoting reform, opening up, and economic construction. In line with the principle of macroeconomics, pioneering, in-depth, and practicality, we should actively participate in government and political affairs by putting forward plans and ideas, concentrating on major problems surfacing in carrying out the central tasks of the autonomous regional party committee and government, on difficult points in economic development, and on flash topics of common concern. In his speech, Comrade Basang put forward concrete demands on ways to better bring out the role of consultation and supervision under the CPPCC system and how special investigations, self-construction, and organizational services can be intensified.
