Qian made the assessment at a press conference here today. In response to a question about U.S. President Bill Clinton's reported disappointment over Christopher's China visit, Qian said, "I am also somewhat disappointed. More results could have been achieved. "During my first round of talks with Christopher, I was the first to say something disappointing. The meeting between us was prepared in accordance with an invitation I had extended to Christopher when we met on January 24 in Paris. "In his letter to me in mid-February, he said he would like to visit China in mid March, which I agreed, because this visit had the possibility of reaching agreements that are beneficial for further developing relations between the two countries. "Something had occurred just before the visit of the secretary of state, which disappointed us. In my view, these matters at least demonstrated that the U.S. side didn't have enough sincerity for this visit." On U.S. granting China most-favored-nation trade status (MFN), Qian said, its renewal will benefit both China and the United States. Its removal will be bad news for both countries. Qian said that the MFN status is a reciprocal and mutually- beneficial arrangement between China and the United States, and it is the base for normal trade for the two countries. "The United States has given the MFN status to many other countries, and I have never heard it will be removed. If the U.S. Government should remove the status for China, trade between China and the U.S. can hardly be carried on," he said, adding that, if it should happen, China and the U.S. would be the first to suffer losses, and other countries and regions like Hong Kong and Taiwan will also suffer. Qian also said that it can be hardly said that in his talks with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, the differences in the views on the human rights issue were narrowed, but the two sides did reach some common understanding on specific methods and measures to handle that issue. He said, "that can be considered progress in this regard." Answering a question on whether or not removal of the MFN status for China will make economic relations between China and the U.S. deteriorate, and whether or not that will lead to a deterioration of their political relations, the foreign minister said, "deterioration of economic relations will surely have some negative influence, but efforts being made by both sides are just to prevent this kind of deterioration from occurring." More than one third of the questions put forward today during the hour-long press conference were related to Sino-U.S. relations. About 600 Chinese and foreign reporters were present at the conference, which was sponsored by the ongoing session of the National People's Congress (NPC).
