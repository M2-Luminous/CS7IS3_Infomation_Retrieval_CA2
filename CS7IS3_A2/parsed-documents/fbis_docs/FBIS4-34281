Fujimori made this statement after his return from Colombia, where he attended the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena on 14 and 15 June. Fujimori, who visited China and Japan before his visit to Colombia, said that what Latin America is currently spending on weapons should be invested in development. Commenting on Peruvian domestic policy and former President Alan Garcia, who has been in asylum in Colombia since June 1992, Fujimori said: "I cannot accept an agreement with or even negotiate with a person who destroyed the country." Recently there has been conjecture about a possible rapprochement between the government and the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA), the party led by Alan Garcia, who ruled Peru from 1985 to 1990.
