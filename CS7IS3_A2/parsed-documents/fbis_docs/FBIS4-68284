Endless stairways and secluded corners unexpectedly terminate in enormous rooms, where pilot lights and instruments flicker in mysterious darkness. Then there are more stairways, passageways, and heavy, massive doors. "Our command center began operating on 30 November 1981," said Lieutenant General P. Kuznetsov, chief of staff of the MO [Moscow District] PVO. "It cost the government at that time 74 million rubles." We headed for the combat control room - the holy of holies of the command center. The plotting boards, charts, and maps illuminated in the darkness could at any time supply the military personnel with literally all the data. A monitor screen displayed a weather report pertaining to military airfields. For example, it was shown that at Bologoye there were a haze, calm, humidity of 95 percent, and visibility of 300 meters. P. Kuznetsov gave the command for a report on the air situation on the northern borders of Russia. There was an immediate change in the size of the map, which showed in large scale the Leningrad Oblast area, with two aircraft flying from Scandinavia in that direction. While we watched the moving electronic spots, an air defense crew located somewhere near Vyborg had already taken up its combat stations. But what was the story? The new instructions forbid knocking down foreign air liners and sports craft that violate Russia's air space. However, the brigade staff command post operations officer has the authority to give the command to destroy a military "pirate." He is not required to obtain permission from the state's top persons to do this. "Many people do not believe that in this economically difficult time we are able to maintain a high state of combat readiness," said Colonel General A. Kornukov, district commander. "But that really is so. Eighty percent of our troops received the good or excellent evaluation in last year's combat preparation rating. In the concluding exercises, more than 100 aerial targets entered our zone at various altitudes and speeds, and all were "destroyed." The men are provided with uniforms, footwear, and food rations. Our military pilots--the only ones in Russia--were able to put in 100 percent of the time called for in the training programs. Ninety-five percent of the air defense regiments are armed with the new S-300 missiles." Indeed, the PVO troops cannot be said to be a stepchild of the government. This is easily seen by looking at the Moscow District. The staff command post in which we were located, although the main one, is definitely not the only one in the district. Under extreme conditions, any one of the five reserve command posts can take on the function of troop command and control. It is true that, in the opinion of military specialists, there is no chance whatsoever that the above situation will obtain. The fortification secrets of underground structures are such that the command post is reliably protected against all types of weapons of mass destruction. Even in the case--God forbid!--an enemy's nuclear bomb would score a direct hit on the site, this would not harm a single hair on the heads of the officers and generals as they perform the 24-hour watch. The combat control room, automatic warning system computing facility, and the communications center are capable of 10 days more in automatic operation. The bunker's reinforced concrete walls are filled with metal shells mounted on special cables and shock absorbers. These constructions prevent soil displacement even in case of a substantial explosion. Military persons would not be surprised if told that it would not be a bad idea to have this kind of stronghold within the population's civil defense system. You and I know that potatoes for plant dining halls have long been stored in puny bomb shelters. They are much cheaper for enterprise workers in the fall than in spring when purchased in stores. Well, the above is incidental to the story. What kind of service are PVO men performing now, and which traditions are they observing and promoting? The MO "lost" 100 large units last year. However, this is in no way a tragedy. Troop reformation is to continue, and it seems that it is impossible to ignore the Suvorov instruction "skill, not numbers" by hiding behind thick walls of a bastion. Nonetheless, it cannot be said that hanging over the heads of district units and subunits is a mortal danger of mass discharges into the reserves, something which is frequently stated in newspapers. Rumors of elimination of the "defensive rings" around Moscow are grossly exaggerated, according to the military authorities. The chief slogan used by Russian airborne troops is "no one other than we." For missilemen, this is "who if not we." This is how the PVO generals feel, referring to the military action experience in Iraq, where the Americans' successful air offensive was decisive in securing victory for them. The Moscow District is capable of launching missiles against 500 targets at the same time. It would be foolish, even criminal, to dissolve this kind of army branch, considering that only a single cruise missile reaching its target would be capable of inflicting upon the national economy a severe lesson. Also, the MO is watching over 1.3 million square kilometers of Russia, eight nuclear power stations, and about 140 installations considered to be special. The above supertasks compel missilemen to keep their powder dry. Formation of a professional army is still something for the future. And filling the manpower needs by voluntary recruitment only leaves much to be desired. In a word, summer is drawing near, and with it the PVO men's new evaluation launchings against practice targets. This is something for which they are ready at all hours of the day and night at Anino. But what about other missile and radar stations distributed over an enormous area? One can only hope that only training alerts will be sounded there.
