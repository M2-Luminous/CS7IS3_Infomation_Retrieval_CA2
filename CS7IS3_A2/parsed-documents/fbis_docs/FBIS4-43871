Martino told parliament that the government opposes the action "the French would have wanted, with or without us," because it would constitute a "major factor in the conflict" in the Central African country. In Brussels, a diplomatic source had earlier said that Italy was prepared, on certain conditions, to send troops to join soldiers France wants to send to Rwanda to halt the ethnic bloodletting there. The diplomat was speaking after some nations in the Western European Union (WEU) had declared readiness following an ambassadorial meeting to provide logistic support for the French move if it receives backing in a new UN Security Council resolution. A draft resolution drawn up by France was on the table in New York on Tuesday. Italy was ready to take part in "humanitarian intervention" at the initiative of the WEU, the United Nations or the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Martino said, "provided above all that the concerned parties agree to it." The mainly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) have warned that they will fight any French intervention because they consider that Paris armed the Rwandan army, which in turn trained extremist Hutu militias accused of killing hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and opposition Hutus. Intervention by "one or two white countries would be considered an act of neo-colonialism," Martino said, adding that "if we send a contingent now, they will finish up like the Belgian soldiers" in a reference to 10 UN peacekeepers massacred when the ethnic bloodbath began early in April.
