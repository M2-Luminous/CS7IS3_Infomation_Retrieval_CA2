This followed the TEC's decision to retain provisionally Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. IFP spokesman Ed Tillet said in a statement in Durban that the TEC's decision made a mockery of the lengthy campaign fought by the ANC [African National Congress] and its allies to have the legislation removed from the statute books.
