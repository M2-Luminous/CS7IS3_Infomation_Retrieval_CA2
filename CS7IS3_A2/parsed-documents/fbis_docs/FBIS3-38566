"This is a great day for the progressives," said Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Left Democrat Party. "We have put together a glorious fighting machine." Present for today's talks were representatives from the Left Democrat Party, the Rete, the Greens, Communist Renewal, the Socialist Party, Socialist Renewal, the Social Christians and Democratic Alliance. The document approved today "does not solve all problems pertaining to government, but it is one on which we can construct a hypothesis for government," a clearly elated Occhetto told the press. According to the document, the united left will field just one joint candidate in each constituency under a banner specially created for the alliance, "while at the same time maintaining the values of our autonomous cultural and political inspirations." The process of selecting candidates will begin tomorrow, but criteria for the choice was already being drawn up Tuesday evening. Each party involved in the pact will present a selection of possibilities from which the alliance candidates will be drawn. "The progressive, reformist democratic forces, drawn from socialist, Catholic, lay and environmental backgrounds...wish to give a precise, realistic, constructive response to the problems raised by the bankruptcy of the old order and the ancien regime," the programme document said. At the basis of the wide-ranging alliance, which stretches from centrist Socialists and Democratic Alliance to the far-left Communist Renewal, is a desire to "restore a foundation of ethical values to politics." Fears that differences between the far left and centre would prove irreconcilable were proved wrong, with carefully-worded solutions found even for such sticking points as privatisation: "to restore dynamism to the economy, to combat parasitism and state hand-outs, we must shore up the public sector but also, when the case arises, encourage privatisation on the basis of rigorous analysis to evaluate when this would be of use to society, and not only on merely accounting bases." The compromises found placated Communist Renewal chief Fausto Bertinotti who said "the hypothesis of two separate negotiating tables, one for an electoral accord and another one on politics and government policy, has collapsed. We are heading for elections with an exhaustive document, although this does not mean that it cannot be widened." Pledges in the left-wing alliance document include one to "regenerate democratic institutions," and, in the economic field, to "open up new paths for development, while guaranteeing an improvement in public finances, an increase in employment, and protection for our cultural and environmental heritage." Tax fairness was promised, as were shorter working hours and an end to an "individual consumist model" and to concentration of power in central government. The progressive alliance made no bones about the "austerity implied" by its programme promises, but pledged to make sure that the weakest did not bear the brunt of this temporary hardship. On a foreign policy note, the document stated the alliance's commitment to "peace and the formation of a new world order based on democratic rules and human rights." The progressives came down in favour of a strong European Union and of "a society of democracy, hard work, solidarity and tolerance." The document failed to state clearly the alliance's position on the direct election of the prime minister, a topic dear to the hearts of the left-wing intellectuals grouped under the Democratic Alliance banner. During the press conference to present the progressives' document, Occhetto claimed that the issue had be "made ridiculous" by electoral reform champion [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni "who woke up one fine morning and ran here there and everywhere saying 'I want to be premier'. This is no way to carry on." The left must now "make this a serious subject once again," said Occhetto, adding that a white paper on the election of a premier will be presented at the beginning of the next legislature. As a satisfied Occhetto briefed the press on the agreement reached, leading lights in other political parties involved were also sounding positive about the outcome of today's talks. "We would never say we agreed with something if we did not," said Ferdinando Adornato of Democratic Alliance, while the Rete's leader Leoluca Orlando stated "this is an electoral agreement which can become a government agreement, once it has been through the essential checks by economic and social groups, associations, the voluntary sector and private enterprise." La Rete has announced that it will field candidates under its own banner, and not jointly with the left-wing alliance, for the 25 percent of parliamentary seats to be assigned with a proportional representation system. The remaining 75 percent will be handed out on a first-past-the-post basis. Carlo Ripa di Meana said that his Green Party had given "unconditional support" to the left-wing programme, and said that vetoes placed by his environmental line-up on topics such as a high-speed train network for Italy had been accepted by the others around the progressive negotiating table.
