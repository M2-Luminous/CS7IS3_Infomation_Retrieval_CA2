He also indicated that despite events that have occurred throughout the country since 1 January, the federal government does not foresee any changes as these relate to [economic] expectations. Likewise, Sanchez stated that manufacturing growth during the first quarter will be practically "stable" or very small since it should be kept in mind that the October-November 1993 period there was a fall in activity. Despite the fact that growth in manufacturing activity has been minor during the first three months of the year, there are no plans to prepare any emergency programs to stimulate this productive sector of the country. The SECOFI official indicated that what the federal government is doing is working with competitive programs designed within the framework of PECE [Stability, Employment and Competitiveness Pact], of which there are currently 33 such programs. Through these mechanisms, the federal government is working with each manufacturing company to solve their most urgent problems. The most common, pressing problems that have been identified among these companies include inadequate financing, tariffs, red tape and public bids, among others. Interviewed within the framework of the inauguration of the Expo-Electronic 94, the official denied that investment plans in the assembly plant industry are being delayed. He stressed that it is even appropriate to say that this is one of the most dynamic investment items of the national economy. In reinvigorating the issue of investments in the national manufacturing industry, Sanchez pointed out that many companies are now investing their capital in the sector. The Commerce Secretariat, he indicated, has detected a significant number of investments in every manufacturing field which are either concluding this year or are at a very advanced stage. These capital investments, he added, include those in the automobile sector, cement, textiles, electronics, and assembly plants. Sanchez stressed that there are a significant number of projects that are in an advanced stage. On the other hand, in reference to the problems of the electrical manufacturing industries which consist of purchases in the public sector -- Federal Electricity Commission -- he pointed out that they are at a standstill because of problems caused by Chapter 10 of the free trade agreement, but that it was already being resolved. Yesterday during a meeting with several manufacturers, an agreement was made with respect to what the rules of the game would be as they relate to national public bids authorized within the Free Trade Agreement. During his speech, Sanchez Ugarte said the electronic manufacturing industry represents a key element in the country's economic, modernization strategy because the search for greater levels of productivity has encouraged a more significant use of electronic products in most sectors.
