Iraq blockades the north. Iraq impoverishes the central region. What is this Iraq that works against its south, north, and everything in between? What is this Iraq that works against Iraq, trying to assassinate it? Ask the Security Council and those who dominate its resolutions. They are the ones dominating and besieging all of Iraq. They forbid all Iraq to have a loaf of bread, medicine, and cloth--with official resolutions they are proud of, which they are delighted to agree upon. They allege that all is well in the world, even that the world is new and pure, as stable as a mountain top. Why? Because the big people who are manipulated by the United Nations agree to extend the sanctions and to deprive Iraq of all imports and exports. And shamelessly, without any feeling of fraud or deceit, they claim that Iraq is besieging itself. Iraq has become, from their point of view, a hook on which they may hang all their errors and evils, including their crimes against Iraq. Again: Why? First, because Iraq is a huge reservoir of oil in the grip of a powerful people; they want its oil for free or almost free, down to the last drop, not just down to the last barrel. Secondly, because Iraq has reclaimed its [oil] wealth from the clutches of big companies and gone on to handle it justly, neither oppressing buyers nor cheating sellers. Third, because Iraq has used its oil revenues to benefit people: to build factories, roads, and bridges, universities, schools, clinics, and residential buildings; to eliminate illiteracy and to liberate people from ignorance. In short, Iraq has moved quickly toward modernization, to bridge the gap between it and post-industrial society. That is to say, its resources have not ended up at roulette wheels, or in banks to be brazenly stolen, nor have the revenues from our resources been distributed among kings and princes. Fourth, Iraq has become a power, a force for the truth that it defends. It is a power, a treasury of civilization, a power to strive toward a future where everything is new and honest. Iraq is a force for a unique mind and a powerful arm. These factors have all strengthened the philosophy and logic of Commander Saddam Husayn, and his management of matters of state and society. I say these factors have been strengthened, making Iraq a material and military power. This power has nothing to do with aggression, nor do its people have any time for aggression against anyone else. It is not in their character to encroach on other people's rights, though they may respond to aggression. It is enough that they safeguard their building; it is enough that they are protective of justice, and profoundly opposed to all evil. Fifth, when they failed in their plan to alienate the leader from those he leads; when God, the people, and Saddam Husayn thwarted their efforts to destroy the people's spirit, to kill the conscience of the resistance, then their hatred increased, and these failed people's hatred grew even more bitter and crafty. Today the whole world knows that Iraq has departed from the script written in the West. Countries have fallen, blocs have collapsed, people and countries have been torn apart. Leaders have crumbled under American pressure; some have chosen to rely on the refuge and the mercies of their enemy. All this has happened, yet Iraq remains as it wants to be, not as they want; as God, not they, has decreed. And so? The masters of many traitorous individuals admitted their failure even before we said so. These many utterances from the marshes, mountains, coasts, and valleys are unmoved. We are and will remain justified because we are believers.
