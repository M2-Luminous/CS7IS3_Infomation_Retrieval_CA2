We heard Syrian Foreign Minister al-Shar's public statement yesterday that the Israeli offer is silly. We heard the outright public rejection. Did you hear anything in today's talks which sheds more light on the Syrian reply? [Gur] Naturally, the style was completely different. The phrase silly plan was not even on the agenda. The talks are serious. We cannot speak of a breakthrough, but we are trying very hard to find the way to a breakthrough. I hope we will succeed. [Levi] Christopher said that the negotiations have entered a new and substantive level, while you say that there was no breakthrough. How is the situation different, then? [Gur] We must first remember that the U.S. secretary of state spent many hours discussing with the Syrian president, something we, certainly I, did not. It may be that following his talks with the Syrian president, the secretary received the impression that there is a different tune. Judging from our conclusions, however, I can say that the conditions which would enable us to say that we can enter a much more serious stage of negotiations have not yet been created . [Levi] Did the Syrians make a counterproposal? [Gur] As far as I know, the Syrians are not ready yet to discuss any issue in detail -- neither territory nor the nature of peace. They have a single position, which is total, sweeping, and therefore cannot serve as an opening or a basis for the continuation of the negotiations. We try to maneuver because we attribute great importance to the continuation of the peace process. Naturally, we will not maneuver beyond the issues pertaining to Israel's security. [Levi] By saying that the Syrians have a single stand, do you mean their demand that Israel immediately state that it is willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights in one fell swoop? [Gur] In essence, what you said is correct. I would not want to be misquoted when I repeat Syrian remarks, but the idea is this: There is nothing to talk about before Israel announces unequivocally that it is withdrawing from the entire Golan Heights. No other issue can be discussed before this happens. Naturally, we cannot accept such an attitude. We care about the distant future, not just our immediate future, but also the future of our children and grandchildren. Unless we know what we are actually talking about, it would be very hard to make progress in the negotiations. Hence, we need patience, endurance, and a willingness to make progress. [Levi] Qol Yisra'el reported this afternoon that, citing al-Asad, Christopher said Syria is willing to go into detail regarding the components of normalization with us, which is new. He also said that al-Asad would be willing to consider Israel's security needs, vague as this may sound. [Gur] That is possible. I agree with you that this sounds a bit vague. I would use almost the same words, if I were asked. That is why this is absolutely insufficient. We cannot plan our life based on hints, allegations, or obscure plans. We want to hear clear things; then we will make our clear remarks. [Levi] Regarding normalization, can you confirm the report I mentioned before? [Gur] I cannot confirm any report. I can only speak of what we know is a basis for making decisions. I must point out with regret that the Syrian stand has not changed to the extent that would call for a change of the fundamental decisionmaking concepts because we will not compromise Israel's security. [Levi] We spoke of the willingness to recognize Israel's security needs, and you said it is vague. Was the idea that keeps coming up regarding the demilitarization of the Golan Heights discussed this time? Is there any agreement on this? [Gur] The issue may have been raised in the discussion between them. We have not reached this stage yet. We are not discussing it because we have not heard an initial Syrian declaration regarding the nature and essence of peace, or that we can talk about this. I hope that, as a result of the U.S. efforts, the Syrian president will indeed reach the stage in which he himself states his position -- not through the mouths of others -- and say he regards peace as a comprehensive, long-term peace. Then, we will be able to begin detailed negotiations. [passage omitted]
