Meeting U.S. senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar Wednesday [5 January], he said that the step by the North Korean leadership could deteriorate the situation not only on the Korean Peninsula, but the world over. Pyongyang declared its intention to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty in March 1993. Grachev said Russia favors further inter-Korean dialogue. The minister described as counterproductive the possibility to impose international sanctions against North Korea. The problem should not be tackled with hastiness. He believes it is necessary to consider the possible political and military implications that could follow the sanctions, as well as to ask for China's opinion on the issue, since the country has very close contacts with North Korea. The minister has said that Russia stands for a balanced approach to the issue. He also believes that the international impact on Pyongyang should be aimed at drawing North Korea to rejoin the treaty, not at expanding its isolation. The development of the North Korean-U.S. talks, he believes, could be an effective means of influence. Russia and China could also influence Pyongyang.
