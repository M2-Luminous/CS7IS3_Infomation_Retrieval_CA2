This was the indirect reaction of Vladimir Dlouhy, minister of trade and industry, to claims made by Peter Rosenstingl, the Austrian Freedom Party spokesman, that the Czech nuclear power industry was becoming an ever-more-serious safety hazard for the whole of Europe. According to Minister Dlouhy, the causes of the fire at the Dukovany nuclear power station were of a routine nature and therefore should not be interpreted as evidence of the Czech Republic's obsolete technology and its failure to insure nuclear safety. Such a breakdown could happen anywhere. The fact that it has happened just now is rather unpleasant, added Vladimir Dlouhy.
