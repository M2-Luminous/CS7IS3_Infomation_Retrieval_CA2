[Makkawi] We asked for an urgent Security Council session to discuss the blatant Israeli aggression against Lebanon's territorial sanctity and the kidnapping of Lebanese citizen Mustafa al-Dirani as soon as we received the Lebanese Government's instructions last Saturday. That act was a violation of human rights, the UN Charter, and the principles of international law. I met with the Security Council chairman for that purpose. The issue is now in the hands of the Council and consultations are underway to set the date for the session. [Al-Miliji] You have undoubtedly discerned the prevailing attitudes of the Security Council members on this issue during these consultations. Can you tell us about them? [Makkawi] We immediately started contacting the permanent members. The majority of them showed an understanding of Lebanon's stance because, as I said, that action was a clear, blatant, and unambiguous aggression. We will contact the Nonaligned Movement's members in the Security Council to undertake the task of supporting and backing this complaint. There is an overall understanding within the United Nations of Lebanon's stance and demand. [Al-Miliji] Let us take the Security Council's permanent five members. What exactly is their stance? [Makkawi] With the exception of the United States, which does not yet have clear instructions, the other countries that we have met with--Russia, China, France, and Britain--have shown understanding and are ready to respond to the Lebanese demand for a session and to let the Security Council make some decision. [Al-Miliji] Haven't you held consultations with the U.S. Administration? [Makkawi] I am in touch with the U.S. representative to the United Nations. The Lebanese Government is undoubtedly holding consultations through our embassy in Washington. [Al-Miliji] Has the U.S. representative told you anything? [Makkawi] They are still studying the issue. We have not been informed so far of the final U.S. stance. [Al-Miliji] Going back to the issue of Mustafa al-Dirani and its repercussions, what is your opinion of the situation? [Makkawi] Israeli planes staged raids yesterday morning, killing dozens of people in the al-Biqa' Valley. We will inform the Security Council of this issue. [Al-Miliji] Isn't Mustafa al-Dirani's issue linked to the Lebanese resistance activities in south Lebanon, specifically to Hizballah's activities? [Makkawi] Al-Dirani is a Lebanese citizen. He was in bed when he was kidnapped. The Israeli raid targeted a site in the al-Biqa' Valley. As I said, dozens were killed and wounded. Hizballah in Lebanon is Lebanese resistance against the Israeli occupation. This resistance remains legitimate and recognized by the UN charter and international law as long as this occupation continues. All the problems in south Lebanon are caused by Israel's continued occupation of parts of south Lebanon and western al-Biqa'. These actions will continue as long as there is an occupation. The only solution lies in Israel's commitment to implement Security Council Resolution 425, which demands that it withdraw immediately from south Lebanon. Israel still refuses to comply with this resolution. [Al-Miliji] From what you are saying, there appears to be coordination between the Lebanese Government and the national resistance in the south. Is that true? [Makkawi] Every country has the right to resist occupation. Resistance is legitimate as long as there is occupation. This is not restricted to Lebanon. All countries in the world have fought occupation and colonialism. This is what the Lebanese people are doing. [Al-Miliji] This raises the question about the security situation in Lebanon. Doesn't this Israeli operation and the ease with which it was done raise this question? [Makkawi] Israel has gotten into the habit of undertaking such operations, not only in Lebanon but also in various parts of the world. I remind you of the Tunis operation in which a Palestinian official was killed. Israel is militarily developed and can carry out such operations regardless of the military situation in Lebanon. [Al-Miliji] What does Lebanon plan to do in the next stage? [Makkawi] The Security Council should ask Israel first to stop its aggression against Lebanon and second to release this Lebanese citizen immediately. These are Lebanon's main demands. [Al-Miliji] Will this take the form of a resolution? [Makkawi] We are holding contacts. I do not know yet what the Security Council's reaction will be. It might issue a resolution or a statement. How the Security Council will act is not clear yet.
