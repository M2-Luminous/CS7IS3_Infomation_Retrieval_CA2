Brother citizens: On this day in 1982, the great Egyptian people achieved what is regarded as one of the great historic events immortalized by time and thus etched forever in its annals, alive and forever in the people's conscience, and continue to spread their fruits and blessings everywhere until judgment day. This date will always remain one of Egyptian nationalism and a symbol that embodies the people's ability to give endlessly and its determination to sacrifice all that is dear for the sake of our land and sovereignty and in defense of the homeland's supreme interests and its right to live in security and peace with other peoples and nations. This will continue to add to humanity's assets and contribute to the process of renaissance and progress. This great achievement could not have come from a void nor have happened because of any historic coincidence. It was the logical and natural outcome of several antecedents and successive positive events that all came together to create this resounding victory and coordinated process that constituted a magnificent epic the like of which history rarely hands out. The people understood the course it had to take and set out its supreme national interests with a clear scientific vision that did not confuse between reality and dreams or between the possible and the impossible. It then expressed the sincere intention to achieve these objectives in accordance with the right priorities and regardless of the sacrifices. The tumultuous masses competed in the national action process with full seriousness and commitment to the objective. Not one Egyptian who loved his country deviated from the noble national consensus. With its unique sense of history and its shrewdness, the people realized that it had no life, present, or future without liberation of the land and honor and the retrieval of every single inch of the sacred land of a homeland blessed by Almighty God. It was incumbent on every Egyptian who cared deeply about his country and its honor to regard the objective of liberation as above all other considerations and to give it priority. No person, regardless of his status, can have dignity if his homeland does not hold its head high and has no dignity. The people, who have a rich civilization, knew that the road to liberation was difficult and bitter and that it was not strewn with roses, rhetoric, or wishful thinking. The people knew that the road to liberation needed constant hard work, sweat, and tears in a solemn national procession in which wills were united, abilities merged, and differences eliminated. Thus it was certain that the march would continue to its triumphant goal. The struggling people knew that liberation could not be achieved on one, but on several twisting paths in which decisive military action would mingle with active political action and where every citizen had a role to play, because the liberation battalions were not only confined to fighting soldiers, but included other builders of glory and civilization in every field. The real touchstone for testing a citizen's ability to participate is his readiness to make efforts and sacrifices within the framework of one national structure free from selfishness and personal interests at the expense of the interests of the public. Since the first spark of the liberation war in those blessed hours of October 1973, the people realized the goal of the war. They realized that it was not an end in and of itself, but a means to achieve a fair and lasting peace based on the provisions of law and legitimacy and striking a balance between rights and various interests. Thus Egypt's noble people met the challenge of peace with the same resolve and determination with which they fought the glorious October war. They were not frightened by claims about the adversary's superiority and its great abilities and resources. They entertained no doubts about their ability to meet the challenge. It was inevitable that they would triumph and liberate their land and their will, the region would witness the birth of a new age in which broad horizons of peace would be opened, there would be coexistence, and violence and suffering, bloodshed, and the exhaustion of resources would end. We place this great achievement, which the Egyptian people attained through war, peace, and self-confidence, at the service of peace and security for all the people of the region. We will use this achievement to serve the fateful pan-Arab issues, particularly the principle of total withdrawal in return for comprehensive peace, to guarantee balanced security for all the parties, and enhance cooperation based on acceptance and free choice. No one should be harmed and no one coerced into anything. There should be fruitful cooperation for the common good. We are following with great attention and anticipation the ongoing talks on the various tracks. We are confident that the people's will will prevail and triumph. We are also confident that the differences that surface occasionally are temporary, not an obstacle to the march of history. All the parties realize that there is no alternative to a comprehensive and just peace. No one can stop the current for change or tie the region up in the shackles of subversion and stalemate. The world is witnessing exhilarating developments and an unprecedented, great technical revolution. All our achievements and all the horizons that peace will open up for other peoples with whom we share a common interest and fate inspire us to double national work at home with firm resolve and renewable energy, spreading glory, cultivating hope, making progress, and opening great vistas for innovative and creative work for every Egyptian. The current comprehensive reconstruction and development in the blessed land of Sinai is a good example and a true mirror of the future throughout Egypt. It is a future full of dreams and hopes, replete with good fortune and bounty for every hand that lays a stone in the great building of renaissance, for every arm that safeguards the homeland, and for every eye that guards the country and the people's security. May God grant success to us all. May He protect our march. He is the best protector. May God's peace and mercy be with you.
