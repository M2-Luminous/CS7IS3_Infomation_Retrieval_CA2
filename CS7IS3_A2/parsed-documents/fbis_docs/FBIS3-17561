The Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze, who is in Moscow on a working visit said this at a news conference today. In the minister's words, a dangerous concentration of armed formations is occurring on Abkhaz territory near the border with Georgia. All the same, Georgian diplomats are seeking ways out of the crisis. All of us -- Georgians, Abkhazians, Ossetians -- need to take an active part in devising the draft of the new constitution. This will make it possible to avoid confrontation, the minister said. Chikvaidze said that the implementation of a preliminary accord with Russia on sending Russian peacekeeping forces into Georgia was one other way of settling the conflict. Regarding the results of Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to the United States, the Georgian foreign minister put a figure on the loans granted to the republic within the framework of the United Nations -- $400 million. The Georgian diplomat noted that this money should help the republic's economy, which is in a very grave state.
