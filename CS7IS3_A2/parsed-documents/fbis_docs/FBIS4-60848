The CIS Council of Heads of States supports the efforts of Commonwealth member states aimed at a lasting political settlement of the conflict, including persistent peacekeeping initiatives by the Russian Federation, and welcomes the mediating mission of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS member countries. The CIS Council of Heads of States reaffirms its desire to facilitate in every way a search for the only possible--compromise--solution. The main priority and imperative for the settlement is an immediate cease-fire, an end to all military operations and following that, its firm reinforcement. Without this, we cannot proceed to eliminate the consequences of the tragic conflict. The CIS Council of Heads of States calls on the international community, the CSCE, and the United Nations to support the steps being undertaken by the CIS in the interests of settling the conflict.
