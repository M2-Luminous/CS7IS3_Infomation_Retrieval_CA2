Wang Daohan, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), based on the mainland, wrote to Ku Chen-fu, chairman of the board and secretary general of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), saying that the latest developments in relations across the straits called for an urgent meeting between the two organizations. Wang said that the contacts between them would help further increase understanding, remove misunderstandings, overcome differences and promote cooperation. The proposed talks, he said, could explore ways to forge closer contacts and expand cooperation. Wang proposed that they should meet in Taipei, or elsewhere if Ku prefers. Wang recalled that in a letter earlier this year he had invited Ku to Beijing for talks in late spring or early summer, and that sources then said that Ku would be happy to meet Wang on the mainland. Ku also wrote recently in an article expressing his wish to strengthen contacts. In his letter, Wang said that the Wang-Ku talks a year ago had ushered in an important historical step in the development of relations across the straits, adding that exchanges in various sectors have been developing vigorously, marking the progress made in the five talks to settle the remaining issues in the agreements reached between Wang and Ku during their talks in Singapore. Wang especially noted that the talks between Tang Shubei and Chiao Jen-ho early this year had reached a high degree of common understanding concerning talks on routine issues, and had drafted an outline for this year's talks between the two organisations. He said the relations across the straits had been affected by the Qiandao Lake tragedy which claimed the lives of 24 Taiwan tourists. But Wang spoke highly of Ku's positive and rational stand to safeguard the relations across the straits. "Amidst the rumors and misunderstandings, we should intensify our efforts to push ahead with the talks and exchanges between the two sides," Wang wrote. This would be in line with the original intention and would consolidate the achievements already made, and therefore calls for talks between high-ranking leaders of the ARATS and SEF as soon as possible, Wang added.
