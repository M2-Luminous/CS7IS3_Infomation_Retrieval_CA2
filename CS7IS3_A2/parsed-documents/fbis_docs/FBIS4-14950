They Think in Moscow That the Operations Are Fully Legitimate"] [Text] The UN headquarters has distributed as a UN General Assembly and Security Council document a joint statement by the Russian Federation Defense and Foreign Ministries saying that Russia carries out peacekeeping operations in CIS countries fully in accordance with the UN Charter and that it needs no "authorization" from the community of nations or the CSCE to carry them out. The document, the text says, is a response to statements made by some politicians and publications in foreign mass media regarding the "ambiguity" of the Russian Federation's peacekeeping mission on the territory of countries that are part of the CIS. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov commented on the joint statement at the request of your SEGODNYA correspondent. He said that Moscow has never raised the question of legitimizing its peacekeeping operations on CIS territory, but it has asked and is still asking the United Nations for support. Financial considerations are not the least important factor here: Russia has been contributing large sums of money to finance peacekeeping forces, whereas its own operations in the CIS have been seen by the international community as something that does not fall under the definition of "peacekeeping." We think, however, Sergey Lavrov continued, that they are part of a general effort to ensure global security. Russia believes that its peacekeeping activity is in no way at odds with the UN Charter -- on the contrary, the Charter encourages regional agreements to participate in the settlement of conflicts. There are just different kinds of operations, Mr. Lavrov explained. One of them is an operation under a UN flag, authorized by the Security Council. In this case the peacekeeping forces must be multilateral, and expenses involved must be shared in accordance with the specified amounts of contributions. Another type is an operation on the basis of regional agreements, something that is taking place in Liberia. The UN secretary general, the deputy foreign minister said, fully shares this point of view and has no doubts as to the Russian actions' legitimacy.
