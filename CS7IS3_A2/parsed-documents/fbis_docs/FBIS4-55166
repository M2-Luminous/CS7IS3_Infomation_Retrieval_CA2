He was replying to a question on whether he accepts the demand from Christian Democratic Party [KDS] Deputy Chairman Vaclav Benda for one of the deputy interior minister's posts for his party, a post that -- according to Benda-- should compensate the KDS for the fact that his party did not obtain the post of attorney general. The interior minister declared that, at the moment, he has three deputies from the coalition parties and Deputy Minister Fendrych, "whom he needs." According to Jan Ruml, he does not need to increase the number of deputy ministers merely to satisfy the ambitions of certain people from the KDS. Nevertheless, Ruml admitted that the KDS has a claim to this post in accordance with the coalition agreements. If, however, coalition representatives begin to negotiate on a potential deputy interior minister from among the ranks of the KDS, Jan Ruml intends to "enter very forcibly" into these negotiations.
