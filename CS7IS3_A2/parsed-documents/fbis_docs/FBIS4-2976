A research report suggests Beijing should urge the Hong Kong government to clamp down on speculative activities in the real estate market. It proposes that the Chinese government should negotiate with the Hong Kong authorities to increase land supply and speed up the redevelopment of land in urban areas, thus easing the short supply of housing and cooling down the bubble economy created by property speculation. It says overheating in the property market has greatly worsened Hong Kong's investment environment and undermined its status as an international business centre. Chinese sources said yesterday that the report, jointly prepared by researchers from China-funded institutions and enterprises in the territory concluded that the Hong Kong government had amended its long-term financial policy to create a bubble economy in the runup to 1997. Last month's 1993-94 Budget report presented to the Legislative Council by the Financial Secretary indicated a policy change by the authorities, Chinese sources cited the research findings as saying. Following the breakdown of the 17-round marathon Sino-British talks over constitutional reform, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office ordered local China-funded research institutions to conduct an overall study into the Hong Kong government's financial and economic policies in the later transitional period. It was aimed at exposing any plot by the British to undermine Hong Kong's economy after its attempts in the political field failed. The report said the Hong Kong government had moved to undermine the territory's financial basis by cutting its revenue structure. It had narrowed the tax base by cutting corporate tax from 17.5 per cent to 16.5 per cent and increasing the income tax allowance. It said the corporate tax of 17.5 per cent was the lowest in the world as far as ratio was concerned, and the smallest in the world regarding share of total government revenue. The report said every government should depend for its revenue mainly on direct taxation--corporate and personal income tax--as both reflected the overall economic situation of a community. But the government had amended its financial policy to shift its revenue sources from healthy economic growth to speculative activities in property and stock markets. "It sounds like repeating the experiences in South America in the 19th century," said a Chinese economic source referring to the bubble economy created by colonists. The Hong Kong government was to blame for the overheated property market, and was the biggest speculator in the territory. Through encouraging speculative activities on the real estate market and receiving as much as 75 per cent of its revenue from the sector, the government was capable of cutting a healthy, substantial and steady revenue from other sectors. The revenue structure was an apparent plot to undermine the financial position of the future Special Administrative Region government.
