In a news conference he held for Turkish and foreign reporters prior to his departure for Ankara, Sanberk stated that his contacts were constructive and that a common view was reached in connection with the oil pipeline with the five permanent member countries of the UN Security Council. Using a very reserved language when discussing the outcome of his contacts in the United Nations, Sanberk said that, for now, he will not be able to give a detailed account of the accord reached with the five permanent member countries of the United Nations. Sanberk added: The preliminary accord focuses on a draft resolution which will enable a technical exemption in connection with the oil pipeline repairs. The applicability of the draft resolution within the framework of the embargo imposed on Iraq was emphasized during the discussions, Sanberk indicated. Pointing to the importance of the resolution being in line with the United Nations decisionmaking mechanism, Sanberk stressed that he expects the draft resolution to be presented to the UN Security Council in a couple of weeks. Sanberk indicated an additional meeting with the Baghdad administration will be necessary following these chain of meetings.
