His comments came as North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders, meeting at a summit in Brussels, discussed the possibility of renewing their threat of air strikes, originally made last year. In a statement to the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency, he warned against an "anti-Serb resolution" by NATO, saying that air strikes would only create "new difficulties." In particular he said that if NATO agreed to any resolution "against the Serbs" they would be forced to review territorial offers to Bosnian Moslems -- a key factor in the overall peace settlement. "We offered 33.3 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Moslems, and accepted under certain conditions that Sarajevo be put under UN administration," he said. Karadzic said that, of the three warring sides, Bosnian Serbs had "proved to be the most cooperative." He once again blamed the international community for the crisis in former Yugoslavia, saying it "would do nothing but continue its series of mistakes" if it continued to press its "anti-Serb" policies.
