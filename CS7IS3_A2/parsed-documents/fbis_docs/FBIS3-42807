We find this report disturbing," Valeriy Kolosov, first deputy minister of labor of the Russian Federation, told journalists. Plans called for the minister himself to conduct this press conference on the situation in the socio-labor sphere, but he was detained at a government meeting. His deputies, V. Kolosov and R. Batkayev, therefore came under the "shelling" of press representatives. What did we find out? Population Income Population income increased 11-fold over the level of 1992. However, this takes into account the incomes of people engaged in entrepreneurial activity. If these are not taken into account, the level of income fell. More than 30 percent of the populace have incomes lower than the minimum wage level, and 13 percent have incomes which do not exceed the cost of the minimum subsistence selection. And this does not consider the quality of nourishment, a factor of serious concern to medical experts. For example, the above-mentioned schoolchildren no longer receive milk at breakfast. Wages Wages increased 9.9-fold over the level of 1992, which corresponds approximately to the growth in consumer prices. But in December of last year wages increased only eightfold over the level of the previous December, while prices rose almost 10-fold. The differential seen with respect to wages is ever increasing. "At a number of state enterprises, the salaries managers receive exceed the average wage dozens of times," V. Kolosov stressed. "This is abnormal. We have to have some kind of rules regulating this." Recently a critical situation has arisen regarding delays in monetary payments, especially to workers in the budget sphere. Their pay level continues to lag behind wages in the production sphere. Last year the wage level in sociocultural sectors amounted to 40-80 percent of the average wage in industry. Employment and Unemployment The total number of "persons out of work and actively seeking work" (as the employment services characterize the unemployed) and "workers in the less-than-full employment mode" (the potentially unemployed) came to 7.8 million individuals by the end of 1993, or 10.4 percent of the "economically active population." Some 0.8 million people hold official status as unemployed. Considering sectors of the national economy, the most significant employment reductions were seen in science and construction. Yet the number of people employed in credit services, insurance, tax inspectorates, public notary offices, and legal services is increasing. Labor relations Labor relations are characterized as tense. The reasons: nonconformance of labor legislation to new economic conditions and the absence of an effective system of protecting the labor rights of workers. Contract forms of labor relations based on principles of social partnership have virtually displaced the administrative forms of labor relations. Labor Conditions and Social Insurance Every day about 30 individuals lose their lives and more than 50 become disabled in the production sphere. Some 400 accidents occur each year. Expenses incurred by enterprises related to damage compensation exceed 40 billion rubles [R] per year. Our level of occupational trauma is two to four times greater than in the developed countries of Europe. Nonetheless, enterprises are reducing funds designated for ensuring occupational safety, and in the private sector they often do not allocate such funds at all. Personnel Training Over the past three years, we have seen sharp reductions in the numbers of directors and specialists--by more than threefold, and of workers--by 5.4-fold. The number of workers undergoing training, retraining, or receiving instruction for the first time decreased twofold. Assessing the situation overall in the socio-labor sphere, specialists of the Ministry of Labor have concluded that as a result of measures taken, the landslide drop in standard of living of the population which began in 1992 came to a halt in 1993. To agree or not agree with this--is the right each one of us has.
