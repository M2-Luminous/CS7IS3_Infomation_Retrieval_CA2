FBIS3-13359 "drnes049_k_94007" FBIS-NES-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 IRAQ Paper Says Ekeus' `Procrastination' Part of `Ugly Game' JN1403122394 Baghdad INA in Arabic 1000 GMT 14 Mar 94 JN1403122394 Baghdad INA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Baghdad, 14 Mar (INA) -- The AL-'IRAQ newspaper has asserted that both the Security Council and the UN Special Commission, led by Rolf Ekeus, are making a grave mistake if they think that they will not be held accountable for their continued attempts to avoid giving a specific date for the lifting of the embargo. They are also greatly mistaken if they think the Iraqi people will accept remaining at the mercy of the inspection agencies and their unfair conditions. In an editorial today, the newspaper wonders: Does the Security Council think that the Iraqi leadership will continue to wait for unspecific and vague dates as to when the unfair embargo will be fully or partially lifted? The paper adds: Do the United States, world Zionism, and the clique of agents and traitors think they can maintain the embargo indefinitely through delaying tactics and procrastination? Do they think they can achieve this by obstructing any positive stand the Security Council should take in return for Iraq's fulfillment of its obligations toward Security Council resolutions, despite the fact that these resolutions are harsh, severe, and illegitimate? The paper highlights the important, valuable speech made by President Saddam Husayn when he received cabinet members and well-wishers on the 'Id al-Fitr. The paper cites his excellency as asserting that whatever the degree of Iraq's cooperation, commitment, and response, the party representing the Security Council will continue to be evasive, disregard facts, and give tendentious explanations and lame excuses to weasel out of its commitments to close the file of the embargo once and for all. The paper says it is laughable that the Security Council, which is influenced by the United States, claims that it is concerned about the sovereignty of Iraq at a time when the members of the Security Council violate this sovereignty and draw their own lines of latitude and longitude in order to achieve familiar, malicious objectives that threaten the very concept of our sovereignty. The paper notes Rolf Ekeus's procrastination, saying it is another part of the ugly game. The chairman of the Special Commission is a senior diplomat and international official who is supposed to keep his word and respect his decisions and dates. This situation arouses sorrow and regret over the moral deterioration of the Security Council. One time Ekeus says that Iraqi compliance should be tested for three months; on another occasion, he says six months; and sometimes he says not less than a year. However, Ekeus has so far not told us when this probationary period will begin in order for us to know when it will end. Despite all of this, they talk about our credibility. Have you ever known greater hypocrisy or worse maneuvering tactics? The paper adds: In light of our bitter experience with the Security Council, we realize that the ugly game aims, first and foremost, to exhaust the people of Iraq and manipulate its resources. The greater conspiracy -- whose features were clear even before the U.S.-Zionist aggression -- targets our development, cultural progress, the future of our generations, and our legitimate right to keep pace with the age and look forward to the 21st century and to achieving progress and development on all levels. AL-'IRAQ says: After a few days, the Security Council will begin its periodic discussions on lifting the sanctions. The patient and steadfast Iraqis will not be affected or weakened if the Security Council again fails to comply with its commitments under pressure from the United States and Zionism. Our people and leadership will face any such situation in a way that maintains the momentum of their earnest work to face challenges. Concluding, AL-'IRAQ stresses that the lofty Iraq will not go back on its national and pan-Arab course. It will remain the edifice of faith, honest principles, and genuine values. Iraq will not be shaken by treacherous storms or forces of evil, despotism, or falsehood. That is how we are and that is how we will continue to be. However, the enemies of God and humanity will harvest evil, disgrace, and misfortune.
