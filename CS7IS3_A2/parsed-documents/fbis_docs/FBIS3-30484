Karel Kovanda sees his success and that of Czech foreign policy in the Security Council mainly in the fact that the other countries view the Czech Republic different from the way they did a month ago. Kovanda said that he purposely managed to cut down the length of the council's meetings but increased their efficiency. He said it is a hard fact of the present world that the council has only limited powers that could be further curtailed by the decreasing interest of the individual states in supporting the council by, for example, being reluctant to offer their soldiers for service.
