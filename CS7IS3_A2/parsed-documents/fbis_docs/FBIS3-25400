Various proposals and counter-proposals were tabled in the process. This led to the government's negotiating team making a proposal on 2 February this year which, in our opinion, could resolve the deadlock. The ANC [African National Congress] has now dropped its opposition to important aspects of this proposal and we believe that this offers the opportunity to all parties, including the Freedom Alliance [FA] parties, to participate in the elections. In particular, the proposal addresses two matters which were of key importance to the parties of the Freedom Alliance, namely a constitutional principle which makes provision for self-determination and a related mechanism which gives further attention to the idea of a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] and a constitutional principle which provides that the powers and capabilities of the provinces will in essence be maintained. All the other matters are, however, also of crucial importance. The road to peaceful participation in the election is, in our opinion, now open to all parties and the government expresses its hope that the Freedom Alliance will now place the interests of South Africa and of its own voters first.
