This was due to the occupation of the area of Umm al-Rashrash by the Zionist enemy separating it from the Arab world and blocking the land road to Mecca. The Libyan Arab pilgrims arrived on camels in the area of Halat 'Ammar in Saudi Arabia where they were welcomed by members of the brotherhood bureau to Saudi Arabia and the Saudi authorities in the area. The pilgrims chanted slogans reaffirming their determination to continue their journey to Mecca. Also the pilgrims chanted slogans in support of the great al- Fateh revolution and its leader reasserting their defiance of the unjust measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah by Western countries preventing the Libyan Arab citizens from performing their religious duty.
