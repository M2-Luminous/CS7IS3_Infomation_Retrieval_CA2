FR941207-2-00012 FR941207-2-00005 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [I.D. 112194B] Small Takes of Ringed Seals Incidental to On-Ice Seismic Activity AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of issuance of letters of authorization. SUMMARY: In accordance with section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) as amended, and implementing regulations, notification is hereby given that letters of authorization to take ringed seals incidental to on-ice seismic operations in the Beaufort Sea off Alaska were issued on December 1, 1994 to BP Exploration, Western Geophysical, and Schlumberger, all of Anchorage, AK. DATES: These letters of authorization are effective from December 1, 1994 until December 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: The applications and letters are available for review in the following offices: Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 and Western Alaska Field Office, NMFS, 701 C Street, Anchorage, AK 99513. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kenneth R. Hollingshead, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, (301) 713&hyph;2055 or Ron Morris, Western Alaska Field Office, NMFS, (907) 271&hyph;5006. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq .) directs NMFS to allow, on request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region, if certain findings are made, and regulations are issued. Under the MMPA, the term ``taking'' means to harass, hunt, capture or kill or to attempt to harass, hunt, capture or kill marine mammals. Permission may be granted for periods up to 5 years if the Secretary finds, after notification and opportunity for public comment, that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s) of marine mammals and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses. In addition, NMFS must prescribe regulations that include permissible methods of taking and other means effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the species and its habitat, and on the availability of the species for subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds and areas of similar significance. The regulations must include requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking. Regulations governing the taking of ringed seals incidental to on-ice seismic activities were promulgated on January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4091) and remain in effect until December 31, 1997. Summary of Requests NMFS received requests for letters of authorization on the dates specified from: (1) BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 900 East Benson Blvd. P.O. Box 196612, Anchorage, AK 99519&hyph;6612 (July 15, 1994, revised September 20, 1994); (2) Western Geophysical/ Western Atlas International, Inc. 351 E.

All letters request a take by harassment of a small number of ringed seals incidental to on-ice seismic work in the Beaufort Sea, AK. Issuances of these letters are based on findings that the total takings will have a negligible impact on the ringed seal species or stock and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of this species for subsistence uses. Dated: December 1, 1994. P.A. Montanio, Acting Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service.
