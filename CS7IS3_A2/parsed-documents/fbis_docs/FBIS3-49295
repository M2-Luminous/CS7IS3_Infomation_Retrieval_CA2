Referring to a letter the president wrote on 22 November 1993 to the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, some anonymous politicians and commentators are trying to insinuate that the president's military cabinet is either duplicating or substituting for the functions and prerogatives of the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense. Those gentlemen have evidently interpreted the letter in a totally biased way, like the devil reading the Bible, because at the very beginning of the letter it is stated as follows, and I quote: The president's military cabinet as a whole, its chief, and the advisers on the different branches of service, have neither command nor control functions over the Ministry of Defense and the Bulgarian Army. It could not be stated more clearly than that. We should add that the text was approved by the Ministry of Defense and by the chief of the General Staff and circulated among all military units in the form of a special letter. Even more preposterous are the allegations that the president, by issuing Decree No. 269, intended to take over direct command of the Army. We should first carefully read the Constitution in order to understand the nature of the president's decrees, and then to realize that the decree in question is by no means secret and that whoever is interested in it can read it. I am talking about a document that determines the duties of the military cabinet within the framework of the presidential institution. Item 1 of the decree in question reads as follows, and I quote: The military cabinet assists the president of the Republic of Bulgaria in exercising his functions as supreme commander in chief, by collecting, analyzing, and summing up informative data. The military cabinet has no leading or control functions whatsoever over the Armed Forces as a whole, or over any of their branches. We feel obliged to confirm our impression that any step adopted by the president in connection with settling mutual relations among the country's public institutions is treated with extreme hostility by certain political parties or civil servants. The present attack is only part of a more extensive campaign aimed at discrediting the head of state. Nevertheless, everyone should realize that if the president of the Republic of Bulgaria would have transgressed his prerogatives in any sphere whatsoever, if he had committed any act whatsoever in violating the Constitution, the authors of today's scenarios would have seriously demanded his resignation, as stipulated by the Constitution, rather than engaging in devious political machinations as they are doing today. One of the goals of the current campaign is to introduce a split between the president, as commander in chief, and the Bulgarian Army. This is an attempt of undermining the foundations of the country's national security. Those who consider themselves good Bulgarian politicians could win public confidence by engaging in useful patriotic activities, rather than in futile plots and machinations, because all attempts at slandering other people are usually counterproductive. It is high time to introduce a more civilized spirit into Bulgarian political life, because slanders and attempts at discrediting one's fellow citizens are placing Bulgaria in an awkward situation in the eyes of our own people and are making our country appear ridiculous in the eyes of the world. The political plotters could engage in some more serious tasks serving Bulgaria's interests. [end recording]
