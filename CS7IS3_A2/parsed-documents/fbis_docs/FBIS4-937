Isaacson] [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] could enter into a post election alliance with two parties to gain control of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha said on Wednesday [20 April]. Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg, he said the NP stood a good chance of winning the region on its own or through an alliance with two parties which had similar policies. Mr Botha declined to name the parties, saying it would be improper to do so because they were presently opponents. NP PWV premier designate Oulaas van Zyl said he had received a report by a reputable company showing the African National Congress' support in the region had dropped to less than 50 percent. If the ANC and Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] received less than 50 percent combined, the NP and other parties would work together anyway, he added. Mr van Zyl dismissed reports that Johannesburg's old city council offices would house the new regional parliament, saying the venue would be decided after proper investigation. Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer added Soweto as a possibility. Mr Botha suggested PWV was not a sufficiently romantic name for a province, and suggested the new region be entitled Transvaal. Mr Meyer highlighted the importance of the province, saying it was the financial powerhouse of South Africa which, in turn, was the powerhouse of Africa.
