"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is honoured by the Almighty Allah to house the two holy harams, has been sparing no effort to reinforce the Islamic solidarity, cooperation and cohesion between all Moslems of the world with noble and welfare initiatives which led to the creation of a number of Islamic organizations," he said. "Moreover, the role of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not merely confined to the establishment of the existing Islamic organizations, but is also continuing to extend the unlimited moral and material support to these organizations which are located in the kingdom or elsewhere," Aba-al-Khayl said. He affirmed that the kingdom will continue to extend whatever necessary support is required for the activities of the IDB (Islamic Development Bank) which was set up to dedicate cooperation between Islamic states. The finance and national economy minister expressed deep satisfaction over the excellent performance of the IDB as a leading Islamic economic institution and expressed confidence that the bank would realise aspirations of member states. Aba-al-Khayl said the paid capital of the IDB has increased to dlrs 8.4 billion from two billion dollars and the number of its member states now totals 47 with the joining of a number of Central Asian states. He cited the necessity of maintaining the firm financial performance of the IDB.
