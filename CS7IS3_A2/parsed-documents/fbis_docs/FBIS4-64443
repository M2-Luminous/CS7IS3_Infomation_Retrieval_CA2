Diez and L.R. Aizpolea: "Prime Minister Postpones Any Decision on the Government Until 12 June Results Are Known"] [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has put together an initial plan of action for the next four weeks which rules out compliance with any of the opposition's demands. He is not considering resigning or handing over to another PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] member; he does not plan to submit to a confidence vote in parliament; and he does not intend to propose a series of resignations in light of his acceptance of Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion's resignation. Nor does he intend to reshuffle the government. All the government and PSOE sources we consulted -- except for a minority demanding immediate measures -- recognize, however, that these actions, or at least some of them, may be implemented after the European and local Andalusian elections on 12 June, as long as the Nationalists continue to support the government. That support is assured for the time being. The Socialist leader is to make no statements today, leaving the limelight to the outgoing interior minister. The government now expects the opposition to use Asuncion's gesture as an excuse to attack Gonzalez for not resigning. Sparks are guaranteed to start flying at the spokesmen's committee meeting, during which the People's Party representatives are to demand that Gonzalez appear before a special congress plenum. The government has no intention of submitting to the opposition's diktats, judging by the statements issued after Gonzalez' appearance before his party's Federal Committee on Friday [29 April] evening. Joaquin Leguina, Madrid's Autonomous Community president, and Joaquin Almunia, the PSOE member responsible for research and programs, tried yesterday to lend political weight to Felipe Gonzalez' instruction that "hysterical reaction" must be avoided. "We are on the eve of the 12 June European and Andalusian elections of 12 June and a chain of resignations would lead to instability; we must think ahead, a little beyond the situation entangling us," Leguina urged, not forgetting to direct a few choice epithets at Luis Roldan and Mariano Rubio. Almunia pointed out that the prime minister recently took part in the debate on the state of the nation and, on that occasion, it was seen that he has the confidence of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Socialists admit that the situation would become unsustainable if the CiU [Convergence and Union] withdraws its support, which would mean that the Gonzalez government could not push even one more law through. The calm picture that is being painted by the Moncloa [prime minister's residence] and the PSOE's main leaders was reinforced by Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra in Barcelona last night. The deputy prime minister set out to confirm the government's basic contention that it is capable of running the country with the support of the Catalan Nationalists and, in some instances, that of the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]. Serra stressed that the Socialists' fight against corruption is its main task, although this might initially cause the party's image to deteriorate further. Minority Opinion The government's strategy is countered by a minority in the PSOE, especially the Socialist Left faction and certain regional leaders. They are calling for an immediate gesture from Gonzales. In the opinion of this group, which has made its view known to the prime minister, it is politically dangerous for him to allow too much time to elapse without making any drastic decisions, since public opinion is shocked and demands decisive political gestures. According to these high-ranking Socialists, these demands should be met with a sweeping change of government. A change of government, the Socialists add, which would have a cathartic effect, freshen up the image, and save Gonzalez from a no-confidence vote. Those defending this proposal suggest that a change of government would also boost the executive's battered political profile, which currently leaves a lot to be desired. This position, however, is not shared by the majority of the Socialist leadership, which believes that implementing the changes now would leave no political alternatives to offer public opinion if the 12 June elections do not go well. Public Works and Transportation Minister Jose Borrell, speaking in Fuerteventura yesterday, referred to the Roldan and Rubio cases saying: "It takes a lot more than two unscrupulous men to tip the historical scales of Spanish socialism toward `negative.'" Borrell mentioned that he could not say "which of the two is worse, because I cannot choose between the plague and cholera."
