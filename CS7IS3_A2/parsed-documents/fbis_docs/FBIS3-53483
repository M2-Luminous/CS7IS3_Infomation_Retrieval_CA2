'Adil Muhammad 'Abd-al-Baqi, a key member of Al-Shawqiyun which is based primarily in al-Fayyum southeast of Cairo, had decided to leave the organisation and declared he had repented by condemning its terrorist activities, they said. But the police provided no details on the conditions surrounding his surrender or any possible charges that may be brought against him. Last month the ministry gave out rewards of 100,000 Egyptian pounds (30,000 dollars) to three people who provided police with information on a fundamentalist involved in a car bomb attack that almost killed Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi on November 25. The ministry recently announced it would pay 100,000 pounds to any person providing information leading to the arrest of a wanted fundamentalist. Muslim militants in Egypt have since March 1992 launched a bloody campaign to topple the secular government of President Husni Mubarak by targeting senior officials, policemen, tourists and Coptic Christians.
