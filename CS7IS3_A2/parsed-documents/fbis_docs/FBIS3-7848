"Our air force has only one airfield near Banja Luka, and military observers from the U.N. force have long been present there. They could have noticed the taking off of planes from that airfield without fail," a spokesman for the Serb command said in an interview with the TANJUG news agency. The General Staff of the Yugoslav Army also emphatically rejected a possibility of four planes, brought down by NATO fighters, belonging to the Yugoslav Air Force. Strictly following a resolution of the U.N. Security Council banning flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina, our air force planes made no flights in that air space. Since the creation of the union republic of Yugoslavia, not a single plane belonging to it has ever flown outside its air space, said a spokesman for the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army. Meanwhile, according to reports of the Moslem Radio of Sarajevo, today in the morning military facilities in Moslem cities of central Bosnia were bombed by Croatian planes. The time of the bombing concides with the action taken by NATO fighter planes against planes of the Galeb type.
