Speaking at a press conference here today, the dignitaries called for the immediate lifting of the embargo and ending the sufferings of the Iraqi people. They submitted a written appeal to the UN secretary general urging the Security Council to implement Article 22 of its Resolution 687 which provide for the lifting of the embargo after Iraq's compliance to its obligations. Among the dignitaries that had taken part in the press conference were 'Abd-al-Latif 'Arabiyat member of the Jordanian House of Notables, Mr. Baham Singh, chairman of the Non-Aligned Youth Conference, the former ambassador of Mexico, Canadian professor 'Abd-al-Haq Abu-Bakr, Prof. Marta Mandavalo of Athens Univesity and the Iraqi Permanent Delegate to the United Nations Mr. Nizar Hamdun. Replying to questions put by journalists, Mr. Hamdun said the American Administration is the only party that rejects the implementation of provisions of the Security Council resolutions adding that Iraq has implemented all what concerns provisions of the weapons section of Resolution 687. Iraq's demand to lift the embargo falls within the provisions of that resolution itself. The Iraqi ambassador said Iraq rejects the limited selling of its oil and having supervisors over the distribution of food materials. The Arab and Iraqi community in New York assembled here on Monday under the banner of Iraq and denounced the perpetuation of the economic embargo.
