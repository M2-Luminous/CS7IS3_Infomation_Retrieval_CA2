FR940426-1-00033 FR940426-1-00004 Section 10 of the Exchange Act addresses the ``regulation of the use of manipulative and deceptive devices.'' Section 10(a) provides the Commission with plenary authority to regulate short sales in exchange-registered securities. 15 Section 10(b) makes unlawful the use or employment of ``any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance'' in contravention of Commission rules adopted pursuant to that section. 16 In 1942, the Commission adopted Rule 10b&hyph;5, which prohibits any person from using any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any person, making any untrue material statement or any material omission, or engaging in any fraudulent or deceptive act, practice, or course of business, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. 17 15 See Stock Exchange Practices, Report of the Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, S. Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 55 (1934). 16 Section 10(b), 15 U.S.C. 78j(b). 17 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;5. Sections 15(c) (1) and (2) prohibit brokers and dealers from effecting securities transactions in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market by means of any ``manipulative, deceptive, or other fraudulent device or contrivance,'' or engaging in ``any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act or practice.'' Section 15(c)(2) also directs the Commission to define and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts and practices. 18 The Commission has exercised its authority under these provisions to proscribe manipulative activity. 19 18 15 U.S.C. 78 o (c)(1), (2). 19 See 17 CFR 240.15c1&hyph;1 to 15c1&hyph;9, 240.15c2&hyph;1 to 15c2&hyph;12. The Commission and the courts have held that transactions that would violate Section 9(a)(2) if effected in an exchange-registered security would violate Exchange Act Section 15 if effected in a security not so registered. See, e.g., SEC v. Management Dynamics, Inc., 515 F.2d 801, 810 (2d Cir. 1975); Barrett & Co., 9 SEC 319, 328 (1941); Loss at 1573.
