General Kopelipa, special envoy of Angolan head of state Engineer Jose Eduardo dos Santos, arrived here in Lusaka, Zambia, yesterday evening and this morning held a meeting with Alioune Blondin Beye, mediator in the Angolan peace process. The meeting was attended by the government delegation leadership, by Dr. Fernando Faustino Muteka and General Eugenio Carneiro. Although no details have been given about the meeting, it is believed that Gen. Kopelipa conveyed to Alioune Blondin Beye a verbal message from the president of the republic concerning the talks between the government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] under way here in Lusaka. Meanwhile, an official source told Angola Radio Nacional that the document presented by UNITA representatives to the mediator yesterday, connected with that organization's participation in the country's government, is void. It is therefore necessary and urgent that UNITA declares unambiguously whether or not it fully accepts the latest offer made by the government, which is not in any way negotiable. The source also said that the government will, as always, continue committed to searching solutions that will lead to peace through negotiations, fighting to preserve unity and national reconciliation, and trying to resolve the multifaceted problems which the Angolan people still experience, because of the war mounted by Jonas Savimbi's UNITA. The source, contacted by the Angola Radio Nacional here in Lusaka, stressed that the government is aware of its responsibilities and cannot therefore be blamed for the lack of free movement of people and goods in different corners of the national territory. As a matter of fact, the source added, the entire Angolan people long ago identified the causes of their suffering and who is behind them. This morning the negotiators from the government and UNITA continued to discuss the issue which has been on the negotiating table for the past eight days. It deals with swearing in some UNITA members of parliament. On this issue the understanding between the negotiators from the government and UNITA is proving to be difficult. Sources close to the talks believe, however, that the parties could reach an agreement any time, thus making it possible to discuss other issues connected with national reconciliation in the working agenda. It is already known however that UNITA has requested more time to reflect on the issue, as has always been the case.
