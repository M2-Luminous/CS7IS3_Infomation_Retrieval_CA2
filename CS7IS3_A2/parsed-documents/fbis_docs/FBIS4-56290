The secretariat of MOJEP, as a political organization involved in the struggle of the Haitian people for the return of democracy, peace, and social security in the interest of all Haitians, is pleased to send this letter to Haiti's four friendly countries, the United States, France, Canada, and Venezuela, to solicit a total and impartial blockade to force the criminals of Port-au-Prince to hand over power to constitutional Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They have monopolized it since the bloody military coup of 29 September 1991. Dear countries friendly to Haiti, says MOJEP, we pray you to please show understanding by granting us this request. We count on your spirit of collaboration, says the letter signed by [word indistinct] Herve, organization secretary general, and Louis Bauduy Francois.
