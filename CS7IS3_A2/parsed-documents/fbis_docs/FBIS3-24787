He alleged that the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] is using government property for its electoral campaign. Meanwhile, the government says that that matter was set aside following a meeting between President Joaquim Chissano and Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama in August of last year. The Renamo leader, who said that he had already put that proposal to the Mozambican head of state when they met in Maputo in August last year, added that President Joaquim Chissano had rejected it. Dhlakama says that as of now he intends to start "drawing as much attention as possible to that matter, so that a commission can be created that will control the funds. In other words, that would allow at least the Renamo Party to know what is happening in the Mozambican banks and how much money is coming into this country. Let us suppose, for instance, that the United States gives Frelimo some $8 million to $20 million for national reconstruction purposes, but who is to know whether Frelimo will be using it for its own electoral campaign?" President Joaquim Chissano noted that issue had been "brushed aside the moment it was raised by Mr. Dhlakama. We had even agreed we would not talk about the subject. It appeared to me that Mr. Dhlakama saw it as an unreasonable point that had not been properly thought out by those Renamo officials who may have proposed it." In turn, Dhlakama says that it is necessary that "people be certain that Frelimo is not using state funds at this stage for its own campaign." The Renamo leader further noted that the proposed Social and Economic Council could include representatives from other Mozambican political forces, even though those parties had not been signatories to the General Peace Accord in Rome. Nonetheless, he said: "We believe that they are Mozambican political parties and that they also need to be informed about this whole transition process, because they will also take part in the upcoming elections." We asked the Renamo leader: So, are you proposing a government of national unity? To which he replied: "No, no, because a transitional government or a government of national unity would contravene the General Peace Accord. It would also be confusing because it would necessitate discussions on ministerial posts and other such matters." From his point of view, the Social and Economic Council "has nothing to do with the General Peace Accord. What happens is that everyone knows the country is going through a process of transition and even Frelimo itself is going through a transition. In other words, the Assembly of the Republic will no longer be led by one party. It will be a multiparty organization once elections have been held. Taking into consideration the fact that Frelimo ruled the country alone and that even nationalized houses and hotels are today viewed as the property of the Frelimo Party -- though no one knows where or who they bought them from; but today they are occupied by UN guests who pay in dollars and that money is going directly to the Frelimo Party." Afonso Dhlakama also noted that the proposal for the creation of the aforesaid council will be presented to the government again quite soon "because in August I had a small plan that was conveyed to President Chissano and which he flatly rejected. He went so far as to say that it was a blow against the Frelimo government." Copies of the plan were distributed among foreign ambassadors accredited in Mozambique but, as the Renamo leader himself has said, diplomats have not reacted to that document. Dhlakama further affirmed that "I shall really continue this struggle...I shall only rest when I begin to know how much money is in Frelimo's bank and how it is being used. There are many cars, motorcycles, bicycles, millions upon millions of radio sets, spare parts, dresses, pants, and so forth being bought to be given to the people during the electoral campaign and those are things that cost millions of dollars." We noted, though, that perhaps all that is being bought with the Frelimo Party money, to which the Renamo leader replied: "That is fine, but let Frelimo then say where it gets its money." We insisted that Renamo does not disclose the source of its funds either. "Everybody knows that Renamo is poor", Afonso Dhlakama responded. The Renamo leader said: "We are not going to investigate whether there is a factory, whether a Frelimo member has a plantation, or whether he sells corn to finance his party's campaign, but that Social and Economic Council would see how state money is being used."
