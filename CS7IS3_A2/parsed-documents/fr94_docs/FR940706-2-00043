FR940706-2-00043 FR940706-2-00025 [FRL&hyph;5008&hyph;3] Agency Information Collection Activities Under OMB Review AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before August 5, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: For further information or to obtain a copy of this ICR contact Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Water Title: Needs Survey of Publicly-Owned Wastewater Treatment Works (POTWs) in the United States (EPA ICR No. 0318.06; OMB Control No. 2040&hyph;0050). Abstract: This is an extension of an existing information collection sponsored by the Office of Water in support of the requirements set forth by Sections 205(a) and 516(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA requires EPA to conduct a ``needs survey'' every two years as a joint effort of the respondents (States, territories, and the District of Columbia), and EPA's Office of Water and Regional Offices to gather construction cost estimates and technical data on all existing and proposed POTWs. The survey results enable EPA, States and Congress to accurately assess construction requirements and develop allotment formulas for wastewater treatment resource allocations. Respondents will provide information that includes: 1) updated technical and construction cost information on municipal wastewater treatment facilities, 2) planning documentation relevant to construction or project costs of POTWs (capital improvement plans, diagnostics results of needs for construction, etc.), 3) justification of certain specified categories of need based on construction costs curves, and 4) population anomalies relevant to POTWs. Respondents will also be asked to provide information related to combined sewer overflows (CSOs), non-point source and stormwater discharges. The majority of respondents will enter the information using EPA's on-line computerized system. EPA will manage the conduct of the survey, perform quality control and assurance on the needs survey database, and prepare the final report to Congress using the information provided by the respondents. Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 248 hours per response including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and compiling the data needed, and completing and reviewing the survey information. Respondents: State, territorial and District of Columbia government agencies responsible for oversight of POTWs. Estimated Number of Respondents: 56. Estimated Number of Responses Per Respondent: 1. Frequency of Collection: One time. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 13,888 hours Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Matt Mitchell, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th St., NW., Washington, DC 20503. Dated: June 28, 1994. Paul Lapsley, Director, Regulatory Management Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16337 Filed 7&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
