FR940224-2-00123 FR940224-2-00079 Forms Under Review by Office of Management and Budget Agency Clearance Officer: John J. Lane (202) 942&hyph;8800 Upon Written Request, Copy Available From: Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Filings, Information, and Consumer Services, Washington, DC 20549 Extensions Form N&hyph;8f_File No. 270&hyph;136 Form N&hyph;23C&hyph;1_File No. 270&hyph;230 Rule 6e&hyph;2_File No. 270&hyph;177 Rule 17a&hyph;8_File No. 270&hyph;225 Rule 17f&hyph;1_File No. 270&hyph;236 Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq. ), the Securities and Exchange Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget request for approval of extensions on the following currently approved rules and forms: Form N&hyph;8f is the form prescribed for use by certain registered investment companies requesting orders of the Commission declaring that they have ceased to be investment companies. The form takes approximately 6 hours to complete. Form N&hyph;23C&hyph;1 is a form on which closed-end investment companies report repurchases of their own securities. The form requires about one hour to fill out on each occasion, up to twelve times per year, on the part of approximately 4 companies that undertake such repurchase transactions each year. Total annual burden hours are estimate to be 23. Rule 6e&hyph;2 grants investment companies offering scheduled premium and single premium variable life insurance contracts exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940. Only management accounts that register to sell contracts under Rule 6e&hyph;2 have a reporting burden, estimated to be approximately 111 annual hours per respondent, imposed under paragraph (b)(9) of the rule. Since 1988, there have been no filings under paragraph (b)(9) of rule 6e&hyph;2 by existing management accounts, and separate accounts now are being organized as trust accounts, which are not subject to the reporting requirements, rather than as management accounts. Without the rule, management companies that offer variable insurance contracts and their sponsoring life insurers would have to file individual exemptive applications in addition to a registration statement in order to obtain the relief needed to sell the contracts. This process would be burdensome on both the life insurer and the Commission's staff. Rule 17a&hyph;8 exempts certain mergers or consolidations involving investment companies from the restrictions on transactions between affiliates set forth in Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The rule annually requires approximately 1.5 hours of recordkeeping by each of approximately 17 companies estimated to be involved in such a merger or consolidation each year, for a total of 26 annual burden hours. Rule 17f&hyph;1 requires that a custodial contract and an accountant's certificate be filed with the Commission in connection with the placement or maintenance of the assets of a registered management investment company in the custody of a member of a national securities exchange. The rule requires each respondent to spend about 4 hours meeting reporting requirements annually. General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549 and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Budget, (Paperwork Reduction Act No. 3235&hyph;0157, 3235&hyph;0230, 3235&hyph;0177, 3235&hyph;0235, and 3235&hyph;0222), room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.
