"We consider unconstructive the attempts by the Russian part to apply provisions in Latvian-Russian agreements to Estonian-Russian draft agreements," Luik said on commenting Latvian-Russian agreements signed in Moscow on Saturday [30 April]. Such attempts make it impossible to make any progress at negotiations, because Estonia and Russia must find their own solutions corresponding to specific relations between the two countries, Luik said. Luik considered positive the agreement on Russian troop pullout from Latvia while stressing the importance of troop withdrawal timetable presented by Russia. "Russia has a unique possibility," Luik said while adding that troop pullout from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August deadline would eliminate a major issue of dispute between Russia and the Western countries opening the doors to the country's accession to the Council of Europe. On commenting other agreements signed between the two countries, Luik said "Estonia does not accept binding troop pullout to any additional conditions." "A protocol later added to the agreement on retired military does not give the Latvian Government the right to control issuing residence permits to the retired military," Luik said. "...Estonia is not going to give up that right," he added. It was very important that Boris Yeltsin denounced crimes committed in Latvia by the Stalinist regime, Luik said while adding that Estonian people could appreciate a similar gesture towards Estonia.
