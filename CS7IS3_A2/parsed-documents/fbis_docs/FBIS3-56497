If any, a referendum on the status of the peninsula, in Kyrylov's view, will only be of a consultative nature and there is no threat to the integrity of Ukraine whatsoever. According to that party's decisions and in order to deprive the Crimean president of the executive functions of the head of government, changes and amendments to the Law on the president of the Crimea will be introduced if Yuriy Meshkov scores a victory.
