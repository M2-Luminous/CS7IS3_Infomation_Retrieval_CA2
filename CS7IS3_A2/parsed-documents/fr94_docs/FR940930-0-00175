FR940930-0-00175 FR940930-0-00028 The increased use of clean alternative fuels due to the fleet program may well result in the displacement of some of the use of conventional fuels. As in the proposal, EPA projects for the first twelve years of the Clean Fuel Fleet Program 3.2 to 6.4 billion gallons of petroleum-based fuel could be conserved. In addition to the conservation of petroleum resources, the fleet program may provide a number of non-quantifiable impacts, as well. The program will potentially furnish incentives for the development of clean-fuel vehicle technology, stimulate the vehicle conversion industry, support the wider distribution of alternative fuels and related infrastructure, and encourage the public to purchase and use clean-fuel vehicles. III. Public Participation As in past rulemaking actions, EPA strongly encouraged full public participation in arriving at final decisions. On July 15, 1993 a public hearing was held for any person to present testimony in response to the proposal, and written comments on this proposal were accepted for a period of sixty days after the hearing (September 15, 1993). EPA has fully considered all of the comments and has modified the proposal to reflect many of the suggestions received. EPA's complete assessment of the comments received can be found in the summary and analysis of comments document for this rulemaking, which has been placed in Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;30 and A&hyph;92&hyph;69. IV. Statutory Authority The statutory authority for this proposal is provided by sections 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247(a), 247(b), 249, and 301(a) of the CAA. V. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis Under Executive Order 12866 [58 Federal Register 51,735 (October 4, 1993)], the Agency must determine whether this regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. This rulemaking, covering emission standards for clean-fuel vehicles and engines, CFV conversion requirements, and the California Pilot Program, is considered an ``economically significant regulatory action'' under this definition, since the Clean Fuel Fleet Program and California Pilot Program together will cost more than $100 million annually in at least some years of its implementation. In addition, this rule is significant in that it represents the first motor vehicle emission control program which focus exclusively on fleets, raising a range of unprecedented issues. Finally, the rule is significant in that it parallels in many ways the alternative fuel fleet program required in the Energy Policy Act, which the Department of Energy is implementing; the areas of overlap between the two programs add to the significance of the rule. For these reasons, an RIA has been prepared, and is available in the docket for this rulemaking. This final rulemaking was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12866. Any written comments from OMB and any EPA response to OMB comments are in the public docket for this rulemaking. VI. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act
