Senator Evans has condemned the massacre in which more than 50 Palestinians were killed by a Jewish gunman and extended Australia's sympathy to all the bereaved or wounded. He has urged both Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to intensify their efforts for peace and says it is particularly important for the all sides use restraint to avoid further bloodshed.
