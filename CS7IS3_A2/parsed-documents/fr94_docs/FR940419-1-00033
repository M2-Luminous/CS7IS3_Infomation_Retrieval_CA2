Pension portability means the recognition and continuation in a successor service contract of the predecessor service contract employees' pension rights and benefits. 1837.110 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses. The contracting officer shall use the clause at 1852.237&hyph;71, Pension Portability, in a solicitation, contract or negotiated contract modification for additional work when the procurement officer determines, in accordance with the requirements of 1837.170, that pension portability is in the Government's best interest. 1837.170 Pension portability. (a) It is NASA's policy not to require pension portability in service contracts. However, pension portability requirements may be included in a solicitation, contract, or contract modification for additional work under the following conditions: (1)(i) There is a continuing need for the same or similar services for a minimum of five years (inclusive of options) and, if and when the contractor changes, a high percentage of the predecessor contractor's employees are expected to remain with the program; or (ii) Where the employees under a predecessor contract were covered by a portable pension plan, a follow-on contract or a contract consolidating existing services shall include pension portability as long as the total contract period covered by the plan, past and future, covers five years. (2) Only defined contribution plans, or multiparty defined benefit plans operated under a collective bargaining agreement where the plan follows the employee instead of the employer, shall be permitted in the portability provisions; (3) Vesting shall be 100 percent at the earlier of one year of continuous employee service or contract termination; (4) There is a clear description of the plan, including coverage regarding service, pay, liabilities, vesting, termination, and benefits from prior contracts, as appropriate; and (5) The procurement officer has made a written determination that such a provision is in the Government's best interest, including the facts supporting that determination. (b) The procurement officer shall maintain a record of all written determinations that the use of pension portability is in the Government's best interest. PART 1852_[AMENDED] 3. In part 1852, section 1852.237&hyph;71 is revised to read as follows: 1852.237&hyph;71 Pension portability. As prescribed at 1837.110(a), insert the following clause: Pension Portability (XXX 1994) (a) In order for pension costs attributable to employees assigned to this contract to be allowable costs under this contract, the plans covering such employees must: (i) Comply with all applicable Government laws and regulations; (ii) Be a defined contribution plan or a multiparty defined benefit plan operated under a collective bargaining agreement.
