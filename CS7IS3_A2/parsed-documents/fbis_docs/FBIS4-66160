As in 1992, the national economy continued to operate at a high speed. At the same time, conflicts caused by the transition between the old and new systems and rapid economic development became even more conspicuous and latent inflationary pressures began to be released. Beginning with the latter half of 1993, when the party Central Committee and the State Council decided to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, starting with a rectification of the finance system, the national economy began to stabilize and market prices subsided to a certain extent. Looking at 1994, it appears that the rate of economic growth will subside to an appropriate level, but there will still be a relatively high growth rate. The extent of investment growth will decrease but an appropriate level of investment will be maintained in order to strengthen structural adjustment. The range of commodity price increases will decline somewhat but inflationary pressures will remain high. Price increases will remain at a relatively high level. Price reforms will be actively pursued in a prudent manner, based on the capacities of various elements and control of the appropriate intensity and timing of reforms. I. The Form and Characteristics of Market Prices in China in 1993 1. From January through September of 1993, the total retail volume of social commodities was up 22.4 percent over the same period in the previous year. The national aggregate retail price levels were 12.1 percent higher than those of the same period of the previous year. The cost of living was 13.7 percent higher than that of the same period of the previous year. The cost of living in 35 large and mid-sized cities increased 18.9 percent. In examination of 1993 market commodity prices, the following main characteristics can be seen: 1. The market for consumer products is flourishing and dynamic. From January through September, the retail sales volume of social commodities was 22.4 percent higher than that during the same period of the previous year. After excluding the price increase factor, the actual increase was 9.3 percent. The activity of China's consumer product market in 1993 can be divided into two phases: 1) During the first half of the year, the consumer product market maintained vigorous sales and the growth rate increased each month. From January through June, the retail sales volume of social commodities was 21.6 percent higher than that during the same period of the previous year. The increase during the first two months of the period was 15 percent. During March it was 18.5 percent; in April it was 25.4 percent; in May 27.3 percent; and in June it reached 28.4 percent. 2) During the latter half of the year the high growth rate momentum of China's consumer products market began to slow and a trend from peaking toward stability emerged. This was seen in the following: First, growth in market sales began to subside. Growth in the social commodities retail sales volume decreased 1.9 percent in July from June. In August it was 4.6 percentage points lower than that of June. Second, the hoarding and panic buying by residents which occured during one period of the first half of the year nearly disappeared. Sales of imported and name brand household electrical appliances and gold jewelry clearly decreased. Third, the momentum in group consumption inflation was brought under control and decreased from a peak of an average of 30 percent during the first half of the year to approximately 22 percent in August and September, which was even lower than the growth in resident consumption. 2. The capital goods market, which was consistently tight during the first half of the year, became relatively loose. Price increases which had been leaping forward began to slow. This was chiefly evidenced by: 1) Market sales clearly fell to a stable level. The sales volume growth margin fell from 49.5 percent during the first half of the year to 27.3 percent in the third quarter. The supply and demand environment changed gradually from a seller's market towards a buyer's market. The change in the supply and demand environment in the capital goods market was caused by the following two factors, in addition to the influence of the greater economic environment: The first was that the strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control basically eliminated speculative false demand in the market. The second was that imported capital goods arrived continuously and increased the general supply of resources. 2) Inventories increased by a large margin, bringing inventory levels up dramatically from the steady decline over the past year. By the end of July, steel inventories for the entire society were up 10.8 percent from the beginning of the year. Cement supplies were up 15.6 percent and lumber was up 1.2 percent. 3) Capital goods prices fell back somewhat to previous, already high, levels. The growth range in the general price index for capital goods fell back to 43.2 percent in August from 52.9 percent in June and, after decreasing 2.9 percentage points in July, decreased another 6.8 percentage points in August. 3. The bloat in the general level of retail prices grew markedly since the beginning of the year and potential inflationary pressures began to be released. After the strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control, the inflationary trend began to slow to the basis of previous high levels. From January through September, national retail prices increased 12.1 percent over the same period of the previous year. The increase in January was 8.4 percent, in February 8.7 percent, in March 10.2 percent, in April 10.9 percent, in May 12.5 percent, in June 13.9 percent, in July 14.9 percent, in August 15.1 percent, and in September 14.5 percent. Although the general retail price level continued to rise during the latter half of the year, the inflationary trend had already begun to slow. The main factors that served to check the inflationary trend in commodity prices were: The first was that apart from rail freight and upward adjustments of electricty prices, no other new price reforms were brought to bear in the latter half of 1993. The second was that the effects carried over to 1993 of the grain, coal and transportation price reforms of the latter half of 1992, which had a relatively large impact on commodity prices, gradually disappeared during the latter half of the year. The third was that the decline in capital goods prices decreased the cost factor pushing commodity prices. An examination of the price increases of various types of commodities and services from January through September shows that the prices of everyday commodities increased 6.4 percent, the price of entertainment commodities increased 0.5 percent, the price of books, newspapers and magazines increased 6.0 percent, the price of pharmaceuticals and medical commodities increased 9.4 percent, construction materials increased 29.6 percent, fuel increased 38.3 percent, agricultural production materials increased 13.8 percent, and the price of services increased 28.2 percent. When the information is categorized by area, one can observe that the retail price increase in urban areas was 12.6 percent and in rural areas 11.8 percent, and the service price increase in urban areas was 31.6 percent and in rural areas 25.6 percent. Based on the new characterstics of the release of potential inflationary pressures and the current operation of prices in the market, we predict that the trends in national market prices during the latter months of this year will be: The general level of prices will remain high and not decline, but inflationary trends will gradually subside. The general level of retail price increases will be around 13 percent. 4. There has been great progress in the transition to price mechanisms, in keeping with the requirements of a socialist market economy. After government fixed prices were decontrolled on a major scale as a continuation of the goal drafted and promulgated in 1992 to redistribute pricing authority, a series of measures were adopted in 1993 which resulted in breakthrough progress: 1) In keeping with the principle of "unified policy, decentralized policy making, guidance according to category, and gradual advancement," grain and oil purchase prices were decontrolled in all but a few provinces and regions. 2) The price of most centrally allocated coal was decontrolled. First the producer price of centrally allocated coal in Eastern China, Northeast China (including the Eastern part of Inner Mongolia), and Hunan province was decontrolled. Second, the producer price of all clean coal from centrally allocated mines (not including the portion used to produce coal gas for residential use) was decontrolled. Third was the decontrol of prices of centrally allocated power coal used in the production of electricity and in the metallurgy industry in the whole country as well as of economic coal submitted by local governments to the central government for allocation. 3) The prices of most steel products were decontrolled. Apart from steel used in mandatory plans for national defence and military industry, in agriculture and agricultural hydropower, and in specialized railway use, all of which are state guided prices, the prices of all remaining steel products were decontrolled. At the same time, the prices of coking coal, raw iron, ingot steel, steel billets, iron alloys, refractory materials, and carbon products as well as the producer prices of iron ore and manganese ore were decontrolled. 4) The prices of some cement, communication exchange equipment, civilian use trucks, fire trucks and fire-fighting equipment were decontrolled. 5) Railway industry products were decontrolled on a major scale. The number of items with prices determined by the state or ministries was reduced from 13,875 to 161. The number of products with prices guided by the state or by ministries was increased from 89 to 359. The number of items with decontrolled prices was increased from 248 to 13,355. 6) Agent pricing was implemented for raw materials for foodstuffs, chemical fertilizers, cotton, wood pulp, and clothes washing detergent imported under the national foreign currency use plan. 7) Management authority for the receipt of 22 types of administrative fees such as visa fees for foreigners was delegated to the relevant administrative agencies to determine and implement fee levels. As of the end of 1992, the proportion of state-fixed prices was 5.9 percent of the retail volume of social commodities, about 12.5 percent of the total purchases of agricultural by-products, and about 18.7 percent of total income from capital goods sales. In keeping with the development towards a market economy, in 1993 the proportion of state-fixed prices decreased yet another step. In summary, the leading role of the market in the formation of prices for capital goods and consumer materials has been basically confirmed. 5. Price structure adjustments have taken a great step forward, with the emphasis on gradually correcting excessively low prices in the basic industries. After the state adjusted the prices of four sets of major products, foodstuffs, coal, petroleum, and transportation, and raised prices in basic industries such as steel, chemical fertilizers, post and telegraph services, and surface transport in 1992, price structure adjustments took another big step forward in 1993: 1) In order to encourage crude oil production, enhance industrial development capacity, and promote oil conservation, the low level of China's crude oil prices was changed.In 1993, 30 million tons, or a "medium to high" amount of crude oil was produced and the price of finished product oil was increased by a commensurate amount. 2) In order to raise additional funds for construction and hasten the development of railway transportation, railway goods transportation prices were raised in 1993 by 1.5 fen per ton per kilometer, from 3.85 fen to 5.35 fen per ton per kilometer. 3) On the basis of rectifying electricity prices and eliminating irrational prices, electricity prices were raised appropriately by power grid. The national average price of electricity for industrial use was raised about 3.2 fen per quarter. The price of electricity for residential illumination was raised about 5 fen per quarter, and the price of electricity for rural irrigation was raised about 2 fen per quarter. 4) The producer price for logs allocated from state-owned forests in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia was raised as well as the price of lumber turned in by state-owned forests in Sichuan and Yunnan. 5) Producer prices for products from copper and zinc were raised. The price of electolytic copper went from a previous amount of 13,000 yuan per ton to 18,000 per ton. The price of raw copper went from a previous level of 11,750 yuan to 16,200 yuan per ton of pure metal. Refined copper ore went from a previous price of 9,870 to 12,000 yuan per ton. Zinc ingots went from a previous price of 6,400 to 7,700 yuan per ton. Refined zinc ore fell from a previous price of 3,600 yuan to 3,000 yuan per ton. After the prices of copper and zinc were adjusted as representative products, producer prices for other similar products were adjusted appropriately based on the stipulated price comparison coefficients. Preliminary corrected calculations show that the adjustment measures brought into play in China this year have directly resulted in an increase in the average level of commodity prices by 2.5 percentage points. The smooth implementation of these adjustment measures has served an important function in ameliorating China's irrational price structures and furthering the development of basic production. 5. There was additional improvement of the system of macroeconomic regulation and control of prices. With the sustained rapid movement of the economy since 1993, production, construction, circulation, and consumption, after expanding rapidly during the previous year, have all experienced even more rapid, inter-linked growth. At the same time, some new problems and new conflicts have become more conspicuous. In particular, excess currency circulation, a disorganized finance system, a sudden expansion in investment demand and consumer demand, and the exacerbation of "bottleneck" restrictions in basic infrastructure and basic industry sectors have pushed up commodity prices significantly and hastened the emergence of inflation. Under these conditions, the party Central Committee and the State Council have taken charge of the entire economic scene and have decided to adopt a series of measures to advance and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, based on the guiding principle of "in economic work, we must take hold of opportunities and hasten development but at the same time pay attention to reliability and avoid losses, especially large losses." Effective control will be exercised over the economy by expanding reform, hastening the development and completion of the market system, and quickly perfecting macroeconomic regulation and control, using economic techniques, legal techniques and, when necessary, administrative techniques. After a period of great effort, the macroeconomic regulations and controls have achieved some preliminary success, as demonstrated by: First, illegal short-term loans by banks have ceased. Second, various types of illegal accumulation of capital have been brought under a preliminary degree of control, savings have increased greatly, and the excessive issuance of currency has slowed somewhat. Third, the exchange value of the renminbi has fallen to a rational level. Fourth, capital goods prices have fallen back to a certain extent and real property prices have fallen by a large margin. Five, the population's expectations for inflation have gradually decreased. II. Looking Ahead at the Operation of Market Commodity Prices for 1994 After two years of rapid growth in China's national economy, there has been a great change in the macroeconomic environment. The effectiveness of market mechanisms is gradually increasing. The overall power of the country has clearly been strengthened. Macroeconomic regulations and controls have begun to take effect, the conflicts and problems which have emerged in economic life have been resolved to a certain extent, and the national economy is developing in a healthy direction. Favorable conditions have been created for comprehensive reform and opening and hastened economic development in 1994. The 90's are a key era in China's socialist modernization. China is currently facing a rare historical opportunity. In the face of new situations and new tasks, in 1994 we must not delay in furthering reform and opening, hastening the establishment of a socialist market economy system, and promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. For this reason, the national economy must maintain a relatively high rate of development in 1994. According to the predictions of relevant experts, the growth rate of the gross domestic product will remain above 10 percent. The fixed capital investment growth rate and the retail merchandise sales volume growth rate of the entire society will remain above 20 percent. Reform will be actively promoted in 1994 in such areas as taxation, finance, pricing, investment, and foreign trade as well as in the enterprise system. These reforms will have a fairly great impact on the operation of market commodity prices in 1994. At the same time, the delayed effects of the extraeconomic issuance of currency in 1993 and the inertia of commodity price increases cannot be ignored. In summary, a look at the market commodity price situation in 1994 shows that there are factors favorable to stability in market commodity prices and factors which could lead to a rise in market commodity prices. In examining the factors favorable to stability in commodity prices it can be seen that after the central government set down policies to strengthen reform and macroeconomic regulation and control, these policies were quickly disseminated and sincerely implemented by all the regions and ministries and have achieved some effectiveness, as demonstrated by the following: 1. There has been improvement in the finance system, which is moving towards stability. First, chaotic phenomena such as sloppy short-term loans, sloppy fund raising, and the sloppy establishment of finance organizations have ceased. Second, citizens' savings deposits have been steadily rising every month. As of September, the sum of remaining citizens' savings deposits had reached 1386.7 billion yuan, 232.2 billion more than at the end of the previous year. Third, the momentum of injecting excessive amounts of bank notes into circulation was halted and the rate of increase in the currency supply was slowed. As of July, the margin of increase in M1 (narrowly defined currency) had slowed from about 40 percent during the first half of the year to a normal rate. Fourth, the payment ability of specialized banks was strengthened. As of September, reserve deposits rates in specialized banks had increased to 7.2 percent. 2. The fiscal and tax system improved and practices to increase income and reduce expenses began to achieve effectiveness. By eliminating inappropriate reductions or remittals in taxes and aggressively attacking tax cheating and stealing, clear improvements were made in the fiscal and tax system. A preliminary turnaround was achieved over the first half of the year when economic growth was rapid and low revenues fluctuated. At the same time, the rapid growth in fiscal expenditures was also brought somewhat under control. 3. There was improvement in the capital goods market, the stock market, the foreign currency market, and the real estate and development zone systems. The implementation of macroeconomic regulation and control measures such as standardizing the finance market and cleaning up the real estate and development zone situations has clearly suppressed speculative practices and "froth economy" elements. One such example is that the profiteering practices in the capital goods field have clearly been reduced. Capital goods supplies, which were very tight, have become plentiful and prices have gone back down. Second is that all areas have eliminated development zones which did not meet requirements and are continuing to clear out such zones. Third is that investment growth in commodity housing has receded. Fourth is that the development of the stock market is gradually stabilizing. Fifth is that the price ratio of the dollar to the renminbi in the foreign currency adjustment market has stabilized at about 1 to 8.8.4. Certain factors influencing market commodity prices have changed: The first is that the prices of foodstuff, domestic fuel, and building materials, which exert the greatest pressure on commodity price levels, have been largely decontrolled during the past two years and thus will have less residual impact on 1994. The second is that the prices of many capital goods in China now approach or have exceeded international market price levels. These prices are expected to stabilize at a fairly high level. The third is that the consumption psychology of residents is becoming more mature. Rational purchasing is more common than waves of panic buying, and consumer spending is becoming more and more planned. The fourth is that there has been a clear shift in the distribution of residents' income, with more spent on savings, housing and the purchase of stocks and bonds and some delay in a portion of residents' immediate consumption. 5. The rapid growth in the national economy has increased the supply efficiency of the market, which has contributed a solid material base for the maintenance of basic balance in the aggregate supply and demand of the society. 6. The advancement of all the reforms will gradually resolve many of the conflicts and problems remaining from the old system at a fundamental level and will diffuse excess purchasing power, mitigating and releasing some of the potential inflationary pressure. The factors which would cause commodity prices to rise can be seen in the following: 1. Society's aggregate demand is still peaking. Looking at investment demand, it can be seen that although the growth in fixed capital investment during the past few months has decreased somewhat, it is still not an ideal situation. The current growth rate in fixed capital investment is still over 60 percent, and it is predicted that fixed capital investment for the year will exceed the plan by over threefold. The investment rate will reach 37 percent, clearly beyond the limits of normal figures and not favorable to the maintenance of steady and healthy economic development and the normal functioning of market commodity prices. Looking at consumption demand, it can be seen that incomes of urban and rural residents will continue to increase by a large margin. From January through September, the average cost of living income for urban residents was 29 percent higher than that for the same period of the previous year. After commodity price factors were deducted, the actual increase was 12 percent. The average cash income for rural residents increased 17 percent, or actually about 5 percent after commodity price increases were factored out. A look at the consumption demand trends in the fourth quarter shows that following the implementation of the civil functionary system and a series of measures designed by the state to promote production, increase income and decrease expenditures for the peasants, consumption demand will maintain a high rate of growth. These factors will create a rather strong demand pull on market commodity prices in 1994. 2. Looking at the finance and currency situations, it can be seen that the number of new loans by banks and the net amount of currrency put into circulation will be far greater than was planned at the beginning of the year. An excessive amount of currency in the market could cause inflation at any time. History has proven that when the currency supply is excessive in any given year, it will not only influence the inflation rate for that year but also the inflation rate of the following year. Therefore, when we predict the level of inflation for 1994, we must examine not only the plans for currency issuance in 1994 but also the lagging influence of the currency issued in excess of the economy in 1993. 3. It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for the government fiscal situation. Although the current government fiscal situation shows some improvement, the difficult financial straits of the central government are still quite present. Because the fourth quarter represents the peak period for government financial expenditure, with the added financial difficulties experienced during the previous period, many appropriated funds are in arrears. This will increase pressure on government fiscal payments during the next few months. 3. Due to the extensive price increases for energy and raw materials during the past two years, as well as the large price increases for funding, foreign exchange, and wages, pressures for higher prices created by cost are now being released. During the past year, prices paid by enterprises for energy and raw materials have been over 30 percent higher than during the previous year. The price of funds has risen over 10 percent and the cost of foreign exchange has risen over 20 percent. These price hike factors will necessarily push enterprise costs higher and thus push prices higher. Because the push factor of costs has a certain rigidity, this will not diminish significantly in 1994 and will not be clearly suppressed by macroeconomic control and regulation. 4. Due to the lingering impact of excessive currency in circulation, as the economy gradually cools down, market commodity prices will still operate at a high level. Looking at retail prices, it can be seen that in June prices rose 13.9 percent, in July 14.9 percent, and in August the increase reached 15.1 percent. Cost of living prices for residents increased 12.5 percent during the first half of the year and then rose another 13.7 percent between the first and third quarters. The cost of living in 35 medium-sized and large cities has continued to rise at the high level of over 20 percent since June. 5. The agricultural situation is also not optimistic. The party Central Committee and the State Council have placed a high priority during the past year on agriculture and have introduced many specific policy measures to protect agricultural production, with some effectiveness. Many factors influencing the stability of agricultural production, however, are still present and it is not easy to be optimistic about agriculture. Stable agricultural production and an ample supply of agricultural products provide the essential material base which determines whether market commodity prices can operate normally. The agricultural situation of 1993 will have a definite influence on the operation of market commodity prices in 1994. In summary, there are many objective factors present which are favorable or not favorable to next year's market commodity price situation. The key element determining whether market commodity prices will maintain normal operation next year will be whether the strength of macroeconomic control and regulation is appropriate. If only we can be united in our understanding of the situation and face the problems which exist, putting a top priority on all aspects of the work to be done, we can maintain the normal operation of market commodity prices and avoid severe inflation. III. Macroeconomic Policy Choices for the Operation of Market Commodity Prices in 1994 There are mainly three choices for macroeconomic policies for the operation of market commodity prices in 1994. The first is to adopt macroeconomic policies of comprehensive retrenchment as in 1988 and 1989. The advantage of this policy is that it would allow inflated commodity prices to come down rather quickly. The disadvantage is that it would be severely detrimental to normal economic growth and would create a long period of slump in the market. The second is to seek only short-term high economic growth, adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards market commodity prices, eventually causing severe inflation which would then necessarily bring down the rate of economic growth. This type of tumultuous economic fluctuation would not only result in serious damage to the national economy but would also impact on social stability. The third is to adopt a "soft attack" macroeconomic policy. This would be to continue to strengthen and improve the macroeconomic regulation and control of the national economy and to gradually bring down the excessively high growth rate of commodity prices while maintaining a sustained high rate of healthy economic growth. Our view is that the third option is usable. This is because: 1) The 1990's are a key period in China's modernization. The national economy must maintain a relatively high rate of growth. We must take advantage of opportunities for development and strive to create the conditions necessary to promote a sustained high rate of healthy economic growth. 2) The current economic environment, economic mechanisms and economic situation have changed considerably from 1988. Therefore, our macroeconomic regulation and control policies cannot simply repeat the approach of 1988. We must operate in keeping with the patterns of a market economy to favor the establishment of a socialist market economy and avoid great economic rise and fall and major losses. For this reason, we must not use "comprehensive retrenchment" or "emergency brakes." 3) Looking at the conflicts and problems present in current economic life, from a fundamental point of view, it can be seen that because the transition in economic systems is still not complete and the disadvantages of the original economic system are still present, macroeconomic reforms in finance, taxation, and investment are particularly lagging behind. The fundamental approach to resolving current and future problems in economic development is to strengthen reform and establish a new socialist market economic system. In terms of macroeconomic policies, we must put great effort into the following tasks to guarantee the normal operation of market commodity prices in 1994: 1. The relationship among economic development, the advancement of reform, and price stability must be managed properly. We must control the proper strength of macroeconomic regulation and control, and avoid severe inflation while maintaining sustained rapid economic growth. In terms of the current situation, the policy measures adopted by the central government to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control have already had a positive impact and have achieved some preliminary success. The conflicts and problems in economic life have been resolved to a certain extent. This has created a macroeconomic environment more conducive to the normal operation of market commodity prices and the advancement of reform and opening. The assessment, however, of the current achievements cannot be overdone. The conflicts and problems still present in economic life are difficult to ignore. On the one hand, policy measures to strengthen macroeconomic control have not been in effect very long and the positive impact of these measures is still preliminary. On the other hand, some deeply rooted conflicts will only be resolved through deeper reform. In our current economic work, we must continuously research and analyze the newly emerging situations and problems in the economy and correctly master the patterns of economic development in order to resolve quickly problems and conflicts in the operation of the economy. Looking at 1994, we must make every effort to keep the economic growth rate and general commodity price level growth rate at around 10 percent. We must also maintain two security lines: The first is that the growth rate of common incomes of urban and rural residents must not be below the rate of commodity price increases. The second is that the savings funds of residents must not depreciate and savings interest rates must be higher than the rate of commodity price increases. At the same time, we must hold steadfast to the use of combined regulation and decontrol to actively and prudently advance price reform policies. We must avoid overly hurried, one step approaches but arrange for timely and smooth implementation of each reform in an appropriate fashion and thus maintain the stable functioning of market commodity prices. 2. The key to strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control is in expanding reform. The conflicts and problems present in the current operation of the economy have been caused primarily by friction between the old and new systems. Therefore, the key to strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control is in expanding reform. In the process of expanding reform, special attention must be paid to the comprehensive use of economic levers such as government finance, credit, interest rates, commodity prices, tax revenues, wages and exchange rates. These must be coordinated in a consistent fashion. At the same time, attention must be paid to linking short-term regulation and control with long-term reform. At the same time, ample use should be made of the comprehensive planning function of the State Planning Commission. In perfecting the system of macroeconomic regulation and control, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have great respect for planning and have emphasized the need to research development strategies, research the fundamental impact of the market on resource allocation, research mid- and long-term planning and annual planning, and research production industry policy. The State Planning Commission must take a comprehensive view of the entire situation, and from a higher plane, research and offer major macroeconomic policies. It must also offer comprehensive coordination of the various economic policies and economic regulation methods. Currently the emphasis should be on coordinating the relationships among planning, finance, and government finance, these three areas, to ensure consistency among the various economic policies, economic levers and economic methods. 3. Proactive measures should be adopted to strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and control of fixed capital investment and to vigorously refine the investment structure. Resolute control of the scope of fixed capital investment with vigorous refinement of the investment structure is a key element in policy making on macroeconomic regulation and control and a crucial major task. Unless we are determined to resolve the problems of overextended construction, it will be difficult to mitigate the tension in the macroeconomic environment and effectively resolve the conspicuous problems in finance, government finance, and other areas. Each region and ministry must conform its thinking and actions to the central government's policies and adopt effective measures to solve the problems in fixed capital investment. 4. To create a better financial environment for the major state reforms of 1994 and promote sustained rapid and healthy development of the economy, the regulation, control and management of the central bank's basic currency holdings must be strengthened. First, we must continue to implement macroeconomic regulation and control measures, correct the finance system, strictly adhere to finance discipline and continue to enhance reform. Second, we must strengthen the regulation, control and management of the central bank's basic currency reserves and add to the basic currency reserves in a timely, appropriate, and effective fashion, to support the key needs of the development of the national economy and further the sustained rapid and healthy development of the national economy, and create a financial environment conducive to reform and opening. Third, we must continue adjusting the credit structure to guarantee the key requirements for capital. Fourth, we must use the method of strengthening reform to further improve the management system and management methods of the credit fund system. 5. Price reforms must be actively promoted without delay to advance the sustained rapid and healthy development of the economy. The guiding philosophy of price reforms in 1994 should be to actively pursue price reform in a safe fashion, with rational control over the intensity of reform, on the basic premise that the growth rate in aggregate commodity price levels must be lower than that for the previous year. This must be viewed with the following aspects in mind: 1) We must further develop and improve price mechanisms with market prices as the key. We must continue to shrink the scope of state-fixed prices and actively further the transition to market prices, based on the status of market supply and demand and of price reforms. Prices for competitive commodities and common service fees must be decontrolled as much as possible and allowed to be determined by the market. The double track system for capital goods prices must be eliminated gradually and the scope of the capital goods market must be expanded. 2) Based on the requirements of the developing socialist market economy, price structures should be further rationalized and basic product prices should be raised, to solve the problem of excessively low basic industry prices. The prices of agricultural products should be raised appropriately and the system of guaranteed prices and support prices for food and key agricultural by-products should be established and perfected, with attention paid to guaranteeing benefits for the peasants. 1994 will represent an important step forward in adjusting price structures, based on the progress of China's price reforms and the capacities of all elements. 6. The system for indirect macroeconomic regulation and control of the market by the government must be perfected. First, a complete two-tiered price regulation and control system for the central government and the provinces, autonomous regions, and direct-ruled municipalities must be gradually perfected. Second, economic, administrative, and legal methods must be used in a comprehensive fashion to strengthen management of decontrolled prices. Third, the price adjustment fund system for the central government and local governments and the reserve system for important commodities must by established and perfected, in order to strengthen the state's ability to exert macroeconomic regulation and control over the market. Fourth, the assessment and advance warning systems for market prices must be further developed, in order to provide accurate indicators and reliable bases for price policy making and price regulation and control. Fifth, the legal system of laws and regulations for actions relating to the markets and prices must be perfected and standardized. 7. The central government's policy measures on strengthening agriculture must be sincerely and thoroughly implemented to strive to stabilize agricultural production. Agriculture is the basis of the national economy and of social stability. A good agricultural situation provides a foundation for the normal operation of market commodity prices. If major problems emerge in agricultural production, there will be a serious impact on the stability of the market and commodity prices. Looking at the current situation, the following tasks must be completed: The first is to further implement all measures to stabilize and strengthen agriculture, after the meeting of the Central Working Committee on Agriculture. The second is to continue expanding rural reforms, to foster markets, expand the market system, and strengthen macroeconomic guidance with priority placed on the protection of the peasants. We must also hasten the establishment of rural economic operation mechanisms and management systems suited to the requirements of a socialist market economy. The third is to enlarge the extent of funds invested in agriculture by all levels of government. It would be preferable to cut back temporarily on the number of industrial projects and provide guarantees for the pressing needs of agricultural development, raise the prices appropriately for agricultural products, and inspire the enthusiasm of the peasants to develop production.
