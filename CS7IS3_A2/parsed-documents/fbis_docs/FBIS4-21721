Gen. Vargas added that the terrorist plot was uncovered on 22 March after police searched a hotel in downtown Santa Fe de Bogota. Following a shoot-out, four people, whose names were not released, were arrested, while five others escaped. The police director noted that, during the operation, police found blueprints of several buildings in which political parties are headquartered. The only headquarters specifically mentioned by Vargas were those of Ernesto Samper, one of the favorites to win the May elections. Vargas underscored that the terrorists, whose names are being withheld, were arrested thanks to ``intelligence operations.'' He added that police are also working to identify the group plotting to sabotage the elections. Vargas contended that this group could be part of an ``organized crime ring or a subversive organization.'' The Colombian National Police director added, ``This is a very important case that will require exhaustive analysis.''
