Deputies began their working day, as usual, with the miscellaneous section, which was followed by the registration -- 279 people's deputies attended today's debate. After that, deputies returned to the issues that they began to discuss at yesterday's session -- draft legislation on local administration and the economy of the Republic of Belarus and new legislation on Supreme Soviet elections. While the first bill was approved quickly, clashes erupted over the second one, and as the result, it was submitted for further consideration. Having done this, the deputies began to adopt one piece of legislation after another with renewed zeal. Thus, without special difficulties, the draft housing code of the Republic of Belarus, the draft program for housing development, and draft legislation of public roads were adopted. Issues connected with taxes, however, generated many disagreements among deputies.
