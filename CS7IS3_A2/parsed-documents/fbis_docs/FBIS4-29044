The proposed sanctions are on the whole close to what Japan thinks proper to cope with the nuclear crisis, Kakizawa said after an emergency meeting of government leaders called to discuss the issue. The U.S. plans to propose a sanctions resolution to the UN Security Council over the nuclear standoff triggered by North Korea's refusal to allow international inspections of its suspected nuclear arms development program.
