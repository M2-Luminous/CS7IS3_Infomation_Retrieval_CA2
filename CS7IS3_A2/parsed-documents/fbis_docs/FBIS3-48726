"If the North Korean nuclear problem is solved at an early date, I think that the anti-missile missiles will be deployed in Japan instead," he said. Seoul and Washington agreed to deploy Patriot missile batteries at U.S. Army bases in South Korea in March, he said. "U.S. President Clinton has not given final approval for the deployment of Patriot missiles, but I guess that sooner or later he will approve it," he said. "The South Korean Government agrees to the deployment in principle and the intercepter missiles will be deployed at the bases of U.S. Forces here in March or April at the latest. The number of Patriot missiles to be deployed here is 36. They are for protection of strategic points of U.S. Forces in South Korea rather than for defense of overpopulated areas including Seoul and the metropolitan area." Deployment of Patriots on the Korean peninsula is the first step in establishing the theater missile defense (TMD) system, which the U.S. Government is pushing for on a long-term basis. Washington confirmed Wednesday it was considering deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea to defend its ally against North Korean attack. Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, requested deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to prepare against Scud missile attacks by North Korea.
