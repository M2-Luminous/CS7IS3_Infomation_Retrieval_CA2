A previous opinion poll carried out by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] last February shows that Lech Walesa's popularity dropped by 10 points. In the group of authority centers, the president occupied the last position in April as far as his activities were concerned. Lech Walesa's popularity in the social opinion has been dropping steadily since the middle of 1991. In April 1991, his activities were approved by 70 percent of the respondents to a CBOS poll. The 25-percent approval for Lech Walesa, declared by the CBOS respondents, has been the lowest since the time he took over the office. As it turned out, Lech Walesa's conflict with the governing coalition (numerous vetoes and public shows of disapproval), which took place between February and April of this year, was most detrimental to the president himself--he lost as many as 10 points in popularity opinion polls (in February, 35 percent of respondents approved of his activities and 55 percent expressed their disapproval). Thus, the office of the president found itself in the second to last position in the popularity ranking of various establishments. The people declare less trust only for private banks (21 percent approve of them). The statistical supporter of Lech Walesa is either younger than 25 or older than 65, has rightist political views, and takes part in religious activities several times a week. Among employed people, he is primarily backed by skilled workers and among professionally passive people--by senior citizens, disabled pensioners, and unemployed people. The people declare the greatest trust for the Army (76 percent), the spokesman for civil rights (70 percent), and public television (69 percent). Probably because of the "corruption affair" in Poznan, approval for police activities decreased by nearly 10 points; however, its activities are still accepted by as many as 57 percent of the people--just as many people support the activities of self-governments in their regions. The government and the Sejm are enjoying double the popularity of the president. Within the past two months, there has also been an increase in the approval of the activities of the Senate, whose activities were accepted by 41 percent of the respondents in April of this year. * * * The opinion poll was carried out between 14 and 18 April of this year on a representative sample of 1,207 adult inhabitants of the country.
