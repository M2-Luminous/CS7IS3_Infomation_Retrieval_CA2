In a communique forwarded to the AFP office in Port-au-Prince, Martineau says "the country is, in fact, living amid a state of emergency, and all the people's rights have been suspended since 30 September 1991" (date of the coup d'etat.) "If you want to find those who threaten the country's independence, you will not find them abroad because they are in our country," he added.
