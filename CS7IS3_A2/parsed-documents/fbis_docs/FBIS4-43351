The prospect of a new EU/Morocco agreement and the role of Morocco in the Mediterranean region were discussed. Mr. van den Broek said at the close of the meeting that Morocco was a pole of stability and a peace factor in his region. Regarding the agreement envisaged, he said that, for some aspects, there was already a broad basis of consensus, but that others seemed to be more difficult. EUROPE recalls that Morocco has submitted counter-proposals to the content of the new agreement, and that, before the opening of official negotiations, preparatory discussions are to be continued.
