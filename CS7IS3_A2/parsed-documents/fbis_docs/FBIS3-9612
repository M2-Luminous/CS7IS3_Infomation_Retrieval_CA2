The VRS [Army of the Srpska republic] sources say that in practice this is not just a continuation of the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that the war is spreading. The VRS warns that it will resolutely oppose all attacks and defend the territory of the Srpska republic, as well as the historic interests and rights of the Serbian people. The Serbian side has recently obtained information that preparations for the Muslim offensive -- the aim of which is to break through to the left bank of the Drina -- have entered their final stage. The VRS earlier obtained Muslim plans which in essence envisage the idea of a frontal attack on Podrinje from several directions. Particularly important in these offensives is the attempt by Muslim units to link up with the Raska district and further with Kosovo and Metohija. At the same time, the Serbian military sources say, the Muslims are planning to link together the Muslim enclaves in Podrinje and join them by land with the Tuzla area. Continuous efforts on the part of the Serbian side to achieve peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina by political and not by military means give the best explanation and also shows for whom the only option is war, VRS sources say.
