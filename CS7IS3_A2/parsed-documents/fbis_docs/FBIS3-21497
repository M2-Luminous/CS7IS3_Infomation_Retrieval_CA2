It was transporting a considerable quantity of military weaponry destined for distribution throughout the country. The lot of weapons found hidden in the cabins consisted of 20 pump-action 12-mm rifles made by three different manufacturers, 15 6.65-mm automatic pistols, ammunition for hunting rifles and handguns, several cylindrical cases containing sighting pieces for rifles and machine-pistols, infrared binoculars, telescopes, and ultramodern transmitting and receiving stations. Dozens of seamen were arrested and several of them turned over to the Algiers public prosecutor. (Another freighter, the 7,400-ton Ibn Sirradj, belonging to the same company, was reportedly boarded by security forces who suspected it was transporting the same type of merchandise. However, it turned out the vessel was carrying no weapons.) How could this arsenal have been taken on board, and who financed this spectacular transaction? The key to the investigation was the arrest and subsequent confession of Mialet Hacene, a crewman on the ship in question and the man allegedly responsible for transshipment of the merchandise to El Djorf while it moored alongside another vessel at the Belgian port of Anvers. This vessel was an 8,100-ton freighter built in the 1970's and mostly used for "tramping" (transporting varied merchandise in bulk); it belongs to ULN, a regular shipping company serving the Europe-North America zone. Under interrogation, Mialet Hacene admitted to security officials that certain individuals had contacted him and insisted he take some merchandise on board without telling him exactly what it was. As he tells it, he was not in a position to refuse because they would have threatened to take revenge on his family. Hacene stated he was to go to the German port of Hamburg to meet an Algerian named Djamel Ressaf who was to provide him with the "packages." However, an unexplained hitch forced changes in the original plan, and the transfer point was shifted to the Belgian port of Anvers. The merchandise, delivered by the same individual, was taken on board El Djorf unknown to the vessel's captain, officers, and some of the crew. We recall that Djamel Ressaf, then a fugitive in France, was sentenced in absentia to death by the Special Court of Algiers for his role in the terrorist attack that destroyed Houari Boumediene International Airport. Twelve charges had been preferred against him. According to the remand order, he participated with Hocine Abderrahim, Said Soussen, and Zouaoui in the meeting held at El Biar to plan the terrorist operation. In July 1993 he was arrested by French security after expiration of his visitor permit. Nine months later, Ressaf's trail led to Germany and later Belgium. Was he deported to one of these countries after his arrest by French security? Kebir? The possibility cannot be ruled out, especially since Kebir, as former spokesman for the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], and Oussama Madani, as treasurer, were the only ones with access to the dissolved party's funds, which are now deposited in banks overseas. Ressaf Djamel, who also traveled in Sweden on false identity papers, was apparently in constant contact with Oussama Madani. Indeed, it was thanks to this person that Oussama Abassi met in September 1991 with Bachir Benzeguir, alias "Abu Tarek," the self-proclaimed "leader" of a Stockholm "cell" of the former FIS and author of several incendiary communiques, notably the one threatening German interests after German police arrested Kebir and Oussama in July of last year. It would seem, then, that militants of the dissolved Islamist party who are now at large in Europe--including several sought by Algerian justice for terrorist crimes--are still able to find enough complaisance and accomplices to circulate freely on the Old Continent. What is worse, these terrorists even go so far as to flout host-country authorities by indulging in arms trafficking for the purpose of destabilizing Algeria. But the question of the day is whether there now exists a maritime arms-trafficking ring in addition to those identified as operating across our land borders. Its existence would explain many mysteries, such as the provenance of certain types of arms, including Israeli Uzis and Czech Scorpios. When it agreed to grant asylum to these terrorists, did Europe fully appreciate the serious consequences of such a decision?
