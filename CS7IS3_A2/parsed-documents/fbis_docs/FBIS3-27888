Meanwhile, former President No Tae-u, aware of mounting public criticism against his former secretary for foreign and national security affairs, is trying to contact Kim to persuade him not to seek permanent residency in the United States, sources said. No, who had been indifferent to the issue until recently, was unsuccessful in his attempt to get in touch with Kim in the United States, they said. Kim left the country shortly after he was implicated in an investigation of alleged irregularities in the Yulgok project, and was reported in recent weeks to have applied for permanent U.S. residency or even political asylum. One aide to No said Tuesday he fears that the former president may ultimately have to take responsibility if Kim fails to return to Korea. That's why "we have been asking around if people know the whereabouts of Kim, but so far they are not known," he added. It was disclosed belatedly that Kim's 27-year-old son and his wife suddenly left the country for the United States at the end of last December and speculation abounds here now that Kim had already made careful preparations to settle down in the United States for good.
