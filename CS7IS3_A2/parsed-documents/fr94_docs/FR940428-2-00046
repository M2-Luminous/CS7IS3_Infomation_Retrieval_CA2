Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Equitrans, Inc. [Docket No. CP94&hyph;364&hyph;000] Take notice that on April 18, 1994, Equitrans, Inc., 3500 Park Lane, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15275, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;364&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §157.205 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorization to construct and operate one new delivery tap under Equitrans' blanket certificate issued in Docket Nos. CP83&hyph;508&hyph;000 and CP86&hyph;676&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, Equitrans proposes to construct and operate a delivery tap on its transmission line H&hyph;108 in the City of Ellsworth, Pennsylvania. Equitrans states that it would use this tap to deliver gas to Equitable Gas Company (Equitable) for retail gas service to a domestic customer. Equitrans estimates the peak day deliveries to be one Mcf. Equitrans states that the proposed service is within Equitable's entitlements and that the proposed service will not impact Equitrans' peak day and annual deliveries. Equitrans further states that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries without detriment to its other customers and that its tariff does not prohibit this type of service. Comment date: June 3, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 2. Questar Pipeline Co. [Docket No. CP94&hyph;353&hyph;000] Take notice that on April 14, 1994, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar), 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;353&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon certain interstate facilities by reclassification to a nonjurisdictional gathering designation, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Questar states that it proposes to reclassify its jurisdictional Lateral (JL) No. 21 and Lateral 495 to a gathering designation. Questar explains that these existing non-main-line, single-well connection facilities, comprising 7,916 feet of 3-inch and 4-inch pipeline, are used to gather volumes produced from the Antelope production area of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, for delivery into the Table Rock facilities of Colorado Interstate Gas Company. Questar further states that its JL No. 21 and Lateral 495 were installed under certifications issued to Questar's predecessor, Mountain Fuel Supply Company, in Docket No. CP74&hyph;133, as amended, on May 3, 1976 (55 FPC 2074) and on March 21, 1978 (2 FERC ¶61,255). Questar states that as of December 31, 1993, the total gross plant investment associated with the facilities is approximately $38,200. Questar now believes that the facilities now qualify as ``gathering'' in light of the Commission's ``modified primary function test.'' Questar states that no customer's service will be terminated as the result of granting the requested authorization. Comment date: May 10, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 3. Koch Gateway Pipeline Co.
