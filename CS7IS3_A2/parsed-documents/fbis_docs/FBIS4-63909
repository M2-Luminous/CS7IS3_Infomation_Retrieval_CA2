Ingushetia Accuses Temporary Administration of Inaction"] [Text] Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, circulated a statement yesterday regarding extremist statements and actions that have become more frequent in the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict zone. The statement says that extremists on both sides are trying to involve in the conflict the Russian soldiers and officers performing a peace-keeping mission. "The Russian authorities do not intend to tolerate the crude violations of human rights and legality in the zone subject to the state of emergency rule," the statement points out. Urging the citizens of North Ossetia and Ingushetia "to resist provocations," Boris Yeltsin draws attention to the fact that the law and order forces in the state of emergency zone have all the necessary powers and equipment to suppress manifestations of extremism and to protect civilians from violence, the statement says. In the meantime, Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev's chief of staff Ruslan Pliyev has stated that it is the Temporary Administration, or rather its inaction, that is to blame for the worsened situation in the state of emergency zone. In his opinion, the taking of six Ingush hostages by Ossetians on 19 May is a logical consequence of this inaction. In his opinion, the leaders of the Temporary Administration in the state of emergency zone should be replaced, and its headquarters should be located on neutral territory rather than in the capital of North Ossetia, Vladikavkaz. The Ingushetia president's press service addressed another statement to "Ostankino." The statement says: "People have been held hostages for the fifth day running in conditions of constant threat to their lives. In the meantime the central mass media and the "Ostankino" channel have been relaying various reports from North Ossetia, but there has not been even a word about Ingushi hostages." Glossing over facts and one-sided information, in the view of the press service, does not promote stability in the state of emergency zone.
