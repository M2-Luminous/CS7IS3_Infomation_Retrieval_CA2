The government, in particular the Department of Justice, would like to know exactly why the LBH is interested in visiting the prisoner. Minister of Justice Oetojo Oesman made this statement in response to questions from the press in Sukabumi on Thursday (3 February). The press asked about the decision to postpone the visit to Xanana and about letters from the Indonesian Legal Aid Society requesting permission to see Xanana at the Cipinang Penitentiary. As has been reported, the YLBHI [Indonesian Legal Aid Society] wrote Prof Dr Baharuddin Lopa, SH, Director General of Prisons, two times asking for permission to meet with Xanana in Cipinang. Dr Adnan Buyung Nasution, SH, chairman of the YLBHI, sent the first letter several weeks ago, after first submitting a verbal request. Since there was no response to the verbal and written requests, Buyung then wrote to Director General Lopa again asking when his group could meet with Xanana Gusmao. The letter, written on YLBHI letter-head, was signed by Adnan Buyung Nasution, Chairman of YLBHI's Executive Board, and by Secretary Frans Hendra Winarta, SH. "But since we haven't gotten an answer we wrote him again," said Frans. Minister of Justice Oetojo said that it would be prudent to see these problems from the proper perspective considering the judicial regulations involved; the question is who is allowed to deal with or visit the inmate, for example, because that is a matter of judicial regulations. In general, only family members, close friends and attorneys handling the case are allowed to visit an inmate in the penitentiary. It would also be a good thing to ask why the LBH is interested in visiting Xanana. Do they just want to see how Xanana is doing or do they have some direct interest in the case or not. "Meaning, it's OK for LBH to go see Xanana Gusmao, but what do they want to see?" he asked. If, for example, Oetojo continued, they want to ask whether Jose Xanana Gusmao's trial was valid or not, or if they want to ask whether there were any judicial errors made during his trial, clearly they will not be given permission. Because Xanana's trial is over, the results are in force; it has the permanent force of law and can no longer be questioned from a judicial point of view. Moreover, as we know, Xanana submitted a request for clemency (a request for forgiveness) to the president. The president accepted this request for clemency and he commuted Xanana Gusmao's original life sentence to twenty years in prison. So, Oetojo said, the Department of Justice will decide whether YLBHI's request falls into one of the categories just mentioned. If they just want to visit, that's OK, but what's their direct interest in the matter, Oetojo asked. The press asked why two special envoys from the UN Secretary General were allowed to visit Xanana Gusmao. When they made their visit on Monday, 24 January, the policy of postponing visits to Xanana was still in effect (up to 9 February - editor)--and yet now the LBH is not given permission. Oetojo said the situations were different. Oetojo said that the visit made by the two special envoys from the UN Secretary General had been planned long ago and had been programmed far in advance. In addition, the two envoys, Francesc [as published] Vendrell and Tamrat Samuel, had not only visited Xanana Gusmao but had also looked at general conditions in the Cipinang Penitentiary and had visited other inmates.
