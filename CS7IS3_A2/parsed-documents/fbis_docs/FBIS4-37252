In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT al-Asnaj said that the south will urge the UN secretary general to make a move in the framework of the UN Security Council resolution, which authorizes him to brief the Security Council on developments in the situation in Yemen and to discuss the means capable of deterring the regime from violating international legitimacy and putting it in its place as an enemy of humanity and peace in the regime. The southern foreign minister accused President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of working to thwart the efforts being made by the UN secretary general and his special envoy to Yemen Lakhdar Ibrahimi to establish peace in Yemen. He said that the continuation of the war declared by President Salih against the Yemeni people in the Democratic Republic of Yemen confirms his aggressive tendency and the untruthfulness of what he says, namely that he has accepted UN Security Council Resolution 924, which calls for an immediate cease-fire in Yemen. Al-Asnaj stressed that President's Salih forces, which are besieging Aden, have over the past two days shelled mosques, schools, and residential areas. And that they have fired more than seven rockets on the city, killing many children, women, and men in various parts of Lahij and Aden Governorates. He also said that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is living under a big delusion, namely that he is still president of what used to be called the Republic of Yemen. He said that his attack on Aden and his haphazard bombardment of it have provoked feelings of anger in Arab, Islamic, and many other states. The Yemeni minister, who is expected to arrive in Washington within the next 24 hours in the framework of southern diplomatic moves designed to rally political support for the new republic, added that the international community is tired of the northern leadership's attitudes after the confirmation of its noncompliance with the UN Security Council resolution, violation of the principles of the Islamic Shari'ah, and persistence in committing further war crimes. Al-Asnaj said that Sanaa's continuation of the war confirms its involvement in expansionist schemes of states outside Yemen designed to disrupt security and undermine stability in the region.
