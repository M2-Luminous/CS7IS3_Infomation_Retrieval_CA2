In an interview with the MBC Television on its 32nd anniversary, President Kim said North Korea's nuclear development should be thwarted by all means inasmuch as the question is directly linked to the survival of the 70 million Korean people. "At the moment, we can be neither pessimistic nor optimistic about the resolution of the controversial issue," Kim said. Looking back over the reforms he engineered in the past nine months, the president said, "you cannot wash away in mere several months all those defects that had piled up over a period of 30 or so years." He said there needs a longer period of time to change the people's way of thinking. The president stressed there must especially be a change in conscience and notion on the part of politicians. President Kim implied that he won't change the nation's educational system rather hastily. "Our educational system had undergone changes too often, which had brought about much problems in itself," he said. The president also said the basic flow of the Korean economy appears to have entered a rightful track. Nevertheless, he cautioned the people not to expect any overnight improvement of the economy.
