These operations extended to parts of Palestinian territory occupied in 1948. Less than 24 hours after the daring martyrdom operation carried out by a Palestinian youth in the city of 'Afula in 1948 Palestine, in which eight Israelis were killed and 52 others were wounded, a Palestinian youth opened fire on Zionist settlers near Ashdod, also in 1948 Palestine. A settler was killed and four were wounded. The Palestinian youth was martyred when the Zionist soldiers in the area shot him dead. A Palestinian youth in the occupied Gaza Strip stabbed a Zionist settler in the [Gush Qatif] settlement near Khan Yunus, seriously wounding him. These are some of the bold and heroic operations the intifadah youth carried out against the Zionist soldiers and settlers in the Arab territories occupied before and after 1967. The 'Afula and subsequent operations are in reply to the massacres committed by settler gangs and Zionist troops in the holy Ibrahim Mosque 40 days ago. No doubt, carrying out this operation and the Ashdod operation in 1948 Palestine confirms the ability of intifadah youths to expand their operations to include, in addition to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, all the cities and villages in 1948 Palestine. The intifadah youths can move and carry out operations throughout occupied Palestine. There will be no secure or calm place in the occupied Arab territories as long as Zionist occupation exists in Palestine and as long as the occupation authorities refuse to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories or recognize the Palestinian Arab people's legitimate rights. As acknowledged by Zionist officials, the 'Afula operation and subsequent daring fedayeen operations confirmed both the failure of the Israeli repression and the inability of the Israeli Army, police, and all the repressive Israeli measures to provide protection and security to the Zionist settlers. After the Hebron massacre, the occupation authorities sealed off the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and took various terrorist and repressive measures in order to prevent the intifadah youths from replying to this massacre. But what was the result? The result appeared in 'Afula, and a few hours later, in Ashdod. The intifadah youths replied to the massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, in which more than 60 Palestinian worshipers were victimized and hundreds were wounded. The intifadah youths replied to this massacre in 1948 Palestine in 'Afula and Ashdod, confirming their determination to continue the struggle against the occupation authorities, and stressing their ability to reach their targets at the time and in the place they choose. There is no safe place in the occupied Arab territories. There will be no peace or security for Zionist settlers and soldiers as long as Israel occupies Arab territories and as long as settler gangs and occupation troops commit daily massacres and terrorist crimes against Palestinian worshipers, children, and women. Peace, security, and stability will not be achieved for Israel as long as peace, security, and stability are not available for the Palestinian Arab people. A just and comprehensive peace has bases, components, and principles. UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 defined these bases and components. These resolutions provide for full Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, namely, the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, as well as occupied Golan and the occupied portion of southern Lebanon. They also guarantee the Palestinian Arab people's legitimate rights. These are the components of a comprehensive and just peace which were the bases of the peace process. Without implementing these bases and components, Israel will not enjoy peace and stability regardless of the duration of the occupation or Israel's terrorist massacres and crimes. Our Palestinian Arab people will not surrender as long as occupation exists in the land of Palestine, and they will chase the Zionists in every spot in occupied Palestine. Our people can do this, as was proved by the 'Afula operation, by the operations that followed this operation, and by the operation that will follow it. These operations will never stop, regardless of challenges and of the duration of both the occupation and aggression. Final victory will be the lot of our Palestinian Arab people, the owners of the land and the rightful claimants to this land, the land of their fathers and forefathers.
