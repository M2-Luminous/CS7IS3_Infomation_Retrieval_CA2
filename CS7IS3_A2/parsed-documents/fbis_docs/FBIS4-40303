Speaking at a news conference, the deputies explained their decision by the fact that on June 13 the Committee for the Organisation of Work of the State Duma canceled the Union's registration, saying that it did not provide the required 35 applications by the day of registration. Union member Boris Fedorov denounced the move, describing it as a provocation. He accused the Duma factions of the Liberal Democratic Party and Russia's Choice of backstage intrigues in order to get rid of the "wrong" deputies. He also blamed Russia's Choice faction for actions aimed against their own allies. Irina Khokamada, another member of the Union, believes that the decision has shown that the Duma is excessively politicised.
