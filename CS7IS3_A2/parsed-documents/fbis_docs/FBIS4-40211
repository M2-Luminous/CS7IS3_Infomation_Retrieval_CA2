He hopes this would make his country a more attractive place for economic activity and create additional incentives for foreign banks and investment companies. Pozniak's election platform says crucial to the success of economic reform would be all the makings of statehood -- borders, customs, national currency, banking system, bank of emission and the leverage to protect state sovereignty. In the state sector the opposition presidential candidate suggests dividing the functions of power and property. Power will be vested with share-holders, holding companies and concerns, while property management will be handed over to the Property Management Ministry. Pozniak believers that the share of military spending must be no bigger than 6 percent of the GDP. New budget policies proposed by the Popular Front leader imply forming the budget from below -- from the level of local self-government, a stop to subsidizing producers, slashed spending on the state apparatus, appropriate financing of the law-enforcement, defence, the health service and the program to eliminate the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. Pozniak believes that order in the economy would help quick transition to free trade in all goods and resources, which is to economic reform. Without making enterprises fully independent economically privatization, defence conversion or a social safety net for the population would be impossible. In order to consolidate the national currency, whose functions will be performed at the first stage by a settlement bill of the National Bank the opposition presidential candidate suggests shifting all businesses to commercial operation, introducing a law on bankruptcies and another one on the state debt and procedures of forming and paying it, and enforcing anti-trust policies. Pozniak says that the privatization of land is not the end but a means to enhance the effectiveness of the economy. If elected president Pozniak promises to promptly set up rural mortgage banks to credit farm producers, build homes and social facilities. In foreign economic policy Pozniak sees as a priority the development of partnership with neighboring countries and steps to conclude agreements with them on free trade, on customs and currency unions and, in the long run, a common market. He believes that monopoly in foreign trade must be abolished. Pozniak blames the current economic crisis heavily on the government's strong reluctance to conduct an independent economic policy and the lack of political will in parliament to map out the way of the country's development. In case of Pozniak's election victory a future Cabinet will be led by the leader of the Popular Accord Party Gennadiy Karpenko, Popular Front coordinator Pozniak's election campaign manager Sergey Naumchik. IF Note: Earlier Gennadiy Karpenko himself was a presidential candidate, however his team failed to raise 100 thousand signatures in his support necessary for official registration at the central electoral committee. Under Belarussian [Belarusian] legislation registration requires presenting to the central electoral commission the signatures of no less than 70 members of parliament. At first Karpenko was supported by 78 members of parliament, however, eleven of them -- the supporters of the Social Democrats -- changed their mind later. Karpenko withdrew from the election race without waiting for the central electoral committee's decision whether the law-makers had the right to take their signatures back. PF coordinator described Karpenko's agreement to conclude a political alliance with Pozniak as another step towards the unification of right-wing forces. Naumchik said that Pozniak would benefit from the alliance with Karpenko at least because the Popular Accord Party leader has important political connections in Russia and enjoys certain credibility with influential Russian statesmen. PF coordinator has told IF that Pozniak's alliance with the right-wing presidential candidate, ex-parliamentary speaker Stanislav Shushkevich would be impossible. Estrangement between the two will mount as the election race picks up pace, he said. The coordinating committee of the Popular Movement of Belarus (PFB) has decided to support the current Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich as the common candidate of the left-center alliance in the 23 June presidential election. IF Note: PMB unites 30 left-wing and centrist parties and non-governmental organizations, such as the Communists, the Liberal Democrats, the Slavyanskiy Sobor (Slav Assembly) party, the Officers' Union and the republican organization of veterans. Analysts say that the movement have local offices in all districts and regions and is a major political force. Apart from V. Kebich, Z. Pozniak and S. Shushkevich the Belarusian presidency is contested by three other candidates -- the Agrarian Party leader Aleksandr Dubko, Communist Party Secretary Vasiliy Novikov and people's deputy Aleksandr Lukashenko. The latter is faced with the risk of being excluded from the race for abusing the election law. IF Note: According to reliable sources a truck carrying 20,000 color photographs of Lukashenko and leaflets calling to vote for him was detained on the Latvian border on 10 June. The accompanying documents said the printed matter came from Hanover, Germany. The Belarusian election law prohibits any direct or indirect participation of foreign organizations or nationals in financing the campaigns of presidential candidates or giving them any other assistance. The central electoral commission is empowered to cancel the registration of those presidential candidates who prove responsible for violating this rule. Although under the accompanying papers the cost of the cargo is estimated at 9 million Belarusian rubles, experts say that the real cost is more than 100 million. According the papers the customer paid the contractor in D-marks. Interviewed by IF the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Aleksandr Abramovich has said that the commission was not empowered to decide whether Lukashenko should be banned from the race until law-enforcement agencies officially proved Lukashenko's complicity. In the meantime reports from Minsk say that although the cargo was arrested, posters identical to those detained on the border appeared on the walls in the city center. Law enforcement agencies believe that similar cargoes arrived in Belarus earlier.
