These sources said the officer had played a central role in preparing for the invasion of Kuwait, and was directly responsible for all cash payments and gifts that were given to top officials and a large number of journalists in some Arab countries in order to extend material and moral support for the Iraqi adventure against Kuwait. AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM also learned that the Iraqi officer will hold a news conference soon to reveal in figures and names the huge sums of money the Iraqi regime had given to some political and military officials and journalists shortly before the treacherous invasion.
