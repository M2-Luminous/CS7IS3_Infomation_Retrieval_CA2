We were taken by surprise, the deputy minister admitted. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that, speaking before the Knesset plenum, Deputy Minister Gur said that very harsh steps will be taken against the supporters of Kakh. At the same time, however, the administration will attempt to avoid discrediting all of the Jewish settlers in the territories. Our correspondent reports that the Knesset debate was very stormy. Knesset Members [MK's] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and Rehav'am Ze'evi called each other terrorist and murderer, and other MK's rushed to separate the two rivals. Deputy Minister Gur pleaded with the Arab MK's to go back on, and refrain from making statements linking the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] with Barukh Goldstein's shooting. Such claims are blood libel, Gur said.
