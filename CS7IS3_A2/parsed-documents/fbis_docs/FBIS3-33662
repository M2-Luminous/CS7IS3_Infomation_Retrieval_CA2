Your Excellency, the chairman [of the Higher State Council]; members of the Higher State Council; ladies and gentlemen: It is my duty at this historic moment solemnly to salute the souls of all our righteous sons who paid for the freedom and independence of Algeria and the unity and sovereignty of our nation with their lives. I stand before you at a time when the homeland is going through a decisive turning point which makes it the duty of every Algerian citizen, male or female, to shoulder his responsibility and devote all of his forces in order to preserve the supreme interest of the homeland and secure the continuity of the Algerian state and the independence of its decision in faithfulness to the principles of the 1 November Revolution. Not long ago my brothers called on me, from the highest authority in the country, to assume the post of minister of national defense. I responded to the call of duty out of my feelings about the seriousness of the situation and put all of my energy into the service of the military establishment, not striving for posts and protocol, but out of my belief that the homeland is above all other considerations, just as the National People's Army supported and backed--and is still supporting and backing--all efforts to take the country out of its multi-sided crisis by way of serious dialogue. Therefore, I supported my brothers' efforts to make the national conference successful in order to obtain a national consensus within the framework of the document for organizing the transitional phase in accordance with the spirit of the constitution. This is so that it will be a true expression of the tendencies of various sections of society, in order to guarantee a wide popular mobilization, and in order to end the scattering of the nation and to recruit all the sons of the Algerian people, regardless of their political affiliations, for the sake of building a new national order in which the people are allowed to express their choices with total freedom and on correct bases remote from any pressure or falsification, without infringing the homeland's supreme interest and the stability of the state and its establishments. Mr. Chairman, members of the Higher State Council, gentlemen, ladies: My appointment as head of state by the Higher Security Council comes after all means have been exhausted [to solve the crisis] and in response to the requests from large sections of our society who want security, stability, and tranquility. I placed myself at the service of the supreme interests of the homeland and the nation, with all modesty and sincerity, after I saw the deep fragmentation occurring on the political scene, in order to unite the sons of Algeria. I have never aspired at any time to acquire this lofty task and heavy responsibility. Mr. Chairman, members of the Higher State Council: Thanks to your sincere spirit of responsibility and nationalism, you have been able to manage the affairs of the country; you have been eager to follow the constitution and preserve the state institutions. You have created the atmosphere for dialogue and consultation that enabled us to entrench the principle of rotation in power. By doing this you have provided the proof of your sincerity and your zeal in the service of the state and the homeland within the framework of the principles of the November revolution, and you have fulfilled the pledge you made in the 14 January 1992 declaration. The coming generations will remember and history will record this exemplary stand. In my turn I offer you my thanks for what you have done for the people and the homeland. May God render us successful and guide our steps. Peace and blessings of God be upon you. [applause]
