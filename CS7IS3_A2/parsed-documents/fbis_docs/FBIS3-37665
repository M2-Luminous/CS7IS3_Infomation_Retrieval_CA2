This was stated in an exclusive interview given to ITAR-TASS by Vitaliy Churkin, special representative of the president of the Russian Federation and deputy foreign minister, at Zagreb airport today on his return from the Bosnian capital. "The Serbs are firmly observing the promise they gave to Russia, their heavy guns have been either withdrawn or brought under UN control, and the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] leadership has no complaints about them. The questions raised yesterday by the Russian side with the command of Bosnian Serbs were solved on the spot, and relevant orders were given and executed in our presence," the Russian diplomat said. Commenting, at an ITAR-TASS correspondent's request, on the statement by Ejup Ganic, vice president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, to the effect that some hours before the NATO ultimatum expired 40 to 50 percent of the Serb heavy guns remained in their former positions, the Russian president's special envoy said: "Among the Muslim figures there are people who are making nervous and sometimes irresponsible statements. The figure of 40-50 percent is unrealistic. An insignificant number of Serb heavy guns have indeed remained, but they are dispersed across the eight areas allocated for this purpose. But these heavy guns have been declared to the United Nations and are under its control. Some of these guns are simply out of order, the rest have been made incapable of immediate military use. UNPROFOR has no complaints to the Serbs regarding these armaments", Churkin stressed. Today our battalion starts performing its new duties in the capital's district of Grbavica along the disengagement line. This is a difficult area of Sarajevo, where French "blue helmets" too are performing the peace-making mission, he said. V. Churkin noted that the Russian delegation received "all the necessary assurances" from Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic "that there will be no kind of provocations and additional complications for our soldiers." In a short speech for the press Izetbegovic yesterday stressed that "the Russians have come as friends." As regards the Serb population in the areas surrounding Sarajevo, then, in the words of the diplomat, it has received the Russian servicemen "very well and even enthusiastically." "The very presence of the Russian 'blue berets' is calming and stabilizing the situation in Sarajevo," he said. Commenting on Russia's attitude to the meeting commencing in Bonn tomorrow of representatives of the foreign ministries of Russia, the United States, and EC member states, which will proceed with the involvement of a UN delegation, V. Churkin described it as an "important diplomatic if not political event." "Such a meeting is taking place for the first time after overcoming the crisis in Sarajevo, and in my view this is a move to a new level of unity in the efforts of key members of the international community in settling the Bosnian problem. We are preparing for this meeting and hope that it will be followed by meetings at a higher level. Overcoming the crisis in Bosnia will make it possible to energetically complete a settlement in Bosnia as a whole," he concluded. On the same day, V. Churkin flew to Bonn to take part in the forthcoming meeting of high-ranking officials.
