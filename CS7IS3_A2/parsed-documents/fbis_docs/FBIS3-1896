THE NEW YORK TIMES quoted senior U.S. officials as saying the President had accepted the recommendation from his economic advisers that he reinstate by executive order the "Super 301" trade retaliation mechanism. Since the U.S.-Japan summit meeting failed to reach a trade agreement two weeks ago, the U.S. Administration has been considering measures to compel Japan to open markets for U.S. products. "Super 301", passed by Congress in 1988, requires the U.S. trade representatives to identify the countries that maintain the most egregious trade barriers and to use the legislation to eliminate those barriers. If an offending country refuses to eliminate the specific barriers, the U.S. president has the authority to retaliate by blocking an equivalent amount of that country's exports to the United States. These officials said the President still intended to move cautiously and simply signing the executive order did not mean that he would use it against Japan immediately. But some analysts argued that putting such a powerful weapon into place could mark a dangerous increase in U.S.-Japan trade tensions. Reacting to THE NEW YORK TIME's report, a spokesman of Japanese Government said today that such a move would be "counterproductive" and urged the United States to use a "sensible" approach to the trade question.
