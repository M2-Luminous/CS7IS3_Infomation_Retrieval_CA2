[passage omitted] We say to the U.S., Britain, France, the hirelings, and Zionists, that Misratah will reject treason and arrogance. The enemy's calculations, which have led it to issue three unjust resolutions -- concocted through the Security Council -- against the Libyan people must be foiled here in Misratah. We should announce from here, from this town in which we challenged the fleets of Italy and its unjust aggression at a time when there was no comparison between the defenses of the inhabitants of Misratah and the Italian brute force. Today, however, there is some comparison between our force and its readiness and of that of the enemy's, who might like to repeat the aggression once more. Brothers, we would like to announce from Misratah that the Libyan people has come to the conclusion that the battle is not against the Jamahiriyah; it was not caused by the Pan Am incident and it is not a battle between just two sides. The Libyan people has come to the conclusion that a fresh colonialist campaign and a new imperialist scheme is under way against the Arab nation. However, it has been ordained that Libya should raise aloft the banner of this battle. And it has been ordained that the Libyan people should raise aloft the banner of Saladin, Jamal-'Abd-al-Nasir, al-Suwahli, and Umar al-Mukhtar, as well as other banners which symbolize our glorious history; we should raise them all aloft. The Libyan people is aware that Washington, Paris, Berlin, Bonn, London, and Tel Aviv are all behind the battle which is taking place now in the streets of Cairo. The battle which is taking place in the streets of Cairo is a long and a serious battle; it is a battle which has nothing to do with Islamic extremism and has nothing to do whatsoever with Islam. It is a scheme to divide Egypt into a mini-state for Copts and another one for Muslims, and to Balkanize the Arab homeland. The Egyptian people must therefore be aware that Tel Aviv, Washington, Paris, and London -- and Bonn too -- are all behind the battle which is taking place in the streets of Cairo at this moment. It is the beginning of a serious battle, a very serious battle indeed, which aims at fragmenting Egypt and dividing it into mini-states, because Egypt is the mother of pan-Arabism. Cairo is the capital of the Arab nation, and the Egyptian people has made innumerable sacrifices against the Crusaders, colonialists, and Zionists. The Libyan people would like to warn its fraternal Egyptian people against the seriousness of the plot which is being hatched by Western power and Tel Aviv. The faked peace process, which is being bragged about to us these days, is no more that a smokescreen for the Zionist conspiracy against Cairo and the U.S. conspiracy against Cairo. Hence, the Libyan people in Misratah would like to warn its brothers, with whom it is linked by same fate, its Egyptian brothers and Cairo, the capital of the Arab nation, that a serious conspiracy is being hatched against Cairo, first and foremost before Tripoli and Misratah. The Egyptian people ought to vigilant. We would like to warn our brothers in the fraternal Egyptian leadership, out of our concern for them and for our common fate, to warn them from Misratah, the town of Jihad and resistance and the town of heroic sacrifices, that the peace process is a lie and a smokescreen for the dangerous conspiracy against Cairo itself. Therefore, those meetings, delegations, consultations, and compromises are merely a dangerous conspiracy which hides the serious, the secret, wanton, and dangerous work which is being carried out day in, day out, against Egypt itself, against Palestine, and against the Arab nation. We are going to take Tel Aviv's wraps off here in Misratah: When it sends delegations to Cairo, Taba, Oslo, Geneva, and to the United Nations, it is in order to hide the serious conspiracy against Egypt, a conspiracy which is being hatched in secret in order to Balkanize Egypt and to divide Egypt in a bid to destroy the biggest Arab country, and to undermine Arab stamina for a confrontation. They look at peace between Egypt and the Zionist enemy from their viewpoint as being a temporary truce, and when preparations are completed there will be a clash, because the Jews will not be satisfied with a small state surrounded by Arabs and confined between Arabs and the sea, and get a tiny state. The Jews are planning to establish an empire, not between the Euphrates and the Nile, but from the Atlantic to the Gulf, which would replace the Arab nation. At the same time, O brothers, I thank you for giving us this opportunity to deliver this serious speech which concerns the fate of the Arab nation. At the same time, O brothers, while maneuvering and deceptive operations are openly taking place, such as negotiations on Gaza and Jericho, these moves hide the real criminal plan directed against Egypt. At the same time, O brothers, they send delegations and talk with Algeria, which is the second biggest Arab state and is the country with 1.5 million martyrs. They court Algeria with lies and talk about economic aid -- the IMF, the World Bank -- and the possibility of granting loans to Algeria. At the same time, O brothers, they are igniting covert fires and working to cause an internal explosion within Algeria. Paris is behind the battle which has started in Algeria, and France fans it directly with the black French hand. It is not an Islamic battle at all, it is a battle, which according to their plans, will not end until Algeria is fragmented piece by piece, and tiny states are set up in Algeria once again. Then these states will be ethnic and family states which are isolated from each other, and which ask Europe for help and which are at Europe's mercy. From Misratah, the city of historical resistance, the city of struggle, bravery, and sacrifices, we address the call to the brave Algerian people and our friends in the new Algerian leadership, to warn them against this conspiracy being hatched by Paris, the Western states, and Zionism, in order to bring about the fragmentation of and balkanization of Algeria, and to realize that the battle is not with the Islamists or with Islam. Algeria is an Islamic state, Egypt is also an Islamic Sunni state. There is no defection from Islam or heresy in Egypt. Egypt is a country of Islam and is a country of the Holy al-Azhar, but the things which are taking place in the streets of Egypt and Algeria are an U.S.-French-British-German-Jewish conspiracy. The Libyan people are those who can today raise their voice high in order to warn the Arab nation against this sudden danger, O brothers, against the Arab nation. The reason for this is because the circumstances of the Arab peoples do not allow them to express what is in their hearts with regard to America, Britain, France, and Zionism. The Arab peoples are prisoners, and the Arab petty states are tantamount to mass prisons for the peoples of the Arab nation. The Libyan people have broken the chains and have liberated themselves with the revolution, the great al-Fatih revolution, and their voice has become loud. The Libyan people are their own masters and are the people of the People's Congresses and People's Committees, the people of revolutionary committees and free vocational trade unions, the people who possess authority, wealth, and weapons. O brothers, we have the right to warn our nation from Misratah. We have chosen Misratah because Egypt knows Misratah, Algeria knows Misratah, and the Arab nation and the enemy know Misratah. The enemy knows the bitter lessons it tasted in Misratah. The enemy recalls the distress it faced from Misratah's resistance. [passage omitted] The battle is one from the Ocean to the Gulf, regardless of attempts to deceive us. We understand history. We make history. We will not be deceived, O brothers. The battle is one from the ocean to the Gulf and the enemy is one from Tel Aviv to Washington. One enemy against one nation. We should not be deceived, O brothers, that there is an Algerian issue, a Palestinian issue, a Syrian issue, an Iraqi issue, and a Libyan issue. This is a lie. This is deception. This cannot fool us while we are talking from Misratah. [passage omitted] However, the U.S. of yesterday is not the U.S. of today. The U.S. today supports with all its might the artificial Jewish state and arms it with the nuclear weapon and with the bacteriological and chemical weapons, which are targeted toward the oblivious Arabs. O simple-minded Arabs, Israel's weapons are targeted on you alone. Who has a quarell with the Jewish state? You Arabs and Muslims. And who supplied this mini-state with the mass destruction weapons? It is the West who is deceiving you at present and who laugh and ridicule you, and tells you it is your friend. What sort of friendship is it between the Arab nation and its real traditional enemies? The animosity between Islam and the Jews and the Christians will continue until the day of judgment. This is the will of God and all other attempts are naive and ignorant. We are not seeking friendship with the imperialist states. However, what we want is that they remain within their borders and we remain within ours. That is all. We have no ambitions with regard to their assistance. We are not in need of assistance. We are not in need of assistance either from the U.S., from Britain, from France, or from the European Economic Community [EEC]. To hell with the EEC. We can do without the EEC and without any relations with the EEC. Those who pin their hopes on the EEC and on European assistance are plowing in the sea. They are naive. They are ignorant. They are insignificant, and history will cast them to its wastebin. The Libyan people, O brothers, has the honor and the pride and glory that it is paying the price for independence. We are a free and independent people. We have glory and pride in that. We challenge any of the peoples around us to be free. All the peoples around us are shackled. If they were not shackled internally they would be shackled by foreign aid and burdened by foreign debts, and are under foreign control and under foreign aid. What sort of independence is it that depends on foreign aid? What independence is it that depends on foreign assistance? What sort of independence is it for Kuwait if it is unable to remain independent without the protection of foreign forces? Joining Iraq would be a million times better for it than to remain artificially independent and dependent on the presence of foreign forces. What would happen if the foreign forces withdrew? Kuwait's independence would disappear along with the foreign forces. If Saudi Arabia's independence is dependent on the U.S. forces, what meaning does this independence have? For Saudi Arabia to join Egypt or Iraq or Yemen would be better than to have an independence that depends on the presence of foreign forces. The Libyan people, O brothers, is paying the price for genuine independence. This the price of independence. It is to give up the foreigner, be hostile to those hostile to you, and to reject bargaining. Bargaining with dignity, bargaining with your brother. We, O brothers, do not bargain on Iraq and on the sufferings of the people of Iraq and the tragedies of the children of Iraq. Those who do that are cowards. They are the insignificant and the lowly who will be cursed by the nation and cursed by the children of Iraq. We, O brothers, do not sacrifice the fate of the nation or the future of the nation, or the future of the Palestinian people, or the Palestinian issue for the sake of our national issue. We know that our national issue is part of the pan-Arab issue, and that any loss in the Palestinian issue is a loss to the Libyan national issue. Therefore, we profoundly regret the sale of dear Palestine. Palestine has been sold and holy Jerusalem has been abandoned. The bargaining on the Palestinian people has been done. O brothers, they are selling the Palestinians at auction. They are trading Jerusalem; let the curse befall those rulers who are trading holy Jerusalem. They are trading the al-Aqsa Mosque, O brothers. They are trading Palestine. Selling the Palestinian people, selling, O brothers, the future of the Arab nation, selling the future of your children and grandchildren. This is the price of independence, O brothers, which Libya is currently paying. Libya is not paying the Lockerbie price, because no verdict has been passed regarding this issue to the effect that Libya should pay this price. However, Libya, with resolutions 731, 748 and (?889), is paying the price of independence, the price of liberation, the price of emancipation, the price of it being a free and sovereign country which can say no when it wants and yes when it wants, and according to what it thinks. Those who do not pay this price are neither independent nor free. He who wants to have freedom will have to pay the price. Therefore, we declare that we have nothing to do with Lockerbie, and that we have no interest in this issue. We do not look at it and we are closing this file, because we know that we are not going to pay the price of Lockerbie. But we are paying the price for our irreversible independence. Liberation and emancipation are irreversible, independence is irreversible. We will not retreat from the fact that we are living free under the sun and on the land of our forefathers. [cheers] [passage omitted] We have to declare, O brothers, that Egypt is in danger, Algeria is in danger, Yemen is in danger, and Sudan is in danger. We have to declare, O brothers, that these peoples are exposed to danger before the Libyan people, because the Libyan people is capable of confrontation and fighting, but these peoples have been deceived by peace, by the mirage of peace. The Arab nation is being deceived right now and a conspiracy is being fomented against it, the conspiracy of the Balkanization of the Arab nation and the tearing off of its limbs, O brothers.
