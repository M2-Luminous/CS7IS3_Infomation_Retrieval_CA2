The liberal daily TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,300-word article by Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun under the headline "Significance of the Settlement of the Inspection Schedule Agreed Between North Korea and the United States." The article notes that when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team starts the nuclear inspection on 1 March, the ROK side will announce a "suspension" of the Team Spirit exercise for this year, and thus the road toward the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be "opened." Assessing the current agreement as a step in removing another "stumbling block" to a solution of the North Korean nuclear issue, the article stresses that the "stalemate" in the past U.S.-DPRK talks was caused by a "lack of mutual trust" and by "difference in views" on designating the date of the third round of high-level talks and on the "issue of North-South dialogue." North Korea tried to "step up" the dialogue with the United States and to "exclude" the ROK while "delaying" the North-South dialogue, but finally agreed that the United States announce on 1 March its position that "it will not respond to the third round of high-level talks unless the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South is realized." Noting that this agreement was made on the condition that "if the South proposes dialogue for the exchange of envoys, the North will respond," the article pays attention to the North Korean attitude on North-South dialogue and to the "degree of progress" in the dialogue up until high-level talks are held. The moderate daily CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word editorial entitled "This Is Only the Beginning of the North Korean Nuclear Issue." Noting the recent agreement as a "fortunate achievement" attained through dialogue, the editorial says that North Korea has been seized with "a sense of crisis and the sense of persecution" in view of its claim that "the IAEA put forward unreasonable demands" to North Korea. The editorial notes that the U.S. Government revealed its position that "missile export, terrorism, the human rights issue and even the conventional military power" of North Korea must be "discussed" before completely accepting the North Korean demands, and that "difficult problems," which may be raised in the future due to North Korea's act of "picking a quarrel," should be resolved through "patience" and "efforts." The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,300- word article by reporter Pak Tu-sik under the headline "The U.S.- North Korea Agreement and Prospects for North-South Relations." Paying specific attention to the content regarding the exchange of North-South special envoys included in the recent U.S.-North Korea agreement, the article urges the holding of the special envoys exchange "for discussion of the nuclear issue" and "for realizing a North-South summit." Noting that our government called on the United States "absolutely not to concede" to North Korea on the principle on the exchange of special envoys during the talks in New York, the article predicts that the exchange will be realized even "as a matter of formality" because it is North Korea's "commitment" that should be fulfilled within a little over "20 days." However, the article concludes, "the visibility is still poor." The moderate daily KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,200- word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim Hak-sun under the headline "North Korea-U.S. Negotiations Are Now on the `Political Table.'" Explaining the process in past North Korea-U.S. talks on the nuclear inspection issue, including the "highly strained" 25 February contact in New York, the article says that the two sides set "21 March" as the date of the third round of high-level talks, because at least "two or three weeks" are required for "proving the continuity of nuclear safeguards" even after the IAEA inspection starts, and because the ROK and the United States believed that this length of time is needed for "evaluating the sincerity in accepting the nuclear inspection" and for realizing the exchange of North- South special envoys. The article pointed out that both the ROK and the United States reportedly "have driven a wedge" on the road toward the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks so that the talks are "canceled" in the event that North Korea does not show "sincerity" in the nuclear inspection and exchange of special envoys. Therefore, North Korea will not carry out "harmful acts" to the third talks. The article concludes that the U.S.-North Korea agreement means that the two sides are now moving toward "the full-scale political negotiation stage." The economy-specialized daily SEOUL MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word article by reporters Yi Tong-chu and So Yang-won, under the headline "Significance in the Settlement of North Korea-U.S. Working-level Contact." The article points out that at the contact, North Korea made a "somewhat unusual demand" that the content of the agreement be announced in the form of a "joint statement," noting this shows North Korea's persistent "adherence" to the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks. The article refers to remarks of a relevant government official that "the most serious stumbling block" during the U.S.-North Korea negotiations was "the issue of exchange of special envoys" and that North-South relations will be solved by the "parties concerned" prompted by President Kim Yong-sam's recent "summit proposal through the exchange of special envoys." The North and the South are expected to discuss concretely "the qualifications and missions of special envoys and the time and method of their exchange" during a working-level contact to be held "within this week." The article points out a government official's "optimistic view" that "the special envoy of either the North or the South will be able to visit the other side before 21 March, when the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks are held." However, the article notes that the North may come to the North-South dialogue "without attaching any importance to it" because North Korea only adheres to "dialogue with the United States." The government-supported daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word editorial entitled "We Watch the Time After The U.S.- North Korea Nuclear Agreement." Pointing to people's "depressed feeling" despite "the sign of the situation moving toward the right direction" with the agreement, the editorial notes that this is because North Korea's "nuclear transparency" cannot be guaranteed by the forthcoming IAEA inspections alone and because the issue of "special inspection of two undeclared sites--the cause of commotions--" is left as a pending question. Therefore, the editorial stresses, the "task" henceforth is the implementation of "special inspection" of these facilities. The editorial points out that "how sincerely North Korea will cooperate with the IAEA inspection; what the result of the forthcoming ordinary inspection would be, and what the North side's attitude on North-South working contact for special envoys exchange is, will be the "targets" of the people's attention in deciding North Korea's "true intention." Emphasizing that the North's acceptance of "special inspection" and "mutual inspection" would be an important evidence of North Korea's "good intention," the editorial hopes that with the acceptance of these two inspections, the North's "nuclear transparency" should be ensured. The leftist-leaning daily HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,700-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Yon-chu, under the headline "Road Opened for Full-scale North Korea-U.S. Political Talks." Noting an important "breakthrough" was made toward the nuclear inspection and the third round of high-level talks after the agreement was adopted, the article regards the agreement as an "important milestone" for full-fledged political talks between North Korea and the United States, and as a "qualitative change" in relations between the two countries, thus exercising "fundamental influence" on the Korean peninsula and its neighboring countries. The article points out that the U.S. position stressed the "insurance of transparency in the North Korean nuclear issue" and that North Korea attempted to "tightly hold" the nuclear card in an effort to improve "political and economic relations" with the United States. The article emphasizes that regardless of the remarks of some people that "nothing has basically changed in the North Korean nuclear issue," this issue is advancing toward a "smooth, positive solution" judging from "the overall situation." The article then refers to the remarks of North Korean Ambassador Ho that during the forthcoming third round of high-level talks, "the complete return of North Korea to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty; North Korea's implementation of the nuclear safeguards accord; the U.S. abandonment of hostile policy against North Korea and the suspension of its nuclear threat, and other overall political, diplomatic and economic issues" will be discussed. Pointing to some people's allegation on the "necessity" of the North-South summit, the article pays attention to how the North Korean side would "respond" to President Kim Yong-sam's recent summit proposal.
