How To View the Current Russian Economy [Nukazawa] The Keidanren's Japan-Russia Economic Committee and the Russia-Japan Economic Committee, which centers on the Russian Industrialists and Enterpreneurs Federation, held their first joint conference in Moscow for four days beginning 2 June 1993, and discussed a variety of problems based on the present new situation. The Japan committee also made efforts to grasp the realities of Russia's economy and civilian life through visits to plants and a tour of the city of St. Petersburg. These activities were very helpful in increasing mutual understanding between the two nations, and progress was made concerning a number of problems. Opinions about Russia's present economic conditions were sharply divided between those who perceive an underlying strength and those who see utter confusion. What are your opinions? [Yamashita] Russia's economy is said to be gigantic and similar to an elephant. It is not a healthy elephant, but an ailing elephant. We are small and have absolutely no idea why it is flailing its trunk, or in which direction it is walking. Although we attempt to view the present condition of the elephant itself, it is extremely difficult to get an overall view. At present, the Yeltsin administration seems likely to endure for a while longer. Judging from the national referendum held in April, we can perhaps conclude that he still holds the reins of power. Conversely, we cannot debate anything unless we establish such a premise. The Russian People Are Beginning To Enjoy Freedom [Kawake] I believe it is realistic to say that present-day Russia is difficult to understand. However, I received the impression that, still, Russia is moving in a forward direction in its own way. The strongest indication is the bright look on the faces of the people we saw in walking through the streets and in the department stores. The young girls wear miniskirts and look stylish, which seems somehow to be a change. I believe that they have begun to enjoy "freedom." Despite the high prices of goods, with the money they earn, they can buy anything without forming queues. This is natural for us, but it is a great change for them. Their previous custom of buying food and clothing at the state stores was similar to our distribution of rationed goods during the war. Today, however, buying goods at the GUM stores means shopping at one's option despite the high prices. I do not think that the "freedom" experienced by the people can be easily taken away. [Rokugawa] I also felt a brightness in their future. We stayed in Moscow for a week before the conference, and later for about a week in Vladivostok. It was the season of new greenness, and the looks on the faces of the people walking by were etremely cheerful. We met many corporate leaders who were really gungho. They were full of ideas and eager to test them, saying that they would like to trade and cooperate with us in joint ventures. After returning to Japan, I talked with Director Hisao Kanamori of the Russia-East Europe Economic Research Institute. He said that Russia's economy has declined compared to the same period a year earlier, but it has improved when the January-April period of this year is compared with the same period last year, for example, and it made me feel optimistic. Japan-Russia trade also has shown some definite signs of monetary improvement during January-April. Russia's Present "Dual Economy" [Aiko] From a macro viewpoint, after World War II, India, the USSR, and China--socialist nations that were under planned economic management, that is, three regions with the world's largest populations--were shut inside the socialist freezer. The "energy" was released with the collapse of the system, and the planned economy shifted to a market economy. As to which of the three will get on track first, it is China. Next is India, and I believe that today's Russia will require some time. I believe that, in the future, every phenomenon of 21st century politics and economics will result in an upheaval due to the "energy" released in the three regions, and will be prescribed by it. The present state of Russia's economy seems to be a dual economy in which coexist an economy of the heavy industrial sector, which has been encumbered by the shadow of the state-run corporation, and a real economy, similar to the black market economy in Japan immediately after the war. In looking at the sector centered on the heavy industrial state-run corporation, we become extremely pessimistic, but the real economy at the grassroots is considerably more sound. I feel that the views differ according to where the focus is placed. I received the impression that confusion arises when observing Russia's economy, due to the problem of where to focus one's sight. [Nukazawa] What are your views on the observation that, despite the privatization of the state-run corporations, it will result in monopolies that deny the advantages of competition? [Kawake] In a careful consideration of the nation called Russia, companies in the real sense apparently did not exist during the more than 200 years that include the tsarist era, and I believe that a major problem lies in how Russia without such experience should learn about the market economy. It is true that, despite privatization of the state-run corporation, only a monopolistic corporation will result. I believe that it is the responsibility of Japan and other nations to advise them on how to go about it and to think for them, which is more important than capital assistance. Regarding the formation of a framework, Japan and Germany have a variety of experiences. Both have lost in war, experienced inflation, and privatized state-run enterprises. I believe that, as Russia's neighbor, Japan should provide such assistance. Japan's Experiences Effective for Russia [Nukazawa] I heard recently in Moscow that, among the 49 foreign advisers in the Russian Government, 48 were advisers sent by the United States. However, in the case of the United States, its experience in promoting the economy happened a long, long time ago, and I believe that it is more useful to tell them about Japan's experiences. It is important to send advisers from Japan. [Aiko] I believe that there are two major problems concerning the current reforms. First, the effect of the same prescription is totally the reverse, depending on when there is surplus supply capacity and when there is a shortage. You say that virtually all of the advisers are Americans, but the Americans have never experienced an absolute shortage of supply capacity. Looking at Russia's recent circumstances, it appears that they are trying to apply the common sense of a nation with surplus supply to a nation with a shortage of supply. Regardless of price liberalization, there is no way for it to become an incentive for a rise in supply. If prices are liberalized when there is an absolute supply shortage, goods will sell regardless of how high the prices, so the prices will merely climb without a rise in supply. Therefore, under such circumstances, I believe that it is necessary to retain the supply or control system to some extent, and to gradually liberalize in accordance with an upgrading of the supply system. Second, the previous system concentrated outstanding people of talent in the Communist Party and formed a bureaucracy. In one aspect, due to a personnel shortage, ignoring these people and attempting to press for reforms will not work smoothly. In fact, they must be asked to work together to achieve reform. In Japan during the Meiji Restoration, the detectives and officials of the Tokugawa shogunate were used adeptly for continuity. During the last war also, in the process of discarding control, the prewar government organization was used intact. Russia has had a world-class bureaucratic system, and I believe that it should consider pushing for reforms by cleverly using it with its cooperation. Regarding these two points, we could probably provide unique advice by utilizing Japan's experience. [Yamashita] If we narrow down the areas in concrete terms, Russia has state-designated industrial product standards called GOST [All-Union State Standard], which is like the JIS [Japan Industrial Standards]. This is a huge organization that has more than 50,000 members in the capital area and about 38,000 members in the outlying regions. However, despite the large number of members, application of the standards is quite lagging, and Russia's standards have been omitted from the joint standards of the ISO [International Standards Organization] which was started by Europe. If it is unable to win ISO approval, as a practical problem, Russian products, except military weapons, will no longer be exportable to Europe. Therefore, if it adopts a joint approach with Japan, which is slow to conform to ISO standards, it will probably be able to win approval. As this example illustrates, I believe that it is more useful to exchange advice on a specific theme. [Nukazawa] However, perhaps because it has been exposed to the view from Europe and the United States that "Japan has not really become a market economy, and therefore it is not advisable to learn from Japan," there was an atmosphere of an element of caution against learning from Japan, was there not? [Kawake] Conversely, there was a view that, for Russia's sake, it is easier to accept the Japan-style economy than the U.S.-style, and that it would serve as a reference. The problem of privatization of the national railways is one not found in the United States, nor is inflation in the United States so conspicuous. I believe that Japan will of greater reference in various ways. II. What Will Become of Russia's Economic Reconstruction? [Nukazawa] In any case, inflation is quite serious. Today, the dollar has risen much higher than 1,000 rubles, and it is apparently rumored in Moscow that it may go as high as 3,000 rubles between this fall and the yearend. The price of coal, which was deregulated on 1 July, instantly doubled, and is expected to rise six- to eightfold in the near future. Incidentally, the coal miner's monthly wage will rise to about 400,000 rubles or 10 times the general wage. With the price of coal climbing, the prices of steel and other principal raw materials will rise drastically. In terms of dollar prices, they will surpass international prices. Therefore, if we calculate in reverse to correspond with the international prices, the ruble will drop considerably. Because the central bank is granting state subsidies rampantly, inflation is fed constantly. If this continues, one cannot afford to conduct business selling rubles in Moscow. I feel that, before talking about a market economy, there is a need to expel inflation. [Nukazawa] When I hear about coal, steel, and subsidies, I am reminded of the postwar declining industries. After the war, Japan restricted foreign exchange transactions and accumulated foreign currency. However, present-day Russia has adopted no measures regarding foreign currency and its capital is constantly flowing out. For example, there is reportedly $400 billion worth of dollar deposits in New York banks. Is it not rather strange that it wants to borrow money from foreign countries while leaving that money there? [Rokugawa] Actually, the Russian authorities themselves are unable to control and regulate the foreign deposits of residents in Russia. In Japan also, there are requests received by the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan [Zenginkyo] not to accept such deposits. Based on this, Zenginkyo reportedly has sent written requests to its subsidiaries not to accept the establishing of accounts with such mysterious Russian funds. [Nukazawa] In Japan since the war, the government has strictly supervised the recovery of export payments through the standard settlement system, checking how, when, and how much payment is made during export, and where it is destined. However, Russia is unable to do this. [Aiko] They cannot do it unless they regulate by linking the outflow of goods and the flow of funds. The transactions are based on formal contracts, and they will be able to regulate to some extent if they check the method of payment at the time of the contract, and if a bureaucratic system functions to enable the bank to back the entire payment. However, under the present circumstances, they are unable to do so. Recovery of Ruble's External Convertibility Still in Future [Rokugawa] In the case of exports to Russia, we dare not export without prepayment or a form of barter, but bartering is banned in Japan. Therefore, it is conducted under a quasi-barter form of advance export by the Russian side. From the standpoint of the ruble's convertibility, both Russia and East Europe are confusing the convertibility of the nonresident account with the resident account. Japan and the West European nations have assiduously worked to promote exports after the war, thereby accumulating foreign currency, and have not recognized foreign currency holdings by the residents. They also took considerable time to liberalize overseas travel. Once a sufficient amount of foreign currency was accumulated, they first restored the convertibility of accounts for nonresidents and eventually the accounts for residents. On the other hand, Russia left it up to the desires of the masses. It did not adopt a policy of concentrating foreign currency, but first recognized foreign currency holdings by the residents. Despite the external nonconvertibility of their currency, they restored domestic convertibility between residents within Russia. Consequently, their hard-earned foreign currency flowed outside, with the volume reportedly totaling $16 billion or even $20 billion. Therefore, I believe that it should induct comprehensieve foreign exchange management, concentrate the foreign currency holdings of the residents in the central bank, and then liberalize. It is surprising that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have completely overlooked guidance in these respects concerning foreign exchange policy. Therefore, restoration of the external convertibility of the ruble is still far in the future. [Kawake] The present cabinet is implementing to a considerable degree two policies that could not be implemented during the leadership of former Premier Kaidar--i.e. tranquilizing the hyperinflation and controlling the central bank. By beginning to cope seriously with these aspects, Russia is seen as finally lining up on the starting line. Certainly, its energy is extremely cheap by international standards. Therefore, if Russia itself upgrades its system to cope with the extremely difficult task of curbing inflation while raising the prices of its energy, I believe it will be important, first of all, for everyone to give support and offer advice. Black Markets, But No Corporations [Nukazawa] Here and there on the street corners in Moscow are seen foreign exchange trucks which are remodeled buses. The people all exchange rubles for marks, francs, and dollars, and they deposit the foreign currencies. It is regrettable when the people have a low regard for the currency of their own country. The foreign exchange brokers, like the postwar black market operators (in Japan), reportedly buy and accumulate coupons which they trade for stock shares to be issued when the national enterprises are privatized. Can sound privatization be realized under such conditions? In postwar Japan black marketeers were rampant, but the established enterprises also remained. In today's Russia, there are black markets but no corporate enterprises. How the other advanced nations will support them in this respect is important. If Russia's market economization makes progress, there may be a stage when further privatization of the national enterprises will be attempted. At this stage, however, like postwar Japan and Europe, or like the United States following the Great Depression, it should aim for economic reconstruction with the public sector as the business core. Regarding the mode of management, it could probably bring in enterpreneurs from Japan and the United States, and let them take over management temporarily. Outlook of Japan-Russia Economic Relations [Nukazawa] Regarding Japan-Russia economic relations, unpaid trade payments and the freezing of foreign investment accounts are two problems that weigh heavily and became the focus of attention at the recent conference. [Yamashita] The Russian side said that they will be reviewed by a committee chaired by Deputy Chairman Shokhin. Although they say that it will suffice to pay foreign debts with $150 billion worth of foreign currency credits, it is rather difficult for the money to be returned when the debtors are nations like Cuba, Vietnam, and Angola. It is a hopeless situation to be told all of a sudden that "your debtor is Cuba," or "your debtor is Angola." [Kawake] We would hope that the Shokhin committee will carefully review the method of solving the problem of unpaid foreign currency. However, I do not think the Japanese could go in to participate in the discussion and suggest ways to go about it. The position of the Japan side of the committee is to urge and remind, but not to formulate concrete plans. [Nukazawa] Regarding the clarification of authority and the transfer of authority to the regions, which were mentioned during the era of the Japan-Soviet economic committee, did you feel that there has been some progress? Until now, progress was made when the talks were held in Moscow, but recently nothing could be achieved in Moscow alone. As to whom the talks should be held with, it is the respective enterprises or the local governments. However, they have no legal backing. In effect, they have no authority. In other words, adequate talks cannot be held in Moscow and, although concrete talks can be held at the regional level, they have no authority. Therefore, I believe that the direction of the debate by the present constitutional council is extremely important. If the constitution works out smoothly, not only will the president's authority be enhanced to some extent, but the regional authority will also be clarified. I believe it is important for them to first form the framework. [Aiko] A major problem is that it is not clear who the competent persons in charge are. Regarding the 200 or 300 presidential decrees also, it is not stipulated at all who the implementers are, or whether there are any punitive measures, and we have heard that no one bothers to obey the presidential decrees. [Nukazawa] To begin with, there is apparently no concept that the infrastructure is the government's responsibility. Perhaps they think that everything can be done by the stock company. They must clarify the infrastructure of the public sector as being responsible, because the basic role of the public sector is based on social capital. They are mistaken in thinking that such-and-such a port or harbor is the responsibility of such-and-such a company. [Kawake] For example, when considering joint ventures, if the company is asked to build not only a pulp plant but also roads and a port, it will not be done. [Nukazawa] There is a similar problem with respect to Vietnam. If we say we cannot invest because there is no infrastructure, they say: "Well, Japan can build an infrastructure for us also." [Yamashita] At least it is inconceivable for a private company in Japan to provide such assistance. Unless there is clearly an economic profit on this side, a private company cannot do it. As you know, the time span is sometimes long and sometimes short, and it cannot be done unless there is an overall plus for the company. Japan Must Work for Far East Development [Nukazawa] It depends on the direction of the constitution, but if a certain degree of authority is transferred to the regions and autonomy is increased, there will probably be a arising mood in Japan to work for resources development in the Far East. [Kawake] Regions with expansive resources that can be reached by aircraft concentrate on the regions eastward from Siberia and Irkutsk, and east of the Ural region. The Western nations are making rapid inroads into western Russia, and entry by Japan will not make a conspicuous mark. [Aiko] It is something else if there is no potential in the Far East, but there is a potential there in its own right. If Russia does nothing and lets the status quo stand, I feel that Russia's Far East region will become a center of competition between China and Korea. If Russia itself has a certain amount of strategy policywise for economic development, there is a possibility that more Russians will be transplanted there. Thus, for example, Russians who find life unbearable in Central Asia and the Baltic countries will be given opportunities for employment, and I believe it will be very good politically. [Rokugawa] Japan's support should be a more visible form of support rather than through the G-7 or IMF. Particularly regarding the Far East region, ports and harbors come first. Among those related to the development of the Tumen River in East Asia, if we make efforts to improve the port facilities in such places as Sarbino [as translitered], Vanino, and Sovetskaya Gavan, they will stand out. Or, in view of the deterioration of the Siberian Railway, I believe there are many things we can do, such as improving the infrastructure of railway transportation. Or, since it is a cold region, if we construct something like the Tokyo Dome with a wholesale market, a supermarket and an amusement center inside, it would probably be greatly appreciated. [Yamashita] Without transportation, construction requiring a huge volume of materials would not be feasible in European Russia. In that case, products that use less materials and are easily transportable must be produced in European Russia. In that sense, the upgrading of transport routes is urgently needed. [Nukazawa] If the Far East builds a solid position as a resource supply source for Japan, it will be very good for Japan's security. A Realistic Investment Plan [Kawake] After all, Japan itself should set priorities regarding investment, trade and various development plans. Russia is asking for projects worh tens of billions of yen. It would be more realistic to take an approach toward small-scale and really necessary projects, or to figure out how the present facilities can be remodeled. [Rokugawa] When we received a request for a survey on the conversion of the Bulgarian military facilities to civilian use, we asked Juki Corporation, the sewing machine maker which has experience in this aspect, to conduct a review of various local surveys, we found, for instance, that it is technically feasible to produce 100,000 pieces of machines and equipment annually. However, they say that they can sell 10,000 pieces, leaving 90,000 pieces which they want us to sell overseas. However, we do not have the confidence to sell 90,000 pieces outside of Bulgaria. Stymied by this, the idea was dropped. It is quite a task when production is not possible without our thinking about marketing and sales for them. Therefore, regarding conversion of military facilities to civilian use, they should not talk about such large-scale projects as artificial satellites, but utilize the munitions plants in the environs of Khabarovsk. For example, their casting technology is reputed to be extremely good, so if Japan consigns production of mechanical equipment and parts like flanges and buys up the entire volume, or initially has them produce simple communications facilities on a small scale, or seeks cooperation on conversion of simple military facilities to civilian use, I believe Russia will appreciate it. Conversion of high-level military facilities on a grand scale is too costly and extremely difficult to materialize, and it is clear from the standpoint of productivity and cost that their products cannot possibly compete with the products of Europe and the United States. [Kawake] I believe that, in terms of the present relations with Russia, it is important to understand the present conditions. We must go over there to conduct fact-finding surveys in order to formulate some kind of concrete plan. Further feasibility studies are also a prerequisite. [Rokugawa] When we went to a munitions plant in the Vladivostok suburbs where they are working on general telecommunications called "Radio Pribor" [phonetic], we were told that we were the 98th company from Japan. It indicates how many companies in Japan are conducting studies. They probably all investigated and found it difficult to handle, so they gave up. [Nukazawa] Russia has broad territorial lands and is rich in rsources, so the potentials are great. However, it is deterred by its legacies from the past, so it is probably necessary for us to advise them and make smooth circulation possible. However, it is difficult to know where to begin. Image of Russia as a Great Power Must Be Dropped [Yamashita] The problem is that the Russian side is not very receptive to advice. They probably believe that they are smart enough. In any case, all they want from Japan now is money. [Aiko] When we listen to people in charge of projects for overseas advancement, I believe the greatest point in a minus sense is pride. Where pride exists, the situation is difficult. Once that pride is put aside, the rest seems to go smoothly. In a region which has previously produced TV sets, there is a fixed concept of TV production and, if we try to introduce a completely different method, there is terrific resistance. However, in a region where they produce nothing except farm products, there is no resistance, but a receptive attitude toward new technology as is. In that sense, because Russia has a high-tech industry in its own right and also a high level of technical education, it is probably difficult for them to ask for advice. [Rokugawa] As a historical and diplomatic power, Russia has looked down on Japan for a long time and, unless such power consciousness is dropped, I do not believe that they can humble themselves and ask for advice. [Kawake] The Russian side approaches us by asking whether we have an interest in their project. They do not say what they would like to do, but what they want us to do. Because they demand what our interests are, it is difficult for us to reply. [Nukazawa] Even when we go to East Europe and Vietnam, they say that many people come from Japan to see, but the talks are not fruitful at all. Do you mean that the reason is on the other side? [Rokugawa] The Japanese side is very cautious, as you know. We take pains to check before we invest. [Kawake] The Americans often tell us that the Japanese are not very decisive. However, once we decide, we follow through. According to the Russians, the Americans invest very quickly, but they also pull out quickly. Therefore, each side has its merits and shortcomings. [Yamashita] From Russia's viewpoint, they receive numerous inquiries from America. [Nukazawa] That point is important. Unless they understand the difference, they get the impression that we go over merely to browse and do not buy anything. Take Time and Start From the Feasible Aspects [Kawake] Judging from my experience of having been interned in Sakhalin, the Soviet system is bad, but the Russians people are extremely nice, once you get to know them. Therefore, I believe that it is vital to build human relations. However, the remaining vestiges of the old system obstruct the forming of human relations. [Rokugawa] It will be better appreciated by the other side if we help them when they need it. After all, Japan has the most in terms of personnel, money, goods and technology. I feel that, at this stage, it will be more profitable for Japan's future if we start by giving support and adopt the posture of solving various issues including the problem of the Northern Territories. [Yamashita] In such a case, based on Japan's present situation, information on problems of the Far East region is received relatively easily. Therefore, it is more practical to begin with the solution of such issues, and it will probably be more effective vis-a-vis the people of the region also. It is with such an intent that we are offering railway passenger cars for use in Sakhalin. [Rokugawa] Also, it is a problem when they rampantly throw nuclear wastes and bombshells into the Japan Sea. There should be some change in order to eradicate such actions. [Kawake] There are definitely problems in Japan-Russia relations. In any case, it is a nation that can be reached by plane in just over an hour, so I believe that, basically, emphasis should be placed on our relations with them. At the same time, it is of course important to take time and to start with projects which are feasible. [Aiko] Apart from economics and politics, Russia is a very nice country. [Nukazawa] Certainly, it is a wonderful country in terms of its literature, music, ballet and sports. Also, the individual Russian is a warm person with humane touches. Thank you all very much.
