Manfred Woerner, NATO's secretary general, described the meeting as "historical and a big step forward toward the next century." U.S. President Bill Clinton's current visit to Europe, his first since taking office, has attracted as much public attention as the summit itself. The reason may be that people are eager to know: what changes will occur in the transatlantic security alliance now that the Cold War has ended? The statements made by Clinton in Brussels demonstrate that the U.S.-European relationship remains generally harmonious. They share common views on many important issues concerning NATO's future and Europe's new security arrangements. During the summit, the 16 NATO leaders agreed that the Western military alliance remains at the center of European security. They endorsed the concept of building multinational task forces involving NATO and non-NATO nations -- the common joint task forces (CJTF) -- intended to make NATO more flexible in dealing with regional conflicts both inside and outside Europe. Within this framework, NATO will provide military resources to European allies, if necessary. The leaders also adopted proposals for establishing partnerships with former Warsaw pact countries. Some former Warsaw Pact countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, are eager to join NATO. But the proposal adopted, known as the "partnership for peace" plan, falls short of offering these countries either a timetable for membership or security guarantees. The NATO leaders instead have characterized NATO expansion as "an evolutionary process." The summit was, however, dominated by a more urgent issue -- the war in Bosnia. The leaders reaffirmed that NATO is ready to carry out air strikes in parts of Bosnia to break the Serb strangulation of Sarajevo if the United Nations requests such action. They believe that if NATO continues to do nothing in Bosnia, its credibility would be seriously damaged. In any case, the summit was a great success for the alliance and the consensus reached on almost all issues demonstrates transatlantic unity. However, it must also be noted that the summit reflects a change in this relationship, having to do with reshaping European defence burdens in the post-Cold War period. In this prospect, the European allies will have to assume a greater burden. It is clear that the "partnership for peace" plan and the concept of establishing the CJTF, which indeed will usher in "a new period" for NATO, also means that the United States will do less for European defense and security, and Europe will have to rely largely on itself. Regardless of any commitments on Clinton's part, the Europeans know very well that the U.S. will not treat issues of European security the same it did during the Cold War. The U.S. will not easily allow its 100,000 troops deployed in Europe to become involved in European conflicts. In the Yugoslav crisis, for example, the U.S. has argued that the conflict there is "a European problem." It may be assumed that if the same conflict erupted during the Cold War years, the U.S. would not have remained a bystander. With the end of the Cold War, NATO is entering a new era, and it is impossible for the transatlantic relationship to remain unchanged. Both the U.S. and its European allies are well aware of this, but are reluctant to point it out.
