FR941213-1-00021 FR941213-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Parts 219 and 252 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY 48 CFR Part 5452 DLA Acquisition Regulation; Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns AGENCY: Defense Logistics Agency, Defense. ACTION: Proposed rule and requests for comments. SUMMARY: The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 48 CFR Parts 219 and 252 provide regulatory coverage incorporating two standard clauses giving small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns a ten percent evaluation preference in competitive acquisitions where award is based on price and price related factors. The Defense Logistics Agency Regulation (DLAR) 48 CFR parts 5419 and 5452, as proposed in the Federal Register of April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21954) would provide regulatory coverage incorporating two nonstandard clauses in domestic bulk petroleum solicitations and contracts concerning small business set-asides and evaluation preference for SDB concerns into DLAR on a permanent basis. These two DFARS and two DLAR clauses concern preferential consideration for SDBs under small business set-asides and the ten percent evaluation preference for SDB concerns on unrestricted procurements. Comments are hereby requested on the proposed DFARS and DLAR coverage, which reduces the SDB preference from ten to five percent. The proposed coverage is being published in the Federal Register because it is expected to have an effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DLA, and in some cases, may have a modest impact on contractors. DATES: Comments on the proposed DFARS and DLAR rules must be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before January 12, 1995 to be considered in the formulation of the final rules. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to Defense Logistics Agency, Directorate of Procurement, Contract Policy Team (AQPLL), Ms. Melody Reardon, Cameron Station, Alexandria, Virginia 22306&hyph;6100. FAX: (703) 274&hyph;0310. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Melody Reardon, Defense Logistics Agency, AQPLL (703) 274&hyph;6431. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Section 1207 of Public Law 99&hyph;661, as amended, sets a goal for the Department of Defense to award five percent of contract performance dollars to SDB concerns, historically black colleges, and universities, and minority institutions. To achieve this goal, the law permits the payment of contract prices up to 10 percent above fair market price. The implementing DFARS coverage includes an across-the-board evaluation factor of 10 percent. Offers from non-SDB concerns on unrestricted procurements are increased by adding an evaluation factor of ten percent to their offers (evaluation preference). On partial small business set-asides, the DFARS permits award to SDB concerns at prices up to ten percent above the highest non-set-aside award price (preferential consideration). Decreasing the percentage from ten to five percent will save taxpayers at least $3 million a year, while continuing to provide SDB firms an opportunity to participate in fuel procurements and allowing DLA to continue meeting the 5 percent SDB award goal. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This deviation may have a modest impact on a few SDB fuel suppliers. However, the proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. since the projected SDB award percentages in the two most affected fuels programs should only be decreased by one-tenth of a percent or less. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS sections will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite this case in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed rules do not impose any reporting or record keeping requirements that require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq . List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 219, 252, 5419, and 5452 Government procurement. Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR chapter 2 and proposed chapter 54 (as proposed in the Federal Register of April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21954)) be amended as follows:
