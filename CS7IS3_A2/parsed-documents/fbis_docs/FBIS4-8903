Robert Skerjanc reports from the news conference: [Begin recording] [Skerjanc] The SDSS president, Janez Jansa, for this anticipated decision of the party council, put forward three basic reasons for why the party's presidency proposed that the SDSS leave the coalition: [Jansa] The first reason is a gross violation of the coalition agreement, not merely in this latest case when the prime minister proposed my replacement, but gross violation of the coalition agreement from December onwards. The second reason for our departure from the coalition and this decision is a fact that the work of the majority in the coalition and the government was geared to the creation of conditions that not only did not prevent corruption, but created circumstances that actually facilitated it. The third reason for our departure from the coalition is entirely political, namely, the balance of power has changed following the unification, that is to say, merger or drowning of the Democrats, the Eco-Greens, and the Socialists into this big Liberal Democracy. [Skerjanc] The party council yesterday also made an important decision by which it authorized the party presidency and its president to start negotiations with the Slovene Peoples' Party, the Christian Democrats, and the Greens of Slovenia, or, if the Christian Democrats will not leave the coalition, the National Democrats, about the formation of a wide political coalition whose aim would be a democratic and socially and morally just Slovenia. The coalition plans to appear seriously at the local elections. In case the Slovene Christian Democrats would leave the coalition, the SDSS also sees the need to hold extraordinary parliamentary elections, which could be organized simultaneously with the local elections. Jansa also spoke about the anti-corruption rally scheduled for tomorrow. He said that the Christian Democratic Party took part in its organization too, which is, according to him, a good omen for future negotiations about the joint coalition. [end recording]
