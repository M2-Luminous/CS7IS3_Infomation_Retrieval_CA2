FR941207-0-00137 FR941207-0-00022 108. We continue to believe that our existing rules, which allow rural telephone companies to obtain broadband PCS licenses that are geographically partitioned from larger PCS service areas, will provide a viable opportunity for these entities to successfully acquire PCS licenses and offer service to rural areas. We are confident that the partitioning system articulated in the Fifth Report and Order satisfies the directive of Congress to ensure that rural telephone companies have the opportunity to provide PCS services to all areas of the country, including rural areas. In addition, we believe that the other benefits afforded to designated entities, combined with the cellular attribution threshold for rural telephone companies adopted in Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314, will further ensure that rural areas have expedient access to PCS services. 109. We disagree with MEANS/SDN's contention that modifications to our consortia provisions are needed to fulfill Congress' mandate that rural telephone companies have an opportunity to acquire PCS licenses. As we noted in the Fifth Report and Order, we expect that virtually all rural telephone company consortia will be eligible to bid on licenses in Blocks C and F without competition from ``deep pocket'' bidders. Additionally, if consortia members qualify as small businesses, the Commission will provide the bidding credit and installment payment provisions extended to similarly-situated applicants. Accordingly, we believe it is unnecessary to permit passive equity investments in rural telephone company consortia, as MEANS/SDN requests. Indeed we do not extend similar benefits to small, non-rural telephone businesses that form bidding consortia. 110. We also reject TEC's and MEANS/SDN's proposal to extend bidding credits to rural telephone companies even if they are not small businesses or owned by minorities and/or women. We continue to believe that existing benefits for rural telephone companies will allow them to effectively compete for licenses that serve rural territories. In addition to the partitioning and consortia provisions, we also note that rural telephone companies qualify for significant financial benefits from the Rural Electrification Administration and the Universal Service Fund, which as BET suggests, adequately compensates these entities for the lack of bidding credits. Additionally, we note that our bidding credits were specifically tailored to address the discriminatory market barriers faced by women and minority-owned entities. We concur with BET's assessment that rural telephone companies do not face the same kinds of barriers raising capital. 111. We note that most, if not all, rural telephone companies meet the entrepreneurs' block size standards and are permitted to bid directly on entrepreneurs' blocks licenses. To the extent that a rural telephone company does not qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks, however, we disagree that it will be forced to negotiate with other licensees that may not be willing to sell their broadband PCS interests in the from of partitioned licenses or other ownership arrangements. On the contrary, we believe that other applicants and licensees will find rural telephone companies attractive entities to negotiate with, because of the efficiencies associated with rural telephone companies existing infrastructure. Additionally, since a licensee will be permitted to assign a portion of its license to a rural telephone company without violating the transfer and holding requirements, we expect that licensees will actively solicit participation by rural telephone companies. For the reasons discussed above, we continue to believe that our existing scheme, which is narrowly tailored to satisfy Congress' mandate, will provide rural telephone companies with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the provision of broadband PCS services and further the objective of rapidly getting service to rural areas. 112. Finally, we dismiss concerns raised by TEC and Hicks and Ragland concerning the permissible size of a rural telephone company's service area. We addressed these concerns in the Fifth Report and Order and concluded that a partitioned area containing no more than twice the population of that portion of a rural telephone company's wireline service area provides a reasonable presumption of a permissible service territory. However, we agree that rural telephone companies will require some flexibility in fashioning a partitioned service area and thereby affirm our prior conclusion that a strict rule is not needed. Aggregation of and Holding Period for the Entrepreneurs' Block Licenses Single Entity Purchase Limit 113. To ensure that C and F block licenses are disseminated among a wide variety of applicants, our rules as adopted in the Fifth Report and Order, restrict the number of licenses within the entrepreneurs' block that a single entity may win at auction. Specifically, we impose a limitation that no single entity may win more than 10 percent of the licenses available in the entrepreneurs' blocks, or 98 licenses. We indicated that the 98 licenses may all be in frequency block C or all in frequency block F, or in some combination of the two blocks. We observed that such a limit would ensure that at least 10 winning bidders enjoy the benefits of the entrepreneurs' blocks, while also allowing bidders to effectuate aggregation strategies that include large numbers of licenses and extensive geographic coverage. We provided that the limit would apply only to the total number of licenses that may be won at auction on the C and F blocks. Furthermore, we indicated that for purposes of this restriction we will consider licenses to be won by the same entity if an applicant (or other entity) that controls, or has the power to control licenses won at the auction, controls or has the power to control another license at the auction. 114. On reconsideration, the Small Business PCS Association (SBPCS) recommends that the maximum number of entrepreneurs' block licenses purchased by a single entity be limited to licenses that cover no more than a total of 10 percent of the national population, or approximately 25 million ``pops.'' SBPCS expresses concern that the existing limit does not provide for enough diversity of ownership since it would allow a single entity to acquire the top 98 BTA licenses on the 30 MHz entrepreneurs' blocks.
