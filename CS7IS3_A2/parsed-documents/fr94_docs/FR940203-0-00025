FR940203-0-00025 FR940203-0-00009 Amendments to Subpart G to Part 207 Section 207.90 currently indicates that subpart G implements Article 1904 of the CFTA Implementation Act. The amendment to this section expands the scope of subpart G to cover procedures and regulations for implementation of Article 1904 of the NAFTA. Section 207.91 provides definitions of terms used in subpart G. The definitions of ``Agreement'', ``Article 1904 Rules'' and ``FTA'' have been amended to reflect the change from the CFTA to the NAFTA. The amended definitions also reflect that, in the event that the United States or Canada withdraws from the NAFTA, the CFTA would still apply to the United States and Canada, and that these rules would apply to binational panel reviews between those two countries. A definition has been added for ``ECC Rules'', and references to these rules have been added to the definition of ``counsel'' and to the general provision incorporating definitions set forth in the Article 1904 and ECC Rules. Definitions have been added for ``Free Trade Area Country,'' ``Mexican Secretary,'' and ``Relevant FTA Secretary,'' reflecting the provisions of the NAFTA and the implementing legislation. Specific cross-references to 1904 Panel and ECC Rules have been deleted from the definition of ``Notice of Appearance'' to avoid confusion that may result from subsequent renumbering of the 1904 Panel and ECC Rules. Finally, the definition of the term ``Persons'' has been changed to ``Person'' for reasons of clarity. Section 207.93 covers the protection of proprietary information during panel and committee proceedings. Subsections (b)(4), (b)(6), (c)(2)(ii)(E), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(v) have been amended to include references to the Mexican Government, government officials or Secretary where appropriate. Subsection (c)(4)(B) has been amended to reference the ECC Rules as well as the Article 1904 Rules. Specific cross-references have been deleted, however, to avoid confusion that might result from subsequent renumbering of these rules. Subsections (c)(4), (c)(5), (f)(1) and (f)(2) have been amended to change the number of copies of documents filed with the Commission Secretary from six (or seven in the case of subsection (c)(5)(ii)(B)) to three. Subsection (d) has been corrected to indicate that only panel members in reviews conducted under the CFTA should send a countersigned copy of their administrative protective orders to the United States Secretary to notify the Secretary that he or she may transmit documents containing proprietary information. Annex 1901.2(7)(a) of the NAFTA requires that panelists sign an application for a protective order, but unlike Annex 1901.2(7)(a) of the CFTA, does not require panelists to sign a copy of the protective order itself. Subsection (d)(2)(ii) has been amended to make explicit that the Secretary may deny an application for a protective order by informing the applicant of the reasons for such denial within fourteen days of the Secretary's receipt of an application therefor. Subsection (f)(5) has also been revised to indicate that the Commission Secretary is required to provide the United States Secretary with a copy of any amendment, modification, or revocation of a protective order issued during panel proceedings. Section 207.94 addresses the protection of privileged information during Panel and Committee proceedings. The text has been corrected to specifically reference Committees as well as Panels. The term ``Secretary'' has been modified to ``Commission Secretary'' for clarity purposes. Section 207.100 covers sanctions for prohibited acts under these regulations. The Tariff Act, as amended by section 403(c) of the CFTA Implementation Act, authorized the Commission to impose sanctions against any person who is found by the Commission to have violated, or induced violation of, the terms of a protective order issued by the Commission for CFTA purposes. 19 U.S.C. 1677f(f)(4). Section 412(b)(8) of the NAFTA Implementation Act amends this provision to exclude from its coverage judges sitting on courts created under article III of the United States Constitution who are appointed to NAFTA binational panels or committees. The rules contained in §§207.100&hyph;207.120 address the Commission's procedures for imposing sanctions under the statutory provision added by the CFTA Implementation Act. The same procedures will apply with respect to the imposition of sanctions for violations of the terms of protective orders issued by the Commission for NAFTA purposes. Subsection 207.100(a) has been amended, however, to reflect the statutory exclusion of federal judges from the persons who may be subject to sanctions under the Commission's regulations. Subsection 207.102(b) addresses Commission determinations on recommendations made by the Office of Unfair Import Investigations on the initiation of sanction proceedings. A reference to ``OUII'' in this subsection has been changed to the ``Office of Unfair Import Investigations'' because ``OUII'' is not a defined term in these rules. Subsection 207.102(d) currently addresses, among other matters, the situations in which it may be appropriate to request the authorized agency of Canada to initiate proceedings under Canadian law on the basis of an alleged violation of the protective order. By changing the references to ``Canada'' to ``another Free Trade Agreement country,'' this provision now will provide for the referral of an investigation to Mexico or to Canada, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Section 207.120, which provides for public notice of sanctions has been amended to provide for notice to appropriate Mexican, as well as United States and Canadian, agencies.
