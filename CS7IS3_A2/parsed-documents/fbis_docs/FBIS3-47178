Soledad] [Text] The Philippine Government has lifted all forms of trade restrictions against South Africa, the Department of Trade and Industry announced yesterday. Trade and Industry Undersecretary Tomas I. Alcantara said the resumption of trade ties with South Africa will jack up the exchange of trade between the two countries to $200 million this year from the existing cap of $50 million. He added that Filipino businessmen can also use South Africa as an entry point for exports to central African countries, adding that Filipino exporters can already go into oleochemicals, garments, electronics, and software. South Africa can then ship in its exports of steel, coal, phosphate rock, and capital equipment. Moreover, the lifting of the trade embargo would also mean the flow of South African investments into the country, said Mr. Alcantara. [passage omitted]
