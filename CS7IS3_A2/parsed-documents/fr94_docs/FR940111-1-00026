FR940111-1-00026 FR940111-1-00008 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 17 CFR Parts 1, 30, 33, and 190 Risk Disclosure by Futures Commission Merchants, Introducing Brokers, Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors to Customers; Bankruptcy Disclosure AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is requesting public comment on the text of a draft two page generic risk disclosure statement currently being discussed among various international futures regulators that potentially could be used to meet the risk disclosure requirements for both domestic and foreign commodity futures and commodity option products subject to regulation by the CFTC. As contemplated by Commission rule 1.55(c), the text of the generic risk disclosure statement is being published, in part, to further these discussions relative to the development of one document to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements of the CFTC and such foreign jurisdictions as may choose to adopt its language for use in their jurisdictions. Based on the comments received, the CFTC may be better able to provide input to these discussions and to consider rule amendments to permit the substitution of this statement under rule 1.55(c) and certain other rules for firms doing cross-border business. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before February 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581. Reference should be made to ``Generic Risk Disclosure_Advance Notice.'' FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jane C. Kang, Esq., or Robert H. Rosenfeld, Esq., Division of Trading and Markets, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581; telephone (202) 254&hyph;8955. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 30, 1993, the Commission, among other things, adopted final rule amendments to Commission rule 1.55(b) which simplified the risk disclosure process by consolidating the risk disclosure statements applicable to domestic futures transactions and foreign futures and foreign commodity options transactions in rules 1.55 and 30.6, respectively. 1 The use of such a statement was intended to greatly simplify the risk disclosure process for U.S. firms conducting cross-border business. 1 58 FR 17496 (April 5, 1993). These amendments also: _eliminated the requirement that the rule 190.10 disclosure regarding treatment of non-cash margin be acknowledged by the customer; _clarified that the rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement may be included in a booklet of account opening documents, provided it appears on the cover page or following the cover page of such booklet; _provided that the Commission may approve a risk disclosure statement that has been approved by a foreign jurisdiction or foreign SRO for use in lieu of the Commission-required statement; _permitted the use of a single acknowledgement for rule 1.55 and 33.7 statements and other elections, subject to specified conditions; and _simplified the disclosure requirements regarding the bulk transfer of accounts. In response to Commission suggestions in the notice of proposed rulemaking concerning rule 1.55 that it also was considering the development of a ``plain language'' options disclosure statement, 2 some commenters supported that course of action and further suggested that the Commission not only shorten the rule 33.7 disclosure statement applicable to exchange-traded commodity option transactions but also consolidate it with the new combined domestic futures and foreign futures and foreign commodity options statement. In response, the Commission noted that certain international regulators were endeavoring to develop a single risk disclosure statement that could be used in multiple jurisdictions to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements applicable to domestic and cross-border transactions in futures and options. The Commission stated that if a universal statement were to be developed, it would consider permitting the use of such a statement in lieu of the new consolidated rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement as well as the options risk disclosure statement required by current rule 33.7. 3 Under amended rule 1.55(c), the Commission may permit the substituted use of a risk disclosure statement approved by a foreign regulatory or self-regulatory organization if the Commission determines that such statement reasonably is calculated to provide the disclosure required by Commission rule 1.55(b). 4 2 See 57 FR 46101, 46108 (October 7, 1992). 3 58 FR at 17497 and 17502 (April 5, 1993). 4 58 FR at 17503&hyph;17504 (April 5, 1993). For some time, a working group 5 of international regulators worked towards developing a single risk disclosure statement which could satisfy the risk disclosure requirements applicable, in the multiple participating jurisdictions, to domestic and cross-border transactions in futures and options (``generic disclosure statement''). 6 Following extensive discussions, the draft generic disclosure statement set forth herein was developed and the draft text was passed to those regulatory authorities (including the CFTC) who were interested in taking the work forward. The text remains subject to final discussion and approval by the regulatory authorities of the participating jurisdictions. 5 The working group was composed of representatives from Canada (Ontario Securities Commission), France (the French Conseil du Marche a Terme), Switzerland (the Swiss Ministry of Finance), the United Kingdom (the U.K. Securities and Investments Board, which chaired the working group), and the United States (the CFTC). 6 See 58 FR at 17496, 17497 and 17502 (April 5, 1993).
