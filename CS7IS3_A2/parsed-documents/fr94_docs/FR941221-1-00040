FR941221-1-00040 FR941221-1-00012 (D) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous material; or (E) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a package or container which is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation of hazardous material. This proposed rule concerns the classification, packaging, labeling, and handling of hazardous material, among other covered subjects. If adopted as final, this rule would preempt any State, local, or Indian tribe requirements concerning these subjects unless the non-Federal requirements are ``substantively the same'' (see 49 CFR 107.202(d)) as the Federal requirements. Federal law (49 U.S.C. 5125(b)(2)) provides that if DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects after November 16, 1990, DOT must determine and publish in the Federal Register the effective date of Federal preemption. That effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date of issuance of the final rule and not later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA requests comments on what the effective date of Federal preemption should be for the requirements in this proposed rule that concern covered subjects. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule would revise the requirements for infectious substances and regulated medical waste contained in the HMR by narrowing the scope of these provisions. The proposed changes in this rule would provide relief to shippers, carriers of infectious substances and regulated medical waste, and some packaging manufacturers, some of whom are small entities (e.g., medical clinics, governmental jurisdictions, and not-for-profit organizations). Therefore, I certify that this proposal will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is subject to modification as a result of a review of comments received in response to this proposal. D. Paperwork Reduction Act There are no new information collection requirements in this proposed rule. E. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) A regulation identifier number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each year. The RIN numbers contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross-reference this action with the Unified Agenda.
