Security Council [UNSC] to adopt a resolution imposing sanctions against North Korea. The agreement came in a 30-minute telephone conversation from 7:15 P.M. Moscow time. The call was made by Clinton in Rome, where the U.S. President is attending events commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-day. President Kim received the call as he wound up his four-day state visit to Russia. The United States has completed preparations for a better and firmer defense of South Korea, Clinton told Kim, according to presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. Chu said he could not disclose further details of the presidential conversation. Prior to talking with Kim, Clinton called Russian President Boris Yeltsin and told him that the North Korean nuclear row will now have to be dealt with by the U.N. Security Council. Details of the Clinton-Yeltsin call were not disclosed either, but the U.S. President was understood to have phoned Yeltsin in order to secure Russian support for the Security Council plans. They also reportedly discussed taking concerted steps between the United States and South Korea along with Japan and China.
