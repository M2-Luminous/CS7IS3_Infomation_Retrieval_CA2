Tomorrow, after presenting its report in Parliament, the CEC will finish the activity, stated its president Nicolae Timofte. Dumitru Motpan, PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova] leader, told BASAPRESS that the first Parliamentary session will probably be opened by the most senior member, Artiom Lazarev (the Block of the Socialist Party and "Unitate-Edinstvo" Movement). First of all, the new Parliamentary Speaker, the Vice-Speakers and the permanent commissions will be titled; after that, the Parliamentary guidelines will be announced, said Motpan. Projects of the Constitution and of the special juridical status for the Eastern and Southern regions will be debated, along with economic questions. The PDAM will propose ex-speaker Petru Lucinschi for Speaker and for Premier, Andrei Sangheli, the present premier, said Motpan. Valeriu Senic, leader of the Socialist Party, declared to BASAPRESS that his faction has already proposed for the first session a draft decision for suspending the Governmental decision on the linguistic attestation. In Senic's view, priority will be given to the ratification of the CIS Economic Union document and to regional problems in Eastern and Southern Moldova. Alexandru Mosanu, leader of the Block of Peasants and Intellectuals, told BASAPRESS that his faction will insist on the adoption of a new agenda of the session reflecting the crucial priorities; such problems as the granting of a special status to Dniestr cannot be solved until after the ratification of the new Constitution. The concept proposed for the forming of the new parliament with the specification "13th since the first Supreme Soviet of Moldova" is inadmissible in principle, as the Parliament elected on Friday 27th is not a constitution of the Moldovan Socialist Soviet Republic Supreme Soviet. A basic task of the opposition will be the defense of democracy and liberties which have been established and the promotion of radical reforms, already being slowed now by forces that form the Parliamentary majority, said Mosanu. Lurie Rosca, leader of the Christian Democratic Popular Front, declared that his faction will demand from the very first session efficient actions for the release of deputy Ilie Ilascu. Rosca asserted that the Parliamentary and Governmental leadership will be "monochrome," and the opposition factions will be marginalized.
