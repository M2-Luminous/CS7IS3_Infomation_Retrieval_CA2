The officials included the director-general of the agency, Mr. Bappa Jama'are, who was represented by Dr. Yusuf Dibal, Abdulkarim Mohammed Bello, Steven Ogundayo and Hyeladzie Nganjiwa. The others are Alhaji Abdullahi Yunusa, Y. Saleh, Bala Ibn Na' allah, Olusegun Roland, Jacob Idowu, Y. Bayawo, Adamu Tukur, and A. Audu. At the trial of the officials today, the prosecutor told the tribunal that Bappa Jama'are and his personal assistant, Jerry Kumbisi, could not appear before the tribunal because they are on an official tour abroad. The director of public prosecutions in the Federal Ministry of Justice, Mrs. Wonu Folami, pleaded for an adjournment of the trial of the NDLEA officials because of the ministerial enquiry set up by the Justice Ministry to look into the theft of the drug exhibits. However, the tribunal chairman, Justice Oni-Okpaku, dismissed the application saying the issue of the theft is of very high magnitude, the domestic enquiry cannot be allowed to delay proceedings. She also rejected another application by the DPP to grant bail to the suspects. Justice Oni-Okpaku later released four of the officials--Steven Ogundayo, Adamu Tukur, Alhaji Y. Saleh and Hyeladzie Nganjiwa--who only accompanied the vehicle that conveyed the burnt exhibit on Thursday. In another development, the tribunal turned down an appeal by Joe Brown Akubueze asking it to grant him one week more to enable him to secure the services of a lawyer.
