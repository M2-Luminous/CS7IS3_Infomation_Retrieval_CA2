FR940919-2-00120 FR940919-2-00047 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for a Residential Development called Bal Harbour subdivision, in Brevard County, FL AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Gen Real Estate and Management Company (Applicant), is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, (Act) as amended. The permit would authorize the take of the Florida scrub jay, Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens, a threatened species, in Brevard County, Florida, for a period of 5 years. The proposed taking is incidental to construction of # 60 single family homes including the necessary infrastructure on approximately 15.1 acres (Project), all of which contains occupied Florida scrub jay habitat to be permanently altered. The Project is called Bal Harbour, and is located along State Road A1A south of the city of Melbourne, in the Coconut Point area of Brevard County, Florida. The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP) for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). DATES: Written comments on the permit application, EA and HCP should be received on or before October 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the application, HCP, and EA may obtain a copy by writing the Service's Southeast Regional Office, Atlanta, Georgia. Documents will also be available for public inspection by appointment during normal business hours at the Regional Office, or the Jacksonville, Florida, Field Office. Written data or comments concerning the application, EA, or HCP should be submitted to the Regional Office.

Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6620 Southpoint Drive, South, Suite 310, Jacksonville, Florida 32216&hyph;0912, (telephone 904/232&hyph;2580, fax 904/232&hyph;2404). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dawn Zattau at the Jacksonville, Florida, Field Office, or Rick G. Gooch at the Atlanta, Georgia, Regional Office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida, it has been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years. The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that two families currently use the suitable habitats within the Project. The Applicant proposes to impact the territories of both families. Initial construction of roads and utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore result in death of, or injury to, scrub jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated with property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. To minimize the mitigate the impacts of the loss of 15.1 acres of scrub jay habitat, the Applicant will purchase 30.63 acres of scrub habitat known to support the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County, and provide a management endowment of $30,630 to ensure management of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed by the Applicant include control of invasive plant species from the Project, and protection of active nests, if discovered, during the nesting season. The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted, consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and no action.
