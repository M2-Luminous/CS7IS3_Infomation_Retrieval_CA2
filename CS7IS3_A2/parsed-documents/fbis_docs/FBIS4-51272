At today's press briefing, reporters from all countries focused their questions on the MFN issue. We are still waiting for the decision made by President Clinton, Wu Jianmin said, we hope that President Clinton will make a wise decision. Last year President Clinton issued an executive order linking human rights and other issues with China's MFN trading status. A year has elapsed and the choice to be made by the U.S. President and administration has attracted public attention. The Chinese side has always maintained that trade should not be linked with unrelated issues, Wu Jianmin said, such a practice is rare in the world. China has trade ties with more than 200 countries and regions in the world and we never had any problems with them. As for the differences between China and the United States on the question of human rights, Wu stated, China believes that dialogue can be held on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and the purpose is to increase mutual understanding. China is against interference in the internal affairs of another country. Wu Jianmin stressed that international trade should be based on equality and mutual benefit. The unilateral exertion of pressure and adoption of restrictive measures with regard to trade is not in conformity with international practices. These measures are unwise as they harm the interests of both sides.
