They are both from central Slovakia. However, each is made of different stuff--different vocabulary, drive, and temperament. To be honest, the diplomatic polish of the latter prime minister is not, on the outside, in any way reminiscent of the Polana temperament. It is perhaps only revealed by the quiet determination with which he worked his way to the top rung of the Slovak political ladder. [NARODNA OBRODA] Mr. Prime Minister, you traveled along part of the same political path as Vladimir Meciar. When did you begin to part ways, and what was the moment of truth in your mutual relations? [Moravcik] The break did not occur in our personal relations but involved a mutual political parting of ways. There is a tendency to personalize political disputes in our country. For example, I have always had different views from Jan Carnogursky, but we have always remained friends. The rift in relations with Meciar began last year after I was appointed foreign minister and became an open rift in May or June. It consisted of a different point of view on looking after Slovakia's interests. We each had a different feeling about how this should be done. In my opinion, the methods and style of Meciar's government did not do our interests any service. My--almost singular--opinion did not at that time represent within the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] an alternative to this style of government. It came about with great difficulty and under dramatic circumstances. [NARODNA OBRODA] In the most recent public opinion poll, however, almost 45 percent of respondents are of the opinion that the HZDS will again emerge victorious from the early elections.... [Moravcik] I am also convinced that the HZDS will obtain the highest number of votes in the elections. Obviously, the majority of you feel the same. This is very likely, and it probably cannot be changed. Of course, this does not mean that I support the HZDS. [NARODNA OBRODA] What, then, are you doing specifically to alter this situation? What kind of chairman are you if you do not venture to win the elections? [Moravcik] No, we cannot cope with this responsibility. We will not win the elections ourselves. Nevertheless, I am convinced that this governing grouping will be successful if it combines its efforts. I am willing to work hard for this. I am even willing to work on my image. [NARODNA OBRODA] Some coalition radicals are criticizing you and are claiming that the necessary drive alone will not suffice for a more effective preelection campaign against the opposition. They say that you will not win over the politically undecided and irresolute with nonconfrontational decency. Why have you adopted defensive tactics? [Moravcik] Because carrying on along confrontational lines, which I indicated in my speech when I introduced the government's policy statement, would not bring us what we are striving for--a calm atmosphere among the population. If we do not maintain this, we will not manage to achieve what we have set out to achieve. Calm also represents an economic value that can be expressed numerically. Therefore, we have no reason to change what we started with. I believe that a cooperative style of politics will also be asserted after the elections. [NARODNA OBRODA] However, it was possible to discern a certain tension within the broad coalition government after your election as Democratic Union of Slovakia chairman. This also took some of your coalition partners by surprise.... [Moravcik] We consulted all of our partners on this eventuality. However, as far as the consultations with Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] representatives are concerned, I admit frankly that, during them, we confused informal talks with formal ones. We apologized earnestly to Peter Weiss for this mistake and added that it should not affect our relations. [NARODNA OBRODA] However, it is still fresh in the people's minds that it was your Alternative that did not want the political elite to become involved in executive power.... [Moravcik] Even I do not like this solution much. I know that we have lost some points over this. However, it was a necessary compromise that enabled us to implement a plan of cooperation among those political entities that have a compatible or close orientation. [NARODNA OBRODA] Could this issue not have been resolved, for instance, by using the method applied in Great Britain? There they differentiate between the party chairman and leader.... [Moravcik] Such a solution was on offer. Only it is unknown in our political environment. Our solution corresponds to it. [NARODNA OBRODA] Other factors, however, may have a much more significant influence on the outcome of the elections--how much money will be left for the social sphere, what kind of price hikes there will be, while the increased value-added tax on foodstuffs in particular is a major bugbear. [Moravcik] Health care and education are on the verge of collapse. To be able to at least maintain education at the most essential level and provide health-care services and medicines, we simply have to have additional resources. We can acquire these by raising taxes. To reduce expenditures and bring in resources, we are preparing an option whereby value-added tax will be set at the single rate of 25 percent--for luxury foodstuffs and services. We want to raise consumer tax on cigarettes and alcohol. We are still considering beer. However, we do not want to live to the detriment of the future. [NARODNA OBRODA] It is said that a government that increases the price of beer will fall. [Moravcik] Therefore, we are merely considering it. First and foremost, however, we would like to bring more resources into the budget by means of greater financial discipline, even by increasing the fines for misdemeanors. Although not very much is obtained from this, the penalty for them is low, and so we can allow ourselves to be more strict. We would like to save something in expenditure on the Army. It is a problem, but we are also thinking about reducing the subsidies for agriculture. This will be even more complicated. We want to partially reduce the subsidies for energy, but, so far, these measures are merely being taken into consideration. [NARODNA OBRODA] Although we are at the end of April, the greatest change is expected in the budget. Was it perhaps formulated too optimistically, not only with regard to the sources of revenue but also with regard to expenditure? [Moravcik] The sources were overestimated and the expenditure was underestimated. This causes hidden tension in the budget. We will have to take active steps to ensure that health care and education do not collapse. If we were to choose the path of lesser resistance and permitted a deficit at the level of last year's, the state's overall indebtedness would again increase and we would nudge the solution to our current problems into the future. This would be at variance with what we have undertaken to do in the government's policy statement. [NARODNA OBRODA] Your Cabinet is making the maximum possible effort to reach an agreement with the IMF that would create a favorable climate for the Slovak Republic's cooperation with the financial world. Is this not merely patching up the budget with the aim of maintaining the koruna's internal convertibility? [Moravcik] The standby loan and the most advantageous terms for its repayment will create an important background, especially for the entry of foreign investors. The issue does not so much involve the $140 million as the possibility of earning some money. Investment injections from outside improve our credibility and thus the reliability of our economic and trade relations. We could also get loans under more disadvantageous conditions, but we value this effect. That is, we will enter into this even with the knowledge that some of our measures will be unpopular and will affect the pockets of every citizen. Therefore, we have to create a form of compensation for the socially weakest sectors. We are specifying what kind. However, we will decide when all the negotiations are concluded. [NARODNA OBRODA] Did Deputy Prime Minister Schmognerova and Finance Minister Filkus get on well at their talks in Washington with representatives from the IMF and the World Bank? [Moravcik] As far as I know, yes. The talks took place in a pleasant atmosphere and confirmed the interest from abroad in helping Slovakia. [NARODNA OBRODA] With your permission, Mr. Prime Minister, a heretical question. It seems to us that foreign investors are still waiting in front of the gates, at least until the elections, because they consider your Cabinet to be a provisional one. [Moravcik] Despite this skepticism and the short time we have at our disposal, I am an optimist. I believe that we will manage to convince both potential investors and our citizens before the elections. [NARODNA OBRODA] Every government has made promises of its willingness to help businessmen. This is as far as most of them got. Moreover, you have little time.... [Moravcik] Therefore, the most important task will be to guarantee sufficient sources of credit. The National Bank of Slovakia may also increase its credit margin. But this will not be enough. We see additional sources in activating the National Property Fund, in the Guarantee Bank, and, apart from this, we will seek foreign assistance--all during this short period. We are thinking about reducing the tax burden on businessmen, which is on the verge of tolerability, in the future. It does not motivate anyone, but it does lead to tax evasion. Therefore, we intend to accede to tax liberalization, which, in essence, has a motivating effect and, in the final analysis, increases budget revenue. [NARODNA OBRODA] Some foreign sources have said that, even under the former government, the economic decline was halted and that we have already pushed off from the bottom.... [Moravcik] We would not assess the state of our economy so optimistically. Although there have been some positive trends, we have not managed to turn the export-import ratio in the desired direction. However, this is also due to the fact that exports are usually lower in the first few months of the year; they culminate sometime in November. Nevertheless, it is possible to expect what we so carefully formulated in the policy statement, that the trend toward zero growth is a partial reason for optimism. Moreover, the foreign currency operations have also shown some signs of life. [NARODNA OBRODA] In your opinion, will the negative reaction from the Czech side to the mutual assignment of certificates for imported foodstuffs and products also be projected into the higher prices for agricultural products in Slovakia? [Moravcik] When we assumed executive power, the implementation of the legal stipulation on their mandatory assignment, approved by the National Council of the Slovak Republic, had still not been adequately prepared from a technical point of view. Therefore, we agreed to a postponement of one month. It could not be resolved hitherto because of the different interests of the Slovak and Czech sides. However, I do not think it is exactly helpful if, a week before the deadline expires, the whole issue is transferred from the specialist to the political level, even though there was no time to resolve the contentious points before 1 May. However, this does not release us from the mandatory assignment of certificates as laid down by the law. I also conveyed this to [Czech Trade and Industry] Minister Dlouhy in a telephone conversation when he requested a further postponement. However, if problems have cropped up on their side, they could have let us know earlier. It was already too late for us. And will this matter be projected into the increased prices? Issuing certificates does not exact especially high financial costs. But it could if it stiffly curbs the import of cheaper Czech products. [NARODNA OBRODA] Mr. Prime Minister, your government is to prepare a number of laws for parliament. Will you be able to cope with the process of adopting them in view of the fact that summer and the recess are approaching? [Moravcik] Yes, if we proceed from the idea of a working summer. For us to achieve this, parliament will hold a working session at the end of July. We would like to adopt some of the norms, while others will be at least legislatively prepared for the postelection government. Our ambition is that it is our coalition government, although we do not know whether it would have the same personnel it has at the moment. [NARODNA OBRODA] In your opinion, what will the HZDS deputies come out with in their proposal to recall Deputy Prime Minister Kovac? [Moravcik] I am convinced that the accusation is fabricated. I am also convinced that this is merely an attempt to denigrate government members. This is a scheme according to which, if they do not prove anything, they will at least sow seeds of doubt in the people's minds. Such a way of thinking is alien to me. Political practices like this merely damage Slovakia. I do not think it is a decent form of political rivalry. [NARODNA OBRODA] Is your situation also not complicated, Prime Minister, by the rumors that one of your Cabinet team has problems with the screening law? [Moravcik] As it is made clear in the screening law, I asked for all government members to be screened to find out if they comply with the law's conditions. I am waiting for an answer. [NARODNA OBRODA] Apparently, some coalition partners are also thinking about changing the election law. The issue involves, in particular, increasing the number of electoral districts from four to seven. Moreover, the SDL is proposing that the election campaign be shortened to two weeks and that the number of broadcasts on radio and television be cut.... [Moravcik] At the moment, opinions are not unanimous in everything. However, we have agreed that we will adhere to the hitherto valid rules of the game--that is, four electoral districts and a month-long election campaign. Nonetheless, we have left this issue open. We did not consider it to be a fundamental problem. [NARODNA OBRODA] In connection with the term of your mandate and the unpopularity of some measures, you may find yourself in a dilemma over whether to postpone the early elections.... [Moravcik] I admit that this is the case. Six months is too little to be able to change more substantially the ratio of political forces--that is, the problems of the old parliament will, to a certain extent, recur after the elections. I make no secret of the fact that, during the talks with our partners, we also discussed the idea of postponing the elections until 1995. [NARODNA OBRODA] Why was the idea not adopted? [Moravcik] Some parties were of the opinion that this would not be to their advantage. It seems this was not quite the correct conclusion to reach. [NARODNA OBRODA] Mr. Prime Minister, you are a native of Ocova. When did you last sing with Jan Berky-Mrenica? [Moravcik] I have never sung with him. But I like his music very much. It is a shame we have not seen each other for a couple of years. [NARODNA OBRODA] So, what if you were to meet in NARODNA OBRODA next time?
