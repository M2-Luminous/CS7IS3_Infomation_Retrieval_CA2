Shakhray told reporters on Monday that the example of Tatarstan can show to the leaderships of Ukraine and the Crimea "how it is possible to settle relations between a strong centre and a strong region". In Tatarstan secessionist moods were strong until Moscow agreed to sign a bilateral share-power agreement with it. Kazan, in its turn, agreed to participate in elections to the new Russian parliament which failed in the republic mostly because the local leadership was against them. "We want to remind the Ukrainian and Crimean leaders that relations between Moscow and Kazan could have developed along a very bad scenario in their time, but Russian and Tatar leaders had common sense enough to embark on the path of compromises and concessions", Shakhray said and added that the situation "normalised politically and economicaly" after the share-power deal between Moscow and Kazan was reached.
