During the meeting with 200 unionists in Elblag, Krzaklewski emphasised that "in Silesia hundreds of thousands of people are protesting against the incorrect realisation of the reforms and the system which causes our families to become impoverished." Krzaklewski said that he believes in the wisdom of workers and challenged them not to be afraid of the comments of "the parties and unions in power." The union leader said he did not support the idea of this particular constitution being approved by a parliament which is in its majority composed of post-Communists.
