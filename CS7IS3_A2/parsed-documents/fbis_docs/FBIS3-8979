"According to the information gathered and checked so far, there is no evidence of the existence of illegal intelligence services," a statement issued on Tuesday by the so-called political coordination, headed by Drnovsek, said. The government thus refuted Kucan's statement that "para-intelligence services in Slovenia keep under surveillance top state officials, some journalists, and other eminent personalities, and are ready to liquidate them." The Slovene prime minister and his aides also rejected Kucan's statements in the more recent months about the nascent fascism and other negative phenomena in Slovenia, including mounting corruption, disqualifications of politicians and the like. Kucan on February 16 officially informed Drnovsek and parliament President Herman Rigelnik that he had reliable information that Defence Minister Janez Jansa was plotting a state coup. No coup has been staged, but the government has failed to provide any thorough explanation of the case, which is most likely at the core of the so-called intelligence misunderstandings between the president and the prime minister's most reliable team. Slovenia has in the meantime grown more risky for foreign investors, according to the latest poll conducted by the prestigious financial review Euromoney. Confidence in Slovenia's economy and economic policy is at its lowest since the republic seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation. The confidence will further be eroded by a continued drop in the anyway inadequate foreign capital investments, and, as economic experts set out, the too slow implementation of reforms and the country's excessively high debt to a consortium of foreign banks.
