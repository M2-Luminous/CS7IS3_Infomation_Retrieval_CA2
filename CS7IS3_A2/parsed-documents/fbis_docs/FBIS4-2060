The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said the relatively high inflation during the January-March period mainly resulted from substantial price hikes in February fueled by a pre-lunar new year buying spree. Consumer prices declined slightly in March, the directorate said. The consumer price index (CPI), which measures price changes from 1991 when the index was 100, stood at 110.02 last month, down 0.2 percent from February, the agency noted. It attributed the decline mainly to drops in clothing and floral prices as well as service fees following the end of the lunar new year holidays. Compared with March 1993, the annual inflation rate was 3.39 percent, DGBAS officials said. The rise was attributed to a 6.23 percent hike in education and entertainment bills, a 4.92 percent surge in housing rents and baby-sitting charges, a 3.03 percent increase in food prices and a 2.12 percent advance in medical bills, the officials said. Meanwhile, wholesale prices and import prices also rose in March, up 0.37 percent and 2.19 percent from the year-earlier levels because of a slight depreciation of the new taiwan dollar against the U.S. greenback. The export price index, however, declined 0.37 percent in March when compared with the year before, according to DGBAS tallies. For the January-March period, wholesale and import prices edged up 1.11 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, from year-earlier levels, while export prices dropped by an average of 1.54 percent.
