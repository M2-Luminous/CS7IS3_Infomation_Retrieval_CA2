In other orders, the commission has modified the format for filing the election expenditure incurred by candidates and an intensive revision of Delhi's electoral rolls. The Chief Election Commissioner [CEC], Mr T.N. Seshan, told a `meet the press' programme of the Press Club of India here on Friday that the commission would ensure that such candidates give their correct residential address in the nomination and not merely as `C/O The Chief Minister'. The measure was intended to check the "backdoor entry" into the Rajya Sabha, he said. To this end, the Election Commission had asked the Chief Electoral Officers (CEOs) of States to be alert while registering known political personalities in the electoral rolls as voters. The advisory suggests a double check on the "normally resident of the area" clause in the Representation of the People Act to check fraudulant enrolment in the voter list, which in turn enables the personality to contest an election to the Council of States. Answering a question on the common practice of providing a fictitious address for enrolment in the voters' list, particularly by politicians wishing to contest a Rajya Sabha seat from a State where they are not normally resident, Mr Seshan said the commission was aware of it and had moved in the direction of checking it. "Nobody will be able to get away with giving a `care of' address in any State," he said. The Election Commission has modified the format for filing the election expenditure incurred by candidates and directed them to file "correct" accounts. The commission order has called for submission of accounts of election expenditure by contesting candidates in the recent Assembly elections also. Mr Seshan said that the district election officers, before accepting the revised proforma from the candidates on the election expenses should conduct an inquiry, if necessary, to ensure that these were in accordance with the law. The modified format requires the candidates to show day to day accounts as also total expenditure with details, he said. The candidates have been asked to keep correct account of all expenditure from the date of nomination till the declaration of results. Mr Seshan expressed concern over the "increasing role of money power" in elections. The government was yet to take action on his recommendations on checking the menace, he added. Mr Seshan said he had also ordered "special intensive revision" of electoral rolls in Delhi not only following complaints but also because he felt things were at variance with ground reality. Answering a wide range of questions on the changes he is trying to bring about in electoral practices and procedures, Mr Seshan agreed that a one-day poll all over the country even for Lok Sabha elections was the ideal. The commission, however, could not rush in that direction ignoring the constitutional directive to ensure a "free and fair" poll. The commission would complete the polling process in one day, provided the government extended the necessary police personnel to make the poll free and fair. He, however, did not foresee such a situation developing in the near future. Mr Seshan said the commission sets up nearly 6.5 lakh polling stations for a parliamentary poll in all the 543 Lok Sabha constituencies. At the rate of just two policemen at each booth, the commission would require 13 lakh personnel. The government could not go one beyond 60,000 personnel in the November round of Assembly elections. With those numbers, he would be able to deploy just one policeman for ten to twelve polling booths, which was hardly conducive to a free and fair poll, he said. On the question of photo-identity cards to all voters by January 1, 1995, Mr Seshan said the matter was discussed at a meeting of all CEOs in September, where all the 32 CEOs saw no problem of any kind in making this possible by the set date. Now some States were raising the question of resources which was not his look-out. It had to be sorted out between the States and the Centre, he said while declining to comment on the stand taken by the Advocate-General of West Bengal that insisting on identity cards for voters was violative of the constitutional provision of adult franchise. The question of election expenses of candidates was engaging the close consideration of the commission, which was trying to find ways of enforcing the available legal provisions in this regard. He, however, said there was little that the commission could do if Parliament, in its wisdom, did not arm it to deal adequately with the issue. Similar was his stance on barring persons with a criminal background from contesting the polls. Another aspect which the commission is looking seriously into is the exit polls conducted by some organisations, which find their way into newspapers. These exit polls had the potential to influence the voting pattern in other areas, he admitted. Mr Seshan, even as he declined to answer a question on why restrictions were imposed on the entry of media persons into polling stations, on the ground that the matter was pending before a court, said one reason he could share with the press right away was that of overcrowding in polling booths. With an average of 50 candidates in one constituency, there would be as many poll agents inside a polling station. There would also be the average six polling staff and if journalists also went inside in good numbers, there would be no room left for the voters, he said. The CEC, however, promised that reporters would not be given scope for complaining the next time round.
