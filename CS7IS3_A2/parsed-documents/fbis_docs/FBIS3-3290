"My personal view is that in the coming two or three years there will be an increase in the deficit," Liu told journalists, but expressed confidence the Chinese authorities would be able to sell some 100 billion yuan in treasury bonds this year to cover the shortfall. Nevertheless, he acknowledged the growing deficit was a "headache" for the government. In his budget speech to the National People's Congress on Friday, Liu said the deficit would hit 66.9 billion yuan in 1994, with revenues and expenditures rising 7.7 percent and 15 percent to 475.9 billion yuan and 542.9 billion yuan respectively. The deficit is up from 20.5 billion yuan last year, but Liu stressed the leap was partly due to a shift to international accounting methods under which income from debt is not included in total revenue and debt servicing is removed from total expenditure. Based on the new methods, last year's debt would have totalled about 30 billion yuan, he said. Liu said he believed this year's treasury bonds would sell well, despite the lack of public enthusiasm for an issue of 30 billion yuan in 1993. Blaming last year's problems on "financial disorder" in China, he said the situation now was "quite different," while the terms of the bonds were more attractive and the distribution system more sophisticated. "So although the figure of the treasury bonds issued this year is a little bit larger, it is entirely possible that distribution will be smooth," he said, denying that individuals had been forced to buy them in 1993. Liu was unable to indicate why urban residents facing year-on- year cost of living rises of more than 20 percent should show interest in bonds fixed this year about one percent higher than the national rate of 13 percent.
