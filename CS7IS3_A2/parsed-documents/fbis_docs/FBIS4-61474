Praising Russian-Armenian relations, he said that they are of principal importance in Armenia's foreign policy, have historically been "very good," and remain so. "We hope that the democratic changes which have begun on the territory of the former Soviet Union will deepen and that, in that connection, all such suspicions (of Russian imperialism) will disappear," the foreign minister stated. "We need partner-like relations, and they have now been established with Russia," he told ITAR-TASS in Buenos Aires, where he is on an official visit upon the invitation of the Government of Argentina. The Armenian foreign minister called for the unification of Russian and CSCE efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh problem. Both Russia and the European body are trying to unlock the Karabakh conflict, but the existence of two separate initiatives gives, mostly, Azerbaijan and also, partly, Nagorno-Karabakh the freedom to tack between the two sides without accepting either proposal, Papazyan said. "Russia needs stability in the Caucasus. Therefore, it seems to us, the Russian leadership is sincere in its approach to the solution of that conflict," the minister noted. "The most rational element in Russia's proposals is that it is impossible to achieve a cease-fire without introducing separating forces. Nobody except Russia is ready to send their troops into that region. The Azerbaijan side has doubts about allowing the introduction of Russian troops. However, if that is done in cooperation with international institutes such as the CSCE and UN, then Azerbaijan will have no grounds for concern," Papazyan stressed.
