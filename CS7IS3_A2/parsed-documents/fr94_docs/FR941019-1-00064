FR941019-1-00064 FR941019-1-00009 Also, on January 7, 1994, NOAA published a proposed rule for assessing natural resource damages resulting from oil discharges into navigable waters under OPA. 59 FR 1062. The comment period on NOAA's proposed rule closed on October 7, 1994. 59 FR 32148 (June 22, 1994). IV. Potential Topics for Review During this rulemaking, the Department will be considering ways of revising the administrative process and the type B procedures to reflect both experience to date in the use of the regulations as well as scientific and technical advances. The Department solicits comment on all aspects of the administrative process and the type B procedures, other than the assessment of lost nonuse values. Based on the comments received and its own analysis, the Department will develop a proposed rule to revise the regulations. The Department has already received numerous comments on the administrative process and type B procedures over the last few years. One source of comments has been State briefings on use of the regulations. The Department has provided these briefings to State trustee officials at their request. Another source of comments has been telephone calls from individuals requesting technical assistance in the application of the regulations to particular cases. Also, in the course of revising the regulations to comply with Ohio v. Interior, the Department received numerous comments that were beyond the scope of that rulemaking. As indicated during the Ohio v. Interior rulemaking, the Department has included a discussion of all of those comments in this notice. See 59 FR 14266. The following discussion is intended neither as an exhaustive treatment of all possible topics for review nor as a definitive indication of the Department's position. Instead, the discussion is simply provided as an aid in generating further information and analysis. Commenters are encouraged to provide comments not only on the topics discussed in this notice but also on any other topics relating to the administrative process or type B procedures that they deem appropriate. During this biennial review, the Department will also examine the relationship between its CERCLA damage assessment regulations and the OPA damage assessment regulations being developed by NOAA. The Department will consider ways of clarifying the applicability of its regulations versus NOAA's regulations. In this regard, the Department solicits comment on what provisions, if any, its regulations should continue to make for assessing damages from oil discharges. The Department will also coordinate with NOAA to ensure the greatest consistency appropriate between the two sets of regulations. The Department has noted in the following discussion certain areas where NOAA has proposed an approach that differs from that currently taken in the Department's regulations. The Department solicits comment on whether the Department's regulations should be revised to follow the approach proposed by NOAA in areas of difference. A. Administrative Process 1. Streamlining One frequent comment has been that the Department's regulations are ``too wordy'' and ``not in plain English.'' Many commenters have indicated that the administrative process is too complicated and needs to be streamlined. NOAA's proposed OPA rule provides for an ``Expedited Damage Assessment'' based on ``limited, focused studies in order to facilitate restoration as soon as possible.'' 59 FR 1177. Given the wide variety of activities involved in assessing damages, the number of legal, scientific, and economic issues involved in damage assessments, and the broad range of possible types of natural resource damage cases, a certain level of intricacy is unavoidable in the regulations. However, the administrative process and type B procedures were designed to provide trustee officials with the flexibility to tailor the scope and level of detail of an assessment to meet the needs of the particular case. Trustee officials choose from a menu of available type B procedures, using only those procedures and assessing only those injuries and losses that they deem appropriate and adjusting the level of documentation accordingly. The regulations allow both for the performance of a limited number of short-term studies in a simple case involving the release of a single substance affecting a single resource, as well as the performance of numerous, long-term studies in a complex case of a release of multiple substances affecting multiple resources. Nevertheless, the Department aims to make the regulations as clear and straightforward as possible. Therefore, the Department solicits comment on specific aspects of the administrative process that commenters consider unduly burdensome or complicated. 2. Preassessment Phase Several commenters requested additional guidance on the conduct of preassessment activities. NOAA has developed a draft guidance document on preassessment activities under OPA. See 59 FR 1065. The Department's regulations already contain some guidance on preassessment activities. See 43 CFR §§11.20&hyph;11.25. The Department notes that developing guidance requires balancing increased predictability against reduced flexibility to respond to the unique features of the broad range of potential natural resource damage cases. Thus, there is a limit to the level of specificity that can be appropriately provided in the regulations. With this in mind, the Department solicits comment on specific aspects of the Preassessment Phase that warrant additional guidance. The Department also solicits comment on whether the guidance should be incorporated in the regulations or in a separate guidance document. Some commenters questioned whether a preassessment screen should be required when a type A procedure is used. During the preassessment screen, trustee officials determine whether the discharge or release is covered by CWA or CERCLA and whether they have a reasonable probability of making a successful claim before expending efforts to carry out a damage assessment. See 43 CFR 11.23(b). This determination appears to be relevant regardless of the substantive assessment methods ultimately used. Moreover, the determination whether to use a type A procedure, type B procedures, or both is not made until the Assessment Plan Phase, which follows the performance of the preassessment screen. See 43 CFR 11.33. The Department solicits comment on ways to reduce the burden of the preassessment screen while at the same time ensuring that trustee officials adequately consider the appropriateness of pursuing a damage claim before proceeding with either a type A procedure, type B procedures, or both. 3. Coordination With Other Agencies A number of commenters requested additional guidance on coordination among trustee agencies and between trustee agencies and response agencies. Commenters raised questions about the lead authorized official. Some commenters sought clarification of the role of the lead authorized official. Others requested a prohibition against the designation of a trustee official who is also a PRP as lead authorized official. Suggestions for improved coordination between trustee and response activities included: restricting the time allowed to conduct an assessment in order to avoid potential conflicts with settlement negotiations between response agencies and PRPs; requiring trustee officials to participate in the remedial planning process; requiring response agencies to coordinate with trustee officials; and authorizing the On-Scene Coordinator to contact just one Federal trustee agency and one State trustee agency and requiring that the contacted trustee agencies notify all other trustee agencies. The Department's regulations already provide some guidance on trustee coordination. See 43 CFR 11.32(a)(1). The regulations also include discussions of coordination with response agencies. 43 CFR 11.23(f) and 11.31(a)(3). The Department intends to take a close look at these coordination provisions during the biennial review. The Department encourages commenters to provide suggestions on ways of improving coordination among trustee agencies and between trustee and response activities. NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes a model memorandum of understanding designed to facilitate trustee coordination. See 59 FR 1185. Several States have been working to ensure better interagency coordination. Also, as part of the recent National Performance Review designed to streamline government operations, the Department developed a number of recommendations concerning the improvement of trustee coordination for natural resource damage assessments. The Department intends to examine these efforts to see what lessons can be learned. 4. Public and PRP Participation Several commenters voiced opinions about the opportunity for public and PRP participation in the assessment process. Some commenters thought that additional opportunities for public input were necessary while others stated that the existing opportunities for public participation were excessive. Several commenters thought that the Department should encourage earlier involvement of PRPs in assessments to avoid duplication of effort. NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes a model memorandum of understanding for trustee officials and PRPs to use when conducting joint assessments. 59 FR 1187. With regard to public participation, the Department's regulations require that the public be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Assessment Plan, including the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, as well as the post-assessment Restoration Plan. See 43 CFR 11.32(c), 11.81(d)(2), and 11.93(a), as amended by 59 FR 14283, and 14287.
