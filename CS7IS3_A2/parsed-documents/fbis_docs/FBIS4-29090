Ours has now become a government of a minority coalition, but we will do our best for smooth progress of Japan with sincerity and joint efforts." On the night of 28 April [1994], at his first press conference since assuming the office, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata showed a touch of vexation at the condition in which he was forced to start the "Hata regime" with the minority of the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Hata is "the choice" of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and his government was born by easily obtaining a majority of votes--274 votes in the lower house and 127 votes in the upper house. Although the second coalition government appeared to make a smooth start, the foothold of the government crumbled from its foundation all at once when the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] seceded from the coalition government. The genuine ruling coalition bolstering the government numbers 182, a little over one-third of the total in the lower house. The coalition force will only be 202 members even if to count the members of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the new party of Mirai [the Future Party]. Sakigake left the coalition, pledging to cooperate from the outside of the cabinet and Mirai broke away from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and is assuming the pro-coalition stance. Things are severer in the upper house as the coalition holds 62 persons which account for only about one-fourth of the total strength. This explains the conditions under which "none of the bills can be passed" (a leading member of the ruling coalition in the upper house). In his cabinet formation, Prime Minister Hata picked eight members from Shinseito and six from Komeito. The "Shinsei-Komei" tie has thus become strong. He has staffed his official residence by an excellent pair from Shinseito, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura. He reappointed Mr. Hirohisa Fujii to the post of finance minister who deals with tax system issue and Mr. Hajime Ishii to the post of home affairs minister who takes charge of political reform. Both of them are Shinseito members and thus in essence the prime minister has clearly indicated the "Shinseito leadership." In the Hosokawa government, a rift between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura deprived the official residence of its centripetal force. That became a factor in inviting bureaucratic leadership. Hata seeks to solidify his official residence thereby to exercise power of control over bureaucrats. There are such aims in "Hata's personnel management." The fate of Hata government hangs on a tax system reform and a bill for rezoning of single-seat constituencies with a proportional representation system. We can see that Hata cabinet poised to attempt a frontal breakthrough on these two pending bills. With the SDPJ's secession from the government and Sakigake's cooperation from the outside of the cabinet, policy coordinations within the ruling coalition are likely to proceed smoothly unlike in the past. However, problem lies after that. At his press conference, Prime Minister Hata expressed his expectations for cooperation from both the LDP and the SDPJ, saying that "there was a word (from the SDPJ) that it would cooperate as best as it can for the benefit of the nation" and that, although we and the LDP may have clashes over some issues, "I believe the LDP will extend its cooperation on policy matters, and I would like to ask it to do so." However, the situation is not as optimistic as that. The ruling coalition government desires to present the rezoning bill to the Diet as soon as possible after the fiscal 1994 budget is approved. In addition to the election strategy of Shinseito which wants to carry out the election under a new system, the coalition government believes that "such a step can forestall the introduction of a no-confidence motion against the cabinet by the LDP and the SDPJ" (a leading member of the ruling coalition). However, there is a tenacious voice, within both the LDP and the SDPJ, calling for the dissolution of the lower house and a general election under the existing system; therefore, undoubtedly there will be fierce quarrels between ruling and opposition parties after passage of the proposed budget. With the "question of 100 million yen loans" from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm to former Prime Minister Hosokawa still remaining unsettled, the issue may easily turn into a factor for a great turbulence, depending on the opposition parties' approach to the issue. There are many seeds of fiery confrontation between ruling and opposition parties, including measures to cope with issues of nuclear development in the DPRK (North Korea). In the Hosokawa regime, the initiative under the "Ichi-Ichi [Ichiro and Yuichi] line" by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Kometo Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa surfaced in various aspects. With the SDPJ and Sakigake having left the coalition, the "Ichi-Ichi line" could very well be brought out in relief in the Hata government. In what form will the opposition to such development take place? Sadao Yamahana, member of the SDPJ and former minister in charge of political reform, asserted at a meeting of the party's Diet members on 28 April [1994] that "the Hata cabinet will be unable to fulfil the role greater than one assigned to a budget management cabinet." Voicing his feelings of desperation, a leading member of the ruling coalition made the following remarks: "We have no other choice but to make desperate efforts for the first two months. If we keep striving with the given minority, we may enlist sympathy for the weakling." Without carrying enough "fuel," the ship "Shinsei-Hata Maru" is compelled to launch out on a stormy sea, bearing the destiny of the coalition government on its shoulder. The sea route to follow is invisible. The "political change in June theory" is increasingly acquiring a flavor of reality. [1 May 94 p 2] }[Text] "Nobody knows what may happen tomorrow in the political world. Nothing has shown this more vividly than the recent political change," deplores one of Shinseito leaders. Before dawn of 26 [April 1994], SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama announced his party's secession from the coalition government at a press conference he held urgently. The SDPJ's secession from the government, the new Hata regime suddenly slid down to a "minority ruling coalition." A Komeito leader said, "A momentary judgment often sways one's fate, bringing one's prosperity or fall." At his first inaugural press conference on 28 April, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata touched on the formation of a joint parliamentary union called the "Reform" which led to [Hata's] "fall into Hell from Heaven" (a leading Shinseito member) through the SDPJ's secession from the government. Gnawing his lips, the prime minister made the following remarks: "I did not know that things were proceeding that way. As things were getting serious, I became aware that there were some mutual misunderstandings, but it was already too late then." His words sounded as if to suggest a difficult future of the Hata regime. The unfolding new political situation of the Hata regime foreshadows a desperate struggle and confusion involving both ruling and opposition parties. There are three major forces: the "ruling coalition" formed by Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan New Party [JNP], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the Liberal Party; the LDP; and the SDPJ. In addition, Sakigake, which shifted to cooperation from the outside of the cabinet, and Mirai, a new party which has broken away from the LDP, will also be entangled complicatedly. China's RENMIN RIBAO reported: "Viewed from a historic angle, Japan's political situation is reminiscent of its `age of civil strife.' A great upheaval is continuing, and the map of the political quarters will remain unclear until the end of the next election." The "Ichi-Ichi line" between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa displayed a initiative in the former Hosokawa regime and also in making the current Hata regime. The high-handed political methods of this line drove Sakigake, which is led by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, into outside-Cabinet cooperation and invited the SDPJ's "rebellion." Though not openly, a voice calling for reconsidering the "Ichi-Ichi line" is being raised gradually inside Shinseito and Komeito, and the "Ichi-Ichi line" appears to have reached the crucial point. Mr. Ozawa and his followers are now elaborating on the next gambit to make up for their "great miscalculation" that resulted in the SDPJ's secession from the government. It is a gambit for setting off a split between the LDP and the SDPJ and making the political situation fluid toward a new realignment of the political world. To this end, it will be sought to pass a bill on rezoning of single-seat constituency system for lower house even at the cost of prolonging the current Diet session (scheduled to end on 29 June). This is because when the single-seat constituency system is realized, a large number of LDP and SDPJ Diet members will lose their seats, thereby inevitably accelerating the realignment of the political world. Prior to such a development, both the LDP and the SDPJ, the two giants of the "1955 system," with their strategies to expand their influences by bringing about a Diet dissolution and a general election under the existing medium-size constituency. After its secession from the government, the SDPJ immediately had its general secretary talk with the LDP's secretary general, exploring the way for the "LDP-SDPJ tieup." Fierce offensive and defensive battles are inevitable between new and old forces over handling of the proposed budget and the single-seat constituency rezoning bill until the end of the current Diet session. Amid this process, activities for "liquidizing" the political situation will further deepen, and "various combinations of alliance and league will be groped for below the surface of the water" (a leading SDPJ member). The minor new parties, Sakigake and Mirai, "must rack their brains over how to steer themselves among alliances and leagues and grab a casting vote" (a leading Sakigake member). Only a few days have passed since the Hata cabinet started, but a theory is already afloat in Nagata-cho [where Diet building is located] that "the general election will be held on 24 July." This marks the beginning of a war of information on the political situation. The plot of the "24 July" theory is as follows: Toward the end of June, the issue of extending the session of the Diet will be raised over the handling of the proposed budget and the singel-seat constituency rezoning bill. Such an extension will conflict with deadlines set for the settlement of the ruling coalition's tax reform bills and the government's market-opening measures. There is also a strong possibility that the LDP and the SDPJ will jointly bring forward a no-confidence motion against the cabinet. The political situation will get "liquidized" at a stroke. The Naple summit (the meeting of leaders of advanced countries), to be held from 8 to 10 July, is also around the corner. Under this scenario, through a period covering before and after the summit meeting, the lower house will be dissolved and the holding of the general election will be publicly announced. "Anything could happen from now on and I will not be surprised." "I will race ahead, bracing myself like a soldier on the battlefield." These sharp words have been uttered successively by ruling and opposition party lawmakers who were leaving for their local constituencies to spend a long consecutive holidays. [2 May 94 p 2] [Text] "It is an extremely weak cabinet by a minority ruling coalition. More than half of the lawmakers elected by the people do not entertain expectations." "When the prime minister is not the top strong man leading Shinseito (the largest party in the ruling camp), we know that the power has a dual structure." On the evening of 28 April [1994] when the Hata regime started, LDP President Yohei Kono scathingly criticized the Shinseito-led new government. The use of the phrase "extremely weak cabinet" was even suggestive of his tenacious desire to overthrow the cabinet. The LDP was cheered by the SDPJ's secession from the government. It sets out to build a "joint front" with the SDPJ, saying that "the LDP versus non-LDP shackles have now been removed" (a leading member). On 27 April, the day after the secession was declared, [LDP] Secretary General Yoshiro Mori and [SDPJ] General Secretary Wataru Kubo confirmed close tieup in the future Diet operation, and this position was reconfirmed at a later meeting of the Diet Affairs Committee chairmen. The catchword of the tieup is "opposition to the high-handed use of power." This means that they will join hands under the logic that "an enemy's enemy is a friend" in opposition to the so-called "Ichi-Ichi line" political method employed by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, "a method ignoring parliamentary democracy" in the LDP's view. One of the leading members of the LDP says that "when the LDP and the SDPJ join hands, they can grab and exercise life-and-death power over all bills." Their strategy is very clear. Their position is that they may allow the proposed fiscal 1994 budget to be approved, but that "things will be different after that." Immediately after the budget is approved, they will submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet and ask for its general resignation. While taking these actions, they will be even ready for the dissolution of the lower house and the general election. LDP President Kono even went so far as declaring that "after the budget approval, there will be no more work to do for the new government." Until then, they are planning to undercut the government by thoroughly inquiring into former Prime Minister Hosokawa's alleged improprieties. Under this strategy, they are going to take the offensive for the "recapturing of standing committee chairmanships." The LDP and the SDPJ have 280 seats (206 seats for the LDP and 74 seats for the SDPJ) in the lower house, and this strength enables the opposition camp to form, so to speak, a "stable majority (270 seats). They thus reckon that "theoretically, every post can be recaptured" (a leading member of the Mitsuzuka faction). As a first step, to bind the new government's hands and feet, the focuse of their target is in having surrendered the chairmanship of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Rules and Administration--the the key post for steering of the Diet. However, at this stage, such tieup between the LDP and the SDPJ aims at no farther than the "overthrowing of the cabinet." In addition to the fear of the tieup being exposed to criticism that it marks a retrogression toward the 1955 system, there is an opposing view within the LDP that "the SDPJ is too afar from LDP in terms of policy" (a leading member of the Watanabe faction). Secretary General Mori, at the 28 April summit meeting, stated that "the joint struggle will be restricted within the house (Diet steering)," stressing that it did not presuppose a great coalition. The same is the case with the SDPJ. Immediately after the tieup was mutually confirmed, the party headquarters was flooded with the calls of protest, and it was busy explaining that "we are not joining in the work of restoring the LDP regime" (a leading member). Since it lost the office in July 1993, the LDP has constantly been exposed to the danger of another split. During the period, 20 members left the party through confrontations between supporters of the political reform legislation and those calling for a prudent approach, and the post-Hosokawa turmoil over former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe's defection and formation of a new party. The intraparty situation is not monolithic, and the aftereffects of those events are lingering. The executive leadership is busy working to avoid a split, and party reform is also left halfway. A leader admits the actual situation that "people see the coalition shaking; yet we hear no voice saying that let the LDP have power." There are signs that the political world is drifting toward a "tripolar structure" divided largely by the ruling coalition, the LDP, and the SDPJ-Sakigake. Amid these signs, it is doubtful that any one bloc can single-handedly assume power. Both the LDP and the SDPJ are not free from the danger of intraparty split as well. An elder lawmaker says: "From now on, we will be in the world of the history of the `Three States' [China's old wartime history book]. Activities will be swayed by party interests and individual interests. You may see a friend yesterday turn against you today." The LDP clearly upholds the position of overthrowing the present cabinet, and yet it fails to depict a firm scenario of its seizure of power. In such a condition the LDP is about to rush into the work of promoting fluidity in the political situation.
