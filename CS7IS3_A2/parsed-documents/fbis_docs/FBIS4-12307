Talking to newsmen on his arrival, Mr. Talbott said the Clinton administration attach great significance to Indo-U.S. relations. He said India is important to them and Washington wants to ensure that relations with New Delhi expand and strengthen in the years to come. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Kamini Sawhny] India is Mr. Strobe Talbott's first destination abroad after taking over as America's deputy secretary of state. Mr. Talbott, who arrived in New Delhi this evening on the first leg of his overseas tour, is here on a three-day visit. The United States has been India's largest trading partner, and with the liberalization of the economy, the trade turnover between the two countries is expected to touch $7 billion this year. Indian exports to the U.S. were up by 20 percent last year, while about 40 percent of all investments approved by the government in the same year were from U.S. firms. So economic issues will probably be high on the agenda when Mr. Talbott, who is the highest ranking U.S. State Department official to visit India from the Clinton administration, meets with Indian officials tomorrow. [Talbott] My government attaches considerable significance to my visit here. President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher have asked me to come here in order to consult with Prime Minister Rao and other officials of the Indian Government on concrete ways in which we can give together new impetus and new scope to U.S.-Indian relations. [Sawhny] Nonproliferation is also likely to be a key subject for discussion. According to reports, the U.S. proposal to hold a multilateral conference on nuclear nonproliferation and regional security in South Asia is likely to be conveyed to the government. The backbone of India's nuclear policy has been the Rajiv Gandhi action plan of 1988, which calls for a regime that is global and nondiscriminatory. Another related issue that India may take up is the proposal to supply 38 F-16 aircrafts to Pakistan as a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment. India feels that this will escalate the arms tension in the region. The post of U.S. ambassador in New Delhi, which continues to be vacant for over a year, will also figure in the talks. At the end of his visit here, Mr. Talbott is headed for Islamabad. [end recording]
