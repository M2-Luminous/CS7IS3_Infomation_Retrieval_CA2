This time the Israeli Government must make the brave decision to disarm the settlers and to clearly state that the settlements are illegal, and these settlers must be told that this land is occupied territory. If the Israeli Government does not make this decision, the entire peace process could lose its credibility. This will not only give rise to extremism, but the peace process will be refuted: Even the moderates will decide that it is meaningless. [passage omitted]
