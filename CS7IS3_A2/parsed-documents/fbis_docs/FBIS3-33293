The PSDB leaders believe this will only jeopardize the approval of the Social Emergency Fund. Deputy Luiz Maximo (PSDB-Sao Paulo), the vice leader of the party bloc in the lower house, commented: "The president would do the country a favor if he remained quiet. There was no need for him to say what he did. Obviously, he has every right to express his choice, but launching the PSDB candidate is something that only concerns the party." Senator Mario Covas, the party bloc leader in the Senate, was also upset by the president's comments because he believes they contradict the PSDB's strategy regarding the presidential succession and jeopardize the approval of the economic plan that will be voted for the second time by Congress next week. The PSDB candidate for the governorship of Sao Paulo State -- who supports Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy whether the plan is approved or not -- said the PSDB should not voice an opinion on succession before 2 April; the deadline by which those who wish to run for election must resign from their public posts. Federal Deputy Jose Anibal (PSDB-Sao Paulo) said the PSDB's strategy is to approve the plan and cooperate with the constitutional revision with a minimum agenda to guarantee essential reforms: Those involving tax, social security, political, and economic reforms. Only then will the party choose its candidate for the presidency of the Republic. "All parties are taking the succession into account. I believe the plan should be approved and that a minimum agenda should be discussed despite the president's attitude," asserted Jose Anibal, minimizing the repercussion of Itamar Franco's comments. He said Carnival and the reaction of the minister have neutralized what the president of the Republic said.
