This program will prevent the depletion of the country's natural resources in the pursuit of industrialization as envisioned under Philippines 2000. The approval of the program was made during the recent meeting of the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD) with the president. Officially called the Philippine Strategy for Biological Diversity Conservation (PSBDC), the program contains 18 broad objectives intended to address issues such as biodiversity policy, sustainable use, sustainable agriculture, recognition of ancestral domain, public education and awareness on biodiversity, and institutional capability-building. The specific goals of the PSBDC include: developing and implementing a holistic and comprehensive national program for the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components; ensuring that the relevant activities of the biodiversity program harmonize with those of other government and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), private sector, religious groups, and local community; and institutionalizing the practice of biodiversity conservation through legislative, administrative, fiscal and other regulatory measures. An important issue the program addresses is the need for a review of existing national and local policies on the management, use, and conservation of natural resources areas, wildlife and other biological resources. The program thus aims to reform those policies that encourage the misuse of natural resources and ecologically unsound management of biodiversity and its components. It also proposes that policies which give incentives to industries that practice sustainable development and environmentally sound activities be adopted. These would include reduction of resource consumption through waste minimization, recycling, and conservation. Another objective of the PSBDC is the implementation of natural resources accounting method that promotes biodiversity conservation. Part of this objective is the development of satellite environmental accounts in the Philippine system of national accounts. This could lead to the appropriate pricing of resource ecosystems. Today, resource ecosystems are being treated as "free" good and their degradation does not count as depreciation of the nation's basic capital stock in the calculation of Gross National Product (GNP). Another critical objective of the program is the integration of biodiversity conservation into national and local development planning. "If government agencies, both national and local, are willing to incorporate biological diversity conservation in the planning and management of the country, positive changes in the ecological, economic and social spheres of development will surely come about," the program states.
