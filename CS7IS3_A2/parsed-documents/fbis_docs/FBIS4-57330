FBIS4-57330 "drlat096_i_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-096 Daily Report 9 May 1994 Nicaragua Poll Reveals Disappointment Within FSLN Poll Reveals Disappointment Within FSLN PA1505175094 Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish 9 May 94 pp 1, 8 PA1505175094 Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO Spanish BFN [Report by Edgar Barberena S.] [Text] Approximately 90 percent of the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] members active in Managua prior to the 1990 elections no longer participate in the party's activities. This fact, which means only 10 percent of the members are active, shows the party is in crisis at all levels. These results are part of a survey conducted by the Institute of Nicaraguan Studies [IEN]. The survey results are based on statistical information from the FSLN's Departmental Directorate Committees. Of 17 cities polled, Leon leads with 6,050 active members. Although Leon has the most active members, this city also shares Sandinists' disappointment over their party. Although the membership reportedly had been 10,091, only 59 percent of members participated in the pre-Congress discussions. There is a similar case in Chinandega, where only 3,250 active members, roughly 25 percent, remain from the party's former 13,000 members. We wonder what happened to the other 75 percent of the original membership. Have they defected to other parties? Are they disappointed over the current Sandinist leaders? Have they joined the ranks of Nicaraguans who no longer want to hear anything about political parties? Congressmen Must Consider These questions should be thoroughly considered by the nearly 600 FSLN delegates who on 20, 21, and 22 May will decide the Sandinist Party's future. If we keep making calculations in other cities -- like Masaya, where only 42.85 percent of the members are active -- we will find that nowhere in Nicaragua is 100 percent of the membership active. The Sandinists polled by INE say these results are due to the FSLN rank and file's low morale because of lack of attention and the party's internal problems. Those polled pointed out, however, that many Sandinists joined the party purely for personal reasons. Although some members of the Sandinist directorate have denied it, the people polled say this low morale has been proven by the the rank and file's low participation in the pre-congress assemblies, also called ad hoc meetings. The polled Sandinists said the Sandinists will not win the 1996 elections if "the FSLN does not succeed in overcoming its internal crisis, if democratization is not achieved in the party, if the image of marred ethics, morals, and dominance is not recovered, and if the party identity and programs are not adapted to current circumstances." Trends in Sandinism The emergence of various trends (orthodox, verticalist [verticalista] or Pekin School, or the one that advocates a Sandinists' return to the majorities) of necessity was the subject of one of the questions addressed in the poll. Fifty-four percent think the emergence of these trends is an obstacle for the party. The majority, however, think the diversity of opinions within Sandinism is positive. Thirty-five percent of those polled believe that trends are a reality within the FSLN and that these trends help the party. Nevertheless, they warned: "The media unsettle the people with the reports of those confrontations, by siding with one or the other. This creates mistrust, insecurity, and apprehension in the rank and file." One of the questions those polled were asked was: Why do you think of the struggle of socialists versus and social democrats, as well as that of conservatives versus renovators; the struggle for power, the competition for leadership, and the normal process of diversity in the FSLN? The results were the following: 44 percent think it is a mere fight for power; 22 percent think it is a normal process of diversity in the FSLN; 20 percent think it is a healthy competition for leadership; 1 percent think it is a struggle between liberals and conservatives; 1 percent said it is a struggle between socialists and social democrats; another 1 percent does not identify with either Daniel Ortega's left or Sergio Ramirez' renovating trend. Other Aspects The survey also includes information on the FSLN's program and strategic objectives, which point to the need for reaching the rank and file with a permanent work, and streamlining some concepts. There is no room for verticalist concepts. It is necessary to stimulate the rank and file's active participation in the decisionmaking as well as the formulation and implementation of party strategy. Although the statistics for Sandinism's renovating trend are scant, those polled favored replacing the Sandinist leaders from the rank and file up to the chief FSLN leaders. National Agreement The mentality of the "overwhelming majority" apparently has been blotted out of the minds of the Sandinist rank and file polled. Approximately 53 percent referred to the need for a national agreement in Nicaragua but they ruled out the probability of President Violeta Chamorro's government backing this idea because, they said, the government must obey the international financial organizations. The Elections' Subject Asked about the 1995 presidential elections, 76 percent say the FSLN will be the winner and that, for this reason, a policy providing an economic alternative for the people should be developed. Nevertheless, they said the methods must be peaceful so the workers will not be harmed. Fourteen percent voiced doubts the FSLN will win the elections without an internal revision. They think this depends on decisions made during the Special Congress, which called for the party to do away with its militarist, socialist, and radical image, and for the Constitution to be amended. Ten percent think the FSLN will not win the 1996 elections if the party does not form alliances. This will require work by active members. This work must be initiated after the Special Congress. In addition, it is necessary to work within the framework of an electoral strategy "without burning out candidates ahead of time." Those polled added that "it is not a matter of buying votes but of gaining the people's confidence in the daily struggle." And the Alliances, With Whom? The intensive political indoctrination the Sandinists were subjected to during the past decade became evident in a study because one sector said no other party exists with a political viewpoint similar to the Sandinist Party's. Those polled recalled the poor precedents set by other alliances throughout history. Others suggested the possibility of the Sandinist Party establishing electoral alliances with the Christian Democratic Union [UDC], the Party of the Nicaraguan Resistance [PRN], and moderate parties, such as PUCA [Central American Unionist Party] and other centralist organizations. The opinion poll included questions regarding the amendments the Constitution will undergo at the National Assembly. Fifty-eight percent think no one should be banned from running for president in 1996; 38 percent favor leaving open the option for re-election, and 4 percent think this reelection should be staggered, as outlined in the reform proposal drafted by seven Assembly factions.
