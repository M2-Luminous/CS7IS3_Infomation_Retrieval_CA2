As far as the Palestinians are concerned, Christopher's visit expresses the continuation of the role of the participating sponsor which the United States has been fulfilling since the Madrid Conference. The U.S. secretary's remarks in Jericho affirmed this sense through the words of encouragement and support. The visit provided an opportunity to Secretary Christopher to be apprised the situation in the interim rule area in all its aspects and from the first days of the Palestinian National Authority's assumption of its task. Needless to say the construction of the new-born Palestinian entity will begin from zero. On this basis, the supporting role of the United States and of other donor countries in building the Palestinian economy and infrastructure must not be delayed, since the interim stage stipulated in the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [DOP] has already begun. The DOP has been supported by the international community as the first step toward the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the region. The Palestinian side has proved, in practice, its commitment to peace and to the agreements signed with the Israeli side. It is up to the parties that are eager to promote and expand the peace project -- amid a harsh and difficult environment -- to create the suitable conditions for rebuilding the Palestinian edifice in all spheres. This is because, on one hand, peace does not endure amid suffering and misery. On the other hand, the repercussions of what takes place on the Palestinian track, whether positively or negatively, will affect the other Arab tracks which are looking forward to the Palestinian example to draw the appropriate lessons and conclusions. Undoubtedly, this visit by the U.S. secretary of state represents the beginning of action by various parties and international forces that support peace. The sons of the Palestinian people are awaiting a practical response to this action after having suffered a long time under total Israeli occupation and its consequences on the Palestinian economic infrastructure in general.
