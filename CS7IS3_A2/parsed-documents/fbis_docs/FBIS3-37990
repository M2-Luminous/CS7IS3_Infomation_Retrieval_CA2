However, he has returned to his work only for a month until the plenary powers of the current deputies corps end. The chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council did not change his decision to abandon politics during his vacation. He reported on this at the news conference which was also attended by our correspondent Yury Polonsky. [Polonsky] Mykola Bagrov looked optimistic and confident to the journalists. Of course, the vacation did him good. He did not spend his vacation in Cyprus, as rumored, but was with his relatives in St. Petersburg. He visited theaters, museums, read a lot, and thought about what had happened in his life. The defeat in the presidential election did not change his views. Mykola Bagrov has not rejected his election program because he considered and considers himself to be a realist. His program did not contain any populist ideas. He proposed the most realistic ways for getting out of the complicated economic situation which, to my regret, is continuing to grow worse. Under this situation, believes the chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea, it is extremely important for the session to formulate and adopt the budget of the Republic -- the session resumes the work on 11 March. All this made him -- despite his statement on the resignation, which, by the way, was not approved by the deputies -- resume the work. [Begin Bagrov recording] You know that today we can formulate the budget on the one-channel principle. However, speaking sincerely, this has always been attractive to us, but currently this will create additional difficulties. We should take this into consideration. Look, currently, the city should receive profits standing at 700 billion rubles [R], but it receives only R8 billion, so, I beg your pardon, the question arises: How should we react? This means that the problems with communal apartments and all the other stuff will stay unsettled. This can lead to the closure of schools, etc. [end recording] [Polonsky] The journalists asked about the attitude of the chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea to the new executive authorities in the Crimea, to the first steps of President Meshkov. [Begin Bagrov recording] You should excuse me, but I expected that much more would have been done by this time. For a while, to my regret, I cannot say this. No one will excuse us for this stalling of reforms, therefore, the executive authorities should properly perform their obligations. [end recording] [Polonsky] Mykola Bagrov is not going to oppose Yuriy Meshkov. This is not a proper time to do this. Today, said the chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea, we should create normal conditions for the work of the executive bodies of the president. In the opinion of the legislative chairman, if Yuriy Meshkov requests some additional authorities, he should be supported. It is possible to introduce these changes into the law on presidency. Currently, people should be guided by vital issues, by interests of the Crimea. He said nothing specific about his personal matters and future. I want to stress, he briefly said, this is not the end of my life.
