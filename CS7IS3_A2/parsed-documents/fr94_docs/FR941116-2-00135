FR941116-2-00135 FR941116-2-00096 The following table shows the approximate gross square feet (GSF) required for the various types of buildings. The examples shown are for centers with 100-percent residential capacity of 275 and 500 students, respectively. The substitution of non-resident for resident students will decrease the dormitory space requirements, but will not affect other buildings. ␣ 1Building type 1GSF per student 1GSF per 275 students 1GSF per 500 students Housing 175 48,125 87,500 Education/Vocation 85 23,375 42,500 Food Services 44 12,100 22,000 Recreation 82 22,550 41,000 Medical/Dental 12 3,300 6,000 Administration 26 7,150 13,000 Storage/Support 57 15,675 28,500 n,n,s Subtotal 132,275 240,500 n,n,d Child Care Center (40 children) 5,760 5,760 n,n,s Subtotal 138,035 246,260 n,n,d Single Parent Dorm (minimum 28) 9,894 9,894 n,n,s Total 147,929 256,154 Note: Space requirements for child care and single parent dormitories are included in the event these activities are proposed.

Availability of Utilities Since the majority of students are residential, it is critical that all basic utilities ( i.e. , sewer, water, electric and gas) are available and in proximity to the site and in accordance with EPA standards. Safety, Health and Accessibility Job Corps is required to comply with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Act (EPA), and the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). The cost involved in complying with these requirements is an important factor in determining the economic feasibility of utilizing a site. For example, a site which contains an excessive amount of asbestos probably would not be cost-effective due to associated removal costs. Further, sites with any environmental hazard that cannot be corrected economically will be at a disadvantage. Cost The availability of low-cost facilities is a major consideration in light of resource limitations. In evaluating facility costs, the major items that must be considered are: •Site acquisition or lease costs, •Site/utility work, •Architectural and engineering services, •New construction requirements, •Rehabilitation and modifications of existing buildings, and •Equipment requirements. An assessment of these initial capital costs as well as consideration of future repair, maintenance and replacement costs will be used in evaluating the economic feasibility of a particular facility. Consideration will be given to the use of raw land which is suitable for a Job Corps center and on which facilities can be constructed economically. Proposal Submission In preparing proposals, eligible applicants should identify sites which meet the evaluation criteria and guidelines specified above. Proposals should address each area with as much detail as practicable to enable the Department to determine the suitability of locating a Job Corps center at the proposed site. In this regard, proposals must contain, at a minimum, the specific information and supporting documentation as described below
