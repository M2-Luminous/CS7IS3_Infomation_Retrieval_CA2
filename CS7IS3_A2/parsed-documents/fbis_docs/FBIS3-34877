The report urged the countries concerned to adopt the most stringent precautionary measures in anticipation of an international plot with many scenarios that could be implemented by citizens of different nationalities and cover a large number of European states, headed by Germany and France. The report noted that crucial meetings were held several weeks ago in Tehran for this purpose at the Iranian foreign intelligence headquarters in Firuzi Palace. The meetings were attended by representatives of the world's most dangerous armed factions and movements, including the Fatah-Revolutionary Council led by Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna]; the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Japanese Red Army; the Irish Republican Army; the Armenian Secret Army, represented by a woman close to its leader, Hakopian, who was assassinated in Athens in 1986; the Lebanese Revolutionary Organization established by Murshid Shabu; and the Lebanese Hizballah. These organizations were represented by senior officials who were responding to an invitation by a high-ranking Iranian authority eager to gather in Tehran an assortment of the world's most prominent armed networks. It has been learned that Mohsen Reza'i, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (Pasdaran); Mohammad Musavi, the information official at the Iranian Embassy in Beirut; other leaders of the Iranian hardline trend; and coordinators of international armed squads participated in these meetings. A Unified Command and Commandos The report, abridged copies of which were received by several West European intelligence agencies that follow Iranian moves closely, revealed that the meetings focused on the establishment of a unified command by Iran for these factions and the preparation of a plan to disperse these networks in most countries of the world, where they would be ready to strike at U.S. and European interests and assassinate politicians and diplomats upon receiving a codeword from Iran. This would happen if Iran were to be exposed to any attack or international blockade or threats seeking to tighten the stranglehold on it, increase its political and economic isolation, and provoke disturbances and internal strife that endanger its security and order. In fact, many intelligence agencies had been following Iranian secret moves with great concern since the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord in Washington on 13 September. Since that time, these agencies have noticed suspicious activities by international networks, Palestinian factions, and fundamentalist organizations and movements opposed to the accord. The thread of all these activities led to Iran. Then the meetings and visits began to intensify. At these meetings, hosted by Tehran, plans were drawn up to establish a front opposed to the Gaza-Jericho accord that would seek to thwart the accord by force. Information indicates that a reward of several million dollars was set for anyone who would assassinate Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and that Iran utilized all its ties and contacts with the international networks to have them participate in a plot starting at the Arab level and ending at the international level. Even mercenaries of various nationalities were recruited to facilitate this mission and divert suspicion. In recent weeks European intelligence organs have become convinced that armed operations will be carried out at a growing pace. These organs received information that acts of opposition to the Palestinian-Israeli accord, which have begun in the occupied territories, will gradually evolve into operations covering the entire Palestinian arena, then Lebanon, and later will shift to other locations in the world, specifically Europe. This information adds that Iran has opened its Army camps, especially (Karnaji) near Qom, to commandos from the General Command, Hizballah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. They received special training by Iranian Revolutionary Guards officers. At the same time, Tehran has asked Sudan to open its camps for training special units of "Afghan Arabs" and fundamentalist exiles living in European countries. In Lebanon, increasing activity has been observed in Hizballah camps in the western al-Biqa' where Iranian military advisers have been training fundamentalist elements who arrived recently from several Arab states in guerrilla warfare, the use of explosives, and car bombings. Intelligence reports have emphasized the presence of elements from the Japanese Red Army in al-Biqa' and Beirut. Those elements have been dispersed in Popular Front-General Command centers and camps in al-Biqa'. These reports say that the Japanese Red Army elements entered Lebanon witht he assistance of the Iranian Embassy and under the supervision of "N.N." who works in the foreign operations branch of the Iranian foreign intelligence service, headed by 'Ali Fallahian. Meanwhile, Asadollah Reza 'Asaker, the Revolutionary Guard official in Lebanon, has intensified his secret meetings with the commanders of Hizballah's internal and external operations units. Activating the European Networks About two weeks ago Western intelligence organs that coordinate antiterrorist operations within the framework of a special secret plan codenamed "Kilowatt," which covers more than 20 Western countries, received reports from their agents in the Middle East -- who work in full coordination with their counterparts in the region -- urging them to forestall derailment of the peace process. Those reports stated that the codeword was sent out at the recent meeting in Firuzi Palace and that the dispersal of armed networks' elements throughout the world had begun, accompanied by "important orders." Apparently, the uncovering of a plot prepared by a group affiliated with the Abu-Nidal Organization to assassinate an Arab official during his participation at the Nonaligned summit in India in the middle of this month is part of the international terrorist conspiracy hatched in Tehran. The disclosure of the arrival in India at the end of last month of Fatah-Revolutionary Council groups induced most Western countries, which received information about the Tehran mobilization meetings of armed fundamentalist, radical, leftist, and separatist movements from different countries, to declare a state of maximum alert in their security and intelligence organs. In fact, reports from several European countries, including France and Germany, indicated that suspicious movements by radical networks and elements had been observed in their territory and that work had begun to reorganize, revive, and activate existing Iranian networks in preparation for implementing fresh missions and operations. It has been learned that al-Haj "'A.J.," who is Lebanese and a Hizballah security official, moved three weeks ago to Iran and held intensive meetings with Iranian security officials aimed at forming and organizing terrorist networks in a number of European countries, especially Germany, a country that is well-known to him and in which he had participated in organizing several operations. Many meetings have reportedly been held in Tehran between this security official and 'Imad Maghniyah, one of Hizballah's most prominent elements, whose name was mentioned in the kidnapping of Western hostages in Beirut alongside that of "'A.J." It is common knowledge that Maghniyah lives in Tehran and holds an Iranian diplomatic passport. Western intelligence reports mention him as general coordinator of the recently reorganized networks in Europe.
