Chairman of the HZDS deputies group Tibor Cabaj commented on it as follows: "I doubt they are from our group because the HZDS leadership adopted a resolution, whereby in the case of the dismissal of the government we would turn into opposition." Cabaj said he could not rule out that this could happen. These deputies should reconsider their further HZDS membership. It is undignified to wait for expulsion, he said. It is the duty of the SDL to join the provisional government, regardless of its composition, said Weiss. But it will be, indeed, a temporary government because the SDL feels very strongly about early elections, Weiss added. Anton Hrnko, a deputy for the National Democratic Club said: "I believe that Vladimir Meciar will keep his written promise he gave to his daughter that if he is dismissed for the second time, he will never return to politics."
