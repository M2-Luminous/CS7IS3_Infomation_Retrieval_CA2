However, almost half of the executive officers of the top 100 industrial companies expected the political situation in the country to deteriorate. The survey conducted by Unisa's [University of South Africa] Bureau for Market Research showed that business leaders were optimistic that unemployment would not rise this year, but would stabilize.
