FR941013-2-00064 FR941013-2-00053 III It is further ordered That: A. If Sulzer has (1) not divested the Amdry 2010 Information within six (6) months of the date this Order becomes final, or (2) not submitted affidavits as required by Paragraph II.C. of this Order, within nine (9) months of the date the Commission approves the divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information, then the Commission may appoint a trustee to divest both the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information only to an acquirer that receives the prior approval of the Commission, and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information is to enable the acquirer to become a viable competitor in the aluminum polyester powder market, and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the Acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to Section 5 ( l ) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45( l ), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, Sulzer shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to Section 5 ( l ) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by respondent to comply with this Order. B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. of this Order, respondent shall consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities: 1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Sulzer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in the marketing or manufacturing of chemicals. If respondent has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to respondent of the identity of any proposed trustee, respondent shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee. 2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest both the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information and to take all such steps as may be feasible and necessary to assist the acquirer of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information to receive all product approvals from the original equipment manufacturers necessary for the purchase of an Amdry 2010 Equivalent or a Metco 601 Equivalent by such manufacturer or by any other person pursuant to standards and qualifications established by such manufacturer. Such assistance shall include but not be limited to the following: a. Requiring respondent to pay all costs of testing by or for the original equipment manufacturers for product approvals of an Amdry 2010 Equivalent or a Metco 601 Equivalent; b. Requiring respondent to provide any training relevant to the production of an Amdry 2010 Equivalent or a Metco 601 Equivalent to the acquirer; c. Requiring respondent to offer any technical assistance necessary to assist the acquirer in its development of an Amdry 2010 Equivalent or a Metco 601 Equivalent; and d. Requiring respondent to provide any additional information or know-how reasonably necessary to the acquirer. 3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, respondent shall execute a trust agreement that, subject to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture of both the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information and to provide the additional assistance as required by Paragraph III.B.2. of this Order.
