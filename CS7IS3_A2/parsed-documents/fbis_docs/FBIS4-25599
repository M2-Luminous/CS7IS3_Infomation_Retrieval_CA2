Ji Tong Communications Co Ltd, a shareholding company set up last September, is in charge of the Golden Bridge and Golden Customs projects. Golden Bridge will be a national public economic-information network linking 500 cities and more than 10,000 information resources including large enterprises, institutes and government departments. Ji Tong will soon start construction of the network's main centre and branch centres in 20 large cities, said Lu Shouqun, president of Ji Tong. Golden Customs, whose goal is paperless foreign trade, will be in operation before the end of the year, he revealed. Ji Tong is co-operating with Great Wall Computer Group Co and IBM Corp of the U.S. to conduct pilot works for the Golden Card project in 10 coastal cities, which aims to replace cash with electronic money -- credit cards. Lu said Ji Tong will also co-operate with the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television to build and operate multimedia cable TV networks. The cost of building this information infrastructure will be enormous. Lu said Ji Tong will raise capital through various channels, including foreign funds. Ji Tong is also actively seeking cooperation with foreign firms, he said. It has established a $30 million joint venture with Bell South Corp, an American regional telephone company, to engage in telecommunications and cable TV network projects. Ji Tong signed an agreement with IBM to set up a multimedia information network research and development company to provide technical support for the Three Golden projects. The investment for the joint venture's first stage is $10 million. Both sides will inject more money in the future. Ji Tong has two more joint ventures, with companies from Malaysia and Hong Kong. Each day Ji Tong deals with five to eight multinational corporations eager to participate in building China's ambitious information networks. Lu said the government hopes the Three Golden projects will stimulate the development of domestic information and electronics industries. China will import some equipment but most will be supplied by domestic manufacturers and joint ventures. Foreign companies with high technologies are welcome to co-operate with domestic producers. Ji Tong will choose some large and medium-sized State enterprises to set up its production bases, Lu said. Lu will soon go to the United States, Germany and France to inspect their progress in developing information superhighways.
