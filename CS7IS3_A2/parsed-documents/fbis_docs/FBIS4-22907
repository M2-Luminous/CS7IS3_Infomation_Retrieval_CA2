Pavlenko, V.V. Izzheurova, I.I. Prudkaya, Bioorganic Chemistry and Petrochemistry Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 576.095.3:628.35] [Abstract] The urgency of intensifying biological waste water treatment methods, particularly by adding spent and partially mineralized sludge, in order to lower capital and operating outlays and the experience of biological sewage treatment at the Lisichansk Oil Refinery (LNPZ) where partially mineralized sludge is used as a biogenic additive are discussed, and it is noted that this method may be economically efficient for many other plants. The possibility of substituting ammophos used as a biogenic additive at many plants for stimulating the development of activated sludge microorganisms in aeration tanks by partially mineralized sludge from the sludge ground at the Lisichansk Oil Refinery is investigated; in so doing, the biological additives are balanced for various nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations whereby ammonium chloride is used as the principal nitrogen source. Activated sludge was incubated for 17 days in rocking test tubes. The study demonstrates the possibility of using spent sludge as a bioadditive for enhancing biocenosis of activated sludge; addition of partially mineralized sludge balanced for the above biological elements improves the biological treatment indicators relative to petroleum product removal and raises the number of microorganisms which destroy hydrocarbons. Even partial substitution of agents with spent sludge makes it possible to save mineral raw materials and move a step closer toward developing waste-free practices of enhancing biological waste water treatment while ammophos may be substituted with ammonium chloride, thus lowering waste water contamination with phosphorus.
