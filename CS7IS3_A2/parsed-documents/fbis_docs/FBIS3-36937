This was stated today by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha. He was addressing delegates at the fifth congress of the Private Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives Association [AKKOR]. The deputy prime minister gave a positive assessment of the work in 1993 of the private farmers who have been "by their example showing the whole of the peasantry how it is necessary in very complex conditions to strive to achieve production efficiency. Unfortunately, as a whole there is still not enough of this efficiency." The deputy prime minister stated that the government is now earnestly engaged in untying the "tight knots." In particular he stated that "a government decision is being prepared that will define the relationship between the state and the agricultural producers in 1994." On long-term problems, Aleksandr Zaveryukha suggested to those assembled that they become earnestly engaged in setting up peasant banks and organizing insurance companies that could help private farmers resolve questions of credit and compensation for losses arising from unforeseen circumstances. The fifth congress of AKKOR is to continue its work on 10 February.
