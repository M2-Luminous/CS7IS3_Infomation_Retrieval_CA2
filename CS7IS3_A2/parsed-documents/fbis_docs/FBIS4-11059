[passage omitted] During a meeting with the media Fujimori announced that $875 million obtained from the privatization process will be earmarked for social expenditures, as part of a preliminary agreement with the IMF within the framework of the letter of intent. [Fujimori] According to this agreement reached with the IMF, we will be able to use the resources obtained from the privatization process as an advance on the financial aid we may obtain in the coming months, the coming year, from the World Bank and the IDB. [Reporter] Fujimori also confirmed the murder by SL members of indigenous Ashaninkas in the towns of Quilla and Masamari. [Fujimori] The number of dead seems to have increased, and this is very regrettable. The Army has surrounded the SL members near the Ene River near the town of Quiteni. I also want to categorically deny a press report that the Army used helicopters to bomb the terrorists. This is not true, nor is it true that I have held a dialogue with [SL leader Osman] Morote. What the president has done is to show that Morote and his supporters are being held in highly secure prisons. [end recording]
