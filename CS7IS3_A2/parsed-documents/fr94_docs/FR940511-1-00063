FR940511-1-00063 FR940511-1-00012 The existing policy was adopted to be consistent with the regulations concerning exemption from participation in the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program found in part 250. Exemptions from participation in JOBS are available for a number of reasons, including physical or mental incapacity. Since incapacity would provide a long and perhaps permanent period of exemption from activities that would prepare an individual for entry into the work force, a high standard of professional verification by a physician or licensed or certified psychologist was adopted. After experience with the child care programs, we do not believe that receiving child care services under parts 255 and 256 requires such rigorous verification. In addition, when the CCDBG program and the At-Risk Child Care program were implemented after JOBS, both programs, by regulation, provided for care of a child over age 13 who is physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself. The regulations for those programs at parts 98 and 257, respectively, permit the State to make the determination of physical or mental incapacity. Those regulations also require States to include a definition of the term ``physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself'' in the applicable State Plan. We propose to amend the child care regulations at parts 255 and 256 to be compatible with the regulations of the other child care programs. These proposed changes will ease State administration of child care programs while continuing to ensure that eligibility is properly documented. We therefore propose to amend §§255.2(a) and 256.2(a) to provide State flexibility in determining physical or mental incapacity. We also propose to add §§255.1(m) and 256.1(a)(5) to require the State to provide its definitions of physical or mental incapacity in the applicable State Plan. Gaps in Employment and Child Care Under Title IV&hyph;A We propose to modify the regulatory language at §255.2(d)(2) to allow States the additional option to continue child care for families that lose a job but are searching for another job. Under the proposed regulation at §255.2(d)(2)(ii) care can be continued for up to one month of job search if the care arrangements would otherwise be lost. This is an expansion of the existing regulation which provides for a continuation of care for up to one month only if an activity is scheduled to begin within that month and the arrangements would otherwise be lost. We believe that giving States this additional option to continue child care for a limited period of job search is supportive of families who may have to change employment and recognizes that it is not always possible to secure another job immediately following a job loss. Under the existing regulations, States have had the option to extend child care services that would otherwise be lost for a limited period both when another activity is already scheduled to begin within that period and when there is a short period of absence from an on-going job. The proposed regulation broadens the State's ability to serve families for whom continuity of care would assist their movement towards self-sufficiency. We also propose to amend the At-Risk regulations at §257.30(c) to be consistent with the proposed change at §255.2(d)(2)(ii) to allow States the option to continue child care for up to one month for families that lose a job but are searching for another job. Additionally, we propose to amend §257.30(c) to delete the requirement that child care for the two-week period prior to the start of a job may be provided only if ``the child care arrangements would otherwise be lost.'' We believe that the two-week period may be needed to provide child care in order to prepare for employment. We propose that at State option child care may be available for up to two weeks before employment without restriction. In making these changes to the regulations at §§255.2(d) and 257.30(c), we recognized that the existing regulations for care under part 256 (TCC) are silent on the provision of child care during gaps between jobs. In JOBS&hyph;FSA&hyph;AT&hyph;90&hyph;8, dated June 29, 1990, we clarified that families are eligible for TCC during gaps in employment. This proposed rule at §256.2(f) thus codifies existing policy and mirrors the amended policy concerning gaps in employment in parts 255 and 257. Care provided during a break in employment, that is, when the family is not working, does not extend the family's 12-month eligibility period. We propose to make a corresponding amendment to the regulations at §256.1(a) for the State Supportive Services Plan which addresses Transitional Child Care. We propose that the plan reflect whether the State has elected to allow child care during gaps in employment under TCC pursuant to the proposed §256.2(f).
