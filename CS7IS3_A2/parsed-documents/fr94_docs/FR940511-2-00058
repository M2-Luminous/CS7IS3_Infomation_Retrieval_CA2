FR940511-2-00058 FR940511-2-00039 [Docket No. TM94&hyph;4&hyph;34&hyph;000] Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff May 5, 1994. Take notice that on May 2, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of its FERC Gas Tariff, the following tariff sheet, to become effective June 1, 1994: Third Revised Sheet No. 8A FGT states that the tariff sheet referenced above is being filed pursuant to Section 25 (Flowthrough Billing Mechanism) of the General Terms and Conditions of FGT's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1. Section 25 sets forth the mechanism by which FGT is permitted to flow through fixed charge allocations of buy-out and buy-down costs billed to FGT by Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern). This mechanism was approved by Commission Order dated June 16, 1989, in Docket No. RP89&hyph;44&hyph;001. FGT further states that it is suspending its Annual Unit Take-or-Pay Surcharge effective June 1, 1994, because of the cessation of Southern's fixed charge allocations to FGT after May, 1994. Because of the suspension by the FERC of procedural schedules in the proceedings affecting Southern's allocations of fixed charges and the absence of actual information regarding April and May, 1994, throughput and recoveries, FGT states that it will make a supplemental filing within ninety (90) days of the end of the Annual Recovery Period ending May 31, 1994 and make any related tariff changes at that time. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 in accordance with §§385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before May 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
