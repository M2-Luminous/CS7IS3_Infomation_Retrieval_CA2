Subscribers to this network will be able to connect to it from anywhere inside the country and from abroad by dialing a number. Initially, newspaper reports, information on train and flight schedules, and a telephone directory will be entered in the database. The ABRAR newspaper will soon join this network. An informed source in the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephones told our correspondent that once this network is operational, subscribers will be able to obtain their required information within seconds. For example, if a subscriber on the other side of the world requires a particular newspaper, he can contact the network and obtain the required information within seconds. One of the evening newspapers that is scheduled to join the network will be disseminated simultaneously in Tehran and in a European country. The informed source said most of the Western and some Asian countries have such networks. As for the costs of subscribing to this network, he said they would be announced later but that they would in any case be low and result in a savings of time. The network center will be located in the Shahed telecommunications complex, which is at the end of the Kordestan Autobahn. Technical Information IRANPAC: This is a general information network being planned for communications among computers and terminals in the country and with other networks in the world. The IRANPAC packet switching network will be capable of providing reliable, precise, effective, and economical connections among the information centers. Different Transmission Speeds By using Random Access Memory processes in the network and logical channels, IRANPAC will be capable of a simultaneous two-way exchange of information between two subscribers at different speeds. How do we gain access to IRANPAC? The following measures should be taken to gain access to IRANPAC: Set up a communications line between the network center and the subscriber's DTE [Data Terminal Equipment] to obtain data by the following means: 1. [no subsequent numbers below as published] Private communications: The subscriber is linked through a permanent line to the nearest packet switching network center via the IRANPAC network so that he can be linked to the network without any loss of time whenever he likes. Under this arrangement, the asynchronous DTE speed of his private line can be 300-1,200 bits per second and the synchronous DTE speed can be 4,800-9,600 bits per second. To gain access by dialing: Under this method, the subscriber uses a preassigned telephone number and calls from any of the ports in the network that are closest to the IRANPAC switching center and offered to the subscribers. The subscribers can in this manner obtain a Network User Identification so that when they call up the IRANPAC network, their identification is verified; if they are bona fide subscribers, they are connected to the desired address. The speed in this case is 1,300 or 1,200-2,400 bits per second.
