For an enterprise, it is also a paramount issue that will decide whether or not it will hold its own on the market where competition is becoming more and more ferocious. Thus far we have been less than adept at handling these two major issues, with the result that the transformation of S&T achievements is plagued by eight major problems. For the enterprise, there is no running away from these obstacles either. What are these eight obstacles? How can we overcome them? This article will run a series of five articles starting today. We will begin by discussing the eight factors that hamper the transformation of S&T achievements into productive forces. Next we will look at S&T work in the United States and Japan and find out how S&T achievements there are turned into productive forces. Will the series of articles set our readers thinking and making mental associations? Will they come up with some good suggestions about S&T work in China and the transformation of S&T achievements? Jot them down and mail them to us; S&T work needs participation and strategizing by the public. -- The effective energy utilization rate in China is only two-thirds that of advanced nations. -- The large-area dissemination and application rate of S&T achievements in China is merely 15 percent. -- Only 4 percent of China's high-tech products are exported. -- Only 34.5 percent of China's national-level major S&T achievements are commercialized. - China spends a mere 0.71 percent of its gross domestic output on research and development [R&D]. -- There are eight major problems in the transformation of S&T achievements in China. Importance and Urgency The Chinese economy has been expanding rapidly in recent years. Rapid growth, however, masks such problems as poor productivity, low profits, irrationality in the industrial structure, and lack of competitiveness. These problems will inevitably crimp further economic growth. China's international trade has grown significantly in the last few years, with exports almost hitting $400 million in 1992. Ten years ago, China accounted for 1 percent of global trade; now its share has risen to 2.5 percent. Manufactured goods used to make up 50 percent of Chinese exports; to date they constitute 80 percent. Nevertheless, most of the increase in exports still occurs in labor-intensive industries like textiles and footwear. Chinese exports enjoy an edge--in price, not in quality or technological content. China is a relatively resource-poor nation. In this nation that requires 1.1 billion tons of standard coal each year to keep the economy growing, however, the effective energy utilization rate is only two-thirds that of advanced nations. In China, for instance, it takes 400 grams of coal to generate one kwh of electricity, 100 grams more than other nations. We consume 30 percent more energy than elsewhere to manufacture a ton of steel, 70 percent more to make a ton of cement, and 100 percent more to turn out a ton of glass. To sum up, China must rely on S&T progress and accelerate the transformation of S&T achievements if the Chinese economy is to continue to grow steadily and healthily for a long time to come. Present Situation And Gap Some research units have calculated the rates of contribution of S&T progress to economic growth since reform went under way and the open policy was introduced: 16 percent in the 1980's and rising to 20 percent in the 1990's. Transactions on the technology market rose from 2.1 billion yuan in 1985 to 15.6 billion yuan in 1992, a 640 percent gain. The rate of the large-area dissemination and application of S&T achievements is only 15 percent. According to classified standards statistics compiled by the General Administration of Customs, while high-tech products made up 4 percent of China's total exports in the 1980's, the corresponding figures for other newly industrialized countries [NIC's] during the same period ranged from 10 to 15 percent. New products accounted for 32 percent of total sales by U.S. firms in 1986; the projected figure for the 1990's is 50 percent. We can see from the above data that although China has made significant headway in S&T achievements transformation since reform went under way and the open policy was introduced, it still trails the developed nations and the NIC's. Without a wealth of new products with S&T content, it will be impossible for China to beat the competition on the world market in the months and years ahead. Thus identifying the structure that will accelerate S&T achievements transformation has become a hot topic in the S&T policy debate in China. Problems and Difficulties -- Institutional barriers. Scientific research versus production. High-tech research versus traditional industrial transformation. Making use of industry-based technical centers versus raising the technical standard of enterprises. Importing technology versus developing it on our own. Problems abound when it comes to planning comprehensively and coordinating and balancing the two sets of issues, revolving around the nation's priority tasks. Our S&T work is characterized by large-area low-level duplication. Numerous S&T achievements are not effectively and promptly applied in production. The same piece of technology may be imported many times over, which prevents what limited funds we have from being utilized properly. All these problems are commonplace. They involve not only the macro-management of the economic system and S&T system, but also the sound division of labor and optimal configuration of such systems. To effectively marry S&T with the economy at a high level, we must improve the existing S&T management system and economic planning management system and establish a mechanism whereby scientific research organizations and institutions of higher education can participate in major national economic projects. Developed nations have taken a host of measures in recent years to speed up S&T advances, economic growth, and S&T achievements transformation. Take the United States, for instance. The U.S. Government has stepped up the macro-management of science and technology in recent years, doubling its attention to the role played by research and consulting in S&T decision-making. Former President George Bush elevated his scientific adviser to presidential assistant, equal in standing to the assistant to the president for national security affairs, who could participate in national economic and security policy-making at the top level. In February 1990 he revived the Presidential Scientific Advisory Commission and put it on a par with the Council of Economic Advisers. This was followed by the restructuring and strengthening of the Federal Scientific, Engineering, and Technological Coordinating Committee to enable it to play an even more extensive role in inter-departmental S&T policy coordination. It was precisely because of the heavy involvement of the U.S. Government that the United States was able to turn the tide in the global computer chip war and beat Japan. -- Weak consciousness. With its huge population and poor foundation, China is economically and culturally backward. In China the development of social productive forces is hampered by a variety of serious constraints: demographic, resource, and environmental. Traditionally we have tried to develop the economy by consuming huge amounts of resources. Efficiency was low and social productivity was equivalent to barely 5 percent of the best in the world. We will be doomed if we do not size up the times and grasp the opportunity with a sense of urgency and a sense of crisis and truly base economic construction on S&T advances and the improvement of the quality of the labor force. The new global technological revolution is more than an economic challenge to us, it is also a political challenge. The more economically and culturally backward a nation, the greater its need to make science, technology, and education its top priority and put them to use to achieve a quantum leap in the development of productive forces and productivity. In this area we should be more alert, more conscious. The relations between S&T, on the one hand, and the economy, on the other, has never been properly straightened out over the years. Agencies which manage S&T and their counterparts in charge of the economy have been converging institutionally and overlapping functionally. In the process, we have ignored to achieve a sound division of labor between the two. Meanwhile, departmentalism, localism, both byproducts of the small-agriculture mentality, and the idea of preventing an outflow of profits have also inhibited the formation of a fruitful partnership between S&T and the economy. If cadres at all levels continue to fail to truly appreciate the importance of S&T and remain content with the kind of short-term progress resulting from continued extensive development, if they still do not realize the danger posed by the widening gap with the West and fail to think in terms of the nation's general interests, then the future looks grim as far as China's four-modernization drive is concerned. -- Institutional malfunctioning. In a market economy the law of value plays a dominant role and all means of production circulate on the market and participate in competition. Hence the formation of the average rate of return. As organic capital formation increases, moreover, there is a tendency for the average rate of return to decline steadily, forcing enterprises to scramble for relative surplus value by working harder to improve production technology. At a time when international competition is getting ferocious, in particular, a number of illegal channels "leading to excessive profits" are often blocked, thus leaving S&T competition the sole forum for legitimate competition. The enterprises' urgent demand for S&T progress is precisely why the market economy can accelerate the transformation of S&T achievements. However, even in developed capitalist nations with a market economy, government spending on S&T channeled through the planning mechanism almost equals what industry itself invests in S&T. The reason is this. While S&T typically wrestles with mid- and long-term economic development problems, market demand is basically short-term or near-term. Macro-planning by the state, therefore, is needed to compensate for this weakness. Thus, if we organically and flexibly deploy the two mechanisms--market and planning, S&T will successfully drive economic growth in a sustained manner and an endless flow of S&T achievements will be transformed into competitive new products. S&T planning under a planned economy differs from S&T planning under a market economy. The former is technology-led, shaped mainly by what is in the plan and the technology development plan. The latter is market-driven, essentially a response to short-term and long-term market demand. S&T achievements transformation is much more rapid under the latter. -- Sluggish demand. Enterprises are the principal transformers of S&T achievements, but their demand for S&T is less than robust. The reasons are multifaceted. Based on the findings of surveys on some enterprises and scientific research institutions, they can be summarized as follows: 1) Since China is still in transition from a planned economy to a market economy, enterprises still have not realized their own decision-making authority. According to a survey on 6,800 large and mid-sized enterprises across the nation, only 15 percent have been truly vitalized. Government intervention remains excessive. 2) For the two-thirds of the nation's large- and medium-sized enterprises which are still losing money, these are tough times. They lack the economic means to go after S&T progress. 3) Enterprise leaders do not have a strong awareness of science and technology. 4) Funds are lacking for transforming S&T achievements. According to statistics, of the achievements already transformed, self-raised funds were used in 56.8 percent of the cases; government funds allocated under the S&T plan, 21.6 percent; loans, 5.2 percent; and venture capital, a mere 2.3 percent. The transformation of S&T achievements embraces the entire process from the laboratory to industrialized production, of which the most difficult stages are intermediate testing and industrialized trial production. They require investment on a large scale but is highly risky. 5) There are no common interests between enterprises and scientific research units. Enterprises complain that the units turn out immature achievements, poor in quality but high-priced. Scientific research units criticize enterprises for not understanding the value of technical commodities. The gap between enterprises and research units has never been properly bridged. Studies have been conducted on the standard of technology currently provided by research units in the country. Of the large enterprises surveyed, 77.4 percent considered it "average," 19.6 percent said it is "not high," and only 3 percent deemed it "fairly high." Even among small- and medium-sized enterprises, 59 percent said it is "average" and 28 percent regarded it as "not high." In addition, 38 percent of large enterprises and 62 percent of small- and medium-sized enterprises considered existing technology transfer costs "too high." In contrast, 90 percent of scientific research thought they are "too low." 6) R&D funds are not actually made available. Under State Council regulations, enterprises may set aside 1 percent of their sales revenue to fund R&D. According to statistics, however, one third of enterprises set aside 1 percent while two-thirds fail to do so. According to surveys on the metallurgical, chemical, mechanical, and electronic industries, the set-aside rates are, respectively, 0.5 percent (1.5 percent), 1.1 percent (3.3 percent), 1 percent (4.5 percent), and 5.5 percent (10 percent). (Figures in parentheses are averages of similar industries overseas) The spending gap between China and other countries is 1:3 on the average. 7) Scientific research units balk at transferring their achievements and would rather commercialize them themselves. Statistics show that of all national-level major achievements, 34.5 percent were transferred and commercialized while 56.2 percent were commercialized by the research units themselves. The reason is that transfer fees were lower than R&D costs in 50 percent of the projects transferred. With transfer, moreover, there is no guarantee that intellectual property rights would be protected. Of the projects surveyed, no protective measures were taken in 45.7 percent of the cases. 8) Enterprises have meager capacity for technology development. Statistically, 54 percent of large and mid-sized enterprises have their own technological development offices, but only one-third are really doing their job. Enterprises account for just 29.5 percent of all professional and technical personnel in the nation, only 24.6 percent of them senior personnel. 9) Enterprises prefer importing foreign technology and equipment to using domestic S&T achievements. According to studies on the machinery and electronic industries, 39.8 percent of the new technology applied was imported while barely 2.8 percent was domestic in origin. Altogether China spent more than $100 billion in the past decade importing technology and equipment, far higher than what the nation spent on R&D at home. The reasons are manifold, eg., imported technology is mature, dependable, and of a higher standard, and can be swiftly put to work. Importing foreign technology also provides opportunities for overseas training. As part of corporate restructuring in recent times, a new form of enterprise has emerged in the United States. For the specific purpose of developing a particular product, a number of companies and scientific research institutions may get together to form an "ad hoc" company. When the mission in question is accomplished, the company is disbanded. U.S. corporations too have been undergoing restructuring in recent years. They discover that the bigger a company, the more bureaucratic it becomes. This is the main organizational reason why the United States has lost out to Japan in international competition over the past few years. Japanese companies are structurally connected both horizontally and vertically. Big companies and big corporations are composed of small companies level upon level, with the small companies enjoying a substantial measure of independence. These days big U.S. corporations are scrambling to break up into smaller units to make themselves more flexible. It was against this backdrop that the idea of an "ad hoc" company was born. [8 Apr p 3] [Text] There are eight major problems in S&T achievements transformation in China. -- Under-investment. Not enough is being spent on S&T achievements transformation relative to R&D funding. The shortfall differs from industry to industry, but usually ranges from hundreds of percent to 1,000 percent. Without increasing investment, all the talk about accelerating S&T achievements transformation will remain empty talk. The question is: Who will pay and how? How much money should be invested in a particular stage of the transformation process should depend on its riskiness and nature. S&T achievements derive from R&D. To ensure an unbroken flow of achievements, we must begin by boosting investment in R&D. Although they are currently in the grip of an economic recession, developed nations around the world have been boosting their R&D spending sharply relative to the GNP, almost reaching 3 percent. It may be that people who control the purse strings in those countries truly appreciate the importance of S&T in the modern world. Moreover, the leaders of a number of NIC's and developing nations who have seen the light are also scrambling to increase S&T investment. By the end of the century S&T funding will reach 5 percent in South Korea and 2 percent in India, up from the current 0.9 percent. Other countries like Brazil, Egypt, and Thailand are also rushing to augment S&T spending. In China, R&D spending accounted for 0.72 percent of the GNP in 1991 and dropped to 0.71 percent in 1992. The decline had something to do with the rapid expansion of the GNP in 1992, but it also shows that R&D spending has failed to keep pace with GNP. If we persist in our present mentality and continue to force economic growth by desperately expanding the scale of operations and boosting sham GNP through waste, instead of relying on S&T to bring about economic development, China will be overtaken by other developing nations, never mind catching up with the advanced nations. We must commit ourselves to increasing S&D spending to 1.5 percent of the GNP by the end of the century, up from the current 0.71 percent. Enterprises should increase investment in S&T even as the government does likewise. Venture capital should be used to finance the transformation of most S&T achievements. According to estimates by venture capital companies overseas, in the 1970's it was possible to make a profit when one project out of ten survived and in the 1980's, two out of 10. The transformation of high-tech achievements will not be a success unless we go all out to put the venture capital business on a sound footing. There are over 600 venture capital investment companies in the United States with a combined capital exceeding $100 billion. About 3,000 high-tech companies rely on these funds to finance their operations. For the most successful venture capital companies in the United States, the annual rate of return can run as high as 50 percent. More typically the rate of return is around 35 percent. Intermediate testing, industrial testing, and production, all stages in the transformation of S&T achievements, should mainly be financed by credit. State banks should set aside funds specifically to make S&T loans. Between them, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank made S&T loans totalling 3.84 billion yuan during the Seventh Five-Year Plan and over 3 billion yuan in 1991 alone. But this is far from sufficient. By 1995 S&T lending should exceed 10 billion yuan. Already S&T lending in the Seventh Five-Year Plan has paid off. The 3.84 billion yuan in S&T loans extended by the banks had financed 6,300 projects as of 1990, boosting output value by 15 billion yuan and profits and taxes by 3.4 billion yuan and earning $850 million in foreign exchange. -- Lack of personnel mobility. The most effective way to speed up S&T achievements transformation is to enable such achievements to move with their vehicles--S&T personnel. But since there are all sorts of barriers to the circulation of qualified personnel, the magnitude of such circulation is severely limited. Involved here is a host of issues tied up in social and economic reform: housing, health insurance, old age insurance, permanent residency registration, education for their children, and the job title system. It is proposed that the government speed up the reform of the social security system, particularly unemployment insurance, pension insurance, and health insurance. In addition, housing reform should be accelerated. When achievements circulate along with qualified personnel, disputes will occur over intellectual property rights. The state should draw up the appropriate policies, laws, and regulations to encourage circulation and protect intellectual property rights at the same time. With qualified personnel immobile and small and mid-sized enterprises, particularly township and town enterprises, desperate for expertise, there has arisen the "second job" issue. Wages of S&T personnel should be decontrolled and the government should collect taxes based on a progressive income tax system. The job titles of S&T personnel may be divided into national-level and local-level ones. National-level job titles may be evaluated in accordance with national standards while local ones should be evaluated by the units themselves. To sum up, the government should introduce a "three-decontrol" policy with regard to S&T institutions and S&T personnel, namely decontrolling the hiring of personnel, decontrolling the distribution system, and decontrolling job titles. In accordance with the principle of "stabilizing one end and deregulating one part," the management of S&T institutions should vary depending on their type. There should be strong government support for institutions conducting basic research and public-interest research. Institutions and scholars who receive official aid should be evaluated every few years and measures taken depending on evaluation results. Open market-oriented research organizations should be left to the market; such organizations should be given decision-making authority in their operations and held accountable for their own profits and losses. With the exception of scientific research institutions which handle state secrets and commercial secrets, other research institutions should be thrown open to society across the board. Controls on equipment, machinery, and personnel should be lifted. The fee-for-use and fee-for-service system may be adopted to accelerate S&T achievements transformation. "Going outside" is not enough; we should also take pains to "invite them in." Major scientific research institutions may consider vitalizing a section or office first by allowing it to join forces with one part of an enterprise to form a "flexible company." Once the task in question is completed, the company will be dissolved. Decontrol S&T personnel. Allow them to circulate freely in accordance with market supply and demand. The government should take pains to adopt a variety of incentives to encourage S&T personnel. As far as the acceleration of S&T achievements transformation is concerned, in the past most incentives were targeted at people in R&D, while little was done to encourage people who had made outstanding contributions to design, intermediate testing, and production development. High-tech and new technology development zones have been instrumental in high-tech development. A number of special policies should be introduced on a trial basis in the high-tech development zones with hopes of accelerating high-tech commercialization, industrialization, and internationalization. To boost investment in high-tech, for instance, the Australian government has formulated a "150 percent tax rebate policy." Here in China, the government has adopted a "three-exemptions-and-two-cuts" policy in high-tech development zones. For people engaged in genuine R&D, incentives should be made even more attractive in the future. This is because high-tech development is highly intellectual and highly risky and requires substantial inputs, so incentives should be augmented. Let us take a look at the current state of China's high-tech development zones. The Zhongguan Cun development zone boasts the highest concentration rate of expertise in the world, yet other than the Stone Group, whose sales exceed 1 billion yuan, everybody else operates on a fairly modest scale. The biggest problem is that it is everybody for itself in the zone. There is no systems design, no coordination. Instead the companies are like stragglers and disbanded soldiers, each fighting its battle on its own. At best the zone can be described as a place where a number of high-tech companies are concentrated. It has not yet developed the collective edge of a high-tech development zone. -- Importation mismanagement. When it comes to importing and transforming advanced foreign technology promptly, Japan must be the most successful in the world. In the 20 years between 1968 and 1988, Japan spent $6.3 billion importing a total of 30,000 pieces of technology. Had Japan tried to develop the technology itself, it would have cost them 14 times more in R&D funding and taken four times as long. By importing the technology, Japan reaped $1,000 billion in direct profits. What a big pay-off! There is no denying the contribution of technical imports to the sustained and rapid growth of the Chinese economy in the 13 years since reform went under way and the open policy was introduced. According to 1990 statistics, China spent $100 billion importing technology and equipment in the previous 10 years, about $15 to $18 billion on the importing of technology alone. While no exact data exist on the direct benefits of such imports, the macroeconomic results have been quite good. However, the management of importation has many problems, which can be summarized as follows: The phenomenon of "imports hurting domestic industries." There were many technologies and much equipment which China was able to provide. Still, vast sums were spent buying from overseas. Not only was precious foreign exchange wasted, but these imports also dealt a blow to domestic industries and S&T work. "Duplicate importation." According to 1988 data, 113 color TV production lines were imported, as well as 33 low-quality micro-electronic parts production lines, 70 refrigerator production lines, and 15 copier production lines. In the case of color TV production lines, the rate of capacity utilization is less than 50 percent. Little spent on absorption, assimilation, and innovation relative to the spending on importation. Japan spends between $5 to $7 on absorption, assimilation, and innovation for every $1 it spends on importing. China spends very little on the former. At one point in the past, China put together a "12 dragon" absorption and assimilation plan but implemented only part of it for lack of funding. Take, for instance, China's iron and steel enterprises. They have a $6 billion import budget but spend a mere 490,000 yuan on absorption and assimilation. -- Incomplete laws and regulations. As noted above, the transformation of S&T achievements has been badly hurt by disputes between enterprises and scientific research organizations over intellectual property rights. Successful technology transfer must take place within the appropriate legal framework. A legal framework is needed to give technology transfer a favorable environment. It is suggested that the government accelerate S&T law-making to protect intellectual property rights. This is a prerequisite for accelerating S&T achievements transformation.
