Meanwhile, the president of the Crimea knows better than anyone else that political stability on the peninsula depends not on Simferopol -- the key to stability is in other capitals. "In Kiev and Moscow, Meshkov was referred to as a hostage of political stability, who would be easy to blame in the event of any exacerbation of the Crimean issue. "It is no wonder that the Crimean president who is now rooted to the Crimean corridors of power, looks for new hostages among Moscow politicians, not among little-known Simferopol officials: yet another sensation marking Meshkov's visit was his proposal to Yevgeniy Saburov, who, it would seem, was irrevocably pushed away from real economic power, to head a Crimean government". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Yevgeniy Saburov. "It is precisely representatives from Ukraine, who constitute the flower of Russian economic science. Yavlinskiy is from Lvov, Yasin from Odessa, Belkin from Kharkov," Saburov said. "Moscow has been all the time replenished wth cadres from the provinces... I return to the Crimea with the sole aim -- to promote economic reforms on the peninsula. Its potential has not been used to the full so far... It is too early to speak about a specific programme. It is necessary to cast a more attentive look around on the spot". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA runs a sensational item, in which it is asserted that Georgian ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia "is alive and will soon place himself at the head of a Georgian government-in- exile in a foreign country. This was stated in a rather categorical form by a Georgian Zviadista delegation who paid an unofficial visit to Stavropol, to their sympathisers, Russian nationalists, and the Georgian diaspora". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the fifth anniversary of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and on the consequences of that war for Russian society: "The main thing is to show care for Afghan war veterans -- commissioned and non-commissioned officers -- for them to remain on active duty and form the backbone of a new professional army, to draw on the combat experience as the basis of the training of troops, and to protect the people socially and morally". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on rumours about change in banknote denomination and the rouble rate: "The rumours that the denomination of banknotes is expected to be changed and the rouble rate is expected to be set in a one-to-one ratio against the U.S. dollar are a sheer invention". The newspaper quotes Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, as saying that he believes that "the question of a change in banknote denomination is usually raised only after prices in a country stabilise." RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA carries an interview with Yuriy Shafranik, Russian minister of fuel and power, who emphasises that "notwithstanding the overall slump in the Russian industry by 16-17 percent on average, our fuel-producing sectors operated in a relatively steady way. Oil production decreased by only 12 percent, that of coal by nine percent, gas by three percent, and the generation of electric power by six percent, thereby ensuring a sufficiently stable provision of the national economy with energy resources". SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA runs an an article by Yegor Ligachev, former Politburo member of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, who writes: "The work of the parties that are members of the Communist Parties' Union -- CPSU is as if a continuation of the CPSU activities but proceeds under new conditions. This must be taken into account. Previously the party set itself as a task to broaden the social and political rights of citizens, whereas now the point is to restore them". PRAVDA carries a Russian Communist Party statement, which reads as follows: "One has to state with deep regret that a campaign to destroy monuments of Russian and Soviet history and culture was launched on a large scale in the country in recent years. Monuments are pulled down and destroyed, the names of towns, streets, and squares are changed, and museums are closed down. Matters went to such lengths that the study of the creative legacy of a number of great Russian writers has been removed from school programmes, and the study of the country's recent history has been narrowed unbelievably".
