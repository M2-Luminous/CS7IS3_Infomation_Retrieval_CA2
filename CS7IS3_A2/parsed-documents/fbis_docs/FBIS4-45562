Speaking at a meeting held by the state anti-drug trafficking committee, Mr. Tao said despite of notable achievements made in the country's anti-drug trafficking campaign since last year, situation of drug-related crimes remained serious due to effects of the worldwide drug-related crimes. The anti-drug trafficking campaign was arduous with drug trafficking activities rampant in the frontier area of the southwest China and existence of illegal planting of opium poppies. Therefore, the campaign should not slack off. Mr. Tao said top priority would be given to the frontier area of the southwest China such as Yunnan Province and Guangxi Province in terms of crackdown of border drug trafficking. These two provinces should intensify their anti-drug trafficking campaigns in order to prevent drugs made outside China from passing through the territory of China.
