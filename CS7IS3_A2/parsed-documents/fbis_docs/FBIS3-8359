Prikryl, chairman of the Union of Czech and Moravian Housing Cooperatives, by Vladimir Cechlovsky; place and date not given: "Including Transformation Norms in the Housing Law Is Neither Legally Clean nor Decent"] [Text] [Cechlovsky] Recently, when commenting on the proposals by the [government] coalition deputies that other cooperative property be included in the transfer of cooperative housing units [to private ownership], you said that it would lead to the liquidation of many cooperatives. These deputies, however--O. Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party), for instance--categorically refused this view. Do you insist on it? [Prikryl] Yes, I do. Following the adoption of the new statutes, which the Transformation Law of 1992 compelled the cooperatives to accept, most of the cooperatives' property was included in an indivisible fund. If it is now enshrined in the law that the member of a cooperative also has the right, when taking over the housing unit, to have that part of the property that is registered in the indivisible fund paid out, it really can lead to the liquidation of the cooperative. As a matter of fact, such a liquidation can also be initiated by the court. To pretend that nothing is at stake and, at the same time, beyond the framework of the proposal of their own coalition government, try to include fundamental transformation norms in the housing law is neither legally clean nor decent. [Cechlovsky] So, you are against a further transformation of housing cooperatives? [Prikryl] The transformation of housing cooperatives took place in the past, and precisely according to instructions. Another question altogether is whether the instructions called for a lot or a little. Nonetheless, the actual responsibility for the results is borne by the deputies of the then Federal Assembly. They are basically the same ones as those who are dissatisfied today and submit additional proposals. If, today, the coalition deputies do not like the result of the transformation of cooperatives, they certainly are free to request another transformation. We consider it appropriate, however, that such an intervention has the form of an amendment to the transformation law, the Commercial Code, and the law on banks. [Cechlovsky] Why? [Prikryl] It is a guarantee that the eventual change is implemented responsibly. After all, no parliament--and that includes this one--it is not a simple matter to alter the Commercial or Civic Codes, which belong to the pillars of the legal system in any advanced country. [Cechlovsky] That is the legal side of the issue. The deputies are reasoning for urgency, however, by, among other things, numerous letters from the cooperative members, and, by extension, that a further transformation is in the interest of all members of the cooperatives. [Prikryl] As long as it was not self-help construction by the members or nonresidential premises in cooperative buildings, like various shops, stores, offices, etc., in 90 percent of cases they were financed solely by the state and not by the members of the cooperatives. In these instances, I do not see any reason that several individuals should grab these nonresidential premises. They should remain in the ownership of the cooperative, and the proceeds should support the cost of housing of all members of the cooperative. [Cechlovsky] Without any exception? What if these nonresidential premises are a burden for the people living in the given house because, for instance, there is noise, etc.? [Prikryl] That is something else. In such an instance, we would agree that the nonresidential premises be transferred to co-ownership of the people in the building. It is necessary, however, to individually assess whether that is the case. In case of a conflict, even before a court. [Cechlovsky] What about the other nonresidential premises, the cost of which the cooperative members in the given building shared? [Prikryl] It is quite clear there. We have no objections regarding their transfer to the co-ownership of the people in the building. [Cechlovsky] The deputies are proposing and will probably approve a compulsory transfer of the housing units from the ownership of the cooperative to the ownership of the members. How do you feel about that? [Prikryl] Frankly, this stipulation does not worry us in the least. If I decided to do something voluntarily earlier, it cannot trouble me when the state orders me to do it by law. Personally, however, I cannot come to terms with the parliament again showing disrespect for the ownership rights. After all, it is inexcusable to expropriate a legal person to benefit its shareholder. It is a dangerous precedent. [Cechlovsky] The fact is that the transfers of cooperative housing units stopped.... [Prikryl] It is not through any fault of ours. The housing cooperatives wanted to transfer the units and did a lot for that purpose. The transfers were stopped by the Czech Land Register and Surveying Bureau that reasoned for this by not having a legal basis for making the entry in the real estate register. This lapse is to be eliminated by the currently drafted law on housing ownership. [Cechlovsky] To own a housing unit is not the end. Someone must maintain it and take care of its administration. A cooperative member may not feel comfortable in a large cooperative. What will you offer to these people? Should they not have the opportunity, after all, to secede from the cooperative even with a share of the cooperative property. [Prikryl] There is a better solution--namely, that individual self-administrative units emerge from the original cooperative, which, however, remains functional. The new units would then take care of the entrusted housing units, thus bringing the ownership closer to the people while being able to use the services of the original cooperative. [Cechlovsky] How would this benefit the people? [Prikryl] The principle of cooperatives is a service to the people. They will not have to take care of everything, and the cost will be relatively reasonable. Take the energy aspect of our housing, for instance. There are many houses that should have been built in North Africa rather than here because their insulation would be more appropriate there, are in desperate need of repairs: a thermal treatment of the encasements and roofs, and reconstruction of the housing cores. The people in an individual building are not always able to take care of this all by themselves. Nonetheless, there is also just the ordinary caretaking in the building. If the cooperatives were eliminated and each member got with his unit, say, 3,000 korunas--it would hardly be more--it would not be of much help. For this money, nobody would take care of the houses for long. [Cechlovsky] The individual buildings can, however, leave the cooperatives right now. They do not need any complex legislation for that.... [Prikryl] Yes, that is true, but there still are certain barriers. The secession of the self-administration would result in the transfer of property, and that means paying taxes. Thus, the taxes must be eliminated first. Furthermore, the secession of any self-administration must be approved by the plenary session of the entire cooperative. The transformation means that a decision by the self-administration would suffice for leaving the cooperative. No outsider could prevent it. Such a solution is virtually identical with that demanded by the coalition deputies, but it is a pragmatic one and not a politically impulsive one.
