Aircraft of the Uzbek militias, which are led by General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, raided the presidential palace, which is the headquarters of President Borhanoddin Rabbani, Kabul Airport, the main intelligence center, and other government positions. Sources close to the militias have told AL-HAYAH that the raids are intended to pave the way for an assault that they will launch jointly with the supporters of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar to seize control of Kabul. It has also been reported that militia aircraft have, moreover, raided the stronghold of the Ettehad-e Eslami, which is led by Sheykh 'Abd-Rabb Rasul Seyyef, in Paghman, west of the capital. It is well known that Seyyaf is a close associate of the Afghan president. Afghan diplomatic sources have reported that government forces have downed a MiG-21 belonging to the militias in Paghman and that they have killed General ['Abdol] Ghafar Pahlawan, a most prominent Uzbek militia commander, in clashes between the two sides in the city of Mazar-e Sharif, one of northern Afghanistan's largest cities. These sources added that Habibollah Beg, another Uzbek general, and 2,000 of his fighters have surrendered to the government forces in Faryab Governorate. Sources of the Jami'at-e Eslami, led by Rabbani, in Peshawar have told AL-HAYAH that government aircraft have not taken part in the Kabul battles because they have been busy raiding militia positions in Mazar-e Sharif so as to strike these militias in their stronghold. Yesterday, Hekmatyar's supporters issued a statement reiterating their demand that the president resign and reaffirming their rejection of a cease-fire unless Rabbani responds to this demand. A committee of field commanders has declared its rejection of the demands of both sides and has called for forming a new and neutral government. Imminent Assault Sources close to Dostam have told AL-HAYAH that the air raids are in preparation for a fierce assault that the militias will launch jointly with the Hezb-e Eslami, which is headed by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, within 72 hours to seize Kabul. The sources added that the air raids are intended to weaken and destroy the government forces' defenses. Yesterday, Pakistan closed its border in the face of emigrants fleeing the war in the capital. Pakistani Government sources have said that 14,000 Afghan citizens have crossed the border into Pakistan since the battles started at the beginning of this month. Calls for Peace At a time when Pakistan has urged the feuding parties to stop the fighting, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has called for an immediate truce and urged all Afghans to settle their conflicts peacefully. The Afghan Peace Committee, which is led by Field Commander Jalaloddin Haqqani and which includes prominent 'ulema, field commanders, and intellectuals, held a press conference in which it has called for forming an expanded consultative council.
