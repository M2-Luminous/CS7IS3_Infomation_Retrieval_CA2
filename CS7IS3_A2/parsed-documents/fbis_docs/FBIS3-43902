ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] deputy secretary-general Obed Bapela disclosed these details at the funeral of an ANC self-defence unit member in Katlehong yesterday. Two people were shot and injured at the funeral. De Klerk and Mandela met yesterday to finalise the plan but could not complete the task and scheduled further meetings. Spokesmen refused to disclose details until a final agreement was reached. However, De Klerk said proposals included boosting security force manpower and the SADF's [South African Defense Force] role and addressing socio-economic problems, such as housing and education. All parties which had a bearing on violence had to be consulted, including the Inkatha Freedom Party. Bapela said the ANC had met East Rand self-defence units and they had agreed that policemen would not be targets. He urged the community to welcome the SADF. The ANC had demanded photographs of all internal stability unit members so they could be excluded from the police force.
