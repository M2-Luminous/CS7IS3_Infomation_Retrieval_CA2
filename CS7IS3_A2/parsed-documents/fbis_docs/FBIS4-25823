Even though Mr Wang left Beijing for his hometown in Shandong prior to the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre in order to avoid police harassment, he was still followed everywhere he went. The former student leader, who returned to Beijing on Sunday, said he was now "fed up" with constantly being followed and routinely being called in for questioning by the police. "Unless I get some kind of guarantee of freedom of movement from the police, I will stage a hunger strike in protest," he said yesterday. Mr Wang said his mother had visited the local police station yesterday to inform them of his intention but so far they had received no reply Mr Wang said he had not yet decided how long his threatened hunger strike would last, adding that its duration would largely depend on the response from the security forces. Many observers predicted, however, that Mr Wang's hunger strike, if it occurred at all, would probably last no more than a few days. "This sounds like just another publicity stunt," a Western diplomat said, "an attempt to keep human rights on the agenda" following U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision on Most Favoured Nation [MFN] trading status. However, the threatened protest was a sign that while security in the capital had been generally more relaxed following the June 4 anniversary, surveillance of key dissidents remained as intense as ever and was unlikely to be curtailed. Meanwhile a source close to the family said that dissident Chen Ziming's health had improved slightly since being released from prison, but he was still trying to find a doctor to give him a thorough examination and help him on the road to full recovery after having served nearly five years of a 13-year jail sentence. A family source said the 42-year-old dissident, released from prison last month but not allowed to return to his home until last week, had been given medicine for his many ailments. Of Mr Chen's troubles, his skin disorder was showing the biggest improvement though it was far from cured. He was taking medication for high blood pressure, and heart, stomach and kidney troubles contracted while in jail. Mr Chen, convicted by a court of trying to subvert the Government during the 1989 pro-democracy rallies, was freed in May on medical parole as part of a Chinese effort to win MFN renewal. However, Mr Chen is far from a free man. The source said he was under 24-hour police guard. Even his family members had to check through security to enter his apartment. He was not allowed to answer telephone calls. "They would never let you in to his apartment," said the source. Asked about his spirits, the source said: "How can his mood be good when he can't speak freely?"
