The value of trade between Russia and Vietnam made up more than 300 million dollars last year, Antoshchenkov said. Both sides no longer establish rigid quotas on trade. Instead they coordinate the lists of goods in which they are interested. Russian consumers receive from Vietnam rice, meat, tea, coffee, vegetables and friut, spices, rugs and carpets, footwear, sewn articles, knitgoods and other goods. Incidentally, the exhibition of goods that opened at the Vietnamese trade mission in Moscow on June 14 shows Vietnam's export potentials. Vietnam is interested in purchasing from Russia road-building equipment, metals, fertiliser, timber and sawn timber. Russia deliveries of sets of equipment for the construction of various facilities are of much importance to Vietnam, Antoshchenkov said. The construction of the Hoabinh hydropower station will be completed this year. The biggest hydropower station in South East Asia with a capacity of two million kilowatts will go into operation in September. A hydropower station will be build in Yali in the Danang District. This will make it possible to supply enough electricity to central Vietnam. The construction of the Laokai complex with an enrichment factory to produce 1.5 million tonnes of apatite concentrate a year will be completed this year. Both sides expressed satisfaction with a successful functioning of the joint venture Vietsovpetro which extracted over 20 million tonnes of crude oil from the shelf of Vietnam in the period of the venture's existence. The volume of extraction will surpass six million tonnes this year. Vietnam will continue goods deliveries towards repaying its debt to Russia, Antoshchenkov said. During the visit of the Vietnamese Premier accompanied by a large group of officials from various ministries and agencies, representatives of the Vietnamese business circles will hold substantive talks for the speeding up of the implementation of the earlier achieved arrangements and will discuss projects for cooperation. A number of documents, including agreements on cooperation in the area of agro-industrial complexes and fisheries will be signed.
