Commenting on the nomination of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, the national PRD leader said that now more than ever, the political dialogue must be increased to guarantee clean elections. [Begin Munoz Ledo recording] We hope that there will be no hardening of positions. The country's conditions make it advisable for the government to be cautious, wise, and tolerant. The Chiapas problem is not solved. There is concern and even emotional instability in vast areas of the country. We must advise the government to be cautious, increase political dialogue, and not allow the nomination of a candidate to be put on the same level with the appointment of a president. That would be the worst mistake that the system could make at this point. [end recording] Munoz Ledo added that it is probable that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas will resume his campaign after Holy Week.
