Statistics show that by the end of last year, Hainan Province had approved 902 Taiwan-invested projects worth $961 million in total contractual amount, $769 million of which was financed by Taiwan capital. Of the 902 Taiwan-invested projects, 397 were registered last year, accounting for $482 million in total contractual investment, respectively up 21 percent and 32 percent from a year earlier. Taiwan capital currently accounts for 10.2 of Hainan's total foreign investment, second only to Hong Kong. According to concerned departments, Taiwan investment in Hainan displays the following characteristics: --Gradual increases in investment every year and an increasingly faster rate of development. Statistics at the end of 1988 show that province-wide there were only 11 approved Taiwan-capital enterprises, with $5.94 million in total contractual investment. The number was increased annually and by 1992, the growth rate was such that there were 267 and 418 percent increases respectively in Taiwan-capital enterprises and total contractual investment from the previous year. --A rising proportion for firms exclusively funded by Taiwan capital. There are 706 such firms in Hainan's 902 Taiwan-invested firms, 3.6 times the number of joint-venture and cooperation enterprises. --Taiwan businessmen invest more in industrial projects and maintain a rational industrial structure. Of these, tourist and property investment ranks first, accounting for about half of Taiwan investment, while industrial and agricultural projects account for 32 and 10 percent respectively. Together they account for over 90 percent. Officials at the Hainan Provincial Taiwan Affairs Office said the province will increase its efforts to attract Taiwan capital and investment, work vigorously to get Taiwan businesses to launch a few large-scale projects in the agricultural, tourist, high-tech, and mining sectors, encourage one or two Taiwan-capital banks or non-financial [fei jin rong 7236 6855 5816] institutions to set up their base in Hainan, and call a "Seminar on Hainan-Taiwan Economic and Financial Development" this March.
