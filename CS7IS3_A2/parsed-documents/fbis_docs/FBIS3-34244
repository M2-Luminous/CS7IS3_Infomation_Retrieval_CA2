In a technological breakthrough, the missile used an integrated two-stage rocket ramjet propulsion system. While a normal rocket has an inbuilt oxygen supply system, the ramjet rocket draws air during flight for combustion in conjunction with the fuel-rich propellants. India now joins an exclusive group of three nations possessing such technology. They are the United States, Russia, and France. The 650-kg missile Akash has a range of 25 km. It has a (?face) and a radar called Rajendra capable of multitargeting. Manufactured by the Defense Research and Development Organization, the missile Akash has multiple warheads which could target four to five enemy aircraft at long range. More than 100 parameters were monitored during the test-flight. Apart from propulsion parameters, the measured and predicted range values were in close agreement.
