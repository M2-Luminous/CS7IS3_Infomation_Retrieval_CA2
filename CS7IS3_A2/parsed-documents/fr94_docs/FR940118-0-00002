FR940118-0-00002 FR940118-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;60&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8799; AD 94&hyph;02&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives: Rockwell International/Collins Air Transport Division DME&hyph;700 Distance Measuring Equipment AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to Rockwell International/Air Transport Division (Collins) DME&hyph;700 distance measuring equipment (DME) installed on aircraft. This action requires modifying these DME units to ensure they are functioning properly. Several reports of the affected DME units failing to process and update distance outputs, and reports of these units establishing a continuous restart mode upon power application prompted this AD. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent improper operation of this equipment, which could result in navigational errors. DATES: Effective February 21, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of February 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from Rockwell International/Collins Air Transport Division, 400 Collins Road, NE; Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Roger A. Souter, Aerospace Engineer, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4134; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that applies to certain Collins DME&hyph;700 distance measurement equipment installed on aircraft was published in the Federal Register on January 25, 1993 (58 FR 5949). The action proposed to require modifying these DME units to ensure that they are functioning properly. The proposed modifications would be accomplished in accordance with the following Collins service bulletins (SB) (1) SB 20, Revision 1, DME&hyph;700&hyph;34&hyph;20, dated August 30, 1991, which when incorporated prevents a condition known as ``sleeping DME's''; and (2) Collins SB 24, DME&hyph;700&hyph;34&hyph;24, dated May 15, 1992; Collins SB 25, DME&hyph;700&hyph;34&hyph;25, dated November 11, 1992; and Collins SB 26, DME&hyph;700&hyph;34&hyph;26, dated October 21, 1992, as applicable, which when incorporated prevent a condition known as ``deaf DME's''. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Based on the comments received, the proposal was changed to add a modification that went beyond the scope of that which was originally proposed. Accordingly, the FAA issued a supplementary NPRM that incorporated minor revisions and added the additional modification. The proposed actions specified in the Supplemental NPRM would be accomplished in accordance with the following, as applicable: ‚ê£ 1Collins SB/condition 1Date 1Part Nos. applicable (622&hyph;4540&hyph;XXX) SB 20, Revision 1/Sleeping Aug. 30, 1991 All applicable DME&hyph;700 Units, &hyph;020, &hyph;120, with serial number 1 through 4247. SB 25/Deaf and Distance Jumping Nov. 11, 1992 All applicable DME&hyph;700 Units, converts &hyph;020, &hyph;021, or &hyph;022 to -023. SB 20 most be installed prior to or in conjunction with SB 25. SB 24 is incorporated by SB 25. SB 26/Deaf and Distance Jumping Oct. 21, 1992 All applicable DME&hyph;700 Units, converts &hyph;120, or &hyph;121, to &hyph;122. SB 20 most be installed prior to or in conjunction with SB 26. SB 26 eliminates the need for SB 21.
