[Perez] I can tell you that for many years Cubametales [Cuba Metal Import Enterprise] has been holding talks with the Colombian company Copetrol [expansion unknown] for direct supply of Colombian crude oil to Cuba because this is a product we know very well, having been receiving it through negotiations with other commercial companies. We recently held a new meeting to discuss the possibility of this sale under normal market conditions. The Colombian officials are studying this, and we are waiting for the final results of those studies. This is the situation today concerning the possible supply of Colombian petroleum to our country. [Santana] Pedro, I have an AFP report that says Colombia will sell from 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of petroleum to Cuba daily as of next June. Can this be taken as a confirmation of the situation? [Perez] Well, that is a point of reference because petroleum amounts are usually determined according to shipments received at port, not according to daily delivery of products. In any case, I believe that is an amount we can assimilate. It will be so -- or it can be so -- if we reach an agreement. [Santana] Well, you have just heard the news we received here at our studio confirmed by Pedro Perez, director of Cubametales.
