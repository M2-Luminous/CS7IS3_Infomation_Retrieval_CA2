Kliridhis must also accept the proposal repeatedly put forward by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] for signing a nonaggression treaty, Atun added. Atun issued a written statement regarding the demilitarization proposal -- which Kliridhis will reportedly submit to the NATO summit meeting -- as well as the recent shooting incidents against Turkish Cypriot positions. Atun remarked that this attitude is aimed at turning the Cyprus problem, which is an intercommunal issue, into an international one. He described Kliridhis' proposal as a stale tactic designed to eliminate the guarantee and alliance agreements, apply international pressure on motherland Turkey, and undermine the intercommunal negotiating process. Atun stressed that the fact that the Cyprus issue is not an international problem and that it is an intercommunal problem between the two communities on the island and not one between Turkey and Cyprus as claimed by the Greek Cypriot side, has been acknowledged by the United Nations and confirmed in the summit agreements. The prime minister underlined that Turkey is not an occupation force as charged by Kliridhis, but a guarantor state, that instituted peace by preventing the attempts to achieve enosis on the part of the Greek-Greek Cypriot pair, which destroyed the legitimate order, occupied the Cyprus Republic through the use of force, and massacred the Turkish Cypriot people. Atun stated that if Kliridhis is sincere in his quest for a solution, then he must accept these facts and stop his efforts to stage cheap shows, to further complicate the issue by dragging it into the international arena, and to hinder the basis for negotiations. Strongly protesting the shooting incidents against Turkish Cypriot fighters yesterday, Atun announced that the TRNC Government will adopt the necessary measures against these senseless provocations aimed at disrupting the peace, which has prevailed on the island for 20 years, within the framework of its right to legitimate defense.
