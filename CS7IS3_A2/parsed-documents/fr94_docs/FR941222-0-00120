FR941222-0-00120 FR941222-0-00018 Regulations at ยง672.20(f)(1) authorize apportionments of the trawl halibut PSC limit allowance as bycatch allowances to a deep-water species complex, comprising sablefish, rockfish, deep-water flatfish, and arrowtooth flounder, and a shallow-water species complex, comprising pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, and other species. The apportionment for these two complexes is presented in Table 6. Table 6._ Preliminary 1995 Apportionment of Pacific Halibut PSC Trawl Limits Between the Deep-Water Species Complex and the Shallow-Water Species Complex.

Interim Groundfish Harvest Specifications Current regulations at ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A) require that one-fourth of the proposed TAC (not including the reserves and the first quarterly allowance of pollock), one-fourth of the inshore and offshore allocations of Pacific cod in each regulatory area, and one-fourth of the halibut PSC amounts, take effect on January 1 on an interim basis and remain in effect until superseded by the final 1995 initial specifications published in the Federal Register or until harvested. Seasonal apportionments of TACs or PSC limits under provisions of other regulations may supersede this interim specification. Table 1 shows amounts of proposed specifications of target species and the ``other species'' categories in effect on an interim basis beginning January 1, 1995. 10. Opening Date of the Directed Fishery for Sablefish for Hook-and-Line Gear Under new regulations implementing the IFQ program (50 CFR part 676) in 1995, the opening date of the sablefish fishery is March 1. 11. Closures to Directed Fishing Under ยง672.20(c)(2)(ii), if the Regional Director determines that the amount of a target species or ``other species'' category apportioned to a fishery, or with respect to Pacific cod, to an allocation to the inshore or offshore component, is likely to be reached, the Regional Director may establish a directed fishing allowance for that species or species group. In establishing a directed fishing allowance, the Regional Director shall consider the amount of that species group or allocation of Pacific cod to the inshore or offshore component that will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the same regulatory area or district. If the Regional Director establishes a directed fishing allowance, and that allowance is or will be reached before the end of the fishing year, NMFS will prohibit directed fishing for that species or species group in the specified regulatory area or district. The Regional Director has determined that interim amounts of groundfish specified by this preliminary specification (Table 1) for species or species groups identified in Table 7 will be necessary as incidental catch to support anticipated groundfish fisheries prior to the time that final specifications of groundfish are in effect for the 1995 fishing year. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for those target species, gears, and components listed in Table 7 to prevent exceeding the interim amounts of groundfish TACs specified. These closures will be in effect during the period that the appropriate interim specifications of groundfish TACs are in effect. During these closures, applicable directed fishing standards may be found at ยง672.20(g). Additional closures and restrictions may be found in existing regulations at 50 CFR part 672.
