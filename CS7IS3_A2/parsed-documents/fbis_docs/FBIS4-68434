Temchin, under the rubric "Investments": "Where to Put Capital: In Snickers or Lathes?: Commercial Structures Offer Their Assistance to State Enterprises"] [Text] Something seems to be starting to change in our sick economy: for the first time a group of major businessmen, at their own initiative, have approached Anatoliy Ogurtsov, chairman of Roskommash [RF Committee on Machinebuilding], with an offer to collaborate. It used to be just the opposite: Roskommash sought out partners among commercial structures. But didn't find any. It is more profitable to invest capital in Snickers than in lathes or turbines. There is practically no risk involved, and a speedy accumulation of capital is ensured. Machinebuilding is a long and risky affair. Russia's machinebuilding complex finds itself in a very difficult position--mutual nonpayments, a lack of working capital, difficulties with the market and output, and so on. Last year mutual nonpayments and creditor indebtedness reached nearly 6 trillion rubles [R]. In January another more than R1 trillion was racked up. Tractor and combine plants are standing idle; the collectives of our glorious auto giants have been put on forced leave; and our lathe builders and instrument makers are just barely working. One of the instigators of the meeting with the industrialists, Aleksandr Yefanov, chairman of the board of directors of the Mikrodin AO (joint-stock company), stated that commercial structures possess sufficient capital to support financially several sites of the machinebuilding complex, but doing this will require above all strictly selecting, with the help of experts, pilot projects for potentially progressive output that is certain to be competitive and that will enjoy elevated demand on the domestic as well as the foreign market. "Mikrodin AO," he said, "is a happy exception. We have no problems with marketing our output or with nonpayments." He explained that it is just a matter of the system he put together: NIOKR [scientific research and experimental design work]--financial organization--marketing. These are the three whales on which the Mikrodin association rests. First an interesting and promising project, then a study of its marketing possibilities, and, after that, its financing. The main misfortune of many enterprises is that they do not use this kind of system, or in any event they lack the two most important links in the chain--marketing and financing. Abroad, banks work with industry in the closest possible way. This has not been set up here. One person who spoke in the wake of the industrialists said that work in this direction is our last hope. Someone else added that this meeting between financiers and industrialists could become a historic turning point in machinebuilding. In short, fine words were spoken at this conference, hopeful words. But I sat there and listened and thought that many fine and hopeful words had been spoken in recent years, but the reality is much worse. Tens of plants have come to a complete standstill, hundreds are working three or four days a week--there is no money even for salaries. The reasons for this misfortune are well understood by everyone, and there are plenty of plans for getting out of this labyrinth, but just which of them will lead us out into the bright market future? We are drowning in macroprograms, of which we are periodically informed, but how do are they going to be carried out on the microlevel? What specific plans are there on this score? Anatoliy Ogurtsov, Roskommash's chairman, told me that a few days ago the leaders of the industrial committees, famous academicians, and representatives of bankings structures had gathered and discussed how to get out of the present impasse, and they never did come to a unanimous opinion. Each group has its own macroprogram, each of which contains good ideas, but they mesh badly. At Roskommash they made an attempt to synthesize them. A working group of 11 highly experienced financial analysts was created. They got hold of "outsider" programs (although this is not always easy; we have retained the old habit of not showing "outsiders" our "secrets"), subjected these programs to painstaking analysis, selected the most far-sighted elements, and added their own. At the meeting between the machinebuilders and the "sharks" of capital, several contradictions were noted in the goals of industrialists and financiers. Most important to the former, in order for such giants as ChTZ [Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant], Rostselmash, and others like them to take up work again, was that their investment return workers and engineers from their forced leave. The other side was interested in something else. The president of the inter-branch commercial Resurs Bank, Semen Epshteyn, said sternly that bankers were acting in this instance not as altruists or as patrons, but were guided above all by the desire to defend our market against foreign intervention. And there is only one way to do that: by investing in pilot projects. But these have to be selected very carefully, not only for their technical characteristics but also for their marketing possibilities as well. Banks are not going to invest capital in something that the market doesn't demand and that will not yield a definite profit. In his opinion, it makes no sense to invest capital now in a tractor or combine giant, because their current mass output is not in demand in the market. All you can do here is get bogged down and go bankrupt. It would be another matter if there were new developments that were promising from a marketing aspect. In that case there would be food for thought. After the second meeting, Roskommash created in quick order its own expert commissions, which must choose what they think are the most promising projects. These will be subjected to expert banking analysis, and then they will see. The fact itself is important. For the first time in the years of economic reforms, commercial structures have turned away from Snickers and toward machinebuilding, which never yields quick or large dividends anywhere in the world but does ensure the prosperity of all other branches. This meeting of young native capital and our old machinebuilding may set off a saving spark. We will have to wait a month. That was the deadline set.
