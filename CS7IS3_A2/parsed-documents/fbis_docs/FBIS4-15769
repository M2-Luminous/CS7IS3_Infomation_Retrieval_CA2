The government is losing a lot of money thereby as it does not participate in these transactions. This new decree gives us a simple solution that does not affect the constitutional legal basis. In accordance with this decree, heads of local administrations do not sell the land which belongs to the state, but sell the right for using this land during one's life time and for leaving it to be used by one's heirs. In other words, ownership on land is separated from ownership on life-long inherited right for using this land. This means that land relations are included in the market turnover, thus creating conditions for accumulation of additional mortgage means on banking accounts. The government becomes the main regulator of land relations and receives profit in the form of dues from these transactions.
