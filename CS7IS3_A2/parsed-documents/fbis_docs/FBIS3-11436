[Begin Paul recording] I still support the FNCD proposal. I think it is a realistic one. It is realistic because when we asked for the amnesty law to be passed, we felt there would be many advantages to passing it: First, it would set the stage for General Cedras' early retirment, in compliance with the promise he made in the Governors Island agreement. Second, it would meet conditions that would enable President Aristide to appoint a prime minister once Gen. Cedras had gone into early retirement as promised. My concern regarding the plan is what would happen afterwards, even if the Senate managed to pass this same plan via a resolution -- because I had a conversation recently with President Aristide, who told me that he is maintaining his position, and that he will not budge an inch as long as those who staged the coup d'etat...[rephrases] Gen. Cedras does not step down as head of the Army in compliance with the promise he made on Governors Island. [end recording] That was a statement by Evans Paul, mayor of Port-au-Prince and FNCD spokesman.
