This subprogram, known as Chippac, is being managed by the Bull company. The heads of the European ESPRIT research program have just entrusted the management of the Chippac microassembly program to Bull. This subprogram, to run for two and a half years, is to use models to demonstrate the operational reliability of multichip modules (MCM) and single-chip modules (SCM) designed on the basis of the results of several previous studies of substrates and modes of connection. Other European companies will also participate in this project, notably Framatome, GEC Marconi UK, IMC, Alcatel-Mietic, SGS-Thomson, and Telefonica. The results of Chippac will have to be suitable for use in applications as varied as information technology, telecommunications, robotics, transport, or even for the general public. Participants in the Chippac project will initially concentrate on several basic studies of modules, starting with the problem of the reliability of bare chips. In particular, Chippac will seek to develop testing methods and tools to enable the quality of bare chips to be guaranteed before their assembly on the module (KGD: known good die). Two further studies will concentrate on ceramic (particularly low-temperature cosinters) and organic substrates, with the aim of comparing different kinds of products, and determining the limits and rules for their design. A Thorough Study Based on Ball Bearings Chippac will also look into modes of interconnection of bare chips (known as "first level of connection"). Wire connection up to 75fm and by TAB without bossing onto the chip (connection on the strip being by means of the pins of the chip) will be particularly investigated. The second level of connection (assembly of the module on the card) will also be investigated in a study dedicated particularly to ball bearings. The aims of Chippac are also concerned with the characteristics of modules. The SCM model will have to be able to encapsulate a 15 x 15 mm chip comprising over 400 E/S, operating at over 100 MHz and dissipating up to 10W. The module will need to be sufficiently reliable to be suitable for information technology and telecommunications applications. One of the MCM modules on a ceramic substrate (MCM-C) will need to contain 32 chips, including 24 bare ones (connected by TAB without bossing), and 8 encapsulated in ultraflat cases (TSOP). The external connections will need to operate at up to 33 Mbit/s, and the internal ones at up to 75 Mbit/s. The desired dissipation level is between 100 and 200 W. This configuration will also be tested on a MCM-L model (organic substrate). Another MCM-C model will use flip-chip technology to connect a 9-memory microprocessor. Finally, a MCM-L model needing to operate at around 1.5 GHz in very severe environmental conditions will also be tested.
