FBIS4-15070 "drsov066_v_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Lithuania Council Set Up To Recover Removed Archives Council Set Up To Recover Removed Archives WS0504201294 Tallinn BNS in English 1750 GMT 5 Apr 94 WS0504201294 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 05, BNS - A special group of experts has been set up to the Lithuanian working group for talks with CIS to recover Lithuanian archives kept in Russia. The group is headed by Gediminas Ilgunas, director general of the Lithuanian State Archive. The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry has sent a note to Russia requesting to set up a similar commission. The return of archives was discussed March 31 at a meeting between Nikolay Obertyshev, Russia's ambassador to Lithuania, and Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy foreign minister. The ambassador reportedly said that Russia has no legal or historic grounds to return archives to Lithuania and sees no purpose to create a commission for talks in order to deal with the problem. Januska said Lithuania reserves the right to negotiate the matter at interstate talks. In an interview with the RESPUBLIKA newspaper, Ilgunas said the Russian ambassador's statement contradicts the international principles of archiving, according to which, archives must be kept where they are created. Ilgunas said Russia began taking out Lithuanian archives in the times of the czarist empire. In his words, a collection of legislative acts of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and documents of Lithuania's provinces were taken out before 1915. Lithuania archives were also taken out after the Soviet occupation in 1940. The Soviets took a number of documents of the pre-war Lithuanian republic, the archives of the president's office, including the Feb. 16, 1918 Independence Act. Archives were last taken out in 1989-1991 from the KGB building in Vilnius. KGB criminal and filtration files of the 1940's were recovered in 1992. Russia later said that the files were used against persons mentioned in them, but Ilgunas declined to comment on these allegations.
