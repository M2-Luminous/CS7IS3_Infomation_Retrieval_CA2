Germany is taking a lead with its research facilities, and great possibilities are also opening up for industry. Small and medium-sized companies, however, are still experiencing serious problems in developing marketable products. "Microsystem technology constitutes an expansion of microelectronics," Prof. Dr. Anton Heuberger emphasized at the presentation of the BMFT's [Federal Ministry of Research and Technology] promotional program "Microsystem Technology" on February 18th in Sankt Augustin, "which will achieve a key importance still in this century similar to that of microelectronics today." The director of the Berlin Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology (ISiT) is confident that this key technology which has the goal of "integrating microelectronic and other functions such as optical, electromagnetic, mechanical, chemical and even biological into one miniaturized solid state system" holds great importance for German industry. "Germany's prospects and qualifications in microsystem technology are incomparably better than in microelectronics." The initiative in microsystem technology "has led to an extremely substantial and broad research infrastructure in Germany," which for Heuberger is "a very good fundamental basis for industrial development." Now care must be taken that national support does not get pushed toward basic research but instead fully demands the relevance [of such research] to industry. Production technology and system reliability also continue to be decisive factors and "not only [whether] new systems are feasible in principle." Also required are a consolidation of themes and leadership in industry. However, "the early support of industry also produced a significant level [of work] here, in comparison with other countries, which after the initial difficulties culminated in a fruitful coexistence of large and small industry." And industrial sectors such as automotive technology, telecommunications, medical technology or metrology and control engineering, "which are particularly dependent on microsystem technology," are well represented in Germany as well as in Europe. The victory is far from won, however. The Fraunhofer director referred to the example of Japan with its "micromachining" successor program, where the greatest potential danger lurks. "The entire program is carried out there in large industry as a supplement to microelectronics, which is already strong there as it is." Heuberger's fear is that the Japanese could begin product development earlier and more consistently. Nothing is yet decided, but the problems which are still to be solved by the German initiative in microsystem technology "are incomparably more difficult than those in microelectronics, where we have already not solved the problems." Also the European JESSI [Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative] program "does not cover important methods and technologies of system integration and system technology because of its concentrated focus, desired by industry, on memory or storage technology." The weakest aspect is the software: without elaborate software simulation systems and design tools, which are not on the market yet, there can be no industrial production of microsystems. "If we do not succeed at least in building up and sustaining an industrial software supplier and in not having to buy system software from the USA as we have done, it is all pointless," Heuberger warns. However, microsystem technology still offers great opportunities, also and specifically for small and medium-sized industry in Germany. As Helmut Hund, director of the sensor production company of the same name in Wetzlar, emphasizes: "Usually, the manufacturing processes of semiconductor technology are not accessible to companies of this size." For companies of between 20 and 1,000 employees doing business of between a few and several hundred million German marks, it has been nearly impossible up to now to get into technologies like design and simulation, lithography, wet and plasma etching technology, or coating and testing technology. The situation is completely different in microsystem technology, with small volumes of a few thousand units. No longer do smaller structural dimensions or larger and more complicated memory determine the level of innovation in microsystem technology, as is the case in semiconductor technology; [innovation] is instead determined by the intelligent combination of various technologies in the areas of micromechanics, application specific IC design and sensor construction. "Small-scale manufacture combined with relatively economical manufacturing processes offer small and medium-sized businesses an ideal opportunity against the large companies. It offers an opportunity because the price pressure is no where near as great as with the semiconductor standard components." There are also hidden risks in microsystem technology, however. "The wildest chip ideas come to nothing if the corresponding products are not [as written] lacking which can be used in industrial and everyday life." The practical Hund sees Germany's biggest current problem here. "In every possible presentation and in the technical journals there is talk of insulin pumps, of miniature robots and of micromechanical drive systems," Helmut Hund says mockingly, "but sales are not yet being made with products containing these components." Small and medium-sized businesses are demanding support not only for technologies but also for the development and marking of new products. As a man of experience, Helmut Hund knows first-hand the problems of small and medium-sized businesses. "No small or medium-sized business has the financial resources to reserve all the hardware for microsystem technology alone." His credo is, therefore, not to make everything alone but rather for small and medium-sized businesses to work together from cooperative research to realization of the product, a concept for which Hund has coined the term cooperative technology. Hund the business man grew up in the country and knows what he is talking about: "Many farmers could only buy a harvester together which they would have been unable to afford individually." However, large companies, too, should make use of joint solutions with small and medium-sized businesses. Hund: "Then the call for a German MITI [(Japanese) Ministry of International Trade and Industry] or similar institution would no longer be necessary." Big business, meanwhile, emphasizes its leadership role. "For rapid industrial development and the use of microsystem technology in new products, some mass markets will probably be essential at first in which unit price is low and high unit numbers of elements, sensors, actuators and components are used, such as in automobile technology or domestic and home appliance technology"--of this Dr. Horst Schmidt-Bischoffshausen from research and technology at Daimler-Benz AG in Munich is certain. Accelerator sensors for airbags or rpm and torque sensors for controlling ABS and powertrains are examples of current mass production of microsystems at the element level.
