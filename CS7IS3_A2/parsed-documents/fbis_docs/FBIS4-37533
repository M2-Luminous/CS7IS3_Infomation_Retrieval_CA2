During a news conference on 30 April in Karachi, Mohammad Nawaz Sharif had reportedly leveled serious charges of corruption against the president, prime minister and her husband, and the federal commerce minister in the cotton export deal. While challenging these charges, the special public prosecutor said that these charges were false, baseless, and devoid of truth. He said this has not only hurt the prestige of the president, the prime minister and her husband and the federal commerce minister, but the people were misled by its widespread publicity. The court has summoned Mohammad Nawaz Sharif on 4 July.
