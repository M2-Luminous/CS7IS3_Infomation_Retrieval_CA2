Dr. Khalid Mush'il joined Hamas when it was just founded. He became a teacher after finishing his education in Kuwait University in 1987. During that time, he also started his own business. However, because of his special love for Palestine's independence, he spent all his time working for it. TAKBEER arranged a meeting with him while he was in Karachi. The editor in chief of TAKBEER, Muhammad Salah-al-Din, was also present during this meeting. [passage omitted] Khan: Hamas is active in militant actions in addition to on the political front. How successful is Hamas on this front? Mush'il: Al-Ahmadullah [Thanks to God] it is very successful. I can say with full confidence about the intifadah's activities and military operations against the Jewish forces that 90 percent of these activities are carried out by Hamas members. Khan: If a new state is established under the leadership of `Arafat, will there not be the danger of Israel using it to eradicate Hamas? Considering that Hamas is already directly fighting the Jews, what will be your method of operation when the new country with full government and weapons support from Israel also rises against Hamas? Mush'il: The fact is that the job given `Arafat according to the `Arafat-Rabin agreement is to eradicate all the opposition parties led by Hamas in Palestine. He will be given Israel's police force, weapons, and economic assistance for this purpose. He will have to terminate the Palestinian mujahidin who are fighting against the Jewish Army controlling this area. Thus, `Arafat's main responsibility will be to defend the Jewish Army. At the same time, the Palestinians, especially the freedom fighters, will be punished for demanding their freedom and rights. This way he will be doing his duty to protect the Jews. The Palestinians will receive neither protection nor their rights. Several of `Arafat's associates have mentioned in their statements that they will fight against Hamas with the support of Israel and the state police. Despite all this, the declared Hamas policy is that Hamas will never raise a weapon against a Palestinian and its fight is against the Jewish imperialists who have occupied Palestine illegally. Hamas knows its responsibility and invites all Palestinians without any exception to join the struggle for freedom. Hamas will try its best not to be involved in any civil war, which the Jews and `Arafat are aspiring to start. [passage omitted] Khan: What kind of administrative structure does Hamas have, and how does it function? Mush'il: Hamas operates underground in Palestine. Its organization and leaders do not come out; they work secretly. There are political and information bureaus of Hamas outside of Palestine. It has a central committee, officers in various places, and there are Hamas representatives in some Arab countries. We have a regular office in Sudan. The leadership in Palestine and outside work together and consult with each other. The leaders and shuras [councils] in both places make decisions jointly. However, these associations are kept totally secret and no one knows about the council members. Hamas faces a lot of problems in this effort because, if the Jews learn about a person having Hamas association, he is sent to jail. Membership in Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood is a crime in Israel's eyes. Khan: Where does Hamas get money for its operations? Mush'il: We receive donations from all Muslim countries. Whenever possible all Islamic countries give us donations. We receive donations from Europe and the United States also. People are very helpful; however, our income does not meet our needs. Khan Where do you get weapons for military activities? Mush'il: The main source is the Israeli soldiers. We confiscate their weapons in confrontations with them. The second source is the weapons black market. We face a lot of problems as some of the weapons traders have connections with the Jews and are actually Israeli agents. At times, the Israeli Army tries to trap us through these traders. In addition, weapons bought this way are very expensive. Weapons are not available in Palestine, and a weapon that can be bought for $700 to $800 in Jordan costs as much as $75,000. [passage omitted] Khan: What is the purpose of your visit to Pakistan? Mush'il: The first purpose in visiting Pakistan is to inform all segments of Pakistani society, including intellectuals, journalists, politicians, and Islamic parties, about Hamas and to spread its message among our brothers. We want to inform them of the Jewish conspiracies against the Muslims, warn them about the future dangers, and exchange ideas of mutual interests and relations of Muslims. The second purpose is to bring our message to the Pakistani Government and its policymakers. [passage omitted]
