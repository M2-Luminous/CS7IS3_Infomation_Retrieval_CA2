Concerning the coffee issue, the Salvadoran president has said that with the retention of 20 percent of exports, favorable results regarding international prices are being achieved. He has said Colombia has an important role in the participation. [Begin Cristiani recording] We will continue to promote certain cooperation and free trade mechanisms with Colombia. During this short meeting, we talked about coffee. We made a follow-up and an evaluation of the retention process, now that a minimum price agreement was reached this week. We have seen a favorable response regarding prices. We think it is going well, and we believe we must continue to take these measures until a stable price is reached. In this regard, Colombia's participation is vital due to the impact they have on the market. [end recording] Concerning a free trade agreement with Colombia and Venezuela, Cristiani has said all they are waiting for is the settling in of the new Venezuelan Government, so as to promote the trade negotiations. [Begin recording] [Cristiani] We talked about a free trade agreement between Colombia and Venezuela, and we talked about Venezuela's situation with their new government, internal problems, and the difficulties that may emerge from a quick follow-up of the negotiations. We believe once President Rafael Caldera is sworn in, we are going to continue trying to promote the agreement. Both President Gaviria and I are interested in reaching a free trade agreement between Central America, Venezuela, and Colombia. [Unidentified reporter] Did you talk about Gaviria's candidacy to the OAS? [Cristiani] We did not talk about that; we had already talked about it on the telephone. He is already aware of El Salvador's position and that of the Central American countries. He has not yet decided on his candidacy. He is still studying the possibility of running, but we did not talk about it. [end recording] Finally, Cristiani said that even though President Gaviria could be one of the candidates for the post of OAS secretary general, Salvadoran support will not be given to him, because the Central American countries have agreed to support the Costa Rican foreign minister, Bernd Niehaus. If there were any changes regarding the support given to the candidates, it would have to be out of a consensus with the rest of the regional countries, according to the Salvadoran president.
