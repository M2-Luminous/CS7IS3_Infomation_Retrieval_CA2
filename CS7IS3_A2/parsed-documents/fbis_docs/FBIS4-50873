The two owners of the two vessels will be dealt with according to ROC fishing laws which mandate punishment for illegal operation in foreign economic zones, COA Fisheries Department Director Li Chien-chuan said. Li said that the fishing licenses for the ships may be suspended or revoked. The owners of the ships were not available for comment on the incident, in which an Argentine Navy corvette opened fire on the Chin Yuan Hsing Saturday, forcing the crew to escape the sinking vessel in lifeboats. About 110 Taiwan fishing boats are reportedly fishing for squid near Argentina and the Falkland Islands. Of this number, Li said, sixty have signed fishing agreements with the Falkland Islands and 13 with the Argentine Government which allow them to fish in territorial waters. The remaining 37 squid boats have not signed the accords and can only fish on the high seas, he said. They are prohibited from fishing in Argentine or Falkland Islands territorial waters. The Argentine Navy has been strictly enforcing a ban on illegal fishing and will continue to do so, Li added. Meanwhile, a report from Buenos Aires said that the crew of the Chin Yuan Hsing was rescued by the Chin Chuang Hsing, which is still somewhere on the high seas. The Chin Chuang Hsing was expected to return to Port Stanley, Falkland Islands on Saturday afternoon, but remained on the high seas through late Sunday. A medical team has been sent to the port to await the Chin Chuang Hsing and treat any injured sailors, the report said.
