Introduction If you were driving in your car and got caught in a traffic jam, you would not know whether there was a detour route available. If that detour could get you to your destination faster, you would not hesitate in taking it. Furthermore, if you always knew when there was an available parking lot nearby where you could park your car, you would not have to worry so much about fighting for parking places, and not have to be pay for expensive parking tickets. The basic functions of a car is not only the driving part but also getting to your destination safely, reliably, and quickly, so the route that you take has important implications. Avoiding illegal stops along the highway also has direct links to keeping traffic volumes down on the roads. The Vehicle Information and Communication System (hereinafter VICS) is a system that provides this type of essential information to the driver and assists the driver in decision-making. 2. Purpose and Benefits of VICS 2.1 Background of VICS Research The automobile is preferred by people for its convenience, so this means that the demands on the roads will steadily grow. The roads receiving this traffic are supposedly being widened and improved, but it will not be long before we reach the base of this demand, resulting in severe congestion and calling into question the basic role of the automobile. There is also a serious concern about the rising number of traffic deaths over the past few years that could be reduced by having more driving safety programs and more traffic safety equipment. The Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) is a system that provides people with information they need when driving. That information is used to keep traffic flows moving in the right direction, and not the least, to make driving smoother and safer. 2.2 Aim of VICS This system offers drivers information on the time certain basic things take when traveling. These for the most part include information such as whether a road is open or not due to accidents or construction, the origin and destination of a trip, degree of traffic congestion, and also travel time on each road. A driver in his car gets this information, and using his judgment, selects the fastest route available to get him to his destination. The use of this system will bring about a redistribution of traffic. For quite some time, the over-concentration of traffic has accelerated the reduction in the ability of the roads to handle this traffic capacity, a phenomena that has come to be known as a traffic jam. On the other hand, however, there is a growing recognition that a redistribution of traffic will quickly restore the ability of the roads to handle this traffic, and ease or get rid of these traffic jams. In other words, drivers seeking more convenient routes that give them a faster alternative to their destination will help make better use of the road networks, and will, secondly, help ease or eliminate traffic congestion. Furthermore, the easing and reduction of traffic congestion decreases driver irritability and frustration because the driving time is shorter and the arrival time is known. Putting drivers more at ease also helps prevent auto accidents due to driver carelessness. In Figure 1, we show the benefits of the system. Figure 1. VICS Benefits The opposite is often the case. For example, parked cars along the road which are there tending to their own immediate needs have a negative effect in that they dramatically reduce the ability of the roads to handle traffic. The VICS system seems too good to be true in that trying to accommodate the needs of the individual in turn benefits society. 2.3 Infrastructure Enables Japan To Take World Lead In addition to the social aspect, the infrastructure already exists in Japan to erect such a system easily. The first part of this is that the information the system requires has already been collected for administrative purposes and is available for use. A big advantage that we have over other countries is that traffic information is systematically gathered by a public safety commission and traffic authorities (Table 1). Table 1. VICS Information (In Planning) 1. Road and Traffic Information - Traveling time (areas, times, etc.) - Traffic congestion (areas, times, etc.) - Accidents (locations, causes, etc.) - Traffic laws (areas, particulars, etc.) - Other information 2. Road and Traffic Related Information - Parking sites (locations, availability, etc.) - Other information [end table] The second area that we already have in place here in Japan is that research has been almost completed on another system that was used to confirm the technical feasibility of this system. The third factor is the sophistication of the on-board equipment used in automobiles and the progress being made in building cars with more advanced features. Car navigation systems, in particular, have shown remarkable growth since manufacturers started coming out with these systems after the Japan Digital Road Map Association began offering digital road maps. There are now more than 300,000 car navigation systems in use today (Figure 2). Figure 2. Car Navigation Systems 3. VICS Promotional Activities and Research Organizations 3.1 VICS Promotional Activities In introducing a new traffic information system for moving vehicles, the National Police Agency (NPA), the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication (MPT), and the Ministry of Construction (MC), recognizing the need to synthesize those traffic information systems in which companies have been doing R&D in order to achieve safer and smoother traffic flow, came up with a single system called the Vehicle Information and Communication System, and in March 1990 set up the VICS Liaison Committee. Later, in December of that year, a group of companies united to form a VICS company and business center, but before putting it into operation, quickly established the VICS Promotional Council with cooperation from the above named ministries and agencies. In October 1991, the Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) was established with over 200 participating corporations and groups, with most new VICS members joining by prearrangement from the break-up of the AMTICS Promotion Council and the RACS Promotion Council (Table 2). Details Surrounding Formation of VICS Promotion Council - March 1990: VICS Promotion Council started by National Police Agency, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and Ministry of Construction - December 1990: Interim report released by VICS Liaison Committee (1) Three ministries/agencies work jointly toward realization of VICS (2) VICS Promotion Council formed by private corporations as preliminary organization to VICS company - September 1991: VICS Promotion Council meeting convened Council Promoter: Koichiro Toyoda, president, Toyota Motor Corp. (chairman at that time) - October 1991: Establishment of VICS Promotion Council Goal: Quickly put Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) into operation, and expedite business side. Chairman: Hiroshi Inose, director, Gakujitsu Joho Center Members: Oki Electric, Sumitomo Denko, Toyota, Nissan, NEC, Hitachi, Matsushita Electric works and 207 other corporations and organizations Thus, VICS was added to the list of traffic information system projects being carried out around the world as shown in Figure 3. The aim of the projects is the implementation of such systems. Figure 3. Vehicle Communication System Related Projects Around the World 3.2 VICS Research Organizations In studying how to implement VICS, we organized a study group to look at each of the items that needed to be researched, and brought these items up in a committee format. The study group was divided into three committees, and these were further divided into subcommittees in order to deal more effectively with both specialized and comprehensive studies. First, there is the "business committee." This committee is made up of a "systems subcommittee" which is studying the implementation of VICS and what needs to be done with regard to commercializing VICS as well as the business side including income and expenses, a "safety subcommittee" which is doing studies to make sure that VICS information does not present problems in terms of safe driving and yet is marketable, and a "database subcommittee" whose aim it is to satisfy the needs of the user. The job of the safety subcommittee is to absolutely avoid the side effects that take place when VICS is used as a specific remedy to make traffic flow safer and smoother. This is an important item that supports the implementation of VICS from the side. The "research committee" is divided into a "beacon subcommittee," an "FM multiplier subcommittee," and a "teleterminal subcommittee" that have been formed to look into each of the media which VICS uses, how the media should actually be used, and the compatibility with VICS. A proposal was also received from the National Police Agency on whether an optical vehicle sensing device that they planned to implement, and which also has a two-way communication feature, could be used in the VICS system as a light beacon, so in April 1993, a "light beacon subcommittee" was formed. The "testing committee" is made up of a "demonstration and testing subcommittee" which was formed in the fall of 1992. This subcommittee is in the process of speeding up preparations to demonstrate and test the system in order to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness and necessity of the system. 4. VICS Outlined 4.1 Designing a User-Oriented Product We believed that the first conditions that VICS must meet are availability, ease of use, and cheap enough for users to afford because this product has yet to demonstrate its usefulness in the world. The VICS system is made up of four different systems according to function, namely, an information gathering system, a data processing and editing system, an information broadcasting system, and an information utilization system (cf. Figure 4). Figure 4. System Overview of VICS In studying each of these systems, the first things we considered was whether to use something that was already available on the market as basic infrastructure, or whether to share infrastructure as needed in the future, and secondly, to make sure that the user could bear the overall cost burden. Next, we emphasized the real time properties of data from the view of being useful to the driver, and set an upper limit of five minutes on the time it takes for data to be sent from an information source to the on-board navigation equipment. As policy, we tried to avoid having the system equipment be too unnecessarily complex, and looked at ways of configuring the systems so that data was received and stored efficiently and the information mainly used as links (segments of numbered roads). This also helped compress the overall volume of information, thereby making more information available with the same amount of data transmitted, and moving the system one step closer to the goal of "anytime, anyplace." The third thing that we considered was one-source processing and information broadcasting. One area that the user is completely unaware is that the different broadcasting sources and broadcasting media differ according to the contents of the data and the road type the car is traveling. For that reason, we made it conditional that VICS cover the information sources needed by drivers, and that the information be processed and broadcast by a single source as traffic information or traffic-related information. In order to promote widespread use of VICS, the data processing and broadcasting system were looked at in terms of how it could be designed to meet the needs of the user (Table 3). Basic Requirements of VICS 1. Efficient infrastructure (1) Use existing infrastructure (2) Share new infrastructure 2. Real time information (1) Time performance of system (2) Usefulness of information 3. Single-source processing and broadcasting of information (1) Cover necessary information sources (2) Consolidate management configuration 4. Ensure product diversity (1) Utilize media characteristics (2) Broadcast configurations compatible with use 4.2 Using Government Collected Data Various public safety commissions and traffic authorities are collecting for administrative purposes assorted traffic information on things such as traffic accidents and traffic jams, and VICS is being given this information through the Japan Road Traffic Information Center which is a joint government organization run by the National Police Agency and the Ministry of Construction. For example, there are 74 traffic control centers set up in cities throughout Japan. That means that traffic signals are now generally controlled according to traffic information collected by vehicle sensing devices. A portion of this information is given as ordinary traffic information through traffic information display boards, or through radio or television, but behind that, there exists an enormous amount of stored information. This is how a basic data collection system has been built in Japan, but before VICS can be put on the market, there needs to be more study done including standardizing the definitions and units of measurements that differ slightly between each traffic authority. In addition to that, we also have to find a way to collect other traffic-related information such as relates to parking in an effective and systematic way. 4.3 Center System and Database The VICS Center will be the central place that processes and edits the data to make it easier for drivers to make effective use of the data in terms of "anytime and anyplace." The basic aim of the VICS Center is to receive and efficiently store data as information which VICS can use to bridge links, but to do that, the center's systems must have databases combining link management configurations for each information source so that all the information forms a network. In specific terms, an information source will make no difference to a driver wanting to use a high-speed route to his destination if he cannot get through on either the high-speed route or regular routes. This is particularly true in terms of travel information. VICS is not a road network made up of units of distance, but ideally is a network made up of units of time, and this time reflects the traffic conditions occurring at those times in real time. For the user, the most practical piece of usable information is the "fastest route" to one's destination, which is displayed on the on-board navigation equipment in the car. This is simply because the traffic congestion problems mentioned in the opening section would not get too far out of hand if drivers had indications of such congestion. Furthermore, in considering the use of on-board navigation equipment, it is essential that the links used in navigation system databases now on the market be compatible, and that the equipment be built so that it can withstand new links being added in the future corresponding to roads in which traffic authorities have gathered data, or to the expansion of those roads. We also have to devise some way of guaranteeing continued use of existing systems now being used in vehicles. A study of VICS links in support of VICS databases is being done with this very point in mind (cf. Figure 5). Figure 5. Link Conversion Configuration The compatibility between VICS links and other individual on-board map database links will hopefully be resolved by a digital road map database bridge being offered by the Japan Digital Road Map Association. In coming up with the on-board map display, consideration was given not only to displaying information based on links, but also to direct use of data and to having relatively inexpensive "simple graphics display" or "character display" for data processing or editing. 4.4 VICS Media Promoting Product Diversity (1) FM Multiplier Broadcasting In order to achieve the goal "anyplace/anytime," we must not only widen the areas being served but we must be able to transmit large volumes of data instantly covering all types of information (cf. Figure 6). The media best suited to do this is FM multiplier broadcasts. So this past May, the Electricity Utility Industrial Council issued the technical standards for characters, graphics, and data for a mobile vehicle, but VICS also contributed to this study. Figure 6. Example of FM Multiplier Transmission Format The unique feature of FM multiplier broadcasts is that it is cheaper and covers a wider service area than can be obtained with the existing broadcasting equipment being used. The degree to which cost can be lowered, however, is based to a certain degree on the advances and technical progress made in the processing functions of on-board equipment, and on the way that information is selected from the large volume of data received, which has tended to place quite a load on the on-board equipment. For example, the map display selects information automatically by displaying the place where one's car is located, but judging by the current cost of equipment, it would take quite a long time before any social benefit was born out of that. That is why an FM multiplier system has an area code added to the information being broadcast. If the on-board equipment is provided with some sort of auto-positioning detection feature, it will enable data to be filtered out automatically. (2) Beacon Beacons provide users in the middle with data by filtering out that data which is unnecessary, and by doing so they lighten the load on the on-board equipment. The biggest feature of a beacon system, which receives data on the road intermittently, has to do with the location where the car receives data. Accordingly, if only filtered information is received from beacons at the spot where it is received, the on-board equipment will basically only have to display that information which it receives. This information could include nearby parking lots, or the driving time required from there to certain main points. In addition to traffic information, we are also considering beacons offering road information such as places that make the present location obvious, place names, shapes of traffic intersections, and destinations. Beacons will also be able to form service areas out of the places where traffic information is needed. Studies are now being done on using both semi-microwave and infrared radiation as an information medium of this beacon system. (3) Teleterminals As far as what is in store for information broadcasting in the future, thought is being given to individual driver requests. Teleterminals are the media best suited to achieve this with VICS. Teleterminals themselves have already been put to commercial use, and being very similar in construction to a portable cellular telephone, are effective two-way data communication devices. A broadcasting-type teleterminal is the kind used in traffic communication systems. The teleterminal was fully tested in the AMTICS pilot experiment, and in practical experiments conducted during the Osaka Flower and Garden Show. In order to have a request-based VICS information broadcasting system, we must first take a hard look at the needs that exist, and then study information access methods that specialize in requests made by drivers, and the databases that correspond to those methods (Table 4). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4. Characteristics of VICS Media | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Beacon |FM Multiplier |Teleterminal | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Service Area (cha-|Min zone repetiti-|Wide area (depend-|Med zone repetiti-| |racter) |ons (optional) |s on FM broadcast |ons (depends on b-| | | |area) |usiness) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Broadcasting Meth-|Sharp distinction |Large batches (br-|Optional (request | |od |between beacons (-|oadcast type) |type) | | |unidirectional) | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The teleterminal is thought to exhibit great utility when equipped with audio recognition as a standard feature, but studies have shown it not to be inefficient in its present stage of development, so we decided to do a study to see what was missing after setting it up to offer simple directions. 4.5 ...Good Products Amid the Competition The last are the on-board systems that utilize information. We believe that the fierce competition between major manufacturers has provided us with an inexpensive good-quality product without it ever having been manufactured or sold. A manufacturing company bases its decisions on whether a market is tilting toward the high end with an emphasis on features and performance, or whether it is tilting toward a large market by having simpler features and lower prices, or it bases its decisions on which media or product type to target given the competition. For that reason, the aim with regard to VICS is to disclose which type of information can be broadcast using what type of format. By doing these types of study in a committee format, we are hoping to come up with on-board equipment that reflects the needs of the user and can be put into operation. 5. Commercializing VICS 5.1 VICS Cost and Efficiency When we looked at what it would take to develop an efficient VICS broadcasting system throughout the country, we found that a centralized system would be cheaper than a decentralized system having centers in each of the prefectures. To be more realistic, however, it would seem to be better to have several centralized blocks throughout the country because we have to make sure we have a back-up system in case of emergencies. In a typical case such as this, the working expenses needed over a 10-year time period are estimated to be ¥390 million with the largest portion of that amount, ¥300 million, going toward plant and equipment costs (¥288 million for information broadcasting equipment, and ¥12 million for center equipment), and ¥90 million going toward management and operating expenses (¥26 million for items associated with center). When a market survey was done to estimate how far-reaching the use of on-board equipment will become, the results indicated more than 18 million units in operation within 10 years. If we include the ¥500,000 in expenses for existing navigational equipment and radios as additional on-board equipment, that total rises to ¥820 million. When we calculate the benefit to society of implementing VICS on this basis, we find that the time saved by shortening driving time and the reduced fuel consumption that results produces a savings of roughly ¥5 trillion. Accordingly, the cost of operating VICS over a 10-year period is estimated at roughly ¥1.2 trillion, but it has a ¥5 trillion return benefit. When we consider the combined use of both a radio beacon system in which traffic authorities build the information broadcast infrastructure and an optical vehicle sensing system installed by the safety commission, and also consider the on-board equipment costs excluding those costs absorbed by the user, we find that VICS will cost an additional ¥38 million, but that the benefit to society will actually be more than 100 times greater at roughly ¥5 trillion. 5.2 VICS Beneficiary The dilemma that VICS finds itself in is that although the benefits outweigh the financial risks, the system cannot be installed and put into immediate service. In studies undertaken earlier, it was found that it was too much of a burden for a VICS business unit to have an infrastructure for providing information, and that such a company could not be formed into a business. Accordingly, after an infrastructure of sorts has been built, the business side of VICS will have to be set up jointly. The most important thing is how to obtain revenue. Excluding the safety, environmental, and market-creating advantages of VICS, the economic effect alone of smoother traffic is greater than the cost of the system, so the question of who should bear the burden of costs is really the major question. Ideally speaking, the costs of the system should be born fairly between those who benefit from the system. Those who benefit from the economic effects resulting from smoother traffic include all the people driving on the roads. In that regard, there are more cars without VICS systems than there are cars with VICS, which are the information users. Moreover, the users of cars equipped with VICS are already having to bear the equipment costs associated with bringing this system up on-line for society's benefit. 6. Conclusion It takes quite a bit of money to build and operate VICS. Since VICS uses information collected by public officials and benefits society as a whole, it should not be made into a typical profit-making business. In determining the beneficiaries of the system and who should pay for the cost of installation, it will be important in the future to determine how much of an effect broadcasting time-keyed information has, and what effect equalized driving times will have on actual traffic volumes on the road, and subsequently, to determine how, where, and when this can be achieved. For people who have the system in their cars, VICS provides more flexibility in the routes that they can take, and in selecting those routes, is not the type of equipment that issues commands or instructions from the outside, but rather more than anything else, is user-friendly in the fact that it allows the driver of a car to make his own decisions based on position and availability. It is a system that makes effective use of road resources which are quite limited, and contributes toward safer and smoother traffic on roads and highways. This fall, we are planning to hold a public demonstration of VICS in hopes of gaining wider public support and understanding of the system. Having received more cooperation than ever before from the government, we hope to have the VICS system up in operation soon.
