ANC regional monitoring co-ordinator Roy Ainslie, charged that Section 61 of the Electoral Act had been contravened. The section prohibits interference with free political activity. "We are extremely concerned that this could be a foretaste of what we can expect on election day unless something is done about the nature of policing." He charged police were unable to contain the situation. Police could not be immediately reached for comment. A tense standoff ensued earlier as thousands of ANC supporters thronged the street leading to the King Zwelithini Stadium, while about 500 metres away, several hundred IFP supporters mobilised in the stadium. Police fortified the road with armoured vehicles, and stood rifle at the ready, to prevent any potential clashes. Later police teargassed ANC supporters who were preparing to leave shortly after an address by ANC National Chairman Thabo Mbeki, Southern Natal Chairman Jeff Radebe and Transkei ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa. Supporters scattered for cover, and a volley of gunfire pierced the smoke-filled air. No one was reported injured. Within minutes the street where ANC supporters had cheered on their leaders, was empty, bar the piles of shoes left behind by retreating men, women and children. Monitors on the scene charged that police had lobbed teargas canisters first, forcing fleeing supporters to fire. Minutes later, the stadium's occupants left in the opposite direction. In a telephonic interview later, IFP spokesman Ed Tillet condoned the occupation of the stadium. He said the occupation was a response to continued attacks on its members in Umlazi and surrounding townships. "What's happened doesn't surprise me. Under normal circumstances we would never condone this. The extraordinary circumstances prevailing in the area have culminated in this action. We believe the ANC has got their just rewards. This is a taste of their own medicine." He added the occupation was sanctioned by the SA [South African] Hostel Dwellers Association and not the IFP. The association is non-aligned but IFP-sympathetic. Transitional Executive Council [TEC] member Pravin Gordhan charged that police failure to remove IFP supporters from the stadium showed its partiality to them. "There is also an unwillingness by police to ensure the electoral act can be put into place throughout the country," Mr Gordhan told SAPA. Meanwhile in his address to the mass of supporters, Mr Mbeki said: "The ANC are not cowards. If we were we would have entered the stadium, but because of our nature we prefer not to use violence." On a political note, Mr Mbeki charged IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi was afraid to contest elections due to a fractional support base. He said if Mr Buthelezi's claim to have millions of IFP supporters were true, he should participate in the April poll. Gen Holomisa, speaking in his capacity as chairman of the Military Council of Transkei, urged all homeland defence forces, and private armies to be placed under the control of the TEC. This would ensure that troop deployment would no longer be undertaken by the National Party Government, he said.
