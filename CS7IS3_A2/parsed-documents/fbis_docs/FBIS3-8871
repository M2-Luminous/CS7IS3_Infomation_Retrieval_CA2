The 350,000 signatures which, according to the Slovak Constitution, are needed for the president to call a referendum were not collected during a petition drive organized by the HZDS, journalists were told by head of the President's Office Jan Findra and Ladislav Orosz from the Office's legislative department. During the petition drive, which started in the last week of February and lasted until March, 422,054 signatures on 21,000 petition sheets were collected and submitted to the President's Office for checking. A total of 695 sheets were found to be invalid during the checking, Findra said, adding that out of the 399,212 signatures on the remaining archs [as received] 38,000 signatures were illegible and over 36,000 people did not put their first name or shortened it. So only 324,321 signatures were recognized valid. And after checking addresses of the people who signed the petition a total of 232,957 valid signatures were left, which is not enough for a referendum to be called. Orosz said that the reason why the petition drive failed was that it was the first time that a referendum had been organized in Slovakia, its organization was not of the appropriate standard and the pace of the collection of signatures was too quick.
