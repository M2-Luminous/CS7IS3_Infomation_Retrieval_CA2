Specifically, following the assessment of UN official Gustave Feissel, who does not believe that the Denktas letter includes conditions, U.S. State Department Special Coordinator on the Cyprus Issue Robert Lamb has judged the Denktas letter as acceptable. The foreigners do not attach so much importance to the "titles" of Denktas and the letterheads and the principles or thoughts that he expresses, but are concentrating on the substance: that he agrees to discuss the three UN documents, and in the end that is what counts. We do not think that under the circumstances the Greek Cypriot side will have the ease to say "no" to a call by the UN secretary general for talks. For this reason, we repeat that the political leaders should meet and make collective decisions on the handling [of the Cyprus issue].
