FR940622-0-00035 FR940622-0-00011 The law is self-implementing; that is, it did not require public comment or regulations in order to be implemented. However, we did consult extensively with major beneficiary and provider organizations (such as the Gray Panthers, American Hospital Association, and the American Association of Retired Persons) and have subsequently revised the final version of ``An Important Message from Medicare'' (the ``Message'') after these consultations. Comment: One commenter stated that the ``Message'' is inadequate, especially as it pertains to discharge planning, and suggested either a separate notice or an expanded notice to focus on the discharge planning requirements of section 1861(e)(6) of the Act. Another commenter asserted that the original ``Message'' was poorly written, as it tries to cover legal requirements. The commenter also asserted that there is a need for the ``Message'' to be more supportive and informative. Response: The revised ``Message'' contains several references to the availability of hospital discharge planning and the need to consult a physician or appropriate hospital staff for assistance. Beneficiaries have a current need for the ``Message,'' and we do not believe it would have been appropriate to delay its distribution until after the condition of participation for discharge planning, proposed to be included in our regulations at ยง482.43 (see 53 FR 22506, June 16, 1988), is published as a final rule. Requiring a notice of hospital discharge rights and requiring hospitals to provide a discharge planning process are two separate statutory provisions of OBRA 86 that were not meant to be combined. Further, Congress did not specify explicitly in section 1866(a)(1)(M) that discharge planning should be included in the notice. We have revised the original ``Message'' to improve its readability as well as its content. We note that it has always been our intention to revise the ``Message'' in the future as patient needs change. Comment: One commenter thought we should include an explanation of the content of the ``Message'' in the final rule and that an outline of it in the regulations would aid in its later interpretation. Response: We are including as Appendix I to this interim final rule the current ``Message''; it is self-explanatory. We do not believe it is necessary to outline its content in the regulations text, as the ``Message'' is readily available at hospitals. Comment: One commenter thought we should advise the public how they can obtain a copy of the ``Message'' or that we should send each commenter a copy. Response: The ``Message'' was distributed to all hospitals via Medicare Hospital Manual Transmittal No. 545, dated July 1988. The ``Message'' is readily available to the public since it has been reproduced in the 1989 through 1994 editions of ``The Medicare Handbook.'' As stated above, we are also publishing it as Appendix I to this final rule. Comment: We received four comments, all from beneficiary organizations, in favor of our requirement that the hospital obtain a signed acknowledgement of the discharge rights notice. We also received 17 comments against it, primarily from hospitals and hospital organizations. Four of these commenters stated that there is no need for this requirement. They cited HCFA's statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that, ``we believe we already have full cooperation from hospitals.'' Response: We strongly believe that the requirement that a hospital furnish a statement concerning discharge rights to each Medicare beneficiary must be fully met. However, we are persuaded by the commenters that full compliance has already been achieved in most hospitals. Therefore, we have eliminated the requirement for a signed acknowledgement. In its place, we now specify under ยง489.27 that a hospital must be able to demonstrate that it complies with the requirement that each beneficiary be furnished with a discharge rights notice at or about the time of admission. We note, however, that signed acknowledgements could be required as part of a plan of correction for a hospital that was found to be out of compliance with this requirement. Comment: Fourteen commenters objected to the requirement that hospitals retain the signed acknowledgement by the beneficiary, as they anticipate it will be a tremendous burden in terms of cost of the forms, storage of the acknowledgements, and added processing time by the admissions staff. Response: In conjunction with the elimination of the signed acknowledgement requirement, we have deleted the accompanying retention requirement from this interim final rule. When we published the proposed rule, our PRO program was oriented towards review of hospital medical records, and so we chose initially to implement the discharge rights requirement specifically in terms of an acknowledgement in the medical record. More recently, however, we have reoriented our PRO program towards efforts more likely to bring about general improvements in quality and have minimized our funding of more limited ``process'' requirements such as review of individual medical records. Accordingly, we recognize that the proposed acknowledgement and retention requirements have become obsolete and are eliminating them. Again, the final rule does require hospitals to demonstrate compliance with the discharge rights notification requirement, but does not specify the manner of compliance. We expect some hospitals may continue to seek and retain signed acknowledgements but believe they should have other, less burdensome, options as well.
