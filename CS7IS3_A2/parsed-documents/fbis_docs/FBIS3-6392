Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, told a press conference that Tokyo is doing its utmost to expand foreign chip buying. Kumano was responding to newspaper reports that the United States has urged Tokyo to formulate new action plans on chip trade, including the government encouraging the auto and telecommunications sectors to step up foreign chip buying and extending the current chip accord calling for the 20 percent foreign share in the Japanese market for additional years. The reported U.S. requests are similar to those shown in the bilateral chip trade talks in January, Kumano said. Washington may renew these demands in the ongoing Hawaii talks to assess the chip trade performance in October-December of 1993 but Japan has no intention of taking new measures, Kumano said. Kumano said the latest accord between Tokyo and Washington over cellular phone trade cannot be applied to auto and other trade issues covered under the "framework" talks. The comment came in response to Washington's reported request in the past several days for Tokyo to ensure results in auto trade areas on the basis of the approach used in settling the trade dispute between Motorola Inc. and Nippon Idou Tshushin Corp. (IDO). Telecommunications trade is different from autos, Kumano said, explaining that the former sector is under government regulations, allowing room for government intervention. It is "impossible" for the government to force automakers to guarantee the size of their parts buying from the U.S., Kumano said. Such a request would strip Tokyo of its willingness to make efforts to get the stalled framework talks rolling again, he said.
