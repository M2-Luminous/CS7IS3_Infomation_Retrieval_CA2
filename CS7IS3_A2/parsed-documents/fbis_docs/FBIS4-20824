These are deployed at seven different sites and must be destroyed within a period of ten years. He said that chemical weapons causing a blistering effect were among the first to be destroyed at two sites-in the villages of Kamarka (Udmurtia) and Gorny (Saratov Region). Tarasevich said the operation would cost Rbl [rubles] 500 Bn [billion] at last year's prices. The total spending for the destruction of all chemical weapons runs at Rbl 2.5 Tn [trillion]. However, Tarasevich declined to say whether Russia was engaged in the development of new-generation chemical weapons on the grounds that this should be "the subject of a special session." Head of the Foreign Ministry's arms control department Oleg Sokolov said it would be in Russia's interests to become one of the first of 65 signatories to ratify the convention on the destruction of chemical weapons. He said "negative implications from Russia's failure to do so are obvious." For his part, chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov who was also involved in the hearings told reporters that Russia had offered to destroy 40,000 tons of chemical weapons though it had produced more than 400,000 tons. In his view, the remainder was destroyed in a barbarous way without any elementary precautionary measures being taken, which in itself "is just as dangerous as the use of the weapon itself." To begin with, an international commission of experts must be set up to find where and how those weapons were buried, he said. Mirzayanov called for extending the destruction period from 25 to 30 years given the enormous spending involved.
