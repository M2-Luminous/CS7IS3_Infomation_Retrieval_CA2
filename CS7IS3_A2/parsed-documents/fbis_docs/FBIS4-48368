Yesterday, AFL Commander Lieutenant General Bowen issued a stern warning to Taylor's men about problems in Harbel, the site of the giant Firestone rubber plantation, and now ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] have taken action to try to stop things getting worse, as Nii Nartey Allison reports in this telex from Monrovia. Two truckloads of African peacekeeping troops moved into Harbel today to stave off war between the AFL and Charles Taylor's NPFL. A spokesman for the African peacekeeping forces said that the deployment in Harbel was a preventative and precautionary measure. He called on Harbel residents to remain calm as the situation was fully under control. The chief of the AFL, Lt. Gen. Hezekiah Bowen, yesterday threatened to wage war against the NPFL if it did not withdraw from AFL positions in the Harbel area. However, the NPFL liaison officer in Monrovia, John Richardson, today dismissed Bowen's threats as no threat to the NPFL but rather a threat to the peace process and the Liberian people. He said Bowen should take his case to the cease-fire violation committee set up and provided for under the Cotonou peace accord. Meanwhile, a Russian vessel, the M.V. Volotitsa, has been detained here at the free port of Monrovia for illegal entry and bringing in 81 aliens. A Justice Ministry statement said 11 immigration officers assigned to the free port have been charged with negligence of duty. The ministry said the ship arrived here two weeks ago and unloaded 81 aliens believed to be mercenaries. They disembarked and disappeared before immigration officers at the port knew what had happened. Neither the nationalities of the aliens nor its last port of call have been revealed. ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] leader Roosevelt Johnson accused Alhaji Koromah and his Mandingo supporters of hiring the mercenaries to help fight his Krahn faction. Koromah dismissed the Johnson claim as baseless, untrue, and mere fabrication designed to cause confusion.
