[passage omitted] Some observers believe that Syria is currently trying to resolve matters between Jordan and Libya. The Syrians believe that any Jordanian pressure on Tripoli in this connection would weaken the latter's position in the worsening Lockerbie crisis. At any rate, it seems that Jordan is trying to identify the clues to this issue outside Jordanian territory, as the information available has not indicated that Jordanian security services have taken any actions against members of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council or made any arrests in this connection. It seems that it is seeking to get hold of all clues in light of the investigations with those suspected of carrying out the assassination operation in question in Lebanon, and to determine whether they have any link with members of this organization in Jordan.
