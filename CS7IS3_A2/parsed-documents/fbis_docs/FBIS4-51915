The new law prevents them from engaging in retail and wholesale business, among other things, causing an outpouring of anger. In a meeting held Wednesday, the brokers resolved to continue their "work-to-rule struggle" until the government amends the law. The government, meanwhile, flatly rejected their demand Wednesday by deciding not to revise the law. A senior presidential aide said, "there is no such thing as the principle of the law, which has been pushed for in the perspective of reform, to be retracted or re- amended. The brokers' act can by no means be accepted from the viewpoint of either the producers or consumers." He said, "the government should, on the contrary, see to it that this incident be used as an opportunity for a structural reform of distribution of farm and fishery products to be facilitated." Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok instructed Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Choe In-ki to relieve the farm market paralysis created by the brokers' strike. Should the brokers continue to strike, the government will accuse them of "group egoism" and take punitive steps including investigation of their account books for heavy taxation, officials said.
