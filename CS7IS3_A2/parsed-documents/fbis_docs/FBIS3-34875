He accused the Americns of doing nothing to stop the war there. He added, in an interview with AL-HAYAH conducted in Paris yesterday, that the United States had not behaved reasonably towards an important partner such as Pakistan, and that the sanctions it imposed have hurt his country. The Pakistani foreign minister touched on the Afghan question in his interview, saying that the reason for the failure of the peace accords there was the disqualification of the military sides from the solution and opining that there had to be a broad solution including all sides. Regarding the Egyptian "Afghans" who say that Pakistan expelled them from its territory, he said, "It was hard for us to distinguish between Egyptians and Sudanese, because they all carried Sudanese passports." Asif Ali further confirmed that his country had made a decision to remain in Somalia for as long as its people required the presence of Pakistani forces. He also reaffirmed his demand that a referendum be held in Kashmir to grant its population the freedom of self-determination, and denied that his country had any intention to annex this region. The text of the interview follows. Kashmir Regarding the bases upon which, in Pakistan's view, a Kashmir settlement should rest, he said, "Our view is simple in this regard; there must be coexistence between the civilized entities of the world, and in accordance with Islamic principles, and with what United Nations law stipulates. There are the Security Council resolutions on Kashmir that must be implemented, chiefly the holding of a referendum by which the residents of Kashmir may decide whether they want to join the Indians, or Pakistan." Addressing the likelihood of a Turkish-Pakistani solution in Bosnia after the visit of the two countries' prime ministers to Sarajevo, he said, "Our position on this crisis is one with that of the 52 countries of the Islamic Conference Organization. It stipulates the sovereignty of nations and respect for human rights. If the sovereignty of one country is destroyed, and that is accepted in principle, then the sovereignty of the other nations comes into question." He believes that it is essential not to legitimize aggression through hasty solutions, saying that "a veiled peace will never lead to lasting peace; the two world wars are the best proof of that. Therefore we do not understand Europe's position. We do not understand how Europe made this costly mistake. The results of this mistake will be serious and dangerous for the future of Europe, the Atlantic alliance, and the UN. My view is that depriving a country of the right of self-defense is immoral, and we condemn it vigorously. Nor do we understand the reason why Europe does not take responsibility for the war going on in the middle of the continent. It holds to the principle of coexistence among religions and peoples, so why does Europe not do so in this matter?" He discussed his belief that the United States has not taken a well-defined position on the war in Bosnia; he said that the Americans "are not doing a thing." Relations With Washington On another front, the foreign minister commented on the U.S. decision to freeze its aid to Pakistan because of doubts about its development of a nuclear bomb. "Traditionally we have had excellent relations with the United States, and we hope that they will return and resume in order to remove the misunderstanding arising primarily from the nuclear issue. The American law, known as the Pressler Amendment, forbids us from getting weapons systems for which we have paid more than $1 billion in cash. This harms us and has made us feel that there is an anti-Pakistan bias." He added that Islamabad considers that the United States "has not behaved reasonably, especially towards one of its important partners." As to his nuclear policy, he said that he had explained to the three senators who visited his country recently that Pakistan had maintained to the international community that it will not develop an atomic bomb. He confirmed that Islamabad refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty because India had not signed it and thus the problem was a regional one. He pointed out that his country had submitted very significant proposals in this regard. "We are ready to sign the treaty as soon as India signs it." Neighboring Countries Speaking of Pakistan's efforts, with Saudi Arabia, to mediate between the two warring sides in Afghanistan, he said, "I believe that the major groups have not taken part. This is my personal view, not as a foreign minister but as a political analyst. Now, our inclination is to reach an accord between all the neighboring countries of Afghanistan. We all agree on the solution, and we say that it must be a broad one embracing all sides, from the military men to the jihad factions and others. Only then will we be able to achieve a lasting solution, because historically, and over two and a half centuries, Afghanistan has been a country whose unity was based on a wide-ranging alliance." AL-HAYAH asked him whether Pakistan's rapprochement with Turkey, was aimed against Iran, and whether it was linked to his country's excellent relations with the Gulf states. He said, "Our relations with Turkey are not aimed at Iran. Iran is a friendly country and very close to us; it is a neighbor, bound to us by great understanding, just as with Afghanistan. Our relations are aimed at strengthening these ties. Regarding the Gulf, unfortunately Iran does not have excellent relations with the Gulf states, and some Gulf states are uneasy to some extent, especially after Iran seized some islands." Addressing Egypt's request to have the Arab Afghans handed over, he said, "There are a number of Egyptian fighters who came to Afghanistan and had headquarters in Peshawar; they were fighting in Afghanistan and used Peshawar as a base. Some of them are charged with acts of terrorism in Egypt. We were recently asked to turn them over. It is very hard for us to distinguish between who is Egyptian and who is Sudanese, because the routes by which they came all passed through Khartoum, and their passports with visas from our embassy were Sudanese. The Egyptian interior minister and chief of intelligence visited us, and our chief of intelligence visited Egypt; I think that they can distinguish between an Egyptian for themselves, and a number of those were prevented from entering Pakistan." He explained that he thought these numbered between 20 and 30, "but we cannot hand over citizens with Sudanese passports to Egypt." In response to a question on whether the withdrawal of the Europeans and the United States from Somalia would affect the mission of the Pakistani forces there, he said, "We do not make our decisions based on what the United States and Europe decide. We have decided to remain in Somalia for as long as the Somali people need us."
