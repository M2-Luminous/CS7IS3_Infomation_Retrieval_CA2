In accordance with the government's decisions, beginning on 10 April 1994, those enterprises which have failed to pay for energy sources will not receive a single cubic meter of gas. Decree No. 196 of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers "On Settling An Enterprise's Accounts for Natural Gas" may be summarized as follows. The gas-supplying enterprises of Derzhkomnaftogaz [State Committee on Oil and Gas]--Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz--will become the organs responsible for carrying out this decree. The reason for applying such harsh measures lies in the fact that previous demands by the government regarding the introduction of prepayment for delivery of natural gas supplies and restriction on the distribution of gas to those consumers who fail to pail their gas bills on time have not, in fact, been carried out. And it was only in March 1994 that organs of the Ukrainian Derzhkomnaftogaz implemented a series of measures which compelled enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of the Macine-Building Industry--the greatest consumers of energy for production purposes--to begin paying back their debts. On the other hand, the Derzhkomnaftogaz cannot stop gas deliveries to many of its consumers (even to those which chronically fail to pay their gas bills) without thereby risking a complete disruption of the technological processes at these enterprises--something which could cause breakdowns or even accidents. The latest government decree on putting a stop to gas deliveries allows the Derzhkomnaftogaz to proceed to completely shut off the supply of gas if the debtors fail to settle up by 10 April. Moreover, the responsibility for the consequences of applying such measures shall be borne by the leading officials of the debtor-enterprises involved. In such situations the enterprises' leading officials will have to draw on their own hard-currency accounts, including those in foreign banks. Shutting off gas deliveries does not apply, however, to enterprises of the public-utilities sector, which are financed on accounts of the state budget. Moreover, the above-mentioned decree is the latest step in the government's consistent program for compelling Ukrainian enterprises which produce goods suitable for export to take part in paying for the import of Russian energy sources. In the opinion of representatives of Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz, the latest change in the system of settling consumers' accounts (partly or sometimes by consumers making prepayments for deliveries on a contractual basis) and accounts for gas-93 will allow the Derzhkomnaftogaz to accumulate funds for settling accounts with Russia within quite a short period of time. All the more so in that its own previous decrees had already demanded that bills be paid in hard currency from those of our country's enterprises which have it in their bank accounts. The new scheme set forth by Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers for settling accounts with Russia could be called "a la Nordex." In order to speed up the introduction of a mechanism of reciprocal clearing accounts with the Russian gas-suppliers, the Ukrainian government has adopted a schem for covering its debts by means of bartering goods through a fully authorized middleman or intermediary--the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz Association. According to this scheme, the consumer-enterprises will be able to pay their bills into the Ukrgazprom account, using Ukrainian karbovantsy to do so; and the Gazprom will immediately channel these karbovantsy into an account of the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz. The latter will buy a certain quantity and assortment of goods in Ukraine (those on a list approved by the above-mentioned decree) for karbovantsy and then sell them to Russian enterprises for rubles, thereby obtaining funds to pay for Russian gas. Formerly the Ukrgazprom on its own had to buy Russian rubles or hard currency at the exchange rate set by the National Bank; moreover, it was far from always successful in finding the necessary sum. To a large extent, the scheme adopted by the government repeats the previously approved scheme, which--however--turned out to be rather ineffective. The fully authorized organizations--Ukrnaftogazzabez and Rosnaftokomplekt--were unable to sufficiently provide the material and technical elements to cover the Ukrainian debt for energy sources. In the case of the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz, the operating principles will be similar to the scheme under which the well-known Austrian-Swiss firm Nordex operates in Ukraine. But it is still too early to judge the effectiveness of the scheme which will be implemented by the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz. The decree issued by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers "On the Price of Natural Gas To Be Released to Enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry in 1994" may be summarized as follows. This decree was adopted by the government on 4 April. It supplemented the list of government measures with regard to setting up and regulating a system of settling accounts for energy sources. According to the decree, the accounts for imported gas will be managed by enterprises under the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry in Russian Federation rubles or in hard currency at a price equivalent to 65 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. Furthermore, this sum will also include the cost of transporting the gas by the transport organizations of Ukraine's Derzhkomnaftogaz--computed at 4.1 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic meters. These prices shall not apply to the cost of gas for enterprises producing fertilizer and other items for protecting plants and ensuring the success if springtime field operations. A decree previously adopted by the government "On Settling Accounts for Natural Gas by Enterprises Under the Minsirty of Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry (No. 23, dated 3 January 1994) stipulated that these enterprises must pay in karbovantsy for transporting gas through the territory of Ukraine. The revocation of this point attests to the government's decisive intention to achieve from the gas-consumers of the above-mentioned ministries compliance with the conditions set forth by the Cabinet of Ministers--Ukrainian enterprises must take part not only in paying for imported energy sources, but also bear the expenditures of entailed in delivering them directly to the consumers. It is anticipated that the Derzhkomnaftogaz transport organizations will be ensured by the government's decisions against late payments by the consumers for the delivery of gaz being imported--for the most part--from Russia. The government's January decree also indicated that the above-named ministries and Derzhkomnaftogaz must make sure that contracts are drawn up by the sub-departmental enterprises for purchasing from each of them an additional 6 billion cubic meters of gasfor the needs of the national economy. At that time the price of gas was not indicated, and the industrial enterprises were in no hurry to come to terms on this matter, as had been stipulated in the decree. It was precisely for that reason that the decree issued by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers on 4 April mandated not only the signing of contracts (to be sure, the terms were not indicated), but also the payment from the account of 52.4 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. As has been previously provided for, the Derzhkomnaftogaz is to pay this amount to the enterprises in Ukrainian karbovantsy "at the official exchange rate set by the National Bank of Ukraine on the day that the payment is made." The decree does not indicate whether this obligation pertains to those enterprises which came to terms and paid the amount owed prior to 4 April, or whether they must make additional payments. But if, indeed, there are any such enterprises, they can only be envied. Obviously it is by this means that the government is attempting to compel Ukraine's industrial structures to pay a greater share of the energy costs for consumers in the budgetary sphere. And certainly the chairman of the Derzhkomnaftogaz, Mykhaylo Kovalko, back at the end of 1993 noted that state financing for providing energy sources to the budgetary spheres was insufficient for paying for even half of the raw material being imported. Together with this, the Cabinet of Ministers obligated the Derzhkomnaftogaz to fully provide for the needs of the national economy's budgetary sphere. Because of the differences in the currency exchange rates, the industrial structures will, obviously, have to cover the shortfall in budgetary financing. However, such decisiveness on the part of the government does not mean at all that the enterprises subordinate to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry will be in any immediate hurry to pay for imported energy sources. Moreover, the gas-transport organizations of the Derzhkomnaftogaz will be in an advantageous situation. If they previously had to extend credit--whether they wanted to or not--to the enterprises involved and had no possibility of settling accounts for imported energy sources, nowadays the situation has changed fundamentally. The leading officials of Ukrgaz and Ukrgazprom have already had occasion to state that if the domestic Ukrainian gas consumers pay their debts and will regularly make their prepayments, at least in part, the gas-transport organizations as early as June would be able to return most of their debt to Russia. And by October they would be able to settle their accounts with the RAT [expansion not given] Gazprom and be able to purchase gas in any amounts required. Let's point out here that--by using this method--Ukraine managed to settle its accounts with Russia for gas deliveries during the first three months of the current year--to the extent of approximately 110 million U.S. dollars. However, paying back its debt for 1993--amounting to approximately 700 million U.S. dollars--still remains a serious problem.
