The central topic of their discussions was how to focus on, serve, and submit to the overall task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability," which was proposed by the CPC Central Committee and expounded in the report. At a crucial moment when our country is promoting package reform with breakthroughs in key areas and is accelerating the pace of building a socialist market economic system, the deputies, who are in Beijing to attend the NPC session, were aware of their heavy responsibilities. Lively discussions were going on in all meeting rooms, with the deputies focusing on deliberating the "Government Work Report" as they bore in mind the many problems specific to the grass-roots level. The discussions were in-depth from the outset as the deputies did away with pleasantries. Deputy Cheng Weigao from Hebei maintained: The report gives us a feeling that the party Central Committee and the State Council are so firmly committed to deepening reform and to advancing the process of building a socialist market economic system, that they completely foresee difficulties and obstacles that may arise on the way ahead, and that they can take steps to solve problems while the latter are still in their infancy. He went on to express his views on the question of deepening reform as part of the overall task. He observed: If we fail to tackle key aspects of reform this year, we cannot proceed on all fronts; if we fail to proceed on all fronts coordinately, it will be difficult to establish a new system. Successful reform requires efforts to 1) conduct proper propaganda on reform, correctly guide public opinion on reform, and carry out ideological and political work among cadres and people; 2) pay due attention to coordinating the reform process; 3) solve thorny and key problems relating to enterprise reform and commodity prices; and 4) pay attention to constantly deepening and improving reform. He said: Enterprise reform is the most important and crucial part of the effort to deepen reform; its success or failure is the major criterion for judging the success or failure of reform as a whole. We should make enterprise reform the focus and crux of all reforms. Reform is the driving force, development is the goal, and stability is the prerequisite. Without stability, reform cannot succeed and it is impossible to pursue development. In closing, he said confidently: This year's reform is bound to succeed, the economy will surely develop, and social stability is bound to prevail if we focus on the overall task of the entire party and country and proceed in accordance with the principles and tasks spelled out in the report. We are fully confident of this prospect. Deputy He Zhukang from Jilin maintained: We must proceed from an overall point of view; understand and handle all aspects of the relationship between reform, development, stability, and others; and improve the levels of integration and coordination in reform and development. On the other hand, the various problems and difficulties we currently encounter in reform and development are certain deep-seated contradictions which require us to highlight key areas and achieve breakthroughs in those areas while increasing the level of integration and coordination. He said: This particular point is explained very well in the "Government Work Report." On the question of work guidelines, the report focuses on the overall task of the entire party and country in seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. It dialectically links up reform, development, and stability, and the resultant idea permeates the entire report. On the pace of reform, the report gives prominence to reform of the enterprise system, as well as reform of the financial, taxation, banking, and price management systems, thereby integrating efforts to establish principal competitors in the market and to invigorate microeconomic activity with those aimed at improving macroeconomic management and at setting stricter standards for market activity. This constitutes a concrete plan for implementing the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and for building a socialist market economic system. On the question of socialist modernization, the report takes economic construction as the central task. It makes comprehensive plans for building a socialist market economic system, as well as for promoting socialist democracy and a socialist legal system. It makes wide-ranging arrangements for both socialist material and spiritual civilizations. This makes it possible to apply our country's concept of modernization to our work plans more completely and in a more balanced manner. On economic development, the report emphasizes the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, restrictive factors that have a great impact on the national economy such as enterprises' economic returns and the investment structure, and the fundamental goal of improving the living standards. This reflects deep concern about improving the general quality of the national economy. The deputies enthusiastically discussed the issue of how to focus on, serve, and submit to the overall task. Deputy Yao Minxue from Ningxia forwarded four viewpoints: First, it is necessary to base the job of solving problems and handling various contradictions of the overall task and to understand and attach utmost importance to the task. The overall task is to uphold economic construction as the center, seize opportunities, deepen reforms, widen opening up, promote development, and maintain stability with the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. In addition, it is necessary to unite more closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core as well as more conscientiously safeguard the State Council's authority to ensure the smooth implementation of administrative orders. Second, it is necessary to safeguard stability. As we cannot do anything at all without social and political stability, we must strive to safeguard stability. Speaking on Ningxia, the crux lies in strengthening the unity of Hui, Han, and other nationalities. Further, we must encourage them to cleave to each other and advance through thick and thin. Third, we must uphold the principle of grasping two links [grasping economic development and socialist spiritual modernization simultaneously] and taking stern measures in tackling both. In the course of reform, opening up, and modernization, it is necessary to effectively tackle spiritual civilization, strengthen ideological work among the people, enhance understanding, eliminate suspicions, regulate sentiment, remove contradictions, readjust relations, and enhance the spirit to mobilize all forces for the great undertakings of the four modernizations. Fourth, it is necessary to do practical work. We should give our best instead of doing superficial work; speak the truth instead of engaging in empty talk; and work for practical, instead of fabricated results. We should do genuine, solid, and practical work to effectively implement this session's guidelines. Deputy Li Qiyan from Beijing said: The "Government Work Report" stressed that we must focus on, serve, and submit to the overall task in various undertakings. This should be a principle we must steadfastly implement. He said: Looking from the point of development, we should pay special attention to several issues that concern the overall task: 1) agriculture; 2) changing the operating mechanism of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises; 3) maintaining stable commodity prices; 4) upgrading the people's living standards; and 5) safeguarding social stability. We must attach great importance to these issues that concern the overall task. Deputy Bai Qingcai from Shaanxi maintained: For a province to focus on, serve, and submit to the overall task means that in solving problems and undertaking jobs, it should first correctly identify its position in the overall task. Under the prerequisite of focussing on, serving, and submitting to the overall task, it should maintain coordinated development with the overall task. Serving the overall task is inseparable from stability. It is of vital importance to properly handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability. We should adopt a realistic and practical approach to thoroughly implement the intentions of the central authorities in every task. We should do practical work and effectively nurture and bring into play the people's enthusiasm. Deputy Hui Liangyu from Hubei maintained: To focus on, serve, and submit to the overall task, it is necessary to pay special attention to solving the following few problems: First, we should upgrade economic efficiency by ways and means and should not blindly pursue output value, growth rate, and scales. Second, we should, through deepened reform, establish a modern enterprise system to truly bring enterprises to life. Third, we should further adjust and optimize the economic structure and focus on solving the "bottle-neck" that restricts national economic development. Fourth, we should attach great importance to agriculture and peasants' problems. He said: Agriculture is a sector that will bring about peace to the country. It is a sector that involves many people and has a relatively large social benefit. It is also a relatively fragile sector. We must not overlook our work for the rural areas and peasants' interests. Fifth, we should adopt realistic measures to safeguard social stability. Deputy Tian Chengping from Qinghai maintained: To achieve the goal of focussing on, serving, and submitting to the overall task, we should first forge a uniform understanding. He said: In recent years, the pace of China's reform and construction has quickened and the national economy has developed rapidly. However, some problems have also emerged during progress. An important reason for the emergence of these problems is due to the lack of unanimity in our understanding. The good results obtained in macroeconomic regulation and control last year were due to better uniformity in our understanding. Problems can be solved only if everyone from top to bottom uniform their understanding. He said that Qinghai people supported the policies of the party Central Committee and the State Council. They will definitely implement well various tasks with uniform understanding. With reference to specific work, Deputy Yue Qifeng from Liaoning pointed out: When seeking understanding on the issue of focussing on and submitting to the overall task, it is necessary to emancipate minds, do practical work while seeking truth, and work innovatively. It is necessary to give prominence to reform and uphold the advocation "development is the last word," and correctly regulate the relationship among reform, development, and stability to maintain social stability. We should effectively run state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises and strongly nurture new economic growth points. In particular, we should support leading spots in economic development so as to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Persons in charge of the State Council's various departments observed the group meetings yesterday and today to hear deputies' opinions and to answered their queries.
