The meeting was attended by indigenous people from the Rio Negro and Neuquen Provinces in the Argentine Patagonian region. The CAI issued a press release stating that "the prices of products have not changed," adding that -- on the contrary -- "low prices continue to aggravate the situation of small- and medium-size producers." The CAI demands that the authorities order the immediate implementation of a comprehensive Indian law and rejects "attempts to divide the region, which merely seek to undermine the historic decision by indigenous peoples to remain politically united." The CAI reaffirms the determination to struggle and resist all plans "to evict us and to do everything possible to defend the land that is our life." They decided to strengthen the political unification of the southern region "through coordinated movements, as a way to defend our rights and the rights of all groups affected by current economic policies." They demand the implementation of the Southern Region Development Organization "which must make every effort to plan alternatives." The document concludes: "The participation of the CAI in the continental, indigenous, black, and popular movement places us on the same footing as other Argentine and Latin American organizations, on the same path of construction, and as part of the same resistance."
