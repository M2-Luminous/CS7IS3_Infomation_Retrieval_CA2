We availed ourselves of this opportunity to interview Prime Minister Meksi: [Begin recording] [Meksi] Regarding the government's activity during these two years, I would highlight the great work done in the direction of the all-round reformation of Albania in the aspect of structures and the judicial, economic, and general aspect so as to pass from a state with a centralized economy and a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat into a state of democracy and free market economy. Of course, just a glimpse of that great work of the government and parliament, after two years, cannot be understood in one moment. However, if we take into account the large number of laws, we would understand that many things have changed in Albania and, in my opinion, they have changed for ever. Nevertheless, the Albanian Government and parliament will have a greater obligation in the next two years, precisely in the direction of changing the economic, state, and judicial structures in Albania, because there are still many things to be done. [Unidentified correspondent] What didn't you manage to accomplish in these two years as you would have liked to? [Meksi] We would have liked public investments to have been more numerous and larger, but the difficulties of these two years and the need for a social character in the whole economic reform, as well as the need to support unemployment and the less economically rich strata, left fewer funds for foreign investments. We hope that in the coming years, together with the support program by the G-24 countries, these investments will be greater. [Unidentified correspondent] What message would you like to address to the Albanian people today? [Meksi] First of all, the overwhelming majority of the Albanian people have courageously supported the reform in Albania. The message I would send to them on this occasion would be to thank them for the support that they have given to the government and the economic and state reforms in Albania. This message is valid for all Albanians, first to the emigrants who have helped to overcome these two difficult years; the trade unions who have developed a dialogue, objected, and proposed better solutions to the government; and the political forces who have been objective and who have wanted to improve the reform in Albania to the benefit of Albania. My thanks go to all those foreign experts who have come to Albania and have contributed to the reform; to all the associations who have helped Albania with humanitarian aid; to all states, first those of the European Community, the United States, Turkey, and other countries that, with the humanitarian aid, credits for raw materials, and assistance for the balance of payments have made it possible for Albania to overcome these difficult years of transition.
