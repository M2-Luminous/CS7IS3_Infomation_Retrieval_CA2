And all those oil producing countries, both within and without OPEC, that rely primarily on oil for income are suffering and will continue to do so if they do not devise real alternatives to oil as a source of their livelihood. Iran is no exception to the above rule and it is suffering just as hard both externally (debt and its servicing) and domestically (spiralling inflation and uncertain economic future). But there might be a difference between Iran and the majority of other oil producing countries. The Islamic Revolution and its republic have advocated efforts towards reducing dependence on oil, and finding alternative to it, from the moment of victory as the centerpiece of its economic policy. The most important alternative, and one which the government promoted whole-heartedly, has been to strengthen foreign trade and enter international markets. But the government campaign to cut reliance on oil has remained just that, and in practice no tangible results in this connection have been make. The reason for this failure is that the oil income has been too readily available. In the foreign trade, or export promotion arena, there have been some advances but the income has been too small and the gains too partial to be of any effect. The reason for the government's partial success in the foreign trade has been due to the absence of a long-run, well-researched and integrated trade policy. And there will be no real success unless the government relinquishes its short-run, inconsistent, and sometimes contradictory, policies. Oil prices have fallen and there are indications from the international economy, and its lingering recession, that this trend is not temporary, and that the low oil prices will not rise in the foreseeable future. And this is where the governments of oil producing countries, and especially Iran, come in to make the necessary adjustments and perhaps make the best of a bad situation. The Islamic Republic seems to be finally ready to institute the painful and real changes and compensate for the lost income. How can the government do that? -- compensate for the lost income. The immediate and the one that applies to all situations is to cut fat, or unnecessary expenses, reduce the size of government, or at least stop its growth, transfer over to the private sector those tasks or responsibilities it is unable to do effectively, institute administrative reforms to improve efficiency, and use the available resources more effectively, among others. As in often the case when governments lose some projected sources of income, the immediate alternative is to hike taxes, and raise the price of products and services they provide. It was disclosed by the head of Majles plan and budget commission that the government's proposed budget bill, presented to the Majles last week, is providing for a tax hike amounting to some 100 billion rials. For the Islamic Government the income from tax hike is a real alternative just as the incomes from export promotion or tourism can be. But the government should approach this matter ingeniously by trying to widen and diversify its sources of income. When it comes to taxes or their hikes as alternative source of income to oil, the government should be careful. Because it is a sensitive issue and the wrong approach to it can backfire. The existing tax collection system has often come under fire as being weak and inappropriate. The country's present tax apparatus is in need of a change to make it responsive to the needs of a changing society. Formerly the widely practiced and internationally accepted tax paying culture had no acceptance basis, and the Iranian people used to pay taxes reluctantly. That has changed, and people pay taxes willingly as a part of their social responsibility. But what people ask of the Islamic government is to collect taxes equitably and justly. There are a lot of people who believe the government does not need to raise taxes or move people to higher tax brackets. What it should and can do is improve tax collection system. The higher income as a result of improved collection system might be beyond government's belief. Otherwise arbitrary tax hikes lead to inflation, which can offset the government's increased income. In Iran a lot of people with very high incomes do not pay taxes, or if they do what they pay comes nowhere close to the real taxes they should be paying. Also, because the supply is often below demand, there is no real competitive market condition, and the general public has no choice but to buy what it needs, the producers of goods and services are not often afraid of tax hikes because they can always pass it down to the consumer by raising the prices of their products or tampering with quality. The government should devise a plan to deal with these problems. Only then can it be sure that it has the support of the public for what it is doing.
