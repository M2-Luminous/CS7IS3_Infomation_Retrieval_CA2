FR940830-0-00076 FR940830-0-00013 As previously mentioned only one commenter opposed the proposed fungibility provisions. They argued that this was an attempt to circumvent the statutory five-year planning requirements. They asserted that full fungibility is inconsistent with the Act because it violated the requirement of a schedule to prioritize work items during the Five-Year Action Plan. The full fungibility was said to remove the scheduled order of the planning process. The second perceived inconsistency was the exemption of HAs from the amendment process outlined in the Act which describes how changes to the approved plan may be made. They interpreted the Act to require HAs to wait until their submission of an annual statement, with appropriate tenant consultation and public comment, before elements of the comprehensive plan are to be changed. It was also stated that full fungibility is bad public policy. The proposed rule gives HAs absolute discretion over modernization funds upon award. They found this to be an abdication of Federal responsibility. They asserted that this approach is also problematic because modernization is a troubled program with an enormous pipeline and an inability to impact the profound repair needs in public housing. HUD was charged with the failure of the modernization program due to its poor oversight and HA's weak management practices and financial operations. Response: HUD cannot change the comprehensive grant process to a once every five years submission process. The Act requires an Annual Statement. The Five-Year Action Plan is also a statutory requirement. Fungibility is not inconsistent with the Act. The Act provides that as long as the activities and expenditures are consistent with the approved plan, the HA shall have total discretion in expending assistance for any activity or work set forth in the plan. HAs are to certify that they have provided residents of the housing affected by the planned activities the opportunity to review the Annual Statement and comment on it, and that such comments have been taken into account in formulating the Annual Statement as submitted to the Secretary. Needs Assessment Comment: One HA found the requirement to amend the Needs Assessment in order to perform work items not on that Needs Assessment to be redundant and of no value. The Needs Assessment's value was found in providing the residents and public overview information about the identified deficiencies of each site. Response: The Act requires that work items be included in a Comprehensive Plan or Annual Statement before modernization funds may be spent on the work items, except in the case of emergencies. The Act also provides that work items may not appear in the Annual Statement or Five-Year Action Plan unless the need for the work has been identified in the Physical or Management Needs Assessments. Therefore, this comment was not accepted because the Needs Assessments have to be amended to include new needs. Six-Year Revision of Comprehensive Plan Comment: HAs and CLPHA objected to the requirement for submission of a totally new Comprehensive Plan in the sixth year of a HA's participation in the CGP, but suggested allowing HAs to keep updating the Five-Year Action Plan's rolling base so that it would continue indefinitely. Another comment was that the requirement for a development-by-development analysis of whether the improvements will (a) reasonably ensure the long-term viability of the development at a reasonable cost or (b) is necessary to maintain habitability until residents can be relocated does not accomplish any purpose. Another commenter suggested that HUD's inclusion of ``essential non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability'' is good but requires further clarification (such as including routine maintenance costs that are excessively high as a direct result of the units' need for comprehensive modernization work). Response: HUD has retained the requirement for the submission of an updated Comprehensive Plan every sixth year. However, the submission requirements have been reduced by eliminating two components of the Executive Summary, which are the strategy statement and the statement regarding the HA's plans for developments funded for comprehensive modernization under CIAP. Therefore, the additional documents which must be submitted in the sixth year are: Summary of total preliminary estimated costs; description of the resident participation process and summary of general issues; and revised and updated Physical and Management Needs Assessments. The Five-Year Action Plan, which is also part of the Comprehensive Plan, must be submitted in any case. While HAs may elect to update annually the Physical and Management Needs Assessments by eliminating work already funded and adding newly identified work, there is no requirement for HAs to submit these updates to HUD. HAs are only required to submit updated Needs Assessments to HUD if they wish to undertake work which was not previously identified on the Needs Assessments. HUD feels that a completely updated Comprehensive Plan every sixth year will provide valuable information to both HUD and the public on how well the CGP is meeting HA needs, as well as the types and dollar estimates of unmet needs.
