He said Tajikistan would plunge into a new war as soon as Russian troops were gone. On the plight of the Russian community there, Kondratyev said there was no possibility of evacuating them to Russia at the moment because of the country's economic hardships. The general said that Russian peacekeepers were used as a stopgap in areas of conflict or wars which might spill over to Russian territory if no measures were taken in time. He also spoke of Russia's geopolitical interests saying that an estimated 25 million Russians living in other republics of the former Soviet Union needed protection.
