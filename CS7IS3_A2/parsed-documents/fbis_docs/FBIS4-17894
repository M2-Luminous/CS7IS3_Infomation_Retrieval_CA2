Karasin pointed out that for the first time in South Africa's history its people cast their ballots for a non-racial parliament. According to Karasin, Russia, which made a considerable contribution to dismantling the apartheid regime, believes in a new South Africa's future. U.N.-sponsored Russian observers in South Africa and a number of official observers from Russia are another sign of this, the diplomat said. At the same time, Karasin pointed out that in South Africa there remained forces which did not hope to win electors' sympathy in a fair struggle under equal conditions and vainly tried to stop the historical process and torpedo the elections. "This is how the explosion of a car in Johannesburg near the building where the ANC headquarters and affiliates of a number of other political parties are situated should be understood," Karasin pointed out.
