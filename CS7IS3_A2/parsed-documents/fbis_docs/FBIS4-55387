The greatest shortcoming of the law was that it did not respect the need for the court protection of citizens who were unjustly accused of having collaborated with the former Communist secret police (StB), Ftacnik said. "International institutions also blamed us because the law does not set down the possibility of court protection," he said. Many of the people who received a positive lustration certificate appealed to the court and were vindicated, he added. The lustration or screening law, which was passed by the now-defunct Czechoslovak federal parliament in 1991 and assumed by its two successor states -- the Czech and Slovak republics after Czechoslovakia's division in 1993, bars former Communist Party officials, StB agents and collaborators, and People's Militia members from high economic and political posts until 1996. The problem of lustration in Slovakia became urgent after information leaked out to the public that one of the ministers in the current Slovak cabinet of Premier Jozef Moravcik had failed the screening process. According to the Slovak press, Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi who was nominated to the cabinet by the SDL may be having problems with the screening. Magvasi, however, in an interview with CTK denied his alleged cooperation with StB. The former Slovak Government of Vladimir Meciar requested the Slovak Constitutional Court in the middle of January to start investigations into allegedly major discrepancies between the screening law and the Slovak Constitution. The Constitutional Court, however, rejected the request on May 10, arguing that it declined to deal with the proposal of government which had subsequently fallen, since the court had already made a decision on the matter once. The lustration law in Slovakia remains valid, although no official body has been empowered with issuing lustration certificates. Under the regulation of Meciar's cabinet the Slovak Information Service (SIS) has thus far been dealing with the issue, however the regulations became invalid nine months after the division of the federation. A law should have been then passed to establish a body for carrying out lustration but such a law had not been passed. Therefore there is no body to implement the screening of Moravcik's government members as Moravcik had asked shortly after the new government was appointed. The coalition parties are considering amending the law on the SIS to empower it to issue lustration certificates. Ftacnik told CTK that the Coalition Council did not reach any decision on the issue at its meeting today. He said that Meciar's government had a bill ready last September which would have also specified the body responsible for lustration. "The bill was then withdrawn but for which reasons -- that is not a question for me," he said.
