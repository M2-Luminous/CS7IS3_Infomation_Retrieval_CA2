A meeting between Viktor Chernomyrdin and the leaders of the trade union is planned for the next few days. Understanding how difficult the situation is, the chairman of the government appeals to the heads and workforces of oblast radio and TV relay centers to continue work in accordance with the radio and TV broadcasting schedules. Nevertheless, we continue receiving reports from the regions on TV and radio broadcasting being cut. In Murmansk, Kandalaksha, Zapolyarnyy, and Kirovsk only Russian Television programs will be broadcast. On the instruction of the head of the Tomsk Radio and TV Center, broadcasting of the All-Russian TV and Radio Company has been halted and only news bulletins go on the air. The situation in Buryatia is similar. More than one-third of Russia's transmitters are not operating at all or are operating only partially. Such major TV and radio centers like the Chita, Novosibirsk, Yuzhnosakhalinsk, and Kamchatka ones are not operating at all. Volgograd's communication workers have reported that only because of severe frost has broadcasting not been switched there.
