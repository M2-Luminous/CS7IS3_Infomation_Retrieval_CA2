This was because of advice from U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale. According to a number of senior U.S. officials, Mondale, through his contacts with U.S. Government officials visiting Japan, and correspondences by telephone or telegram, has persistently stressed that "we must make the Japan- U.S. summit meeting in February a success in consideration of the difficulties facing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa." The former vice president's judgment about the situation may have reminded the Clinton administration, however briefly, of the story of "The North Wind and the Sun" in Aesop's fables. The Clinton administration's demands on Japan have become much more acceptable to Japan, compared to its previous position, since mid-December. Comments on the issue of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks can be taken as a softening of the U.S. position, including the suggestion that "we will not seek market share targets," and the remark "we would like to reach agreement only on guiding Japan to open its market to a degree comparable to other advanced nations." Even in the area of macroeconomic policy, the United States has refrained from making concrete demands, claiming "we are not in a position to talk about the precise scale and schedule of the income tax cut in Japan." And on the matter of the yen exchange rate, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen went beyond an acceptance of the present exchange rate to make remarks which could be taken to mean a toleration of a further depreciation of the yen against the dollar. This change came after Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman visited Japan in mid-December. Senior U.S. Government officials not only exchanged views with Japanese officials, but were also briefed by Mondale on the economic and political situation in Japan, and given the advice that "it will not do to be on the offensive all the time." In other words, "the sun will be more effective than the north wind in making Japan, which is wrapped in warm clothing, disrobe, or open its markets and expand domestic demand." Since then, the U.S. Government has not publicly made any unreasonable demands regarding Japanese economic stimulation measures, and has temporarily toned down its unacceptable demands at the framework talks. Admittedly, U.S. officials in charge of the talks are also anxious because "our performance will be assessed on the outcome of the framework talks." The Clinton administration has made "three consecutive hits" in trade policy with the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (APEC), and the GATT multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round). U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor is eager to "make a `cycle hit' [a Japanese-coined baseball term referring to the same player making a single-base hit, a two-base hit, a three-base hit, and a home run in one single game] by concluding the framework talks successfully." However, it will reflect poorly on the officials concerned if there is no agreement reached in February. It now remains to be seen how the Japanese Government will take advantage of the realistic line adopted by the United States, which has been the combined result of the advice from the former U.S. vice president and the desire of U.S. officials to put on a good performance.
