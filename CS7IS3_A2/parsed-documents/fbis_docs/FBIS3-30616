The disputed legitimacy of the DPS in Bulgarian political life and the fresh memories of the "revival process," ensured an internal unity and discipline within the DPS of which all other parties were envious. In addition the DPS succeeded in implementing all its demands regarding the Bulgarian Muslims' rights and freedoms. However, it is impossible to live only by acquiring the right to learn the mother language and the freedom to pray. It was precisely the DPS supporters, especially those in the southern parts of the country, who were most affected by the shock therapy and the economic crisis. Consequently the stream of tourists with a one-way ticket to Turkey has not stopped. It was Ahmed Dogan himself who inflicted the heaviest blow on the DPS. The media created the aura of him as the best Bulgarian politician, while his supporters elevated him to the rank of a prophet. However, with his behavior, which resembles that of an eastern sultan, and with his unclear sources of income he provided his impoverished electorate with sufficient reasons for dissatisfaction. In addition, his authoritarian style of leadership and almost conspiratorial political contacts created a conflict within the DPS leadership. Thus Ahmed Dogan gradually became one of the numerous false prophets in Bulgarian political life. According to both the Bible and the Koran such prophets have an unenviable fate. However, perhaps the "Dogan case" really is a part of a greater game?
