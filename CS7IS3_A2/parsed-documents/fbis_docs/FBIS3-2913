The Entire Army Should Strive To Accommodate the New Situation Characterized by Ever-Deepening Reform Jiang Zemin said: This year is crucial for promoting reform, opening up, and modernization. Keeping in mind the need to build a socialist market economic system, we will combine breakthroughs in key areas with package reform and strive for substantial progress in reforming the economic structure. The introduction and implementation of major reform measures set forth by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee -- including those aimed at reforming the financial, taxation, banking, investment, planning, and foreign trade systems, as well as those designed to establish a modern enterprise system -- is a "decisive battle" in our process of reform and opening up. Our victory in this battle and our establishment of a basic framework for the socialist market economic structure will effectively guarantee sustained, rapid, and healthy development in our national economy and will facilitate the conduct of many affairs. Jiang Zemin noted: Nationwide, the situation is very good. The ever-deepening reform, however, dictates a readjustment of certain economic relations and some interests, resulting in quite a few new contradictions and problems. We must have a secure and stable social and political environment in which we can deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and promote development. Our Army comrades must be fully aware of their historical responsibilities and strive to strengthen all aspects of Army building so as to better carry out their sacred mission of safeguarding the motherland's security and unity and of defending the socialist modernization drive. He said: Over the past few years, the entire Army has withstood the test in the course of reform and opening up and has always maintained a high degree of unified centralism and a high level of agreement with the party Central Committee. The establishment of a socialist market economic structure is a profound socialist transformation, and new circumstances and new problems will surface incessantly. Ideological problems of various types will inevitably arise among cadres and fighters. We should pay attention to improving ideological work among troops, ensuring that such work will be carried out in a meticulous, down-to-earth, lively, and deep-going manner. We should address and solve various ideological and conceptual problems among troops in accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and with the party's principles and policies. We should provide guidance to everybody concerning the need to consider the fundamental interests of the party and the state; to stress ideals, discipline, unity, and overall interests; to conscientiously subordinate personal interests to general interests; and to consistently maintain the party's basic line so as to make continuing contributions to promoting the country's reform, development, and stability. All Officers and Men Should Be Further Motivated To Carry Out Their Work Jiang Zemin said: Reform, opening up, and modernization are a grand and arduous undertaking which requires an uplifting of the entire national spirit and the mobilization of positive factors in all parts of the country. As the Army goes, it means we should bring into full play the initiative and creativeness of all officers and men so that they will render more meritorious services in Army modernization and make more contributions to the country's prosperity, strength, and long-term stability. The most fundamental task at present is to improve education on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas for Army building during the new period, on the party's basic line, and on the Army's functions and patriotism, so as to further whip up the enthusiasm of officers and men for dedicating themselves to national defense and Army building. We should make our ideological and political education more appealing, relevant, and effective. We should educate officers and men about the need to firmly adopt a correct outlook on life and correct values, always stress the interests of the party and the state, foster lofty ideals, not to seek fame and wealth, work hard, make positive contributions, and devote themselves to Army building and reform. Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: Leading cadres' efforts to forge close ties with the masses, to exercise strict self-discipline, to set a good example, and to foster a good image are very important for harnessing the enthusiasm of all sectors. If officers of a unit identify themselves with rank-and-file soldiers and follow the mass line in everything they do, the unit will have unity, healthy work style, and fighting capacity. Leaders at all levels in the Army should carry forward the fine tradition of forging close ties with the masses, uphold the principle of unity between higher and lower levels and officers and men, truly bear in mind the interests of the masses, and go down to the grass roots to perform concrete work and listen to opinions of the masses, thereby drawing on their wisdom and experiences to further improve the work. Jiang Zemin also stressed the need to care about the life of officers and men. He said: In recent years, the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission [CMC], as well as organizations at all levels, have adopted numerous measures to improve military personnel's living standards. Nevertheless, quite a few practical problems do exist in some grass- roots units, especially in units stationed at hardship posts. The CMC and the Army's headquarters have attached great importance to and adopted a number of measures to solve the problems. Organizations at all levels should also explore ways for improving military personnel's living standards, especially through encouraging Army units to engage in agricultural and sideline production. In improving military personnel's material and cultural life, we should allow rank-and-file soldiers at grass roots to take precedence over officers of leading organs. We should first improve the life of soldiers at grass roots and then officers of leading organs. This should be a standard requirement and customary practice, and should be passed on to the future generations. Continually Raise the Army's Level of Building Spiritual Civilization to a New Height Jiang Zemin said: Promoting socialist spiritual civilization while striving to build socialist material civilization is Comrade Xiaoping's consistent thought, as well as the party's important guideline for the modernization drive. We should unswervingly implement this principle at all times. Reform, opening up, and the development of a socialist market economy have exerted a positive influence on the people's ideology and morality. This is primary. However, we should never ignore the negative influence. The deeper the reform goes, the wider the country is open to the outside world, and the further our material civilization develops, the more necessary it is for us to promote the building of spiritual civilization. The PLA should be the vanguard of society in building spiritual civilization. As far as this issue is concerned, the Army has scored remarkable achievements and has presented a large number of advanced models in theoretical study, ideological and moral construction, and work related to science, culture, education, literature, and art. For example, Xu Honggang, who risked his life to save people in difficulty and who showed no fear in the hour of danger, epitomizes the mental outlook of a people's soldier and the fine tradition of the party and the Army. His heroic deeds have aroused strong repercussions throughout the Army and society. They show that our society can produce and needs heroes like Xu Honggang. If each and every member of society can behave like him, the general conduct of society will keep improving and the cohesive power of our nation and society will become stronger and stronger. We must further deepen the campaigns to emulate Lei Feng, Su Ning, Xu Honggang, and other heroes and models to develop revolutionary spirit, foster healthy social mores, and promote the building of socialist spiritual civilization. Jiang Zemin stressed: To improve spiritual civilization in the Army, the most important thing to do is to improve officers and men ideologically and morally. In view of the new circumstances and new problems that have arisen among officers and men with regard to their outlook on life, values, and moral concepts in the new situation, we should conduct various forms of education to guide cadres and officers about the need to always bear in mind our Army's goal of serving the people wholeheartedly; to strengthen their ideals and convictions in building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to promote the "five types of revolutionary spirit" initiated by Comrade Xiaoping; to measure their speeches and actions against such ideological and moral standards as self- sacrifice, selflessness, the practice of placing others' interests above one's own, and hard work; to conscientiously resist the influence of mammonism, ultra-egoism, and decadent ways of life so as to become practitioners and preachers of new socialist morals and customs. We Should Always Pay Attention to Army Building at the Grass-Roots Level Jiang Zemin said: In recent years, the entire Army has conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the CMC's directives and made great efforts to strengthen Army building at the grass- roots level, achieving great success in this respect. The Army's basic work begins with the grass-roots level. Leading organs at all levels should further rectify the guiding ideology of their work, always take the grass-roots level as the point of departure and basis for their work, and make unremitting efforts to strengthen the Army's foundations. Toward the end of last year, the CMC promulgated anew the "Program for Army Building at the Grass-Roots Level." This was a major step taken by the CMC to implement Comrade Xiaoping's ideas for Army building during the new period and to strengthen all aspects of Army building at the grass-roots level. All units must implement the program effectively to promote overall progress in Army building at the grass-roots level. We should take the buildup of party branches as a crucial aspect of the effort to strengthen Army building at the grass-roots level. The Army has rich and excellent traditions of strengthening party building at the grass-roots level, and it is relatively well-organized; therefore, it should be able to achieve even better results in the new situation. Jiang Zemin said emphatically: The Army is a highly centralized and unified armed group, which must be trained and managed strictly. An environment of long-term peace, coupled with the Army's ever-changing membership, can easily lead to lax management. This underscores an even greater need for setting strict demands for troops and for managing and training troops in accordance with relevant regulations so as to ensure the strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. Strict administration, however, does not amount to doing things in an oversimplified and crude manner. Our Army has the fine tradition of promoting unity among officers and men, which reflects the Army's character and goal; we should closely follow and widely promote this tradition in the new situation. Authorities at all levels should explore the distinctive features and patterns of commanding troops in the new period so as to constantly improve the level of troop management. In closing, Jiang Zemin said: We should further improve unity between the Army and the government and between the Army and the people. Chairman Mao once said: "If the Army and the people are united as one, who in the world can match them?" We have always done a good job in this respect. In the new situation, we should all the more consolidate and expand the Army's relations with the government and the people. Local governments at all levels should show concern and support for national defense and Army building. The Army should support the government, cherish the people, and take an active part in and assist national economic construction. Troops stationed in impoverished regions, in particular, should do their utmost to help the poor and make positive contributions to national development and people's prosperity.
