One wishes that the president would utter these words before the chiefs of his own press service. The work of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA [NG] correspondents has been constantly impeded throughout the recent year at all events participated in by the president. In plain terms, they are simply denied accreditation at these events; this was also the case when the president addressed parliament. The boilerplate explanation is -- no room. In the meantime, room is always there for the press service's pet editions. While Kostikov's and Krasikov's business is to choose their own pets, NG is not pushing to be among them. But that this policy is discriminatory toward NG is obvious to us. Many of our journalists had been told without mincing words -- quit NEZAVISIMAYA, and you'll get your accreditation. Kostikov, as everybody could hear during the president's recent press conference in the Kremlin, was not too fastidious in advising the NG correspondent loud and clear and in public to leave the newspaper. One would have thought he had specially prepared this ad lib in advance for the presidential press conference, putting aside all other affairs. For us, these are usual difficulties we could and would be able to overcome. In particular, NG was the only Russian newspaper to have given in its 22 February issue a precise account of the main points of the presidential message. The behavior of the president's press service has not only transcended the bounds of human decency, but also seriously violates the professional rights of NG journalists granted us, not by Kostikov and Krasikov, but by the law for which NG was fighting when neither were at the president's side. We are going to uphold these rights. For the time being, by making public the facts we know. Further on, perhaps, also in the Arbitration Information Court instituted by the Russian Federation president. But it hardly pays once again to play, via publications close to the court, the NG-small-circulation card. Or else we are going to make public the real circulations of all favorite dailies and weeklies of the press service.
