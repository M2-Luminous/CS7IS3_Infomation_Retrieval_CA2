However, relations between the Bandwagon [League nickname] and Forza Italia have become somewhat tense by now, so Maroni, replied to the Knight's [Berlusconi nickname] proposal by suggesting instead "a government made up by the League, Forza Italia, CCD [Christian Democratic Center], and UCD [Center Union], and with external support, not only, however, from AN but from anyone else." [LA REPUBBLICA] But in this way you are voiding Berlusconi's proposal. [Maroni] The important thing is that Berlusconi said that AN will not form part of the government. [LA REPUBBLICA] In short, you do not want [AN leader] Fini. [Maroni] As [Northern League Secretary] Bossi says, maybe the mountains will also move, but, I repeat -- and this is no news -- there will be no government with the fascists. [LA REPUBBLICA] Berlusconi insists on opening a door to Fini. [Maroni] We could perhaps make use of those political personalities who are elected under Forza Italia and AN's common symbol, but who are nevertheless independent. [LA REPUBBLICA] They would not be enough to form a government. [Maroni] AN has not subscribed to a political agreement or to a platform. We, Forza Italia, CCD, UCD, the Radicals, and the Pact's former supporters, have done so, and this constitutes the future government's platform. Forza Italia and AN only add up to votes, as Berlusconi himself says. [LA REPUBBLICA] To set up that sort of government you would require an absolute majority without AN. [Maroni] Why place limits to Providence? [LA REPUBBLICA] If, as is more probable, you do not obtain that majority, Fini's votes will be decisive. [Maroni] We will form a minority government. [LA REPUBBLICA] What if Berlusconi insists? [Maroni] How could he govern without the League's votes? Presumably, with Fini and the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], given that [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli will not have a seat. [LA REPUBBLICA] With a minority government... [Maroni] Yes. Consider the Ciampi government. It did not have a majority but, in our opinion and in that of many others, it governed well. Consider the Varese and Monza town councils, with League mayors but no organized majorities. They are doing very well. Otherwise, new elections would have to be held all the time. [LA REPUBBLICA] No alternatives? [Maroni] There is also another possible government solution, which has been proposed to me by a PDS member in the last few days: that of an institutional government. [LA REPUBBLICA] Who made this proposal? [Maroni] I cannot tell you, but it is someone I hold in high esteem. An institutional government would have to include everybody, from Communist Renewal to AN, and it would have to be based on a very precisely defined platform, limited to a few points only: electoral reform, institutional reform; this would be followed by elections.
