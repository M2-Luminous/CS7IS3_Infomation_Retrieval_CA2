One of the first results of that crisis, according to reports circulating in Beirut's political and information circles, is that al-Hariri is staying away and refraining from carrying out his official duties. It has been learned that the prime minister cancelled a television interview which was scheduled to be broadcast on the official television network yesterday evening, without giving any reasons. Al-Hirawi had, on his latest visit to Damascus, sought the opinion of the Syrian authorities regarding the reshuffle issue. It seems that Damascus does not favor a complete change of government but has no objection to a limited reshuffle in the interest of more effective government work to fulfill current requirements at home and abroad. It has been claimed that the differences between the Lebanese state leaders concern individuals as well as portfolios and that what is needed is not just replacement of the some of the current ministers with new ones but also a change of the portfolios of some of the current ministers while at the same time keeping them in the cabinet. Some sources hinted that each of the three leaders wants to improve his position in the government and increase his share in it by having people close to him or considered loyal to him in the cabinet. One of the declared aims and reasons for the partial and limited reshuffle is to restore the Christians' confidence in the government by broadening representation and participation in the government through inclusion of individuals so far considered to be members of the opposition. The parties tipped to join the government include the Phalangist Party led by George Sa'adah and the National Bloc Party led by Raymond Iddih. It has been learned that the first does not object but the second has reservations and might refuse to have one of its members in the cabinet.
