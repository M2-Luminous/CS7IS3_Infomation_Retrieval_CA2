In a note distributed to mayors and governors, President Frei warns that "administrative integrity implies putting public interests above personal ones." It adds: "Corruption implies taking advantage of a situation for personal benefit." The note exhorts officials to look after public property and resources by making good use of them, to have a social life in accordance with the dignity of their positions, to avoid intervening in a situation in which personal interests are involved, and not to engage in influence peddling or handle privileged information and to prevent others from doing it. Tax collectors are warned that they should not solicit, commit others to grant them, or accept donations, advantages, or any other sort of privilege. They must promptly report to the courts crimes they are aware of, as well as report all irregularities to the appropriate authorities. They are also requested to strictly control the use of fiscal revenues. The note also reminds public employees that the administration is subjected to multiple controls, therefore they should not hinder or delay this control. Another part of the note adds that no fees should be charged for tasks performed by government members unless legal provisions establish otherwise. The president of the Republic also requests that public administration employees comply with the objectives of each government institution and that, on their own initiative, employees seek to better fulfill their obligations and place the public administration at the service of citizens. Another provision is that civil servants meet community requests, charges, or complaints that are respectfully and appropriately presented. The public tasks must be fulfilled in thorough compliance with the terms of the Constitution, the laws, and established norms. They also are required to be diligent, not to create false expectations about the extent of government actions, to be efficient, to simplify red tape, to make use of the available means, and not to overwhelm society with excessive rules. Obsolete or useless norms must be expressly eliminated, and the language used in guidelines and norms must be simple and understandable to all. They are told to exercise authority in a reasonable and not arbitrary manner, to do it in a respectful and diligent way, and to ensure that their action goes beyond the interests of individuals or groups. The president of the Republic points out in the note: "Our rule of law guarantees absolute equality before the law. Therefore, I will not allow people, groups, interests, or authorities to be favored. "I demand that you appoint people who have full knowledge of matters in his area in positions of direct service to the population. I want them to carry out their duties with dedication and courtesy. Everyone has the right to be treated well. I want special respect for the poor, the handicapped, and elderly people. I want clarity. I want the people to see what you are doing. Do not deny access to the information or reviews of administrative documents. I want people who respect our population's different cultures, who can make sound decisions, who can resolve problems by listening to those affected. I want people who will adopt all necessary measures to guarantee security, good service, and the protection of users' rights. I want the areas where people wait or where they are heard to be accessible and dignified. Users should receive all the information necessary concerning administrative proceedings so they clearly know where to go, which documents to take with them, and when they will be served.
