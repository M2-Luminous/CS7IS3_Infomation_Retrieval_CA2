The fact that the latter are still observing neutrality and are restraining themselves from active operations on a large scale is, in the opinion of Colonel-General B. Pyankov, the commander of Coalition Peacekeeping Forces in this hot spot, one of the chief results of the three months' stay of troops under his command on Tajik soil. [Kushko] Boris Yevgenyevich, what made formation of the Coalition Peacekeeping Forces (KMS) necessary? [Pyankov] To answer this question I need to first carefully explain the situation in which Tajikistan found itself with the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Having divided political power, the army and the plants with ease, the former Soviet republics were unable to divide up their joint security just as easily. This was chiefly true of Tajikistan, where internal conflicts transformed into civil war, and threatened assumption of a regional nature and spread to the borders of Russia itself. External aggression also promoted development of the conflict. All of this required CIS countries to take adequate steps to provide assistance to our neighbor in misfortune. A decision to establish coalition peacekeeping forces consisting of armed forces from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan was made in September 1993 at a meeting of the leaders of the Commonwealth in Moscow. The Treaty on Collective Security signed a year and a half ago in Tashkent by six CIS states was the basis for the decision. Ideally, United Nations "blue helmets" should have taken on the role of peacekeepers, but today the potential of this organization is behind its growing peacekeeping responsibilities. [Kushko] Sending peacekeeping forces into Tajikistan generated a number of apprehensions. The Russians wonder if their country is going to be drawn into a new Afghan history. Citizens of other countries wonder if Russia is continuing to demonstrate its imperial ambitions. [Pyankov] We have a clear position in the Tajik conflict--we are not interfering in any political scrapes, which differs favorably from the position of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, where support was rendered to one of the dueling sides. Our main objective is to provide assistance in protecting and defending the borders. That's precisely where over 20 percent of the personnel of the peacekeeping forces are. Our other functions include analyzing the military and political situation in the region, protecting humanitarian aid columns, and participating in the negotiation process with the goal of stabilizing the situation. But in no way are we providing any military assistance to local groupings. As far as assertions of Russia's so-called imperial ambitions are concerned, such a statement of the question is wrong. The fact that I am a citizen of Russia doesn't mean my unconditional subordination only to Russian leadership. I bear equal responsibility before the heads of state and defense ministers of five countries. At the same time Russia doubtlessly has its own interests here as well. It cannot but be troubled by the position of the Russian-speaking population. Around 200,000 Russian-speaking citizens still live in Tajikistan. As we know, in May of last year one of the leaders of the opposition already attempted to declare them to be hostages. [Kushko] What might the effect be of giving the Coalition Peacekeeping Forces the status of "blue helmets" of the United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe? [Pyankov] It seems to me that implementing such a proposal would encourage the participants of the Tajik conflict to begin negotiations. Moreover it would mean international support to our actions. In this case we have no opposition at all to international inspections or to participation of foreign military contingents in our actions in Tajikistan. Unfortunately our proposal regarding this matter was not supported at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. [Kushko] To what extent is reliance being placed on weapons in the actions of the peacekeeping forces, and to what extent on political methods? [Pyankov] Actions of the Tajik opposition in preparing for new combat operations are evoking countermeasures from our side. We are reinforcing the borders, we are undergoing planned combat training, and we are undertaking various sorts of preventive actions. The KMS have up to 25,000 personnel, up to 2,000 tanks, 350 infantry fighting vehicles, 350 artillery guns, and aviation and helicopters. These forces are capable to opposing any enemy. But we are not in any way placing our reliance solely on methods of force. [Kushko] To what extent are countries that signed the agreement on the KMS fulfilling their obligations? [Pyankov] Only Tajikistan and Russia have fulfilled their obligations completely regarding allocation of the needed quantity of men and equipment. Russia is having to carry the main burden--up to 50 percent of all of the expenses. Russia placed the 201st Motorized Rifle Division at the disposal of the KMS as its "initial membership dues." A separate motorized-rifle battalion was allocated from Uzbek armed forces. Operational use of one of the subunits of the Kyrgyz contingent is difficult because it is based on its own territory. The Kazakh contingent still hasn't arrived. Nor have promised resources for the maintenance of the joint command of the KMS arrived from Kazakhstan. However, my hope is that the leadership of Kazakhstan will fulfill adopted obligations in the immediate future. [Kushko] Boris Yevgenyevich, how do you think the situation will develop in Tajikistan in the immediate and remote future? [Pyankov] The situation remains complex, despite the apparent lull. There are three main forces capable of destabilizing it. First, the government in exile, operating from the Afghan city of Talukan [transliteration]. It is openly preparing armed detachments to fight the present leadership of Tajikistan. The Talukan exiles, who have not received recognition from a single state or support from their own people, may undertake harsh steps. The second force is the democratic opposition, which is presently working underground in Tajikistan. It has the support of the inhabitants of a number of regions, and it has contacts with the Tajik opposition in Moscow. If the detachments of the former People's Front that do not have a clear political orientation go over to its side, its importance will increase significantly. I consider the armed detachments in the Pamirs and the several large detachments operating in the mountains in the vicinity of Garm to be the third force. All of them may become active in spring in their struggle for power, which can seriously worsen the situation. A more favorable scenario for the development of events is also fully possible. Assuming presence of goodwill and a readiness of dialogue among all participants of the Tajik conflict, the situation may stabilize to such an extent here by the end of 1994 that we would be able to begin reducing the KMS contingent.
