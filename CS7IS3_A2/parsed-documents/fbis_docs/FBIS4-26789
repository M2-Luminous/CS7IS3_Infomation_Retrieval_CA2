This is a pragmatic approach. Ma Yuzhen told reporters yesterday that the Chinese Government has taken account of Hong Kong's interests in adopting this pragmatic attitude on current Sino-British relations. Both the Chinese and British sides clearly understand that it is impossible to hold talks again on Hong Kong's constitutional reform, Ma Yuzhen pointed out; but both sides are aware that there is still a need to cooperate on issues other than Hong Kong's constitutional reform, he added. He cited as an example that Hong Kong's economy and its people's lives must not be ignored because the talks on Hong Kong's constitutional reform have failed. In addition, China and Britain must cooperate in international affairs and in their economic and trade relations. British Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad will visit Beijing in July. This indicates both sides' wish for cooperation. On the prospects for Sino-British trade, which has received attention in all circles, Ma Yuzhen said that the Chinese Government welcomes British businessmen's investments in China and hopes that British businessmen will have opportunities.
