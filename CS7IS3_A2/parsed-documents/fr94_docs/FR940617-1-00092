Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. Interested persons may, on or before December 14, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch, written comments, objections, or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. A request for an oral hearing must specify points to be covered and time requested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted on or before December 14, 1994. Three copies of all comments, objections, and requests are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Comments, objections, and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced in the Federal Register . Interested persons, on or before June 19, 1995, may also submit in writing new data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of those conditions not classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submitted on or before August 17, 1995. These dates are consistent with the time periods specified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural regulations for reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the Federal Register of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730). Three copies of all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Data and comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch. Received data and comments may also be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consider only data submitted prior to the closing of the administrative record on August 17, 1995. Data submitted after the closing of the administrative record will be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is published in the Federal Register , unless the Commissioner finds good cause has been shown that warrants earlier consideration. Therefore, the agency is proposing to amend 21 CFR part 333 by adding new subpart E, consisting of §§333.401 through 333.470, and to amend 21 CFR part 369 by amending §369.21 in order to establish conditions under which OTC health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded.
