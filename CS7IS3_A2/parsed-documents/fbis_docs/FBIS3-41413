The conference was attended by people from 40 countries, including Ukraine. The Ukrainian delegation was headed by Militia Colonel General Valentyn Nedryhaylo, first deputy interior minister. There is good reason for the attention paid by the EC to the problem of narcotics. Today, drug lords are acting on a large scale, expanding their spheres of influence and trapping thousands of new victims in their nets. According to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, the number of drug addicts in Ukraine has reached 400,000. They consume five tonnes of deadly substances every day, spending almost 80 billion karbovantsi. In light of the fact that the "traditional" routes of shipping drugs stretch close to our territory, members of the Italian and Colombian drug Mafia have already held consultations about using these channels for selling their products. The documents adopted, and concrete measures outlined by the conference will facilitate the launching of an attack against the drug Mafia in the very near future. However, the efforts of law enforcement bodies alone are not sufficient. That is why the participants in the forum passed a decision to support all public organizations in the fight against the use and trafficking of drugs.
