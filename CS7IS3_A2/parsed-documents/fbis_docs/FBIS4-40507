Our task, he pointed out, is to establish business and emotional contacts. However, we have prospects only on condition that we work in a single constitutional field, said Oleksandr Moroz. According to the Ukrainian Supreme Council speaker, the aggravation of the situation in Crimea was caused not only by the local authorities' actions, but also by the mistakes made by the Kiev authorities. Touching on the Black Sea Fleet issue, Oleksandr Moroz pointed out that this is a zone of special interest of Ukraine and Russia. In the opinion of Oleksandr Moroz, the Black Sea Fleet should be used jointly by both countries and it should have a joint command. However, the Supreme Council chairman pointed out, Ukraine and Russia should maintain and be in charge of their own parts of the fleet. Oleksandr Moroz held a news conference for journalists during which he, in particular, spoke out against the federal system in Ukraine, saying that the time has not yet come for this.
