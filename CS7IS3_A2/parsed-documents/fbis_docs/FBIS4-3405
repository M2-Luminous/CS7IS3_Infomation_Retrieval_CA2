In a speech at the rally, Liu Huangfa, chairman of the New Territories Township Council, said: With only three or more years left before China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the customs and habits and traditional rights and interests of the original inhabitants of New Territories are being brutally trampled upon. What is worse is that the British Hong Kong authorities, intending to break the promise made when they leased New Territories, have suddenly rendered support to some council members' motion to amend the draft of the "New Territories Land (Exemption) Regulations." He said: "We are justified to believe that quarters concerned are carrying out a major scheme aimed at destroying the traditions of the New Territories, depriving the original inhabitants of their rights and interests, and dividing up the people of Hong Kong." Chairmen of the seven township councils in the northeastern district, as well as many villagers, including women, and former inhabitants of the New Territories who have taken up residence abroad, spoke at the rally, supporting the New Territories Township Council's action to protect the original inhabitants' lawful rights and interests. A female college student denounced some Legislative Council members for making statements that smear the image of original female inhabitants of the New Territories. According to her, the majority of the original female inhabitants, who do not care much about the family assets of their father's generation, hold a harmonious and ethical society more important than material interests. After the rally, villagers proceeded to Fengji Township to pay tribute to martyrs who died while resisting British troops 96 years ago. In 1898 when British colonialists wanted to forcibly lease New Territories after occupying Hong Kong, more than 100,000 people of the 423 New Territories villages staged valiant resistance and many died heroically. In April 1899 when British troops took over the New Territories, the masses bombarded British barracks and were brutally suppressed. Some 200 villagers sacrificed their lives.
