It discussed the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power stations. Leaders from Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, the State Atomic Inspectorate, Ukraine's State Atomic Committee, directors of nuclear power stations, and enterprises of the nuclear industry took part in the commission's work. Having noted the positive tendencies in raising the safety of Ukrainian nuclear power stations, above all, the Chernobyl AES, the meeting's participants concentrated on the present problems of which there are many because of the imperfections of state tariffs. Nuclear power stations are working at a loss: The Ukrainian Ministry of Energy's national dispatching station pays the AES only 200 karbovantsi for 1 kWh, the cost price of which is 750 karbovantsi. But even at this price, the nuclear industry's debts reached two trillion karbovantsi. Because of the shortage of funds, repair and preventative inspection work is being disrupted and therefore the safe working of the AES is not guaranteed. There is a real threat that up to five generating sets each with a capacity of one million kW could be shut down. In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Mykola Pavlovskyy, chairman of the [Nuclear Policy and Safety] Commission, said that its priority task would be to prepare and adopt a law on the use of nuclear energy as soon as possible, and in the future to create an effective legislative base on the basis of which nuclear power engineering will develop.
