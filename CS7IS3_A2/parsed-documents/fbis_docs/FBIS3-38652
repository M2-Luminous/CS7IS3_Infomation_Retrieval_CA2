[Passage omitted] The Spanish position has been voiced repeatedly by Foreign Minister Javier Solana, who invokes new UN resolutions before moving on to such armed reprisals. But we have Foreign Minister Solana's latest statements made just a few minutes before he left for Brussels. Our colleague Hector Arenas has them. Good morning. [Arenas] Good morning. Spain will support airstrikes, especially on Serb positions in Bosnia, if that is decided by NATO and the United Nations, although Spain will continue to think that there is no military solution to this war but rather a political one, of prior negotiations, which will enable the ending of the terrible massacres of civilians like this weekend's and the achieving of a lasting peace. This is what can be deduced from the statements which Foreign Minister Javier Solana made a few minutes ago as he left by plane for Brussels for the meeting of EEC ministers. [Passage omitted] [Begin Solana recording] If there is an intervention of this kind, whose main aim, I stress, must be to raise the siege of Sarajevo, Spain would logically say...[pauses] maintain a position that this is what must be done; but being quite clear in all of this that there is no military solution to this war, that the solution to this terrible war is a solution of a political nature, which is the only thing which can make a lasting peace in these Balkan lands possible. Therefore any actions set in motion must have the rationale of seeking or of exerting pressure in the direction of a political solution. [end recording]
