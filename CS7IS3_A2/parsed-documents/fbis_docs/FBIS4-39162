The following report is presented by Yuriy Horban. [Horban] Leonid Kravchuk acquainted himself with the products of this enterprise, which is one of the first joint-stock societies in Ukraine, and also met the working collective and representatives of the Union of Independent Entrepreneurs. Therefore, not only the activity of a definite production unit but the entrepreneurial movement as a whole was a subject of discussion. According to certain speakers, the wild process of accumulating capital, which some of their colleagues in Ukraine have abused before now, is almost over. The prestige of the state, the firm and even trademark becomes ever more prevailing in the activities of the new structures. It was emphasized that private enterprises, like state ones, now require stability most of all, first and foremost a stability of legislation. It is not for the first time that issues of foreign economic activities, taxation and exchange rate policies and currency regulation were discussed. The unsatisfactory nature of the relevant laws scares potential investors off Ukraine and leads to a total collapse of the state's economy. The participants in the meeting emphasized their support to the economic movement on way of reforms and expressed their belief that President Kravchuk is the main guarantor of their implementation. As was pointed out, certain political forces wish to blame the reforms, the market and entrepreneurs for all the economic troubles, although they themselves torpedoed these reforms and continue to torpedo them. In his speech, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized his loyalty to the course of economic transformations and also spoke out in favor of the state sector where 90 percent of the economic capacities are concentrated today. The president of Ukraine referred to power engineering and agriculture as the industries which require most of the state's support. Leonid Kravchuk analyzed the causes of the crisis and referred to the contradiction between market laws and anti-market ones and also failure of public opinion to accept the high rate of a transition to a new system as one of the causes. The president also expressed his views concerning the current political situation. [Begin Kravchuk recording] As far as the elections are concerned, well, the Supreme Council took a decision that the elections would take place and there would be no changes. In other words, we are now entering a permanent process of elections. On 26 June, [pauses] It is clear that this will not be the end. I am not sure that all will be elected on 26 June. If the president is not elected, on 10 July there will be a repeat election. Then, in one month's time there will be elections to local bodies. On 24 July they will again fail to elect all the 112 deputies and again they will postpone the elections. That is to say, we shall enter the new year on the wave of elections. I have honestly done everything possible to prove that these elections today, even proceeding from the fact that they are necessary, are dangerous and ineffective because they have no legal basis. Nowhere in the world, [pauses] Ukraine will be a unique state which is holding elections having neither provisions in the Constitution nor the laws which would regulate the power bodies. When I tell this, they say: You are telling this just to retain your post. And the overwhelming majority of people, let us say, [passage indistinct], can believe that this is the only desire of the current president. I was telling the Supreme Council that the Supreme Council assumed huge political and historic responsibility. If no laws regulating and determining the structure of power bodies at the local level are adopted, we shall have the executive power completely ruined. I underline this: completely ruined. We shall have 25 Crimeas or even more, because today, as the president, I can rescind a decree by the president of Crimea in compliance with the Constitution, however no one, neither the president nor the government, can rescind a decision by a chairman of the oblast council.
