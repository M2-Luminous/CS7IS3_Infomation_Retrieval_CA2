Speaking to this newspaper in Bonn, [Anatolijs] Gorbunovs, the speaker of the Latvian parliament, said that regarding this issue, the Riga government is counting on "support from West Europe and the CSCE." He said that Latvia had made "substantial concessions" to Moscow to stabilize the European security system. That involves, above all, the promise that Russia would be able to use the early-warning system radar station in Skrunda for another four years. However, the Latvians fear that in the future the Russian Government will be able to ignore the pledge to withdraw from Skrunda. That is why the Latvians would like a "guarantee" from the CSCE regarding the Russian promise of a withdrawal. Appropriate signals from the West regarding the upcoming ratification of the these treaties by the Latvian parliament, the Saeima, would be important. The Latvian parliamentary speaker, who is on an official visit to Germany along with a parliamentary group at the invitation of the speaker of the German Bundestag, said that, despite Moscow's promise to withdraw 18,000 active soldiers by 31 August, there was concern about retired Russian officers who wanted to continue living in Latvia as Russian citizens. The government in Riga, which is being advised on citizenship issues by the experts from the Council of Europe, is seeking to encourage Russian citizens to agree to repatriation on a voluntary basis. A foundation has been set up to assist those who wish to be resettled. So far, Sweden and the United States have contributed $2 million to the foundation. "It would be wonderful if all the countries who congratulated us on this gesture would...also participate in the foundation," observed Gorbunovs. Schaefer, the Foreign Ministry secretary, congratulated Gorbunovs on the Russia-Latvia agreements on the withdrawal of Russian troops. They were the "expression of a policy based on readiness to reach a compromise and not on issuing maximum demands." The Latvian parliament should now seek to ratify the agreements as quickly as possible. Schaefer gave an assurance that Germany would campaign for the "rapid admission of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia to the European Union." The Federal Government hopes that with the beginning of the German EU presidency on 1 July, the free trade agreements between the European Union and the Baltic states will be concluded. During the German presidency, the "Europe treaty" should be implemented.
