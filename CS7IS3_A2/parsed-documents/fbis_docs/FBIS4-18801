Sarajevo Radio, citing statements issued by the presidential spokesman, announced that Serbs attacked Gorazde from three fronts and that there were large numbers of casualties. Western news agencies have carried stories regarding the issue based on the Sarajevo radio report. Vice President Ejup Ganic, who is currently in Istanbul, has stated that news regarding chemical weapons being used against Gorazde has reached them as well. Ganic said that accurate information regarding the situation in the city and number of casualties will only be definite during the course of the day. It is expected that Ganic will go to New York to take up the issue with the UN authorities. It was also reported that information confirming the use of chemical warfare by the Serbs against Gorazde has not reached the UN center in New York or the U.S. Administration. The Turkish Foreign Ministry has started intensive contacts to investigate the truth behind the claims that chemical weapons were used against Gorazde -- a region inside the United Nations declared safe area. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said that Turkey will submit a request calling for an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council in case the claims regarding chemical warfare are accurate. In a statement he issued to TRT last night, Cetin said that a possible NATO air operation may be discussed if the claims are correct.
