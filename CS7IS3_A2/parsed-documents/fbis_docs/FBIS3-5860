It may have been, but I'm not worrying about prestige now. As long as we can keep things going, I am willing to take the flak. There are certain costs to be paid and I'm willing to take those now. What was the levy really for? It was to fund the electric power projects we needed so we wouldn't have brown-outs. Funds were necessary not only for the power plants but also for the distribution lines. The three-week suspension was really a holding operation, not a step backwards, which we needed so we could identify alternative measures. The observation has been made that one of the country's biggest problems is political gridlock between the executive branch and Congress. Do you think that the Congress, especially the Senate, has been an obstructionist body? I'm saying that in the past 18 months, the Congress has been very productive. There are many important laws enacted and they are of high quality, and we collaborated with them on these. We have discussions with legislators once a week, and we have more regular dialogues now with the leadership of the House and the Senate, so we can chart directions more precisely. The senators tell me that one of their problems is that there are just 23 of them, and they are supposed to deal with the products of 200 congressmen, so they are swamped with work. The oil levy controversy has highlighted the budget deficit as the biggest block to economic growth. Are you confident of solving this problem? You have to look at the bigger picture. The total deficit has been going down substantially, and we'll bring it down to below 3 percent (of GNP) this year. All the economy's parameters -- interest rates, inflation, the exchange rate -- are improving. The commercial portion of the foreign debt burden has been brought down to a minimum, and better terms negotiated. The domestic debt service is still a major problem, but we are reducing that also. What is important is the direction. Are there gains in collecting the taxes due to the government? We are implementing a three-pronged approach: improving tax collection, creating a broader base of taxpayers, and undertaking reforms in the tax and tariff system itself, and in the collecting agencies. For example, we are restructuring the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Where there used to be 80 revenue districts, there are now 115. We have also removed the discretionary power of lower-ranking officers in deciding tax compromises, and this can be done now only by the bureau's top five officials. A large taxpayers unit in the BIR is now operating, which will allow them to focus their efforts on the big taxpayers. Your efforts seem to be frustrated by the courts, as in the case of your campaign against magnate Lucio Tan. The courts' involvement has also blocked major development projects. That is something out of my control, but at least efforts are being made. But we are also taking steps to solve those. We are seconding the justice department's state prosecutors, who are better paid, to the BIR or to any other department who need such lawyers. Last week, I appointed 177 new state prosecutors. The Department of Justice has filed cases against tax evaders for a claim of P [Philippine pesos] 23 billion (US$836 million). But we have due process in this country. If these tax evaders lose in the lower court, they appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court, and they have smart lawyers behind them. But we have to start the process. Early on in your administration, you said that one of your thrusts would be to dismantle cartels and monopolies. So far, however, it has only been the monopoly in the telecommunications industry which you've addressed. We have made an investigation of the cement industry, and we're not quite through with that yet. But (cement producers) have made the commitment that there will be no artificial shortage and no price manipulation, and we're making sure of this province by province. The banking system is one area we want to liberalise. That's why we're pushing for a new banking law. The biggest bank here is smaller than Thailand's 10th biggest bank. Why? Because the banking industry has largely been in the hands of a few families. We're about to open up that industry, so that our banks will be more competitive vis-a-vis the entire Asean region, so that access to credit will be maximised, and its cost minimised. The observation has been made that you are involving yourself too much in the details of your administration, rather than in giving overall direction. You have to start with the basics. I've spent time visiting neighbours in the region, I've spent time talking with senators and congressmen about bills and policies, and talking with the private sector. However, we cannot neglect providing solutions for problems down below, where because of neglect in the past, there is a need for interagency collaboration. There are observations that given the country's political structure, the Philippines may not be "governable." I think it definitely is governable. That's why we went into this, as a challenge. All other efforts have failed. It's just that we did not do many things right. The structure depends on the people who run it. You can have the most beautiful structure, but if the people who are running it are not devoted, and are not dedicated to the goal, it will never work. What would you say is your biggest lesson in governance? You have to be awfully patient. You have to be steady. You must not be diverted from your original objectives.
