Hans-Friedrich Meyer said the two new inspectors, who should arrive in Pyongyang Tuesday, will continue supervision of the experimental nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometres (56 miles) north of the capital. North Korea created a crisis earlier this month by refusing to allow international supervision to check whether material has been diverted from the Yongbyon complex for military use. One of the two inspectors currently in Korea will leave Tuesday and the other will leave at the end of the week after briefing his two colleagues, Meyer said. "It is essential for us that two inspectors remain on the spot," Meyer stressed, adding that the two officials obtained visas without any trouble. The duration of the inspectors' visit has not been fixed, but an "old rule" of the atomic watchdog fixes inspectors' tours of duty at three weeks. Bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea are scheduled to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on July 8. North Korea paved the way for the new talks by agreeing not to refuel the reactor, and not to reprocess nuclear fuel -- to make the plutonium needed to manufacture atomic weapons -- and to allow the IAEA inspectors to remain in North Korea.
