The operation, a joint effort by the police and MI5, the security service, has identified a conspiracy by a Serb middleman and a British arms dealer from Kingston, Surrey, to buy missiles worth about £1m on the black market in London. The success of the operation, codenamed Porchester, will come as a relief to Nato pilots and United Nations peacekeeping forces in the besieged city, where the chances of bombing raids receded last night after the Serbs appeared to be meeting UN demands to withdraw artillery. Scotland Yard has declined to comment, but intelligence sources said the two men were monitored at meetings in London and the home counties as they tried to buy eight Starburst missiles from an unidentified man, thought to be a British arms dealer with links to organised crime. Starburst is a shoulder-fired, laser-guided system manufactured by Shorts of Belfast. First unveiled at the 1991 Paris air show, it boasts a two-and-a-half-mile range and can be fired within seconds. Shorts sales' literature boasts that Starburst "can be brought into action and fired as soon as enemy aircraft have been identified -- and before the release of their weapons". The missile is said to be immune to electronic jamming, flares or chaff, and would undoubtedly have posed a threat to allied warplanes, including RAF Tornadoes and Harriers. A successor to the Javelin missile system, it is used by the British Army. Security sources say the Serb middleman described himself as "the procurements officer" for the government of Slovenia, a province of the former Yugoslavia and now an independent country uninvolved in the civil war. The middleman is a well known Yugoslav-born arms dealer in his late thirties who lives near Vancouver in western Canada. He has been under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) since last year. The international operation also involved American customs and Canadian and Israeli intelligence. The middleman was tracked to meetings at Hilton hotels in London's Park Lane and near Bushey, Hertfordshire. At one meeting he was shown a missile, worth £100,000 on the black market, and a shoulder launcher. The combined unit was offered for sale for about £180,000; the Serb said he wanted to buy eight missiles. He arranged to have the money transferred from a Swiss bank account in Zurich to a branch of Credit Suisse in London. It is understood he planned to smuggle the weapons to Serbia on a plane from Heathrow. Detectives from Scotland Yard's international and organised crime branch, SO1, have contacted the defence ministry in an attempt to find out how the missiles reached the London arms black market. Last year, 120 tonnes of weapons were seized in Slovenia in what UN investigators claim was a plot to breach the arms embargo to forces fighting the civil war. Operation Porchester is the latest example of joint action by police and MI5 in the growing war against international crime and arms trafficking. Although they are confident they have broken the plan to buy the missiles, the two men are still at large. TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1994
