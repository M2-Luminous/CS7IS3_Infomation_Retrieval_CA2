In an interview to the INFOTAG agency he said that the Democratic Party advocated rescheduling the election date in the eastern rayons even before an official proposal to this effect by the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission. Gheorghe Ghimpu said: "Undoubtedly, the separatist leaders of Tiraspol will try to hinder the residents of the eastern rayons of Moldova who will wish to take part in the elections at polling stations on the right bank of the Dniester. Problems with transportation and vote counting and certain difficulties will certainly appear. Moving up the election date would facilitate the resolution of these issues." He noted that the Democratic Party has developed its own concept for solving the problem of the Dniester region. It envisions the establishment of a territorial-administrative unit of republic significance with the seat in Tiraspol. It could consist of two uyezds--an industrial uyezd, including the present-day Kamenskiy and Rybnitskiy Rayons, and an agrarian uyezd, including the present-day Dubossarskiy, Sloboziyskiy, and Grigoriopolskiy Rayons.
