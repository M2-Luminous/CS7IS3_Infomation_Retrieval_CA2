In line with the ministry's estimates, there would be at least 1,000 unwanted immigrants. "We know where they are, what they are doing, what their origin is; after all, this is what the police is for," says Longin Beirzanek, a high-ranking officer at the Main Headquarters. "It is theoretically possible to start a deportation action," he adds; "however, it would have to be precisely coordinated by the police, the voivodship administration, and the border troops. Otherwise, we might see a situation which has already taken place in Gdansk; there were talks with a group of Romanian Gypsies, living in the city refuse dump; travel documentation was prepared, and even medical tests were made. However, the next day the Romanians disappeared--they most probably went to a neighboring voivodship. "We still do not have an efficient system for the deportation of unwanted foreigners," reiterates Tomasz Kozlowski, director of the Office for Migration and Refugees in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The director is not even going to suggest that foreigners threaten to cause some kind of an apocalyptical catastrophe in Poland; he says, however, that every country must have an effective method of disposing of foreigners who do not respect the Polish law, for instance. However, the truth is that voivodes are rarely able to fully implement their own decisions concerning deportations. Kozlowski argues: "Certainly no one in the Polish Republic is going to plan any mass deportations; this is an absurd idea; all the same, the authorities must not be so helpless." The police have forwarded nearly 40 deportation motions to the Zielona Gora voivode; in almost all cases, administrative visas were placed in the passports which obliged their owners to leave Poland by the shortest route. No one knows which routes those persons chose. Only six foreigners were escorted by a convoy: four to Okecie airport, two to the eastern border. In all, the expeditions cost 49 million zlotys. In order to avoid such expenditures, the police in Zielona Gora increased supervision over foreigners arriving in the areas close to the border. Whenever a more numerous group appears, the functionaries immediately check their documents and scrupulously implement registration regulations. "No one can accuse us of persecuting anyone; however, after such a reception, the guests do not usually stay long," assures Wiktor Szopski of the Voivodship Police Headquarters, who is the author of this method. He suggested, however, that this danger not be exaggerated. In the Zielona Gora Voivodship, which is located on the immigration route, there are not more than tens of so-called cumbersome foreigners. Last year guests from abroad committed 116 offenses here, of which at least 30 percent were road offenses. In these statistics first are the Ukrainians, followed by the Germans. "This is really not much," say Szopski. The Szczecin voivode issued 120 administrative visas last year; he already deported 18 foreigners. According to the voivode's spokesperson Maria Bartczak, the problem has not reached a level which would be alarming to the voivode. Lublin Police Spokesperson Andrzej Przemyski is not as optimistic. According to him, the present deportation procedure is unacceptable: Within 48 hours the entire case must be completed, even though it takes a lot of time to merely establish the identity of the detained person; it is common for them to destroy their documents. The police in Lublin has already prepared its own deportation arrest location (there will be 20 such places all over Poland); however, it is not certain whether this arrest location will be used: some provisions of the 1991 Law on Foreigners have been queried by the Constitutional Tribunal; it did not agree that the state administration be given the right to send people to closed places. The verdict of the judges of the Constitutional Tribunal was then confirmed by the Sejm; now we must wait for deputies to meet their commitment and amend the law soon. The amendment bills aim at strengthening the supervision over the cases of detainment related to deportation, by giving the right of supervision to the prosecutors' offices. Only when the new law is passed will we be able to think about establishing a center where deported foreigners--with their families--would be able to wait until the procedure is completed; in line with the agreement on readmission, signed by Poland, this procedure allows for appropriate international agreements. Longin Bierzanek believes that it would be best if such a center were located in the center of Poland, near Warsaw, where it is only a short distance to the airport at Okecie and to the interested embassies. Last year voivodes made over 1,000 decision on deporting foreigners; only 617 unwanted foreigners were escorted by convoys to the border. According to police estimates, it would not be unfounded to deport from Poland at least 2,000 most cumbersome Gypsies, among whom many cases of tuberculosis were detected, and just as many foreigners from the east, who make deals conflicting with the Polish law. "If the Romanians were sent with escort to their homeland, they would not survive the winter there," protest Poles in the committees for defending Gypsies in Poznan.
