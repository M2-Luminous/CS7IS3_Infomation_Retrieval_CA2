Cauca Department Governor Temistocles Ortega Narvaez said that other more democratic means should be adopted to face the Guerrilla Coordinating Board violence and said that Gaviria's announcement is outside all constitutional order. Gaviria has invoked the Public Order Law. "I am convinced that all Colombians have to decidedly fight to strengthen democracy and this calls for civilian society to have the responsibility of guiding the state at its various levels," the governor said. Temistocles Ortega added that for this very reason he differs from the president's views that members of the Armed Forces should fill the vacancies in those municipalities where the mayors have been murdered. Norte de Santander Department Governor Alvaro Salgar Villamizar said that the fact that a mayor is murdered justifies the president's reasons, but this places the president against the spirit of the Constitution and the mayors' popular election mandate. Antioquia Governor Juan Gomez Martinez said that the measure seems extreme to him and said that in the case of Antioquia Department, the situation has substantially improved, including the Uraba banana area. President Gaviria Trujillo assured all governors that they will have the government's full support in its struggle against the guerrillas and in the consolidation process for the upcoming elections. The president said that the Colombian guerrillas have their military capacity undermined and have been incapable of interpreting the Colombian people's wishes and have found less support among the population. He said that for this reason no one wants to listen to their outdated speeches full of bullets and threats, arguing that all Colombians reject the attack suffered by Finance and Public Credit Minister Rudolf Hommes. The president said that those guerrillas do not know that Colombians must be spoken to with the language of democracy, respect for life, and tolerance. He said that the decided and clear response by the Colombian people should show those who are violent that their weapons do not intimidate us and that their crazy behavior leads us to persist in the policies that will lead Colombia down the path of peace and progress.
