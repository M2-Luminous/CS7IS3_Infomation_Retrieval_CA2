Taking part were the leaders of the parliament's chambers, Federation Council and State Duma deputies, representatives of the government, and heads of representative organs of power in Federation components. In connection with the recently widespread story that a "power party" of regional leaders is maturing within the depths of the Federation Council (a nonformalized but influential party, needless to say) the conference can be regarded as a kind of organizational event: This is the first time that the top leaders of the Federal Assembly have met specially with their colleagues from the regional parliaments, legislative assemblies, oblast dumas, etc. A parallel involuntarily suggests itself with last year's clear attempt by the Supreme Soviet to create a legislative vertical to counterbalance the executive -- something for which neither the previous nor the current Constitution incidentally make provision. However, just as the political situation has changed over the year, the tasks facing the chambers of the Federal Assembly as regards regional representative power have also changed considerably. Let us start with the fact that, even if it were planned, the formation of a vertical has been complicated by the federal parliament's "division in two": Notwithstanding the fact that the upper and lower chambers ultimately have common objectives (the formation of federal legislation) the Federation Council's and State Duma's tactical goals and behavior patterns differ considerably and the contradictions between them are too marked to presuppose any unity of will as regards "government" and even as regards coordinating the activity of all representative bodies in the localities. What is more, the Federation Council, which developed in the absence of local legislative organs in most regions, comprises to a considerable extent republic presidents and the heads of kray and oblast administrations, i.e. representatives of the executive, whose interests differ considerably from those of the representative branch (although this fact may be an additional incentive for the Federation Council to cooperate with local legislators). Be that as it may, Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko considers the talk of a "power party" futile and insists that the parliament needs to work with Federation components in order to further develop the principles of Russia's federal system. The task now is no longer and not so much to reallocate powers between the center and the regions, he said, as to establish normal relations between the actual components of the Federation. In this process the upper chamber is in his view designed to defend the interests of Federation components -- both in their relations with the center and in cooperation among them. As for the State Duma's objectives, they were expressed fairly clearly during the parliamentary hearings 9 June devoted to the principles of coordinating the legislative activity of organs of state power. With regional representative organs' acquisition of legislative functions (under the new Constitution) the question arises of systematizing all lawmaking activity, without which legal chaos, or at the very least disagreements that may destroy the country's unified legal and economic area, are inevitable. State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has of late repeatedly spoken of Russian legislation lagging behind the requirements of economic reform. This considerable deficiency, he believes, must be overcome, and as quickly as possible. According to the organizers of the State Duma parliamentary hearings and the Federation Council conference that has just opened, cooperation in this sphere may be good for the cause. At any rate (and this has also been pointed out in the declaration regarding the joint work of the State Duma and legislative bodies) the conference will result in the creation of a coordinating body to formulate a unified strategy in the sphere of legislation and the creation of an informational system extending to Federation components to keep track of and coordinate all stages of lawmaking activity.
