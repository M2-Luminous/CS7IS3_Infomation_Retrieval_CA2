According to official data provided by the Government Ministry and other state and private institutions that work in programs seeking to replace coca crops with other products, those remarks are based on the gradual increase in agroindustrial activities in that controversial area. Although this solution is apparently feasible, there are several objections such as the inconceivable influence of drug traffickers to maintain justifiable prices for the surplus coca leaves, the precarious economic situation of most peasants in the Chapare region, and the lack of assured markets for the products they intend to replace, without mentioning the industrialization of coca for a reduced national market that makes the project already approved by the executive branch unfeasible. Notwithstanding this situation, government officials claim that the change is possible. They argue that in the past few years the investment of more than $200 million in the region has helped conduct a gradual transformation that will help improve the production capacity and the growth of alternative crops. Gaston Martinic, chairman of the National Fund for Alternative Development (Fonadal), stated: "If we manage to make the peasants understand this, namely the peasant producers of coca, we will be paving the way toward the fulfillment of the anti-drug fight's objectives, in addition to achieving a process for development and voluntary replacement of coca crops." In a seminar sponsored by the La Paz Reporters Association, Martinic explained that preliminary studies have determined that the share of the coca-cocaine economy in the country's GDP in 1987 was 26 percent. He added that coca production yielded $238 million, mainly benefiting drug traffickers. Since then, drug enforcement action has allowed substantial achievements, including the eradication of almost 25,000 hectares of coca crops considered illegal by Law No. 1008. However, the action has caused the loss in value added tax revenue of $472.3 million for the country, which uncovered the national economy's dependency on the coca-cocaine circuit, Martinic added. Official reports on projects carried out through March in Chapare allow us to cite the following results that, considering the 250,000 inhabitants living in that region, cannot be called successful, according to peasant leaders, who even question the figures' accuracy. With the support of U.S. AID and the UNDCP [expansion unknown] of the United Nations, 818 km of roads were restored, 618 km were made usable, and 19 bridges were built in the region. They said that in the past few years U.S. AID has subsidized the construction of 38 schools, the provision of drinkable water to 59 towns, the revamping of 15 community centers, and a vast social assistance program. Concerning electric services, 394 km of primary lines, 110 km of secondary lines, and 24 transformers were installed, and 1,165 street lights also were installed. The same reports add that the increase in alternative crops, which despite the gradual increase, only matches the surplus coca crops estimated at 35,500 hectares. Bananas: A total of 7,075 hectares were planted in 1986, but in 1993 banana plantations reached 10,875 hectares. Pineapple: In 1986 a total of 395 hectares of pineapple were harvested, but 2,618 hectares were planted in 1993. Black pepper: The first crops reached 32 hectares in 1993. Passion fruit: A total of 63 hectares of this fruit were planted in 1993. Subsistence crops: In 1986 a total of 8,000 hectares were planted, while in 1993 planting reached 11,558 hectares. Heart of palms: A total of 241 hectares were planted in 1993 alone.
