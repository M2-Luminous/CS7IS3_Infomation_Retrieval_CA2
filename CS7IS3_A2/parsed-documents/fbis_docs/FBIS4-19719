[Vranitzky] The UN secretary general can only view the issue in terms of possibilities, because he himself does not have any armed forces, he himself does not have any other hierarchies. What must be demanded now -- and this has been discussed very intensively here over the past 48 hours -- is that the individual NATO governments -- that is, the governments of the United States and Canada, the governments of the West European countries, and, in addition to NATO, also the government of Russia, which means, all those countries that are able and willing to follow a common course -- do indeed follow such a common course. If the United Nations does not have the support of its largest and most important members, the United Nations will not become stronger, either. One must accept this, this is reality. Therefore, it is not so important now whether the UN secretary general does or says this or that, but whether his members give him a clear indication of what they are willing to do. [Oberhauser] Well, in Europe at least there is massive criticism that the United Nations and the United States do not know at all what is going on in Bosnia and assess the situation completely incorrectly. Do you also have this impression? [Vranitzky] I cannot confirm this impression here, but I think that this impression is irrelevant. In the talks with Butrus-Ghali and his associates I have noted that they know very well what is going on. After all, they constantly have their observers and their people there. They have also sent people there, who are occasionally right in the middle of hails of bullets. If they do not know what is going on, I wonder how others claim to know that, when they are 600 km away. [Oberhauser] Do people in New York, at the UN headquarters, still believe in a negotiated solution? [Vranitzky] One must believe that, because so many terrible things are happening there, so much injustice and so many acts of violence, that neither in New York nor, I think, anywhere else in the world -- in Washington or in Vienna -- can one simply accept it and say: Unfortunately, no solution can be found and, therefore, we will not do anything. I think, in particular since things have become as difficult as they are now, one needs renewed efforts. Just let me repeat: The big powers, which are, after all, the determining factors, must first work out a common line and second, make it absolutely clear that they will implement this common line, regardless of what it is. If they leave the slightest doubt that they do not mean seriously what they say -- be it together or individually -- it is easy for the aggressors in Bosnia -- for the Serbs and for everybody else -- to say: Those guys in the West are not serious anyway and, therefore, we can just go on shooting as we like. Unfortunately, this is what has happened so far. Today, in all these talks here, it became clear that if this continues, no solution will be found. Therefore, a clear, common, and cohesive attitude is important. I hope that such an attitude can now be found. [Oberhauser] Let us come to a specific matter regarding Bosnia and Austria: Today you presented a proposal to hold a conference on the reconstruction of Bosnia in Vienna. What was Butrus-Ghali's response? [Vranitzky] His response was quite positive, because it is precisely one of the points that the issue is not just about holding a conference. There are a lot of conferences. The issue is to give the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the embattled areas, in the fringe areas, in the border areas hope that, if the fighting is stopped, the international community will be ready immediately to contribute to and help with the reconstruction of hospitals, means of transportation, houses, schools, and everything needed by people who want to reconstruct their homeland again after a war. [Oberhauser] What does this mean for this conference, Mr. Chancellor? When would this conference have to start work? [Vranitzky] I will start preparing for it immediately. [Oberhauser] And who is supposed to participate in it? [Vranitzky] I believe that we will find an appropriate framework with the OECD states. The OECD, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, is, as its name indicates, the appropriate organization for this purpose. It also has the necessary expertise. Then, of course, we have to negotiate with the individual countries about how much money each is willing to provide -- because there is no question that this will cost money -- and what kind of expertise will be made available for the reconstruction an area destroyed by war, as has happened many times in history before. [Oberhauser] According to news agency reports, one subject of your talks was Vienna's role as a UN city and the concern in Vienna that the city might lose importance in this respect because again and again there is a danger of UN institutions being removed from Vienna. What about that? [Vranitzky] First of all, we have to cope with one contradiction into which some Austrians slide again and again. They constantly criticize the United Nations for not being able to achieve anything and, in the same breath, they complain if one or another UN department is removed from Vienna. Thus, we must come to a decision -- do we want it or don't we. I think we want it because otherwise we would not have built the Vienna International Center, and it also has many important tasks. In particular in connection with the reconstruction of East Europe -- this will apply not only to Yugoslavia; in the future we will have to cooperate with many others -- it is sensible for Austria to work on having Vienna as a UN location also play a role in the future. This will be the issue. I told Secretary General Butrus-Ghali precisely what I told you just now and I persuaded him to personally advocate this politically and within the UN framework, because if the top official, the head of this organization does not move ahead in this issue, it will be more difficult for us. However, this was a very good talk. I invited him to Vienna. At the 50th anniversary of the United Nations next spring in Vienna we will be able to say something more specific about this issue. [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, one question in conclusion -- and I refer again to news agency reports. Reportedly Butrus-Ghali asked you for more Austrian UN missions. Will Austria be able to fulfill this wish? [Vranitzky] He did not voice this desire today, but this would not have been necessary anyway, because, in cooperation with the National Defense Council, the Austrian Government began some time ago to work out how we can better prepare ourselves for future demands on Austrian soldiers in peacekeeping missions. First of all, it is necessary to make preparations during training for areas that are not altogether usual for Austrians. Then, precautions also need to be taken regarding equipment and everything that is needed for such a mission. Today I told him that we have started this work and that it will take quite a while yet to conclude it. Then we will brief him on the results. [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, thank you very much for being our guest, and I wish you a good flight home. [Vranitzky] Thank you very much.
