"I haven't heard of that," Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press conference. He was referring to newspaper reports that Germany has proposed holding such a G-7 meeting in late February. Saito, however, confirmed that a meeting of finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on March 18 and 19 in Hawaii will take place as disclosed earlier Monday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. The meeting will be for "exchanging views informally" on cooperation in the region and "not for negotiations," Saito said. Turning to domestic issues, he denied reports of an agreement among the coalition parties for the government to compile the fiscal 1994 budget around February 10, with the Finance Ministry to announce its budget plan on February 5. The ministry has not received any instructions on the timetable, Saito said. But the ruling parties are to hold a meeting of their policy-making forum, he said. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest of the coalition parties, said Saturday that the parties have agreed on the budget schedule.
