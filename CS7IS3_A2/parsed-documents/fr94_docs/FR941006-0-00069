FR941006-0-00069 FR941006-0-00018 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Part 213 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement: Small Purchases for Contingency Operations AGENCY: Department of Defense. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to fully implement the Department of Defense's authority to use simplified procedures for acquisitions in support of a contingency operation. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Claudia L. Naugle, (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background These revisions provide for the use of small purchase procedures up to $100,000 for any contract to be performed outside the United States in support of a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13). The revisions are based on language in Sections 631 and 805 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which modified the definition of small purchase threshold at 10 U.S.C. 2302(7) and added a definition of the term ``contingency operation'' at 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13). B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The rule does not constitute a significant revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501 and Public Law 98&hyph;577 and publication for public comment is not required. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply as this rule imposes no information collection requirements which require approval of the Office of Management and Budget.
