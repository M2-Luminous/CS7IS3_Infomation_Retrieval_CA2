In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the sources confirmed that the exchange of fire was stopped within hours to avoid an eruption of the situation because of the political crisis which has prevailed in Yemen for about five months. It is worth noting that these clashes occurred after the arrival of three Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] brigades in Shabwah from other governorates including Hadramaut. They are the 30th Brigade, the Taysir Brigade, and the 'Abbas Brigade. They tightened control of the oil area which was a joint area between the two Yemens before unity. It was considered "a joint investment zone." Oil prospecting and production rights there were given to the French company Total which announced the discovery of an oilfield last October after the exploratory drilling of three wells. While General People's Congress [GPC] sources accused the YSP of moving these brigades, the YSP claimed that the GPC had moved several units from al-Hudaydah to Ta'izz near Aden and reinforced its units in the governorates of Ibb and al-Bayda'.
