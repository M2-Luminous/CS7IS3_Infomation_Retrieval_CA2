During "postperestroyka" the regional bosses have gained strength on two occasions already. First, immediately after August 1991 (the collapse of the CPSU) and the ensuing Belovezhskoye agreement (the disbandment of Union structures), when centrifugal sentiments increased and leaders of "Federation components" (at that time the term was not yet in use), like leaders of former Union republics, tried to take "as much powers as they could lay their hands on" -- although nobody got very far apart from Dudayev. At that time the sovereignization of the regions was hindered by several circumstances. First, the resistance of the new Russian authority, starting from the president's supporters (Skokov, for example, or Shakhray, who made considerable efforts to restrain the autonomous entities which were part of the Federation) and ending with deputies to the Supreme Soviet, where there were clearly more supporters of a united Russia than supporters of sovereignization or the creation of a Russian Republic within the Russian Federation. Second, the chronic conflict between the republics and the oblast leaders, who also stated their demands to federal authority, which hardly facilitated the sovereignization of future Federation components along national and ethnic lines. Third, neither -- unlike a number of leaders of former Union republics -- could rely on a wave of national movements in their plans for and attempts at self-determination...there was simply none of these in any Russian region except Tatarstan. The second wave of strengthening the regions came in fall 1993. It was then that the Russian president first realized -- in the struggle with the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet -- the need to intercept the regions and proposed the formation of the Federation Council, which was on the point of starting to form itself within the Constitutional Conference, and centrifugal sentiments already predominated in it, unlike in 1991-1992 (by the end of 1992 most regional leaders realized that sovereignization had no economic foundation and that administratively too much, alas, revolves around the center), although the fact that the Federation Council did not support the president in October 1993 prompted October 1993 to happen and especially prompted the political and commercial forces behind it to disband the Federation Council simultaneously with the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. Today we are observing the signs of the latest, third, wave of activization by regional leaders. This wave promises to be more fruitful (the "law of dialectics" -- development in a spiral and the repetition of development that has taken place at a higher level). First, it has a constitutional linchpin -- the Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. Second, there is some experience (unsuccessful experience is experience nevertheless) of collaboration with federal authority. The cause of May's activization of regional leaders was the State Duma's adoption of the federal budget for 1994, or to put it simply the distribution of state resources. While, for instance, representatives of the fuel and energy complex, which controls the government by drawing up the budget to suit itself, are more or less satisfied with it, the military-industrial complex was cut, the agrarian complex did not obtain what it wanted either, and during the budget's adoption other sectors simply were simply not noticed. The result was the snubbing of regional leaders, "senators," including leaders of enterprises which had been left with nothing. The effect was to turn the Federation Council toward the regions and the military-industrial complex; the appointment of N. Yegorov, head of Krasnodar administration, as minister of national and regional affairs; the rumors of Skokov's strengthened position, who is apparently still in good standing with some regionals and the defense sector; the meeting of leaders of interregional economic associations, etc. What Can Be Predicted in This Situation? Above all -- the start of a new phase of struggle in the upper echelons of power. But not between, for instance, the president and government or the president and parliament, but between sectoral clans on the one hand and regional lobbyists on the other, and also between sectoral groups themselves: THE FUEL AND ENERGY COMPLEX AND THE BANKS AGAINST THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND AGRARIANS. Of course, in the upshot everything will turn into the latest confrontation between the executive and legislative branches, but in fact the main struggle will develop not according to the political but the territorial-sectoral principle. The phase of struggle for ideas (the outward, the ostensible) and for resources (the essental) has ended and smoothly moved into the phase of struggle EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESOURCES. In October 1993 sectoral groups, or more precisely a sector clan, the most powerful one, which is now in power -- the fuel and energy complex -- relying for support on power [silovyye] structures, financial circles, and the "Moscow grouping," got the upper hand over the alliance of regional leaders and the military-industrial complex. Now the figures of the raw materials sector have fewer and fewer chances of stopping their opponents. The regionals and the military-industrial complex are on the offensive. The well-known meeting between the president and military-industrial complex representatives, culminating in the signing of six presidential edicts which "revitalized" the economy, was a clear concession to regional and sectoral (not raw material) leaders. For its part, the fuel and energy complex does not intend to give in. On the contrary, it is counterattacking. Reserve figures are already being "deployed": The mass media have carried publicity for "Gazprom" leader R. Vyakhirev, V. Kadannikov, leader of the "AvtoVAZ" joint-stock company, and B. Berezovskiy, leader of the "LogoVAZ" joint venture (it is known that the automobile sector is one of the most prosperous sectors and its leaders are among the most loyal to the president and premier), Yu. Shafranik, minister for the fuel and energy complex, and certain other figures. On Shafranik's initiative, the Association for Economic Collaboration is being formed (the constituent assembly is scheduled for 17 June), which is supposed to unite not only the leaders of the oil and gas complex but also its representatives in the Federation Council. This association will probably become the most powerful lobby grouping in the Russian parliament jointly with the "New Regional Policy" Duma faction, led by V. Medvedev, president of the Union of Russian Oil Industry Workers. But not all representatives of financial circles support the raw material producers (just as not all regionals support the military-industrial complex). Many of them are keeping quiet for the moment, adopting a wait-and-see attitude, trying to understand the forces at work. Currently they are loyal to Chernomyrdin but it is clear that in any event it is worth thinking about mutual understanding with someone else. With whom? Soskovets? Skokov? Luzhkov? Shumeyko? Shakhray? Bankers are asking themselves these questions at all their confidential gatherings and for the moment they prefer to keep their finger on the pulse of most political groupings. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING OUR "RATING" IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. Thus, there has been an improvement in the positions of Shumeyko, who stepped up his efforts in the "proper" -- long-term -- direction; Skokov, around whom contacts between regional elites and military-industrial complex leaders apparently revolve; and Glazyev, who is also trying to defend the interests of the military-industrial complex and science-intensive sectors. The ranks of the most influential leaders have been augmented by N. Yegorov, the new minister for nationality affairs and regional policy (see table), and another two Yegorovs: Sergey Yefimovich, president of the Association of Russian Banks, and Mikhail Konstantinovich, Yerin's deputy. They are kept company by M. Mityukov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma, who is one of the leaders most loyal to the presidential team, which means one of the most promising leaders, and who is being considered, in particular, as a candidate for the post of chairman of the Russian Constitutional Court. State Duma Chairman I. Rybkin's rating is increasing. Not because the Duma's importance and authority are increasing. The Duma is simply a platform, an arena capable of turning an activist -- whether of the Communist Party or Agrarian Party -- into a figure of nationwide scale. A newspaper specializing in compiling ratings recently wrote that Yeltsin has two alternatives: "In the current situation Chernomyrdin, in the long term Zhirinovskiy." That is naive. V.V. [Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy] will not do any better than he did 12 December. But as for the premier -- no comment.... Rybkin is another matter. The modest, quiet Rybkin is now a real alternative to the president. Provided, of course, as G. Zyuhganov asserts, the "left-wingers" and patriots agree among themselves about supporting a single candidate. Do not forget that the biggest faction in the Duma is not the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (50 deputies) or "Russia's Choice" (70 deputies) but the indivisible bloc of communists and agrarians (100 deputies). The list of candidates has also been augmented by such figures as B. Nemtsov, head of Nizhniy Novgorod Administration; V. Sergeyev, leader of the premier's press service; A. Livshits, leader of the Russian Federation president's group of experts, A. Bryachikhin, prefect of Moscow City's Western District; yet another Yegorov (the fourth) -- Yevgeniy -- chief of Moscow government's department for supporting and developing small and medium-sized businesses; Yu. Petrov, chief of the State Investment Corporation, who has preserved his links with the presidential team; G. Satarov, the president's assistant for the Federal Assembly, who easily finds a common language with the most diverse political groupings; V. Medvedev, president of the Union of Oil Industry Workers of Russia and leader of one of the largest Duma factions; L. Polezhayev, head of Omsk Oblast Administration and chairman of the "Siberian Accord" Interregional Association; Yu. Nozhikov, head of Irkutsk Oblast Administration; K. Titov, head of Samara Oblast Administration and chairman of the "Greater Volga" Interregional Association; Yu. Matochkin, head of Kaliningrad Oblast Administration; M. Prusak, head of Novgorod Oblast Administration; and V. Chub, head of Rostov Oblast Administration. We believe that our rating has at least one serious flaw -- it does not fully assess the level of influence of a number of REGIONAL leaders. This is understandable: Given the existing shortage of information the situation in the regions was not studied properly, but we have started consultations with expert regionalists on this question and we hope that this flaw will gradually be rectified. It must be said that it was always the regional representatives who always predominated in the USSR's supreme power structures: The recruitment of party and soviet cadres was carried out in this way -- via the CPSU oblast committees. Following Yeltsin's victory the new Russian ruling apparatus was formed mainly of Muscovites. Authority is now returning to the old tried and true method -- plucking the necessary people from oblast and republic administrations. Thus, on the one hand, we are obtaining authorities which fit in with Russians' mentality but on the other the deintellectualization of the sphere of state management is taking place, and the place of luminaries, often born not in Moscow (but who, for this reasons, nonetheless, know Russia) but who studied at Moscow universities and finished their studies at the likes of Harvard, are being taken by collective farm chairmen and other regional chiefs (who then rule the state like one big collective farm), whom a commentator has aptly dubbed "behemoths".... Our May list also featured several shady figures -- deputy ministers and other state officials. First, M. Yegorov, who is Yerin's deputy. In the opinion of experts he is now the strongest figure in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], at any rate much stronger than Yerin. Besides which he is a figure who clearly aspires to power. His name cropped up in connection with the rumors of Yerin's possible dismissal (this question, you will recall, was raised by a number of Duma factions after the murder of Ayzderdzis), when Yerin's deputies -- Yegorov among them -- came under the spotlight. Second, P. Mostovoy (list of candidates), Chubays' first deputy, who is alleged to be the one actually orchestrating all privatization and the subdivisions of Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Management of State Property], while Chubays is more of a figure-head. Third, G. Petelin, leader of Chernomyrdin's secretariat, who in our view will be more influential than V. Kvasov, leader of the government apparatus. Fourth, A. Sobentsov (list of candidates), first deputy leader of the Russian Government apparatus. Despite expectations, Shakhray's rating did not fall. The squeezing out of the latter by the "president's entourage" to the edge of the floor on which interregional hagglings are being conducted, and the inability and evidently the unwillingness of Chernomyrdin to defend Shakhray, have revealed the weakness of that particular asset of his -- the strength of his ties with the presidential branch and directly with the Russian Federation premier, but something else was revealed simultaneously: Shakhray is a completely autonomous figure, which means one that is up for grabs [razygryvayemaya]. Of course, Chubays' rating fell -- as a result of his acquisition of an enemy like Luzhkov. Moreover, it is quite clear that it is Chubays who is is losing the struggle under way between the two biggest Russian property administrators. Incidentally, when preparing an "influence rating" for the first time two months back, we noticed that Chubays was one of the next candidates for being "chucked out" of the government. The following candidates have moved out of the top 50 proper into the ranks of candidates for the top 50: -- A. Starovoytov, leader of Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information (his real influence in the last "rating" was by all accounts exaggerated), -- M. Nikolayev, president of the Republic of Sakha-Yakutia (maybe because he was dependent on "De Beers" and became a politician not so much on a Russian as an international scale), -- M. Maley, chairman of the Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission (has sunk to the bottom), -- A. Sobchak and G. Popov, leaders of the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, did not keep their places in our list. As always, the band of the most influential politicians is not limited to 50. In our opinion candidates for inclusion in the list of the 50 most influential politicians are: A. Sobchak, G. Popov, M. Maley, M. Nikolayev, A. Starovoytov, V. Kadannikov, N. Gonchar, A. Ilyushenko, P. Mostovoy, A. Volskiy, I. Golembiovskiy, V. Zhirinovskiy, V. Zorkin, A. Tuleyev, A. Rutskoy, G. Yavlinskiy, N. Travkin, A. Solzhenitsyn, R. Aushev, A. Kokoshin, B. Gromov, Yu. Petrov, Ye. Shaposhnikov, E. Rossel, Ye. Yegorov, A. Makarov, A. Sobentsov, B. Nemtsov, A. Bryachikhin, A. Livshits, V. Sergeyev, P. Aven, B. Berezovskiy, S. Rodionov, V. Bokser, N. Ryzhkov, R. Orekhov, A. Kotenkov, V. Alekperov, Ye. Lakhova, V. Groshev, V. Vinogradov, Yu. Nozhikov, L. Polezhayev, K. Titov, Yu. Matochkin, M. Prusak, O. Poptsov, I. Shurchkov, S. Yushenkov, S. Kovalev, V. Shcherbakov, A. Galazov, G. Satarov, V. Medvedev, L. Sukhanov, V. Chub, and M. Rakhimov. Since we have highlighted a number of little-known "shady" figures -- and in Russia it is customary to classify politicians as those to whom the mass media are attracted -- we once again remind you of what we mean by the word "politician." By leading politicians we mean leaders (of parties and political movements, executive and legislative organs, information and commercial structures...), possessing the greatest RESOURCES AND POTENTIAL in making and ensuring the implementation of state and political decisions. Putting it simply, those who hold the levers controlling society and the state. These, our domestic history shows us, are traditionally not so much tribunes, ideologues, or even party leaders as functionaries and apparatchiks -- akin to spiders, spinning their web of power day and night. That is the reality.
