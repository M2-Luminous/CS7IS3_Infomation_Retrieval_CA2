[Velayati] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. His Excellency President Saparmurad Niyazov has come here on the basis of the invitation of our president, and he has reciprocated the recent visit of our president to Turkmenistan. He and his entourage stayed here for five days. During their stay here they have made very good discussions with their Iranian counterparts in different ministries and in different committees. At the end of his trip we had signed eleven documents. Three of these documents were signed by [the] two presidents. I think after the signing of these documents many facilities have been provided for the expansioning of relations between our two countries. [Correspondent] As you know, Afghanistan is now facing a very critical situation. What are the measures and stances taken by Iran towards the on-going Afghan crisis? [Velayati] This is [a] very unfortunate situation. You know the people of Afghanistan since the very beginning after the occupation of that country by the former Soviet forces, they have tried a lot to expel the former Soviet forces and they have succeeded. So the first part of their struggle was very successful. But, unfortunately, after the victory of the Islamic revolution in Afghanistan they have started fighting against each other. We as the Islamic Republic of Iran are against any kind of internal conflict. We don't support any party against another party. What we have done till now is bringing all factions together and trying to make a peaceful settlement among all these factions which are fighting against each other. We deeply believe that any kind of internal conflict is against the interest of the people of Afghanistan. [Reporter] Iran has decided to resume diplomatic relations with South Africa. On what basis has this decision been made and how long the normalization of ties will continue? [Velayati] You know this decision was made last night in the Cabinet meeting, and we have been instructed by the government to prepare the ground for resumption of relations with South Africa. After the recent important developments we could witness in South Africa and on the basis of the request of the head of important groups there, ANC [African National Congress] and EAC [Ease African Community], and specifically Mr. Mandela has asked us to resume our relations, and Muslim groups in South Africa also have asked us. So we think that as a first step we have to resume our economic relations with South Africa, and after the elections, which will be held in, before the end of April, after the end of that elections we think that the time will be right for the resumption of the political relations. [Reporter] Thank you very much, sir. [Velayati] You are welcome.
