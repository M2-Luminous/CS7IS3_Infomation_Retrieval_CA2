This was announced by the President's Office in Bonn on Monday [2 May] upon inquiry. The amnesty of Roessner, who was involved in the attack on the German Embassy in Stockholm in 1975, will become effective on 16 May. Roessner has been in prison in Straubing for almost 19 years. In November 1992 Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger ordered a suspension of the sentence for 18 months because of Roessner's state of health. Since then he has been undergoing urgent therapeutical treatment near Kassel.
