For lack of markets, the enterprise has mined only moderate amounts. At present, the only market for this ore is the Southern Chemicals General Corporation. This is a great loss for this abundant mineral. Based on surveys, Bao Loc and nearby areas have approximately a billion tons of bauxite, of which approximately 220 million tons is concentrated around Bao Loc City. In particular, the ore at Bao Loc has a very high alumina (AL2O3) content, 45-50 percent. On the other hand, the ore has a hardened, weathered structure and is easy to mine and transport. The industrial-mineral sector must make plans to exploit this very abundant natural resource.
