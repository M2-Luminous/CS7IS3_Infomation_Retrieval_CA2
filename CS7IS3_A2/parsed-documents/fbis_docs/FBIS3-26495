Commission on Human Rights stressed here today the right to promote economic development and the need to create a peaceful environment for development. In his speech on the right to development, Pang Sen, alternate representative of China to the meeting, which is under way here, said the basic objective in realizing the right to development is to promote economic development, particularly that of the developing nations. "In considering the question of the realization of the right to development, the working group on the right to development should face the reality of the current international economic relations and the difficult situation of the developing countries and should pay special attention to the development needs of the developing countries," he said. He noted that "the development of all countries in the world is interrelated and the realization of the right to development is important to both the developing and developed countries." "With the growing interdependence of economies between all countries, the universal significance of the realization of the right to development is becoming more evident," he said. The Chinese delegate also noted that given the past experiences, the realization of the right to development is more difficult than the universal recognition of such right. "While the obstacles to the realization of the right to development are various, more attention should be paid to the elimination of the most important ones," he stressed. "We are of the view that the working group should give priority consideration to the elimination of those obstacles affecting peace and stability in all countries, since economic, social, cultural and political development of a country requires a peaceful and stable domestic and international environment." He pointed out that attention should be paid to the elimination of those obstacles which affect cooperation among states on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Judging from history and present reality, he said, the unbalance in development between developing and developed countries is mainly caused by the unfair and unjust international economic order, while the attachment of unreasonable conditions to economic cooperation and trade by some developed countries has aggravated the difficulties faced by the developing countries in development. With respect to the relationship between democracy and development, the Chinese delegate expressed the view that development, democracy and human rights are mutually complementary and mutually reinforcing. "While political democracy, full respect of human rights of people and perfection of rule of law are beneficial to economic and social development, economic development could relieve people of their poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, etc., thus creating necessary conditions for the full and better enjoyment of all human rights by the people," he added. "Based on its own experience of reform and opening to the outside world, China realizes that to achieve a steady and sustainable development of the economy and ensure the full enjoyment of the benefit of development by the people, a country has to first of all maintain its national and social stability." "It is only under this precondition can a country concentrate on developing its economy, raising the living standard of its people, strengthening democracy and rule of law," he declared. "Any unbalanced emphasis on one factor to the neglect of another and any attempt to copy the development strategies and political models of others which do not fit the conditions of the country will bring unfavorable consequences to the realization of the right to development and the full enjoyment of various human rights and fundamental freedoms of its people," Pang said.
