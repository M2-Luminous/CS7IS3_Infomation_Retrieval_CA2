This is due primarily to falling interest rates that led to an exchange rate profit on bonds. The exchange rate loss of 22.2 million kroner in 1992 changed to a surplus of 32.6 million kroner in 1992. Greenland Bank's general banking operations were almost unchanged in relation to 1992. However, net interest and fee income rose from 74.5 million to 83.8 million kroner. Losses and set-asides amounted to 8.2 million kroner in 1993 -- almost the same as in 1992.
