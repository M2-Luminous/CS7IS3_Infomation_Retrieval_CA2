However, I have mixed feelings about the personal attacks in his speech," the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) deputies group, Tibor Cabaj, said today. Deputy premier and honorary chairman of the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) Jozef Prokes called the speech of President Michal Kovac confrontational, saying Kovac should first have consulted with the government, at least about those parts in which he spoke about the country's situation. "The government is responsible for running the country, not the president," he said.
