Out of 7,000 professional soldiers of Slovak nationality, some 5,000 have stayed on the territory of the Czech Republic for various reasons. According to Sabol, the Army, too, suffers from a shortage of money, but "our arms systems will survive until approximately 2015." It is not true that the Army of the Slovak Republic is weaker than Hungary's. Slovakia abides by the international agreements on troop numbers and armaments, and its compliance with those agreements is being regularly monitored. Our involvement in the Partnership for Peace is not conditional on the compatibility of our arms systems. What must be common, however, is the method of communication. The prerequisite for this is command of the English language, which is still a problem for our Army.
