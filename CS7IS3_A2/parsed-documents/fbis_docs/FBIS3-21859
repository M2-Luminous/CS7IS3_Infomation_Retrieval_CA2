The law was amended to say that "any activities linked to drug production, manufacture or trade, will be considered as conniving with the enemy," the source said. Those found guilty of espionage already risk the death penalty, but convicted drug dealers previously only faced jail sentences. Drug addicts are not affected by the change, and if found guilty still face a maximum penalty of imprisonment for rehabilitation programmes, the official added. Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi accused the United States and Israel in January of propagating drugs in Arab countries in "a cold war aimed at destroying them."
