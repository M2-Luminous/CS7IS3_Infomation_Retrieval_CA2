There is some dispute among politicians on how dangerous the new religious fanaticism is. What is undisputed, however, is that militant Muslims around the Mediterranean are reaching for power. It is also undisputed that through the war in Bosnia, where most of the victims are Muslims, Islamic fundamentalism has reached Europe -- and that Germany and France, as the countries with the highest Islamic populations in West Europe, are directly affected. Bonn government circles and European intelligence services agree that a victory of fundamentalists in Algeria and Egypt, or even Tunisia and Morocco, would disturb the security balance in Europe. Intelligence experts consider Germany to be a "place of rest" for many fanatical Islamic organizations that are also prepared to use terror in Germany. Cambridge orientalist Ahmad 'Akbar says that every one of the 14 million Muslims in Europe "can turn into a radical activist under certain circumstances." [passage omitted]
