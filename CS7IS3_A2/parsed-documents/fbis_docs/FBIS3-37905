Member of the Presidential Council Leonid Smirnyagin told TASS on Wednesday that the people who the Duma pardoned can never change. "Such people as (hard-liner) Ilya Konstantinov are untamable, do not cede to the reasons of history and will again try to unite the irreconcilable under their banner", he said. However, Smirnyagin added that since the new Russian Constitution has been adopted "it leaves no room for (Ruslan) Khasbulatov and (Aleksandr) Rutskoy in the new Russian statehood". The Constitution envisages no post of the vice-president. Smirnyagin added that the Duma decision "doubts the political morality of deputies".
