Considering the severe fighting for the succession of Delors, is this still the same dream or is the dream no longer that nice? [Mock] This is why I said that one has to be realistic. The dream is a more peaceful, stronger, and more solid -- economically and ecologically -- Europe. Not for tomorrow; it is tomorrow that the work will start. Tomorrow is today. This will take a whole generation, and the Austrians are now part of it. Yes, it has been a dream. [passage as heard] [Schmidt] Minister, this dream may be somewhat disturbed by the events in the former Yugoslavia. In the foreign ministers' councils and the European councils in the past few years, all one could hear were declarations expressing regret for what happened there and appeals for peace. Can you imagine anything, or are there plans that are more promising? [Mock] I am approaching this issue with a great deal of realism. In Austria, we have told the people, especially also in the run up to the referendum, that this security structure of the Maastricht Treaty is necessary. After all, the European Community so far has not had a security structure, no joint foreign structure. This cannot be developed within 10 years. I think that if this is developed step-by-step and if, together with the Americans, the European Union proceeds with a somewhat stronger sense of realism, then the European Union will achieve credibility in this area, too. [Schmidt] In the past few months, the Greeks introduced the issue of enlarging the European Union in the south through Cyprus and Malta. This issue was also discussed today. Do you see any major problems in this connection? Would such a step take away energy from the Eastern enlargement or can the European Union cope with it? [Mock] For these two very small countries, I see a chance in 1997-98. After yesterday and today, I am more convinced than ever that it will take a long time before other new members will be accepted.
