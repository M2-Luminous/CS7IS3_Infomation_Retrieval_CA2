This was revealed by RAM/SFP/YOU spokesman General Edgardo Abenina. Abenina said that the continued detention of its members is a violation of the agreement made between his group and the government last 22 December 1992. The agreement states that all members of RAM/SFP/YOU will be freed temporarily while their cases are still being heard. Abenina, however, expressed hope that the government is sincere in its peace initiative. Abenina added that the government is not clear on the procedures it is implementing for the peace talks.
