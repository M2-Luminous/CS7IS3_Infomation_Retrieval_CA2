The dollar fell Tuesday morning in Tokyo to a momentary low of 101.90 yen, finishing the morning at 102.85 yen, down 2.84 yen from Monday's close. The International Trade and Industry minister told reporters that the current level is untenable since it does not reflect Japan's economic fundamentals. A level of 100 yen to the dollar would be a major psychological barrier, he said. Kumagai said, however, that speculative moves in the market to take advantage of the yen's surge could put Japan in serious trouble, adding Japan's monetary authorities should try to prevent such moves.
