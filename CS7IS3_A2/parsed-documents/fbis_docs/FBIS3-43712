The congress will be opened by the president of the ANC, Nelson Mandela on Friday morning. Congress will also receive reports from the president, secretary general and treasurer general of the ANC Youth League. The morning session on Friday, namely, the addresses by the president of the ANC and the president of the ANC Youth League, shall be open to the media and the public in general. The rest of congress shall be in closed session, with the exception for the closing address by the new president of the ANC Youth League which shall be in open session. The closed sessions shall deal with the reports of the secretary and treasurer generals and the different commissions and their plenary sessions. There will be four commissions which shall in turn have sub-commissions. The four commissions are: I. Youth and a democratic South Africa. A. The ANCYL post elections. B. The youth and the RDP [Restructuring and Development Program]. C. Building a national youth council. D. Government participation by youth. E. Memorandum on the need for a youth ministry. II. Strategy and tactics III. Constitutional amendments This commission will address the question of the autonomy of the ANC Youth League, which will also deal with the general relations between the ANC Youth League and the ANc, particularly with the ANC being in government IV. Elections and violence Other issues to be dealt with are the ANC Youth League and the world youth movement as well as the financial self sufficiency of the ANC Youth League. The congress will be attended by 1,550 representatives, representing 235,301 paid up members, and an additional 25 observers that are expected from the international community. There will be five (5) youth delegates from each of the camps of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] that are outside the country. There will also be elections for a new national executive committee. Congress is expected to adopt key resolutions on the education crisis, the violence, elections, and on organisational questions affecting the ANC Youth League. Primary among these will be question of establishing branches of the ANC Youth League at tertiary learning institutions and schools. The state of organisation in the coloured, Indian and white communities will also be a subject of discussion. Because the last two years have not seen a significant improvement in the participation of women in our structures, the challenge to ensure greater involvement of young women in the activities of the organisation shall occupy a high place in our agenda. The 18th congress should mark a turning point in the history of youth politics in South Africa. It shall be the task of our congress to ensure that the ambiguous role that has been played by the youth since the unbanning of the liberation movement is discarded. The congress will have to redefine the role of the youth not only in the transition, but also in a post-apartheid South Africa.
