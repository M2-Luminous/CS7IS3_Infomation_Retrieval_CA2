Sixty-six springs, summers, autumns, and winters. Sixty-six years of wind and rain. Why is the People's Liberation Army, which has undergone various hardships and difficulties, always full of vigor and vitality? When you meet these crack troops you will sense their uniquely brilliant spirit. This spirit is the true color [ben se 2609 5331] of the old Red Army men and the fine traditions of our Armed Forces. It is precisely because they possess this spirit that our armed forces can overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles and can always march forward courageously. How Can Our Armed Forces Always Be Invincible in Times of Peace? One Thing in the Basic Experience Is: Maintaining the Fine Traditions. Peaceful cities. Warm and fragrant rural areas. The country is prosperous and at peace and the people live in happiness. Peace is the hope of the people. Did not numerous martyrs give up their lives precisely for peace today? Peace is not easy to come by and should be treasured. To the Armed Forces, peace is also a kind of test. Troops can be defeated in wars and they can also be defeated in a peaceful environment. In the past century, the Eight Banners Troops of the Qing Dynasty were once "as powerful as a thunderbolt and moved as speedily as the wind." However, in times of peace, they went downhill. Their former agility and bravery were replaced by boastfulness and weakness. Crack troops became people who indulged in playing with caged birds. Lessons should be drawn from history. How should our armed forces guard against corruption and degeneration under new historical conditions? An important question which has a bearing on the existence and survival and the rise and success of our armed forces is put before the leadership of the Military Commission. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has concerned himself very much with the building of our armed forces. On many occasions he earnestly asked the armed forces to carry forward the fine traditions and to maintain the natural color of the old Red Army men. On the eve of the 14th CPC National Congress, he again expressed this hope to the Armed Forces. It is true that the fine traditions of our Armed Forces, which give expression to the unique style and features of the People's Army, are the quintessence of the history of our Armed Forces. With such traditions, our Armed Forces were able to stand against powerful enemies in the years of war and to resist the "sugar-coated bullets" after they were garrisoned in cities and towns. Today, our Armed Forces can still depend on their fine traditions to stand the test in a peaceful environment and to always establish themselves in an unassailable position. The CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, have attached great importance to this exhortation by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Comrade Jiang Zemin generalized the fine traditions of our Armed Forces into 10 aspects and made systematic and profound expositions. He asked the whole Army to raise the education on fine traditions to a height in keeping with our times and to put it in a strategic position. After that, Comrades Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen also wrote the important article entitled: "Carrying Forward the Fine Traditions Is an Important Question of a Strategic Nature in the Building of Our Army in the New Situation." Immediately afterward, the General Political Department complied and issued some teaching materials entitled: "Carry Forward the Fine Traditions, Maintain the True Color of the Old Red Army." As a result, the education on fine traditions has become a common practice throughout the Army. A powerful spiritual motive force has thus been added to the strong and healthy body of our Armed Forces, making them even more vigorous. New Times, New Tasks--Only by Integrating the Fine Traditions With the Spirit of the Times Can They Add Radiance to One Another and Shine With Dazzling Splendor. The world is in a historical period of great changes. The reform, opening up, and economic construction in our country are entering a new stage of development. We are living in such times. New times, new tasks. Are fine traditions still useful at present? Fine traditions are faced with new challenges. Fine traditions can have great vitality only if the spirit of the times is added to them. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has advocated the "five kinds of revolutionary spirit" among the whole party and the entire Armed Forces. Comrade Jiang Zemin has also put forward the 64- character pioneering spirit. Fine traditions have been given a new connotation of the times and the spirit of the times has been infused into the quintessence of fine traditions. The organic integration of the two has produced a tremendous propelling force in the building of our Armed Forces. The first indication is: Leading bodies at all levels have become stronger and more effective in improving the party's work style and in promoting clean administration. Leading cadres at all levels have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Military Commission leadership, gradually understood the contents of the 10 aspects of the fine traditions of our Armed Forces, proceeded from upholding the party's absolute leadership over the Armed Forces and, upholding the goal of wholeheartedly serving the people, earnestly tried to solve existing problems in the use of cadres, the use of power, the building of clean administration, and the leadership work style, and conscientiously undergone the tests involving "power, money, and beautiful women." The second indication is: Grass-roots officers and soldiers have gradually established a correct outlook on life and a sense of value and the cohesive force of the Armed Forces has apparently increased. When "contrast between the Army and various localities" was a hot topic of discussion among the people, and some officers and soldiers had some doubts about the value of life, the education of fine traditions showed its unique might. The education on the outlook on life and the sense of value has been conducted throughout the Army in a lively and down-to-earth manner. Being faced with the achievements of revolutionary martyrs, the officers and solders have gradually tended to acquire a balance between individual interests and the interests of the revolution, conscientiously engaged in hard work, become willing to make contribution and sacrifice, and energetically made contributions to the modernization of our Armed Forces. The third indication is: The fulfillment of various tasks centering around military training has been enhanced and fighting capacity has markedly increased. The aim of the education on traditions is to increase the fighting capacity. All units of the Armed Forces have made efforts to enable the education on traditions to permeate various tasks centering around military training and to foster in the Armed Forces the revolutionary spirit of bearing hardships, doing hard work, fearing no difficulties, and a willingness to shed blood and make sacrifices. One all-powerful unit after another has left its barracks to temper itself in the vast open country, high mountains, thick forests, blue skies, boundless oceans, deserts, and snowy plains. Fine Traditions Are Not Genetic Factors and Are Not Automatically Inherited. The Valuable Thing Regarding Traditions Lies in "Passing On." The number of old comrades who have participated in war has become smaller and smaller. How can the fine traditions of our Armed Forces be passed on and carried forward from generation to generation? A comrade with much foresight made this wonderful remark: Fine traditions are not genetic factors in nature and are not automatically inherited. The valuable thing regarding traditions lies in "passing on." "Passing on" has become a figurative term in carrying forward fine traditions throughout the Army. Earnestly practice what one preaches -- "passing on." Answering the call of the Central Military Commission leadership, large numbers of old comrades who are still working or who have retired have come to give lectures on, and pass on, the traditions to young officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces. This is the most convincing education on traditions and is also the most effective way to pass on experience, give help, and set an example. This is a kind of gratifying natural replacement: The fine traditions of our Armed Forces, like relay batons, are being passed on from the hands of the old comrades into the hands of officers and soldiers of the new generation. "Passing on" through exerting a subtle influence on others. An outstanding characteristic in the education on traditions is to make use of visible and tangible rich historical material, concrete historical remains, and important cultural relics so that the officers and soldiers will be imperceptibly influenced by what they constantly see and hear and benefit by them. Because of this, all units of the Armed Forces have seriously grasped the construction of hardware for the education on traditions. One book after another has been written to be used as teaching material, one military history exhibition hall after another has been built, and one room of honor after another has been renovated in companies. This visible work has created an invisible atmosphere so that the fine traditions of our Armed Forces are found at all time and everywhere. They are like spring rains at night, silently moistening the hearts of the cadres and fighters and exerting a subtle influence on them. Constantly "passing on." What should be stressed in the education on traditions is to carry it out constantly. Many units have combined such education with routine work, carried out such education in good time in view of tendentious problems, and taken advantage of major festive activities to carry out such education. In each barracks, people can see that officers and soldiers often read books on fine traditions, sing songs about fine traditions, tell stories about fine traditions, and watch films and teleplays on fine traditions. Such incessant instillation has enabled the officers and soldiers to constantly deepen their understanding of fine traditions and to turn these traditions into conscious actions. Let the tree of fine traditions of our Armed Forces remain green forever.
