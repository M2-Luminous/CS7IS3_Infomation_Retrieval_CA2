(2) If any corrosion is detected that is outside the limits specified in the applicable service bulletin, prior to further flight, accomplish either paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this AD: (i) Replace any corroded distance piece with a new, improved distance piece (without pockets), and repair or replace the adjacent side plates, as necessary, in accordance with the applicable service bulletin.

(c) For those airplanes on which the distance piece has been reworked or repaired in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD: Within 90 days after the effective date of this AD or within the next 600 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs earlier, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 90 days or 600 hours time-in-service, whichever occurs earlier, repeat the inspection of the distance piece and adjacent side plates in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD.
