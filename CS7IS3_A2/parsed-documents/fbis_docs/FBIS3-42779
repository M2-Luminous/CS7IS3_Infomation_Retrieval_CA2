As is well known, there already are analogies of "special regimes," but the Makhachkala one in particular stipulates that citizens should "continuously have a passport with them, or some other document that identifies them, and present it at the request of workers of Internal Affairs organs," but that "citizens who are detained without identifying documents are subject to a fine in the amount of 10,000 rubles [R], and, if necessary, are put into a reception-transfer center and are kept there up to 10 days until identity is established." The decree of the city administration prescribes that "persons from other towns, who are in the city of Makhachkala without a purpose, will depart for their place of residence in 24 hours" under the threat of eviction from the city and a fine of R10,000. For driving motor vehicles in the city without a license, drivers are fined R100,000. During the first 10 days about 4,000 persons went through the "special regime" (the population of the city is approximately 360,000), and about half of them stayed in the duty room. Six hundred persons were fined, 128 persons were evicted from the city, and a substantial number of volunteers left for home by themselves. The amount of fines levied on the citizens for 10 days amounted to about R20 million. After the introduction of the special order, the number of recorded violations in the city increased, but they started to be exposed less frequently. When people who had arrived for personal or business reasons were detained without justification, the leadership of the GUVD [Main Administration of Internal Affairs] had to give assurances on local television that the "special order" was not a special regime, and that guests could come to the city freely. However, a decree of the administration gave heads of the organs of Internal Affairs of Makhachkala the right "to subject violators to administrative detention of up to 10 days," which contradicts the constitution, which permits arrest without a court order for a period of no more than 48 hours. The chief of the GUVD admitted that absolutely innocent citizens had run into cases of bribery of workers of law enforcement organs. A similar "special order" has now been introduced in the cities of Kaspiysk and Yuzhno-Sukhokumsk. In addition, another investigative commission from Moscow is working in Makhachkala. This time it came from the Procuracy of the Russian Federation on Ramazan Abdulatipov's announcement concerning the increase in crime in Dagestan. In particular, before the New Year a young person who had been convicted three times was arrested on suspicion in the murder of candidate for deputy to the Federation Council Bayramov in Kaspiysk. While being driven to the station, he blew himself up with a grenade and died. A judicial investigation was assigned. Commentaries on the affair concerning Bayramov's murder reported that he had been offered the position of minister if he removed his candidacy. Last week Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Dagestan Amirov declared that the series of attempts in Dagestan is associated not with clan fights but with the economic interests of those who are for the new or old system of economic management, while associating himself with those who support the reforms of the president and the Government of the Russian Federation. On 2 April 1993, 27 rounds from an assault rifle were fired at Amirov's official vehicle, one of which struck his spine, and the deputy chairman is still undergoing treatment. Amirov is the only one of the republic leaders who have declared the need for a Chamber of Nationalities in the new parliament of the republic, where equal representation of the peoples of the republic would be guaranteed. The existence of such a chamber would make it possible to balance the interests of the people of Dagestan and avoid an exacerbation of interethnic relations. At present, official circles are talking only about "taking into account" the fact of the many nationalities in the republic, but without guaranteeing any kind of legal personality of the people. The attempt on Amirov's life occurred in the evening of the day he declared in DAGESTANSKAYA PRAVDA the need for a representative of the people of the republic in parliament. A session of the Supreme Soviet of Dagestan is scheduled for the end of January, where a draft constitution and a draft law on elections will be examined in the new parliament of the republic.
