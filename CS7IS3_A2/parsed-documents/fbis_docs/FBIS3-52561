A statement issued by the NDG's Information Committee said that the Sudanese regime has not been content with imposing high taxes on the people to overcome its acute economic crisis. It has started to sell the Sudanese people's remaining vital utilities, such as the government's tannery and Sudanese Airways. The statement denounced the government's intention to sell the prisons in Omdurman, Kabar, and Port Sudan to complement its previous plans. The statement stressed that these utilities are public properties that should not be disposed of without the consent of the freely elected representatives of the people. The statement warned everyone against submitting tenders to buy these properties, stressing that the sale contracts would be null and void and that the ownership of these properties would revert to the Sudanese people once the regime is toppled.
