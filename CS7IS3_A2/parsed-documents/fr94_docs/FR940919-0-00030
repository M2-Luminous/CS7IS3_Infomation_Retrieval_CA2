ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is approving an April 18, 1994 State request for a site-specific revision to the Indiana sulfur dioxide State Implementation Plan (SO 2 SIP). This revision sets forth a schedule of SO 2 emission limitations applicable to Public Service Indiana's Gibson Generating Station (PSI Gibson) if the facility installs SO 2 emission controls. In the proposed rules section of this Federal Register, USEPA is proposing approval of and soliciting public comment on this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments are received on this direct final rule, USEPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in response to this final rule in a final rule on the related proposed rule which is being published in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register. DATES: This final rule will be effective November 18, 1994 unless an adverse comment is received by October 19, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction At the request of PSI Gibson, Indiana has revised the facility's SO 2 emission limits, which are codified by the State at 326 Indiana Administrative Code (326 IAC) 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1 (Gibson County Sulfur Dioxide Emission Limitations), and submitted this rule to USEPA as a site-specific SO 2 SIP revision. The revision provides the facility with two options for implementing SO 2 emission reduction measures that will ensure protection of the SO 2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The first emission reduction option in 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1 was approved as 326 IAC 7&hyph;1&hyph;19 by USEPA on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2112). This rulemaking action is based on USEPA's review of the emission limits in the second option. II. Background Indiana's SO 2 SIP for Gibson County, which is part of Title 326 of the Indiana Administrative Code (326 IAC), specifically 326 IAC 7&hyph;1&hyph;19, was approved by USEPA for incorporation into the SIP on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2112). It set forth a schedule of emission limitations for PSI Gibson whereby the facility's SO 2 emissions would decrease to protect the primary SO 2 NAAQS by December 31, 1991, and then over several years would decrease further to protect the secondary SO 2 standard. The facility was to comply with these emission limits by burning low sulfur coal in Units 1&hyph;4. The rule allowed PSI Gibson to consider alternate compliance strategies and request a set of alternate emission limits, if necessary. PSI Gibson was required to submit a plan to Indiana by December 31, 1988, detailing the compliance path it intended to follow. In 1988, PSI Gibson submitted a compliance plan to Indiana which requested an alternate emission limitation schedule. In this approach, PSI Gibson would install and operate a flue gas desulfurization system on Unit 4 to control SO 2 emissions. This alternate schedule would allow PSI Gibson to emit much less SO 2 from Unit 4 but slightly more SO 2 from Units 1&hyph;3 than is allowed under the existing SIP approved rule. On August 7, 1990, Indiana adopted a new SO 2 rule for Gibson County to incorporate PSI Gibson's compliance plan. Since PSI Gibson needed additional time to consider the cost-effectiveness of both compliance paths, Indiana's revision to 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1 included both the previously approved emission reduction schedule and the new plan's schedule, and provided that PSI Gibson must make a final choice of a compliance path by a specified date. PSI Gibson has chosen to comply with the emission limits in the second scenario. 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1 was originally submitted to USEPA as a site-specific SIP revision on July 22, 1991. Upon the State's June 29, 1993 request, USEPA deferred rulemaking on the July 22, 1991 submittal. On April 18, 1994, Indiana submitted to USEPA supplemental information pertaining to the modeled attainment demonstration and reactivated the SIP revision request. III. Emission Limitations The emission reduction schedules for PSI Gibson Units 1&hyph;5, which are set forth in 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1(b), are summarized below. All emission limits are in units of pounds SO 2 per million British Thermal Units (lb/MMBTU). The emission reduction schedule in 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1(b)(1), shown in the first column below, contains the same limits and deadlines as those set forth in 326 IAC 7&hyph;1&hyph;19 and approved by USEPA on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2112). PSI Gibson would use low sulfur coal in Units 1&hyph;4 to comply with the limits in this scenario. The second column below presents the new emission limits in the April 18, 1994 site-specific SIP submission. These limits are codified in Indiana's rules as 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1(b)(2). PSI Gibson must install a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system on Unit 4 and use low sulfur coal in Units 1&hyph;3 to comply under this scenario. The limits in the first column have already been approved by USEPA. The emission limitation schedule in the second column does not automatically replace the existing schedule; rather, the two scenarios currently reside in Indiana's rules as a choice of compliance procedures for PSI Gibson. Note that the two emission reduction schedules are identical except for the emission limits PSI Gibson's Units 1&hyph;4 must meet by December 31, 1995.
