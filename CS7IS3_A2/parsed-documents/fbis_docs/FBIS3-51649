Members of the opposition charge the issue of extending the deputies' term prompted a delay in the adjournment of the congressional sessions, but independent deputies claim the one has nothing to do with the other. [Begin unidentified independent deputy recording] The adjournment of the congressional sessions, or a continuation of the sessions during a special period, have absolutely nothing to do with an extension of the deputies' term or their immediate re-election. We were emphatic about this, and those of us who participated in a political dialogue between Social Christians, conservatives, and independents said we will never discuss a transition period that may extend current deputies' term or lead to their immediate re-election --nothing that might benefit current individual deputies will be approved. [end recording] The new majority seems to have scattered and constitutional reforms have been abolished for the time being. If the special period of sessions ends without discussing the reforms, they will be discussed on another occasion, starting from the beginning.
