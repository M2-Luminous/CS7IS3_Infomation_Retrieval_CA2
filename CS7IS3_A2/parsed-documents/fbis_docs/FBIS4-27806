Committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi announced he will go along with opposition demands that Masahisa Naito, former head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Industrial Policy Bureau, appear before the panel on Monday to explain why he was sacked by MITI Minister Kumagai. Kumagai reportedly fired Naito for his alleged favoritism in personnel matters within MITI. The demands by the two largest opposition parties -- the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) -- stalled Diet proceedings, and the ruling minority coalition finally relented. During the budget panel's Thursday morning session, LDP lawmaker Kiyoshi Mizuno blasted Kumagai, currently chief cabinet secretary, for his alleged conspiracy to get rid of Naito by distributing defamatory pamphlets critical of Naito.
