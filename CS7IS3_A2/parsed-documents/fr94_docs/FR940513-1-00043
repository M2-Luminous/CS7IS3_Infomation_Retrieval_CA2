FR940513-1-00043 FR940513-1-00011 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;8] Proposed Establishment of Class E Airspace; Thomaston, GA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway 30 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Thomaston-Upson County Airport has recently been developed. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth is needed for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations when utilizing this SIAP. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the developed SIAP. If approved, the operating status of the airport would change from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;8, Manager, System Management Branch, ASO&hyph;530, P.O.

The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the NDB Runway 30 SIAP to serve the Thomaston-Upson County Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective September 16, 1993 which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1 effective September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. If approved, the operating status of the airport would be changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
