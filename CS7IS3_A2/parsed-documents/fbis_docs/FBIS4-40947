Greeting the spiritual leaders of most of Christian churches and religious associations that traditionally exist in CIS and Baltic countries, the president pointed out that their "aspiration to find ways for the Christians' full-scale participation in overcoming human animosity in the post-Soviet space" is close and understandable to him. "Over long years of militant atheism, the souls of many people have become depleted and have grown hard, harbouring indifference and hatred. All that is a nutrient medium for social and inter-ethnic conflicts, extremism in politics, tension in society". Yeltsin expressed the conviction that "the involvement of Christian communities of various confessions in the constructive peace-making processes will be of great benefit. Religious leaders can stay the hand of a killer by force of wise words and by virtue of their moral prestige, help people to start dialogue and convince them of necessity to return to peace and mutual understanding". "I believe that you will pool your efforts and will actively promote the advancement of the peoples of the newly independent states towards accord and cooperation in the spirit of freedom, mutual tolerance and well-wishing. "I will continue to support the joint peace-making efforts of CIS and Baltic Christians and your cooperation with the believers of other religions and non-religious people in common concern for the well-being of our states," the message said.
