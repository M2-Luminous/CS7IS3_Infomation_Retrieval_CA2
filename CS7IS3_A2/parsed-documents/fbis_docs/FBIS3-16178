"This month, we have found ourselves in a new situation, when many countries, such as Poland, the United States, Great Britain, Sweden, and the Czech Republic, expressed their readiness to sell us arms. Of course it is in the interests of the government to resolve this matter sooner," said the prime minister at a press conference, at which government representatives were reporting on their visit to Israel. The main condition for the arms purchase from Israel would be a proposal of a long-term (at least 12 years) credit. V. Birkavs did not want to mention a specific sum and percentage for the credit, but, due to his estimations, the sum would not surpass half the Estonian credit. As DIENA already reported, it is $56 million, therefore the Latvian credit would amount to no more than $28 million. According to V. Birkavs, Latvia is interested in antitank weapons, communication equipment for the police, and border control systems. The Minister of Home Affairs, Girts Pavlovskis, and the Commander of the Defense Forces, Dainis Turlais, have visited a few factories manufacturing arms. G. Kristovskis said that he was quite impressed. On Monday [7 March], a meeting of the leaders of the three Baltic states and the Nordic states will take place in Stockholm. V. Birkavs will consult with Mart Laar and Adolf Slezevicius on the common Baltic borders protection system with modern technology, and also problems of border security will be discussed. "And yet, this is not only a problem of security, but also of advantage," said V. Birkavs. The cost of the technical equipment could be considerably lower, if it would be purchased in larger quantity. All Baltic states have the common goal of joining NATO, therefore it would be convenient to buy similar arms and border protection systems, he pointed out.
