FR940817-2-00146 FR940817-2-00080 It is represented that the impact of the change in fee structures, described in paragraph 9 above, on aggregate fees received by the Bank is difficult to determine, because various factors and variables are unique to each Plan. These factors include the size of the Plan, the extent to which Plan assets are invested in the Funds, and the application of certain ``break points'' in the schedule of Plan-level fees. Further, Fund size and the application of certain ``break points'' in the rate schedule of Fund-level fees, the identity of the particular investment portfolio of the Fund into which the Plan assets are allocated, and voluntary waivers by the Bank of Fund-level fees are likely to be different in each situation and may affect the aggregate amount of fees received by the Bank. In this regard, it is represented that the combined total of all Plan-level and Fund-level fees received by the Bank for the provision of services to the Plans and to the Funds, respectively, are not in excess of ``reasonable compensation'' within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act. 12. The exemption is subject to satisfaction of certain general conditions. Chief among such conditions is the requirement that the proposed transactions are subject to the prior authorization of a Second Fiduciary, acting on behalf of each of the Plans, who has been provided with full written disclosure by the Bank. It is represented that the Second Fiduciary will generally be the administrator, sponsor, or a committee appointed by the sponsor to act as a named fiduciary for a Plan. With respect to disclosure, the Second Fiduciary of such Plan will receive in writing in advance of the investment by a Plan in any of the Funds: (1) a current prospectus for each portfolio of each of the Funds in which such Plan may invest, (2) a statement describing the investment management fees, investment advisory fees, or similar fees, any fees for Secondary Services, and all other fees to be charged to or paid by the Plan and by such Funds to the Bank, including the nature and extent of any differential between the rates of such fees, (3) the reasons why the Bank may consider such investment(s) to be appropriate for the Plan, (4) a statement describing whether there are any limitations applicable to the Bank with respect to which assets of a Plan may be invested in the Funds, and, if so, the nature of such limitations, and (5) upon request of the Second Fiduciary a copy of the proposed exemption and/or the final exemption, if granted. In addition to the disclosures provided to the Plan prior to investment in any of the Funds, the Bank represents that it will routinely provide at least annually to the Second Fiduciary updated prospectuses of the Funds in accordance with the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the SEC rules promulgated thereunder. Further, the Second Fiduciary will be supplied, upon request, with a report or statement (which may take the form of the most recent financial report of such Funds, the current statement of additional information, or some other written statement) which contains a description of all fees paid by the Fund. It is represented that the Bank does not now execute nor in the future intend to execute securities brokerage transactions for the investment portfolios of any of the Funds, except as and to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940 and applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the event the Bank ever performs brokerage services for which a fee is paid to the Bank by the investment portfolio of any of the Funds, the Bank represents that it will at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service provide a written notice which explains the nature of such additional brokerage service and the amount of the fees. Further, the Bank represents that it will provide at least annually to the Second fiduciary of any Plan that invests in such Funds with a written disclosure indicating (a) the total, expressed in dollars, of brokerage commissions of each Fund's investment portfolio that are paid to the Bank by such Fund; (b) the total, expressed in dollars, of brokerage commissions of each Fund's investment portfolio that are paid by such Fund to brokerage firms unrelated to the Bank; (c) the average brokerage commissions per share, expressed as cents per share, paid to the Bank by each portfolio of a Fund; and (d) the average brokerage commissions per share, expressed as cents per share, paid by each portfolio of a Fund to brokerage firms unrelated to the Bank. On the basis of the information disclosed, it is represented that the Second Fiduciary will authorize in writing (i) the investment of assets of the Plans in shares of the Fund in connection with the transactions set forth herein; (ii) the investment portfolios of the Funds in which the assets of the Plans may be invested; and (iii) the compensation received by the Bank in connection with its services to the Funds. It is represented that written authorization will extend to only those investment portfolios of the Funds with respect to which the Second Fiduciary has received the written disclosures referred to above and which are specifically mentioned in such authorization. Having obtained the authorization of the Second Fiduciary, the Bank will be permitted to invest the assets of a Plan among the portfolios and in the manner covered by the authorization, subject to satisfaction of the other terms and conditions of this proposed exemption. However, the Bank will not be permitted to invest assets of a Plan in any portfolio not specifically mentioned in the written authorization. For example, if the written authorization of the Second Fiduciary covered only three of six portfolios then existing, the Bank could only invest the assets of such Plans in those three portfolios specifically authorized. Further, if a new portfolio were established under any of the Funds, the Bank could invest assets of a Plan in such new portfolio only after providing the required disclosures and obtaining from the Second Fiduciary a separate written authorization which specifically mentions the new portfolio. 13. The receipt of fees, as described above, are generated in connection with the investment in the Funds by the Plans. These investments are the result of purchases of shares in the Funds and exchanges of assets of the Plans, including those in CIFs, for shares in the Funds. It is represented: (1) that Plans and other investors will purchases or sell shares in the Funds in accordance with standard procedures described in the prospectus for each portfolio of the Funds; (2) that the Plans will pay no sales commissions or redemption fees in connection with purchase or sales of shares in the Funds by the Plans; (3) that the Bank will not purchase from or sell to any of the Plans shares of any of the Funds; and (4) the price paid or received by the Plans for shares of the Funds will be the net asset value per share at the time of such purchase or sale and will be the same price as any other investor would have paid or received at that time. 11 11 In this regard, it is represented that the value of HighMark's shares and the value of each of HighMark's portfolios are determined on a daily basis. In the case of the Non-Money Market Portfolios, assets are valued at fair or market value, as required by Rule 2a-4 under the Investment Company Act. In the case of the Money Market Portfolios, the assets are valued based on the amortized cost method authorized by SEC Rule 2a-7, in order to maintain net asset value at $1.00 per share. Both the Money Market Portfolios and the Non-Money Market Portfolios determine the net asset value per share for purposes of pricing purchases and sales by dividing the value of all securities, determined by a method as set forth in the prospectus for each HighMark portfolio, and other assets belonging to each of the portfolios, less the liabilities charged to each portfolio, by the number of each portfolio's outstanding shares. 14. Purchases and sales of shares in any of the Funds by the Plans may also occur in connection with daily automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements. However, agreement to such arrangement is not a condition for the Plan otherwise choosing to invest in shares of the Fund, nor will the reverse be required. It is represented that at the time the application was filed, all of the Plans served by the Bank had elected to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements with HighMark. Further, it is represented that the ``sweep'' procedures, as described below with respect to HighMark, will remain in effect under the proposed exemption for any of the Funds.
