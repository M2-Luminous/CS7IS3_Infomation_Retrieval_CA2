FR940216-1-00020 FR940216-1-00008 A new paragraph (p) would be added to provide for the prosecution of a failure to display an authorizing document when it is required by the document to do so. A new paragraph (q) would prohibit ``outfitting or guiding'' on the National Forest System without a special use authorization or in violation of Federal or State law. This proposal was probably the addition most widely requested by the Forest Service regions. Considerable problems have existed in the enforcement of the requirement that outfitting and guiding be conducted under special use authorization due to the lack of a definition for the two activities. The approach taken in the proposed rule is to define ``outfitting and guiding'' at 36 CFR 261.2 and then to prohibit these activities without a special use authorization at 36 CFR 261.10. A new paragraph (r) would be added to prohibit the undertaking of any activity in violation of the requirements of a scenic easement. This is a companion rule to the proposed 36 CFR 261.9(i) and is being promulgated for the same reasons outlined in that paragraph. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.11␣Sanitation Existing paragraph (b) would be revised to establish a general prohibition against litering. The current text provides that a Forest officer may take action only against persons who leave ``litter in an exposed or unsanitary condition.'' This has proven insufficient to protect the National Forest System from littering. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.12␣Forest Development Roads and Trails Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to add the terms ``contract'' and ``approved plan of operations'' to the list of authorizing documents, correcting an unintentional omission. A new paragraph (e) is proposed to establish a rule prohibiting the operation of a vehicle in violation of State laws, posted signs, or traffic devices. Although local authorities are relied on, when possible, to enforce traffic regulations, there are many times when it is not possible or practical to obtain their help, making Forest Service enforcement necessary. For example, reckless driving is a matter that needs immediate action when it is spotted by a trained and properly equipped Forest officer to ensure safe travel for other road users. Since State laws are applicable to Forest development roads, they could be enforced by Forest officers, when necessary, through adoption of this proposed prohibition. The language proposed for new paragraph (f) currently appears at 36 CFR 261.54(f), which prohibits ``operating a vehicle carelessly, recklessly, *␣*␣* or in a manner or at a speed that would endanger or be likely to endanger any person or property.'' The paragraph would be removed from subpart B, amended to clarify this is a strict liability offense, and made a part of subpart A. A new paragraph (g) would require the use of seatbelts, if provided by the manufacturer, for occupants of vehicles traveling on Forest development roads. The prohibition would support State laws which require the same, while ensuring safety and consistency by relying on a single rule that would apply throughout the National Forest System. Seatbelt laws vary from State to State. For example, some states exempt the passengers of certain classes of vehicles from mandatory seatbelt usage, while others, exempt certain passengers. In many areas on the National Forest System, a Forest development road can cross State boundaries. In these situations, reliance on some State seatbelt statutes could lead to inconsistency and confusion. This provision will ensure the protection afforded by seatbelts throughout the National Forest System regardless of individual State laws. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.13␣Use of Vehicles Off Roads Several changes are proposed to this section. Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to clarify the current ``valid license'' requirement by referring to a ``valid operator's license or permit,'' if required by State law. Existing paragraph (e) would be removed as the prohibition is included in the proposal for §261.4(e). Existing paragraph (f) would remain unchanged but redesignated as (e). Existing paragraph (g) would be revised and redesignated as (f). The paragraph would contain the same language as proposed for 36 CFR 261.12(f). The revision, as proposed for this section, would provide a consistent approach in the treatment of careless and reckless driving throughout the National Forest System. Existing paragraph (h) would be revised and redesignated as (g). The revision would better define the current prohibition of operating a vehicle that disturbs the land or other resources. Existing paragraph (i) would remain unchanged but redesignated as (h). One additional provision is proposed for this section. Many States have passed special registration requirements for off-road vehicles. In support of these requirements, a new paragraph (i) is proposed to prohibit the operation of a vehicle without displaying a license plate or the proper registration, if it is required by State law. Section 261.14␣Developed Recreation Sites One change is proposed to this section. A new paragraph (r) would be added to prohibit the informal reservation or ``staking-out'' of camping units by third parties. Unless campsites are specifically designated for advanced reservations, they are intended to be occupied on a first-come, first-served basis. The ``staking out'' of campsites has become a continuing problem as recreational use of National Forest System lands increases and is one that visitors often bring to the attention of Forest officers for resolution.
