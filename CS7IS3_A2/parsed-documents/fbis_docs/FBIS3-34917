The U.S. delegation's visit at this time has particular political connotations because it coincides with the resumption of the talks between Lebanon and "Israel."

Other reports have stated that a U.S. delegation visited the "occupied zone" a few days ago. This is a signal that the current bilateral talks in Washington have begun to discuss the details after drawing up the outlines of the agreement between Lebanon and "Israel." The same source said U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley, who formed a new political and media team when he assumed his duties in Beirut, personally asked for the large U.S. delegation to come to Beirut and stay at the U.S. Embassy for a few days far from the limelight to help prepare the U.S. Embassy's plan of action and give "advice" to Lebanese officials on how to deal with anticipated developments. The political source has monitored [rasada] U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley recently intensifying his contacts and meetings with the Lebanese officials within the framework of following up the bilateral talks in Washington. According to the same political source, this month or next at most will witness the "ceremony" of the signing of the declaration of principles between Lebanon and "Israel." The large U.S. delegation has carried this information from the U.S. Administration in Washington. The political source noted that a U.S. military helicopter has recently been making frequent trips between the U.S. Embassy in 'Awkar and Cyprus carrying U.S. military and political officials each time.
