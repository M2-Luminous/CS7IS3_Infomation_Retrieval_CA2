The ten projects on the drawing board or under construction include a third bridge over the Qiantang River, an expressway around the city, two highway passenger stations, the expansion of the road to Xinanjiang city, the expressway to Shanghai and Ningbo, and the dredging of the grand canal. Though the city's economy has been growing rapidly, city officials said, the ancient city's antiquated traffic networks had been imposing an adverse effect on the development of its tourism and other economic sectors. This explains why the traffic sector has 10 of the 17 major projects on the city government's top agenda from 1993 to the year 2000. The officials said the 2.3 billion yuan fund for these projects would be raised by many means besides government investment. For example, they said, the expressway around the city would be built using three million U.S. dollars and four million yuan from a Hong Kong company. By leasing a piece of land to overseas banking groups, the city acquired 225 million yuan for the building of the Qiantang Bridge. According to the officials, four of the projects, including the bridge, the highway to Xinanjiang and others, will be built and managed by independent commercial companies. Most of these projects are now under way, and the rest will begin soon, the officials added.
