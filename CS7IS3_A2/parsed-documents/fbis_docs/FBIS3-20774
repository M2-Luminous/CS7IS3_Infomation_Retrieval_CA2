Vankova: "The Successful Ones Will Break the Ice"] [Text] According to a Privatization Agency announcement, the ice will finally be broken a month from now, when the privatization of some 20 chosen companies begins in conformity with the Law on Transformation of Companies With State Capital. This signifies the realization of the so-called pilot program, an important and valued agency activity in which the transformation of the chosen companies will be conducted and managed by its experts. In a number of companies foreign technical aid from EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] will be involved, with the inclusion of international experts who will assist in a number of the activities for the pilot transformations. Using the positive experiences from pilot privatizations carried out in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and with guidance from the consultants "Coopers & Lybrand," the agency will use the pilot privatization in 20 companies with the aim of testing the practical application of the law, and it will draw up regulations and rules for a smoother implementation of the transformations and simpler solutions to the practical problems that arise. The basic intention, as a matter of fact, in realizing this complex program, is to serve as a kind of school for the companies, which are apparently cautious and inhibited in starting this important process. Successful Companies With the aim of completing the pilot programs as soon as possible, that is, to privatize these 20 companies by the beginning of the second half of this year, the agency will start selecting the more successful companies. Those will primarily be companies with positive results, not very dependent on the current blockades in the Macedonian economy. Special attention will also be paid to keeping, if possible, 50 percent of the capital in the hands of the state; the companies should not have problems in proving the ownership over the buildings and equipment; they will have a defined position on the market, and the developing programs will have particular influence on them. In making the selection, a special effort will be made to choose companies that are more likely to complete the transformation successfully, bearing in mind their initial views on the appropriate means of transformation. These criteria will be tested in questionnaires in which the interested companies will have to present a lot of information on all aspects of the situation they are in, including those of interest to foreign investors and for the protection of the environment. According to the assistant manager of the Privatization Agency Olga Mihajlovska Tikvarovska, pilot privatization will be carried out in companies that are starting this process for the first time, but also in some that began their transformation according to the old regulations, in which the Social Accounting Control finished its work. Small, medium, and large companies will be included, to provide testing for different models of transformation as defined by the law. Foreign Investors The advantages to the companies included in the pilot programs, to be announced two weeks from now, are great. They will overcome all the difficulties on the way to privatization less painfully, with the professional help of the agency and the international experts. In some, the agency will enter into a partial or full sale to foreign investors. Opportunities for foreign capital entry are seen through the cooperation of those who provide technical aid, which will help to promote the chosen companies to the international economic and investing public. It certainly signifies an improvement in their negotiating position in discussions with foreign parties interested in investing in definite cases of privatization. The procedures throughout the phases of pilot privatization will be continuously elaborated and presented to the public, thus making the dilemmas and problems clarified in the application of the legal solutions accessible to all companies planning to start transformation. How much the pilot privatizations will contribute to breaking the apparent reputation among companies about this fatal process will be seen only after the "landing of the pilots." Moreover, there are problems that are much more complicated and not easily solved that the companies will in the end have to face themselves.
