Republican Senator Hank Brown asked: What kind of policy disappoints all the parties and makes everyone America's enemy? He did not stop there. Moving a little further, he reminded the assistant secretary of the old saying that sometimes, depending on the situation, it is better to keep quiet. Valuable advice indeed, although it is easy to see that it is just as difficult for a member of Congress to heed this advise as it is for a government spokesman. Even the head of the administration that Robin Raphel represents does not think it is necessary to be cautious. He freely expresses whatever comes into his mind, sometimes even in writing. Given this situation, why should a bureaucrat like Mrs. Raphel restrain herself when making statements? Mr. Brown's advice to Mrs. Raphel to bridle her statements came in the context of her 26 October remarks on Kashmir. Undoubtedly, it was not a casual statement. Rather, subsequent government statements and behavior have made it clear that the new U.S. Administration wants to pursue a tougher policy toward India. It was because of his weakness for India that Daniel Patrick Moynihan, despite being a Democrat, opted to criticize Mrs. Raphel and the present Democratic administration. Moynihan's upcoming visit to India is said to be of special significance to both Washington and New Delhi. This is natural, but the question is whether former Ambassador Moynihan can assure India during his visit that the United States will stop playing the game of persistently harassing India. There is no question that the Bush administration's stand -- that a solution to the Kashmir problem should be found under the Simla Agreement; that is, through bilateral negotiations between India and Pakistan -- has been abandoned. The impression is taking hold that Washington wants to place greater importance on the fictitious or exaggerated stories of human rights violations by Indian troops in Kashmir, while ignoring Pakistani support for terrorism and playing down the grisly acts being committed by terrorists throughout the Kashmir Valley. It may be of no interest in Washington whether or not New Delhi likes the declaration that the United States wants to view India and Pakistan from the same perspective on issue of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It is natural not to consider external opinions when formulating a country's policy. One should wonder, however, if India is perturbed by the excessive interest being shown by the present U.S. Administration in releasing Islamabad from the purview of the Pressler Amendment. The U.S. Administration's attempts to do away with the Pressler Amendment have been temporarily abandoned. It is no secret, however, that this was not for lack of trying. The move was shelved after the extent of Congressional opposition became clear. Political experts do not hesitate to make substantial sacrifices whenever they face danger, although they are never sincere in making such sacrifices. It is difficult to say what objective will be achieved by placing India and Pakistan on the same level. This is better known by Robin Raphel, Lynne Davis, and others. The U.S. Administration's eagerness to abrogate the Pressler Amendment, though, makes us fear that the pro-Pakistan advisers scattered throughout the U.S. Administration are trying to find ways to satisfy Pakistan's appetite for arms. Perhaps this fear is unfounded, or perhaps the U.S. Administration has realized its folly; how the whole region was disrupted in the past when Pakistan was armed against the invasion of communism. But is South Asia that lucky? The person who has the experience of past suffering will naturally be alarmed by the slightest indication of danger.
