Ujevic; place and date not given: "`I am the Assembly Chairman'"] [Text] After the Chamber of Representatives elected Dr. Nedjeljko Mihanovic as the new Assembly chairman with 74 votes, we asked Stjepan Mesic to give us a short comment on the decision. [Ujevic] Mr. Mesic, do you still consider yourself to be the Assembly chairman? [Mesic] Yes. The Assembly chairman cannot be replaced at illegal sessions, regardless of the Rules of Procedure and the Constitution. Ultimately, that would mean that the Assembly chairman could be relieved of his duties by any group of representatives whenever they wanted to, or by any club of representatives. [Ujevic] You will therefore treat this Chamber of Representatives session as that of the club of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] representatives? [Mesic] Yes, precisely, although the whole thing did have a certain form. However, as it all happened while I was in the Assembly building, the decision is illegal. [Ujevic] What could be the repercussions of this situation? You obviously do not consider this issue closed. [Mesic] I do not know what the consequences could be, but I am Assembly chairman until the new chairman is legally elected. [Ujevic] Will you continue to act as the Assembly chairman? [Mesic] Of course, how else? [Ujevic] Does that mean that you could approach Dr. Nedjeljko Mihanovic and ask him to leave the position and let you take over? [Mesic] If I convene a session, then I am the legitimate chairman. [Ujevic] What if you are asked to move out of the Assembly chairman's room? [Mesic] You mean, if I am evicted? Who would do that, Nedjeljko Mihanovic?
