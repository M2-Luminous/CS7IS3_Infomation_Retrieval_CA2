If, for any reason, the influence of the United States abated, the entire Europe would be, according to them, in a security vacuum, and only the Western European Union led by Germany could assume the initiative. Diplomats and military experts believe, however, that this organization is not a sufficient counter force to the military power of Russia. Moreover, the German concept of European security might lead to the transformation of the region of Central and Eastern Europe to the sphere of economic, cultural, and eventually also political influence of the FRG. Nevertheless, the experts, who prepared the documentation for the government analysis of the security situation, expect that the security of Europe will continue to be guaranteed, above all, by the North Atlantic Alliance. The security system in Europe will be, according to them, with the highest probability connected with the U.S. concept of the European and world security. The analysis allows for only a marginal probability that the world could again become bipolar. This could occur only if the democratic development in Russia slowed down or turned around and, at the same time, NATO could not be transformed. "The security of Central European countries would thus become for the North Atlantic Alliance, from the point of its own security interest, irrelevant," the experts claim. The possibility that the development in Europe could be significantly affected by the power aspirations of Russia is, according to them, not likely. Another of the not very likely alternatives mentioned in the analysis could occur if the great powers -- the United States, Germany, Great Britain, and Russia -- agreed on a system of balance of power and interests on the European continent. Under these circumstances, the small countries would be eliminated from the decision-making process, and their future would depend on the situation worldwide.
