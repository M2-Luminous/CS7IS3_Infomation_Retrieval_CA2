FBIS4-35495 "drnes105_r_94004" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 28 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA India Papers Condemn U.S. Diplomat's Remarks on Missile Papers Condemn U.S. Diplomat's Remarks on Missile Comments Termed `Interference' BK3005140294 Delhi DAINIK JAGRAN in Hindi 28 May 94 p 6 BK3005140294 Delhi DAINIK JAGRAN Hindi BFN [Editorial: "Policy of Pressure"] [Text] India should not react immediately to the statement by U.S. Ambassador-designate to India Frank Wisner about missiles and especially the Prithvi missile program. This is because his statement means that the United States has been interfering in the program and that it does not favor the development of Prithvi by India within the Indian army. The question here is whether the Indian defense program is dependent on the mercy, grace, or whims of the United States or has the Indian Government given the United States the right to interfere directly in the Indian defense program. It is definitely not justified for an individual who has been nominated as the U.S. envoy to India to comment about Prithvi missiles. Frank Wisner may not have even reached Delhi but his interference has already begun. When this gentleman arrives, God only knows what he will do. Of course, this can be gauged easily. It should not be forgotten here that the United States has been sending many such officials to India whose main objective has been to interfere in its internal affairs. India should not tolerate this at any cost. It is unfortunate that the designated U.S. envoy to India, Frank Wisner, commented on the Indian missile program at a time when it looked as if Indo-U.S. ties were swiftly improving again. Such a statement by a senior U.S. diplomat immediately after Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's successful U.S. tour is astonishing. On the one hand, U.S. President Bill Clinton has openly declared that he did not want to interfere in any way in the defense affairs of India and that it is for the Indian Government to decide what was good or bad for its own defense. On the other hand, the way the man designated to become the U.S. envoy to India has been making comments about India's defense program smacks of a threat. Definitely, Wisner's comments have been made under a "policy of pressure," and the Indian Government must protest against this "policy of pressure." As far as the missile program is concerned, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has already given his assurances to Parliament. He also reiterated this when he was in the U.S., that there was no U.S. interference in the defense programs of India and that the United States has not adopted any policy of pressure. But the way Frank Wisner has decided to follow the path of the "policy of pressure," even before coming to India, is distressing. After all, both men cannot be right. Either the prime minister is right -- that there is no pressure from U.S. regarding the defense programs, especially in regard to Prithvi missiles, or Frank Wisner is, who plainly wants to put pressure on India that it should not deliver the Prithvi, developed by Indian scientists for the Indian army. At the moment, the only the question concerns Prithvi missiles being handed to the army. Yet, the United States has already started displaying a threatening posture. When Agni missiles are deployed, what would the attitude be then? The Agni missiles are unquestionably much more devastating and important than the Prithvi. Only the United States knows what its intentions are, but on the basis of what has appeared after Frank Wisner's remarks, one can safely say that the U.S. has not completely given up its policy of pressuring India. The criticism of the main opposition parties cannot be termed as unjust in the least. CPIM's [Communist Party of India -- Marxist] reaction is quite right, that the United States wants to continue its policy of pressure. Like the CPIM, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has also criticized Frank Wisner's statement. Therefore, it would be justified for India to express its views on Wisner's comments and declare that the Prithvi and Agni missile programs would continue and the decision taken to deploy Prithvi with the Indian army would not be changed in any way.
