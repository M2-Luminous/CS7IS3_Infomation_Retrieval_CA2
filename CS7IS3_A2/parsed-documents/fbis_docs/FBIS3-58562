Many public servants were detained when they attempted to protest the government for not recognizing their union rights and increasing their salaries very little. The police roughed up some of the demonstrators, and the scene was aired by a private TV channel the same day. In a press conference, Aktuna said security forces who were on duty all over the country had their lives at stake in every instance and these were people who were conscious of their job. However, he said, they did not approve of the attitude of the security forces during the demonstrations. "The importance, seriousness and weight of their duty do not justify their sadistic and primitive behavior against our people," he said. "The government will make it sure that such behavior will not be repeated," he said.
