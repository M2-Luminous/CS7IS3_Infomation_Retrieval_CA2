I suppose that the public's opinion on democracy, parliamentarism, and pluralism is also very important. It is no secret that opponents of democratic development are trying to persuade society to accept the ideas of "a firm hand," "order," and so on, by pointing to parliamentary discussions and uncultured attacks of one party against another. For obvious reasons, it is not difficult to do this in our current situation. The current opponents, who previously held power, are particularly angry and impertinent. One can understand them: Their greatest desire is to return to power as soon as possible, and the current majority, that is, the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], is their "number-one enemy".... It is more difficult to understand the relations, particularly recent ones, between the LDDP and the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party [LSDP]. Our supporters are calling and asking us what happened to make the two parties so hostile toward one another recently. Certainly, given the latest LSDP press conferences and its leader A. Sakalas' special trip to the Socialist International with the aim of lodging complaints against the LDDP and preventing its admission to this organization, such questions are only natural. We say nothing about the Social Democrats' pitifully ridiculous interpellation to the government and their weekly LIETUVOS ZINIOS [News of Lithuania] permeated with LDDP criticism, which, incidentally, has not published an LDDP opinion even once, while TIESA has done this quite often. I will begin from LDDP's attitude toward the Social Democrats. Our attitude toward the LSDP and its activities has been positive since the very beginning. We remember how both factions often voted together or held similar positions in the former Supreme Council, particularly when we had to defend democracy and common sense. Both parties expressed the same views on and contributed most to the May 1992 referendum by speaking out against greater powers for the former parliament leader [Landsbergis], as well as the same opinion on the constitutional process. As we remember, the 1992 elections to the Seimas [parliament] were not very successful for the LSDP. Shortly thereafter, the LSDP leadership refused to cooperate with the LDDP government or form a coalition. The Social Democrats, liberals, and centrists must have feared the rightists' accusations of "collaboration" with the LDDP government.... Despite such a position, the LDDP faction voted for LSDP leader A. Sakalas when electing the Seimas deputy chairman, and later appointed him head of the Lithuanian delegation to the European Council Parliamentary Assembly. This does not mean that the LDDP is demanding some unusual loyalty from the Social Democrats. I think, however, that we could expect normal relations. One cannot say that the Social Democratic opposition is as destructive as that of the right-wing parties which, in general, are continuing the election campaign and organizing strikes, rallies, pickets, and so on. The Social Democrats, and, maybe, the liberals and centrists, are trying to uphold a more civilized spirit of political discussion. This is very important, because the destructive policy of the right-wing opposition could make Lithuania's political life absurd and completely discredit parliamentarism and the shoots of democracy. However, one cannot help noticing the LSDP nervous reaction to LDDP attempts to become a member of the Socialist International. What is this: Provincialism, the fear of competition, or the inferiority complex of a smaller party? In my opinion, we should not compete for membership in this prestigious international organization. One of the key principles of the Socialist International is the solidarity of leftist forces. [passage omitted] In some post-communist countries of Europe, for example, in Poland and Slovakia, social democratic and leftist parties overcame this syndrome of provincialism long ago, and they can cooperate and form coalitions. The LDDP and LSDP membership in, as well as prestige and influence on international organizations will depend on their actual political weight in the legislature rather than on international party intrigues and the extrapolation of our provincial relations to Europe. Currently, the LDDP is cooperating, exchanging delegations and experience, and consulting with social democratic and leftist parties in France, Britain, Poland, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Germany, as well as in Scandinavia and the Baltic states. We participate in the work of the European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity (one of the divisions in the Socialist International), women's and youth organizations, and foundations. Our membership in one or another organization will depend on the majority's opinion rather than on that of individual leaders. Certainly, while talking with leaders of some European party, it is not pleasant to learn that our colleagues from another Lithuanian party have already tried to impart an unfavorable opinion of the LDDP.
