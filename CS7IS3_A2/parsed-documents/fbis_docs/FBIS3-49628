Arpad Goncz considers it important that all those states which make efforts for the assertion of democracy, market economy, and human rights should be allowed to join the Partnership for Peace program. The president of the Hungarian Republic spoke at a working lunch in Prague, attended by the leaders of the United States and Visegrad countries. The head of state also pointed out that neither Russia, Ukraine, or any other state of the region can be excluded from the European security systems. According to Arpad Goncz, President Bill Clinton's talks in Prague prove that the United States continues to be committed to Europe and the democracies of the Visegrad Group.
