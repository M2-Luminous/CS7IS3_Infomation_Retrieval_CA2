On Wednesday, 26 January, viewers of Rossiya Channel were able to see a program presented by the new television company Oblik--"Off Guard, or Newspaper Stories." The cofounders of Oblik along with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA were the independent television company REN-TV and Tatyana Menshikova (past director of the Politika Studio in Ostankino). The information base for the new television program is made up of published and unpublished materials (from investigations to "Love Story") of journalists from various newspapers: NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, IZVESTIYA, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, and others. This certainly does not mean that the journalists will be running with microphones and cameras in hand after heroes for their articles. "This absolutely does not mean that `Newspaper Stories' will be a symbiosis of commentary and pathos," says Tatyana Menshikova. "And this program does not intend to exist as a television version of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, although we do not deny that we subscribe to its ideology. In general the system of constraints has been thoroughly developed: No coverage of catastrophes on the screen, no direct assessments of events and phenomena, no interviews with politicians, not a lot of talking during the sequence--everyone is tired of this already." In terms of form "Newspaper Stories" will be four 10-minute films. They will be films because the program is made by movie makers--die-hards of domestic television documentation like director Aleksandr Orkin and the young people from the VGIK [All-Union State Institute of Cinematography]. "Newspaper Stories" is fundamentally positive in terms of direction and intends to actively advocate nonviolence in the best traditions of pacifism. The example of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA is being followed by other publications: CHASTNAYA ZHIZN, which is known for its predilection for the spicy and the racy, along with the independent studio Antrepriza HCD on a parity basis will begin to film the half-hour, absolutely apolitical program "Television `Private Life'" which will air in Moscow once every two weeks starting on 13 February. The program will be a television version of the newspaper, and many rubrics of "Private Life" ("He and She," "Candid Interview," "C'est la Vie") will begin their television life soon.
