He admits that the Parliament has not succeeded to discuss all the laws scheduled to be considered at first which was connected with a lack of a conception of legislative initiative on the part of the Great State Hural and the insufficient quality of the draft laws themselves. A number of most significant laws of civil code including those on land and securities are being worked out in order to submit them to the Parliament during its autumn session.
