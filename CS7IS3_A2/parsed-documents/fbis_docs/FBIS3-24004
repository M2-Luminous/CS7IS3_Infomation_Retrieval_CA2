The newly-elected President of Crimea is interviewed by Sergei Tikhy, MN correspondent in Kiev. MN: What, Yuri Alexandrovich, is the superconfidentiality which surrounded your first visits as President of Crimea to Kiev and Moscow linked to? Yu.M.: If I were to speak about my trip to Kiev, the point is not about superconfidentiality, but in the concrete circumstances of this key meeting. A representative of the administration was sent to the airport, the car arrived without any escort. From the first moments I came to feel that my visit was of no special importance for Kiev, and that there was no special attitude towards the Republic of Crimea in comparison with Ukraine's other regions. I convinced myself that the meeting had a routine, rank-and-file character. It was a meeting not with the President of the Republic of Crimea, but with a clerk who represented some part of the administration. I had to behave accordingly, as was dictated by the Kiev administration: no press conferences and no coverage in the press -- all of this would have been unreasonable, even illogical. And as far as the meeting in Moscow is concerned, there I felt like I was on native soil. The visit was businesslike and concrete. Natural hospitality, a natural well-wishing reception, and a lot of work. But in virtue of a number of circumstances I didn't find it possible to broadly notify anyone about these meetings in advance in order not to complicate things for persons with whom I met. MN: In what way could you have compounded these persons' position? Yu.M.: There was a warm attitude towards me and I, for my part, made no moves without their agreement, without obtaining permission for the coverage of this or that meeting in the press. MN: Who met you in Moscow? Yu.M.: You are again leading me to specifics about who participated in the meetings. MN: Why, after your visit to Kiev where, as you have said, you were received as a clerk, the press service of the President of Ukraine circulated an official communique on the visit which had been agreed upon with you, whereas in Moscow, where you were accorded a welcome befitting a president, even the information on who met you was classified? Incidentally, were you accompanied in Moscow by the officials of the State Traffic Inspectorate? Yu.M.: In Moscow there was everything indispensable for a meeting at such a level. MN: Nevertheless, judging by press reports, you were satisfied with the results of the Kiev meeting? Yu.M.: Indeed, the discussion was normal, concerning economic problems. I don't want to say that the meeting was patently hostile in character or that attempts to injure someone's pride were made during the course of it. MN: The Supreme Soviet has adopted amendments to the constitution in accordance with which the President of Ukraine has the right to cancel the decisions of local authorities, including your own. Do you anticipate clashes with Kiev on this question in the immediate future? Yu.M.: The adopted decision contradicts the Constitution of Ukraine. The structure of the executive branch has no right to decide questions on whether the statutory acts being adopted by local authorities are consistent with the Constitution. This is a prerogative of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. MN: In other words, the decision of Ukraine's Supreme Soviet is not legitimate, right? Yu.M.: It is not legitimate in this given case. Let's put it this way: it is a disputed issue. MN: And what about the invitation to Mr. Saburov to occupy the post of Crimea's head of government? Insofar as Saburov has no Ukrainian citizenship, this flies in the face of Ukraine's Constitution. Yu.M.: The question is about deciding economic matters. And if we begin pulling out commas and try to formalize the procedure of appointment with commas, I will put so many squiggles on the Kiev administration's table that they will be sorting them out until the end of the year. Whatever has been promised to the citizens of the Republic of Crimea will be carried out. I have no other obligations to anyone. My programme, for which the citizens voted, will be carried out with the help of the most highly competent specialists. MN: In other words, for the sake of fulfilling these tasks you may violate the Ukrainian Constitution? Yu.M.: This does not amount to a violation of the Constitution of Ukraine. Such matters are decided by the President of the Republic of Crimea. MN: Under what conditions would the question of Crimea's secession from Ukraine not be raised at all? Yu.M.: But it has not been raised. The question is about establishing normal civilized relations on the basis of a treaty, as it is written down in the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea. MN: During the election campaign an adventurous, putting it mildly, situation took shape in Crimea: pursuits, assassination attempts, shootouts. It was even rumoured that before the second round you left one of the apartments along the fire escape. Is this true? Yu.M.: I was guarded by the Scorpio group. The boys volunteered and guaranteed me the highest level of security. MN: And what about the fire escape? Yu.M.: If I go into detail, this will take a lot of time. The investigation is not yet over and many circumstances are still being studied. MN: Yuri Alexandrovich, your colleagues both here, in Simferopol, and those in Kiev and Moscow have noted one feature of yours: you give no names, no figures and no facts in general. Is this your fundamental guidepost? Yu.M.: If these remarks are essential, I will surely listen to them and adjust my line of behaviour. The mass media point to my weak, vulnerable sides, and I am grateful to them for this. MN: With what forces in Russia would you not cooperate under any circumstances? Yu.M.: With those people who preach views not permitting a normal person to shake hands with them. MN File: Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov was born in 1945 in Sinelnikovo, Dnepropetrovsk Region. Graduated from Moscow University's Department of Law and worked as an investigator at the Simferopol District Procurator's Office, a post which he had to quit over a conflict with superiors. Worked for three years on the merchant fleet. In 1990 was elected deputy to the Crimean Regional Soviet (subsequently, the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Crimea). Worked as a lawyer. In 1991 the leadership of Crimea's Bar turned to the leadership of the Regional Soviet with a request to dismiss lawyer Meshkov for numerous violations and complaints from the clientele. In August 1991 Yuri Meshkov was among the few Crimean politicians who denounced the coup leaders. In January 1994 was elected President of the Republic of Crimea. Is married and has two children.
