FR941216-1-00057 FR941216-1-00010 (A) In the case of a qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate, the value, as of the issue date, of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate; or (B) In the case of an objective rate (other than a qualified inverse floating rate), a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the debt instrument; and (iii) Qualified stated interest allocable to an accrual period is increased (or decreased) if the interest actually paid during an accrual period exceeds (or is less than) the interest assumed to be paid during the accrual period under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. (3) * ␣9* ␣9* (v) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section. * * * * * Example 3. Adjustment to qualified stated interest for actual payment of interest _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1995, Z purchases at original issue, for $90,000, a variable rate debt instrument that matures on January 1, 1997, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The amount of interest payable is the value of annual LIBOR on the payment date. The value of annual LIBOR on January 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996, is 5 percent, compounded annually. The value of annual LIBOR on January 1, 1997, is 7 percent, compounded annually. (ii) Accrual of OID and qualified stated interest. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the variable rate debt instrument is treated as a 2-year debt instrument that has an issue price of $90,000, a stated principal amount of $100,000, and interest payments of $5,000 at the end of each year. The debt instrument has $10,000 of OID and the annual interest payments of $5,000 are qualified stated interest payments. Under §1.1272&hyph;1, the debt instrument has a yield of 10.82 percent, compounded annually. The amount of OID allocable to the first annual accrual period (assuming Z uses annual accrual periods) is $4,743.25 (($90,000×.1082)^$5,000), and the amount of OID allocable to the second annual accrual period is $5,256.75 ($100,000&hyph;$94,743.25). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the $2,000 difference between the $7,000 interest payment actually made at maturity and the $5,000 interest payment assumed to be made at maturity under the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is treated as additional qualified stated interest for the period. * * * * * Par. 9. Section 1.1275&hyph;6 is added to read as follows: §1.1275&hyph;6 Integration of qualifying debt instruments. (a) In general. This section generally provides for the integration of a qualifying debt instrument with a hedge or combination of hedges if the combined cash flows of the components are substantially equivalent to the cash flows on a fixed or variable rate debt instrument. The integrated transaction is generally subject to the rules of this section rather than the rules each component of the transaction would be subject to on a separate basis. The purpose of this section is to permit a more appropriate determination of the character and timing of income, deductions, gains, or losses than would be permitted by a separate accounting for the components. The rules of this section must be interpreted consistently with this purpose. The rules of this section affect only the taxpayer who holds (or issues) the qualifying debt instrument and enters into the hedge. (b) Definitions _(1) Qualifying debt instrument _(i) In general. A qualifying debt instrument is a debt instrument subject to either §1.1275&hyph;4 (relating to contingent payment debt instruments) or §1.1275&hyph;5 (relating to variable rate debt instruments), or is an integrated transaction as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. However, a tax-exempt obligation, as defined in section 1275(a)(3), is not a qualifying debt instrument. (ii) Special rule if all payments on a debt instrument are proportionally hedged. If a debt instrument is a qualifying debt instrument and all principal and interest payments under the instrument are hedged in the same proportion, then, for purposes of this section, the portion of the instrument that is hedged is treated as a qualifying debt instrument. (2) Section 1.1275&hyph;6 hedge _(i) In general. A §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge is any financial instrument (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) such that the combined cash flows of the financial instrument and the qualifying debt instrument permit the calculation of a yield to maturity (under the principles of section 1272), or the right to the combined cash flows would qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under §1.1275&hyph;5 that pays interest at a qualified floating rate or rates (except for the requirement that the interest payments be stated as interest). A financial instrument that hedges currency risk, however, is not a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge. (ii) Limitation. A taxpayer cannot treat a debt instrument it issues as a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge of a debt instrument it holds and a taxpayer cannot treat a debt instrument it holds as a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge of a debt instrument it issues. (3) Financial instrument. For purposes of this section, a financial instrument is a spot, forward, or futures contract, an option, a notional principal contract, a debt instrument, or a similar instrument, or combination or series of financial instruments. Stock, however, is not a financial instrument for purposes of this section.
