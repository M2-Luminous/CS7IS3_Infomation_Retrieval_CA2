He called for coordinating actions, strengthening unity, and carrying out all fields of work around the project so as to foster Suzhou-style efficiency. Vice Premier Li Lanqing and his entourage arrived at the lakeside of Lake Jinji in eastern Suzhou, where the Preparatory Committee for the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee conducts its business. He heard a briefing on the park's planning and design. He then braved the rain and arrived by car at the construction site of a small demonstration zone developed during the first stage of the industrial park, as well as the construction site of a road for exclusive use by the Jiangsu and Shanghai airports, where he inspected progress in construction work. In the evening, leading comrades from Jiangsu Province and Suzhou city briefed Vice Premier Li Lanqing on progress made by the province and city over the past few months in expeditiously launching the Suzhou Industrial Park. After hearing the briefings, Vice Premier Li delivered an important speech. First, Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his satisfaction with the speed and efficiency with which the Suzhou Industrial Park had been launched officially in just over two months after the Chinese and Singaporean Governments officially signed the relevant agreement. He said: This project is one of cooperation between the Chinese and Singaporean Governments. This model of cooperation has never been adopted before; it is South-South cooperation. The project's success will prove to the world that South-South cooperation is practical and feasible. The project represents overall interests. Its success will also advance reform and opening up in Suzhou, as well as in Jiangsu and the rest of the country. The Suzhou Industrial Park's development and construction is a major task not only for Suzhou but also for Jiangsu and the entire country. For this reason, central leading comrades, such as General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, are all very concerned about the project. We should unify our thinking, coordinate our actions, support each other, strengthen unity, and carry out all fields of work around this project; we should never compromise our overall interests. Vice Premier Li emphatically pointed out: A pressing task of the moment is to do a good job of building the small demonstration zone. Because the Suzhou Industrial Park's development and construction is a very complicated task, we must carry out relevant work carefully and efficiently. Vice Premier Li Lanqing said: In developing and building the Suzhou Industrial Park, we should stress both material and spiritual civilization. We should stress spiritual civilization in the initial stage of construction. We should uphold socialist spiritual civilization and should never allow unhealthy things in. Despite our implementation of a socialist market economy, we should emphasize spiritual things, such as the spirit of dedication and the practice of taking pleasure in helping others. We should not take the market economy to mean that we can benefit ourselves at the expense of other people and concern ourselves exclusively with the pursuit of profit. Vice Premier Li also discussed the issue of learning from Singapore's experience in economic development and public administration. He urged the authority in charge of the Suzhou Industrial Park to explore some experiences that can be promoted nationwide while taking account of China's realities in practice. He said: The Suzhou Industrial Park administrative agency should perform its functions efficiently and in accordance with laws and regulations, improve the transparency of its work methods, and foster Suzhou-style efficiency. In closing, Li Lanqing asked the authority in charge of the Suzhou Industrial Park to make every effort to open up more avenues for training skilled personnel. To provide skilled personnel of various levels for the park's construction, it may recruit personnel to undergo training in Singapore, ask Singapore to send people to China to provide training, or entrust China's institutions of higher learning and vocational schools to train people with Singapore's assistance. He said hopefully: To restructure its industry and transform its old enterprises along with the park's construction, Suzhou should encourage some technologically advanced enterprises in other parts of China to set up factories in the park while, at the same, attracting foreign investment into the park. Accompanying Vice Premier Li Lanqing on his inspection tour of the Suzhou Industrial Park were responsible people from relevant state departments, including Xi Dehua, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Gan Ziyu, vice chairman of the State Planning Commission; and Zhao Guanghua, deputy director of the State Council's Special Economic Zone Office.
