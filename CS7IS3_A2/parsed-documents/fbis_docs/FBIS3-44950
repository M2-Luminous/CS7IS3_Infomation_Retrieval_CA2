He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, conducted investigations and study in the two cities of Hunjiang and Tonghua from 3 to 8 January. He pointed out: The tasks for 1994 are very heavy, and how we carry out our work is a very important matter. We must thoroughly implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, arm our minds with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, emancipate our minds, and seek truth from facts. We should not only change ideas, but we should also solve problems, explore new ideas, and carry forward the spirit of creation to implement to the letter the various tasks defined at the second plenary session of the sixth provincial party committee and to win greater success. In the six-day period, Comrade He Zhukang inspected the Hunjiang city cement plant, Hunjiang city aluminum corporation, Hunjiang city no. 1 plastics plant, Hunjiang city (Hualian) commercial building, Hunjiang city sugar and wine corporation, Hunjiang city (Dongyuan) agriculture-industry-commerce group company, Hunjiang city's (Sanchazi) District coal transport and market corporation, Tonghua Iron and Steel Company, Tonghua city textile mill, Tonghua city artificial leather and fur product plant, Tonghua city radio plant, Tonghua city pharmaceutical plant, Tonghua county (Baiyunshan) pharmaceutical plant, Tonghua county leather product plant, Tonghua county paper board mill, and Tonghua city plastics plant. Some of them are state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises, and others are shareholding enterprises, joint ventures, or private enterprises. He visited the production workshops of these enterprises, inspected their products, and heard briefings by their responsible persons on their production and business. He held several discussions with city, county, and district leading cadres and enterprise managerial personnel and heard work reports by the party committees and governments of Hunjiang and Tonghua cities and by the Tonghua county party committee. During the past few years, especially in 1993, Hunjiang and Tonghua cities conscientiously paid attention to their work and showed much creativity in some aspects. They achieved fairly great steps, rapid development, and notable results in reform, opening up, economic construction, and other undertakings. A number of very convincing examples have emerged. Comrade He Zhukang fully affirmed this. He said: I am very much inspired by your achievements, which prove that we have great potential for economic development. As long as we adhere to the party's basic line, emancipate our minds, and seize the opportunity to work in a down-to-earth manner, accelerate reform and development, and pool the efforts of all fields to work in unison, the province will successfully attain the goal of promoting its economy to a new height. Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: The third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee made a decision of the CPC Central Committee on the several issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market economy system. The second plenary session of the sixth provincial party committee put forward clear arrangements and specific requirements for implementing the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, promoting Jilin's reform focusing on establishing the socialist market economy system, and accelerating the development of its economic construction and other undertakings. Our current basic task is to implement the arrangements with great efforts. By doing work in a creative manner, we mean chiefly implementation in a creative manner. We should give full play to our subjective initiative, carry out all work in a down-to-earth manner, and fulfill our tasks at high standards. We are currently in an important period for great development and great change. Faced with the new situation in which opportunities and difficulties exist simultaneously and changes are rapid, leading cadres at all levels should diligently use their minds to analyze the situation, study new conditions and new problems, understand in a timely manner people's state of mind, be clearheaded to estimate favorable and unfavorable factors, and distinguish the essentials from the nonessentials. In the condition of the market economy, sources and geographical position are not absolute conditions, and they all depend on human effort. Regarding the endeavors we think are worthwhile, we should develop bravely as long as we have the basic conditions for them and never lose the opportunity. Those who understand this early and take action early will gain the initiative. Reform will be carried out across the board this year in a range and quality unprecedented in history. If we can correctly estimate the situation, think over some issues in advance, and accurately seize the opportunity, we will acquire more foresight in doing work, adopt realistic measures, and make correct policy decisions. It is totally possible for us, the latecomers, to attain our goals and surpass the old-timers. Our general demand is emancipating the mind, seizing the opportunity to accelerate reform and development, promoting development with reform, and continuing reform in the process of development. Faced with the new situation and tasks, leading cadres should further emancipate their minds, embrace new concepts, form new ideas, and have more spirit of exploration and creation. Work compatible with the three advantages should be bravely experimented and explored so that reform, opening up, and economic construction can be facilitated continuously. Comrade He Zhukang said: Favorable conditions are numerous for this year's work. When making work arrangements, we should adopt a higher starting point, higher goals, and quicker steps. We should tap potential, fully develop our advantages, boost the enthusiasm of all fields, and pool the efforts of all people to achieve great development bravely. On the premise of this, we should carry out meticulous work and adopt different measures to resolve different difficulties, contradictions, and problems. Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: We should further change leadership methods. When carrying out economic and other work, we should focus on priorities, achieve breakthroughs in resolving difficulties, and avoid vague generalization. We should coordinate the effort to change concepts with that to solve specific problems, both noting that new conditions are unavoidable in the process of reform and resolving new contradictions and new problems in a timely manner. In line with market demand and the principle of improving efficiency, we should adjust the ownership structure, the industrial composition, and product mix. We should strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control as well as enterprise management, step up efforts in scientific and technological advance, bring in advanced technology through the market to carry out technical transformation, and establish our superior industries and highly competitive products amid competition. We should strengthen marketing and actively open up the market. We should appoint able and virtuous people, improve leading bodies, and do a good job in training workers to improve their overall quality. Comrade He Zhukang said: In developing the socialist market economy, we should also rely on the masses. The more arduous and heavier our tasks are, the more we should boost the enthusiasm of workers. We should intensify the ideological and political education of enterprises to enhance workers' sense of masters. We should firmly rely on the vast number of workers and pool their wisdom and efforts to operate enterprises successfully. We should encourage them to participate in management in a democratic manner to suggest ways and means, rely on the collective wisdom to surmount difficulties, and create a new situation. Comrade He Zhukang urged: Cadres at all levels should remain clearheaded in the excellent situation and properly handle the relationship between reform and development on the one hand and stability on the other. They should have a full understanding of the uneven development, show concern for the people's life, give heed to their opinions and voice, succeed in comprehensively improving public security, and safeguard social stability. In rural areas, we should greatly develop the collective economy. There should be collectively operated projects at the village level in order to reduce the burdens on peasants. To resolve the difficulties in the life of the workers of the enterprises whose production is suspended totally or partly, we should have a long-term viewpoint and establish a social security system. Governments and enterprises may further relax policies and systems to encourage the masses to open up broad avenues for employment. Meanwhile, we should adopt effective measures to ensure the basic life of the workers of suspended enterprises. Leading cadres at all levels should make it a system to make contacts frequently with the workers and peasant households who have temporary difficulties in their life. We should fully develop our political advantages, the role of party organizations as fighting bastions, the role of party members as vanguards and models, and the role of trade unions, Communist Youth League, and women's federations as bridges and channels. Also participating in the investigation and study activities were responsible comrades of the general office of the provincial party committee, the provincial trade union council, and the provincial commission for restructuring of the economy.
