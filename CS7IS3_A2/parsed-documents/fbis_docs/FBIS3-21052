This will take place in Heemstede, where phosphates will be removed from the water using a combination of biological dephosphatization and a granular reactor. The equipment will cost 7 million guilders to install. The Heemstede Water Purification Plant (AWZI) is a demonstration model. Should the test unit meet expectations, then the Hoogheem council is considering building more of these dephosphatization plants. "That depends on the experience we build up in Heemstede over the coming year," says P. Knaapen, head of Rijnland's purification technique department in Leiden. "We are checking whether it meets expectations with regard to phosphate purification. And we are also taking account of aspects like control, maintenance and the definitive size." The Heemstede unit is based on a scale model which Rijnland has tested since 1990 in three water purification plants. This mini-plant can be transported in a container. In Zuid-Kennemerland it is the first time that the purification method will be used at real size. Algae Growth When phosphates enter water, they cause an increase in the number of nutrients in the water (eutrophication). This in turn causes a massive growth in algae, so that the amount of oxygen in the water declines. The main sources of phosphates in water are households (kitchen waste and feces) and agriculture (fertilizers). The contribution caused by washing powders is declining because many manufacturers have switched to phosphate-free products. The AWZI in Heemstede already had a biological purification process. However, the equipment to remove the phosphate from the mass of bacteria -- the purification sediment -- is a new element. Its main advantage is that it does not increase the quantity of purification sediment. When oxygen is added, the micro-organisms absorb the phosphates. Rijnland continually separates off part of the sediment and adds acetic acid. While the bacteria absorb the acid as nutrients, they give off the phosphate again. This leads to water which is rich in phosphates and sediment which contains virtually none. The next step is separating sediment and water. The Hoogheem council has chosen a centrifuge to do this. After the separation process, the sediment returns to its own purification process to once again absorb phosphates. At this stage the effluent contains virtually no phosphates. On the other hand the phosphate-rich water from the centrifuge must undergo two more processing stages. The first processing stage is the addition of sulfuric acid to the water. This removes the carbonate from the water. This is necessary because this substance can block the following phase of the process, the granular reactor. The granular reactor was developed by the DHV engineering company in Amersfoort and enjoys an international reputation. Large Granules Once the water has been pumped into the granular reactor, limewater is added to the centrifuge effluent. A deposit of calcium phosphate then forms from the limemilk and phosphate. The water goes from the bottom to the top of the reactor several times. The granular reactor contains grafting sand. The calcium phosphate attaches itself to the grafting sand and forms phosphate granules. The result is obvious: The granules become bigger and eventually drop to the bottom due to their weight. Here they are removed. The purified water is returned to the oxygenation tank. The AWZI in Heemstede is one of 45 water purification plants in Rijnland. The aim of the plant is to help the Hoogheem council in the fight against phosphate. Rijnland calculates that in 1995 it will have to process some 900 tonnes of phosphates. This figure is based on the assumption that there are no increases in phosphate use.
