The secretary issued this warning during his speech at the ceremony in which Jorge Kondo Lopez, a state leader of the Federation of Agricultural Associations of Sinaloa State, presented his second work report. Hank said, "Self-sufficiency in food means producing what is necessary to feed our country." He recalled that four years ago, Mexico had to import beans, and that this was very difficult to do because of international shortages. He said: "We do not want the country swamped with foreign products; we must import only what we need." He said that although at this moment it is advantageous to import basic materials, machinery, and seeds, the ideal situation would be to not require any imports. [passage omitted]
