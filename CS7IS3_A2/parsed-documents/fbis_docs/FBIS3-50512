Oblitas' remarks have aggravated to an even greater degree the confrontation between the Judicial and Executive Branches, which has prompted a movement for impeachment for corruption against the CSJ chairman and a CSJ member which has not yet been cleared by the Legislative Branch. Oblitas also accused the U.S. Embassy in La Paz and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) of being involved in "a truly dirty war to tarnish the image of the CSJ chairman." The CSJ chairman made these accusations because of the publication on 26 December of a statement made under oath by drug trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominquez, who was arrested again eight months after his escape, in which he said he had bribed several judges. Dominguez, captured on 24 December in the eastern town of Santa Cruz, after his escape from a police clinic in La Paz on 17 April, said in his statement, which was published by ULTIMA HORA, that from Sucre, the site of the Supreme Court, he was asked for $120,000 "so as to be acquitted in the trial against me for drug trafficking charges." According to Dominguez, the money "would be for Edgar Oblitas, Ernesto Poppe, and Edgar Rosales," all members of the Supreme Court, but that it was not given, according to what he said, because "I did not have the money, and I decided to escape." Oblitas said that "in face of the collapse and failure" of the impeachment, "where absolutely nothing has yet been proven in the Ibarra case, the government is now resorting to complicity with a well-known and morally discredited drug trafficker, setting up a new scheme in an effort to try to involve (the CSJ chairman) with that criminal." Jose Maria Antonio Ibarra, former Nicaraguan deputy minister of the presidency, had accused Oblitas and Poppe, in addition to former Justice Hugo Galindo, of extortion in order that the CSJ might rule illegal his extradition, as had been requested by the Managua Government. Ibarra handed over to the Bolivian Government a videotape, obtained with the technical support of the U.S. Embassy, which shows the moment he was handing over to Galindo the money that was allegedly intended to achieve the court's favorable ruling. The video was submitted to a Chamber of Deputies committee, which has concluded its investigations but has not yet announced a decision establishing whether or not impeachment against the CSJ chairman in the Senate is legal. Oblitas has asked his lawyers to file suit against Ted Cordoba Claure, director of the newspaper ULTIMA HORA, for "manipulating in a dirty and criminal manner" the news "and for leading public opinion astray." The newspaper limited itself only to stating that it had published a summarized version of Dominguez' remarks to the authorities after his arrest on Christmas Eve. Meanwhile, the suspended justices, on trial for having granted a medical dispensation that facilitated Dominguez' escape, have warned the detainee that he must convincingly prove his denunciations of a $10,000 bribe, or defend himself in the trial they will conduct against him.
