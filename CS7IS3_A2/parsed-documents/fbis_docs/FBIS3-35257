In his meeting with Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] tomorrow, Shohat said, he will seek to clarify whether the PLO officially changed its positions. Minister Shohat believes a change of policy may be needed, and instead of open economies, a decision will be made to close the economies of Israel and the autonomy to each other.
