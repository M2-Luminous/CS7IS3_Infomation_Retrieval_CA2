The report goes on to say that "senior military elements" have expressed opposition to this move, saying that "it delivers a death blow to the IDF deterrence power." HATZOFE adds that "this opposition has been relayed to the IDF command and through it to the prime minister, and it has been learned that Rabin is currently considering rejecting or postponing the move."]
