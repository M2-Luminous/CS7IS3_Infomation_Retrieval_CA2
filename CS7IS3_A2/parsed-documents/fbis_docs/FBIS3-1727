On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Party Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, I wish you all a happy New Year! I would like to offer my New Year's greetings to the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, government functionaries in Shanghai; officers and men of the three branches of the Armed Forces stationed in Shanghai; armed police officers and men; public security cadres and policemen; and patriotic people in all circles. I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, as well as overseas Chinese and international friends, who show concern for, assist in, and support Shanghai's modernization. In the past year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and with the support of all people in the nation, the Shanghai people united as one to blaze new trails and make progress. Shanghai was a heartening scene of prosperity in economic construction, reform, opening up, and social development. It enjoyed sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development on the basis of market demand, good quality, and high efficiency. Shanghai vigorously steered reform of the economic structure toward the goal of taking the lead in building operating mechanisms of the socialist market economy. It scored new achievements in developing Pudong and opening up to the outside world. The spiritual civilization was developed coordinately. People's lives improved notably. In particular, the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee greatly inspired the Shanghai people to further promote the development of various undertakings and encouraged us to confidently march toward the coming year. The year of 1994 is a crucial year for China's reform, opening up, and modernization, as well as a decisive year for Shanghai to "bring about great changes in three years." Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability are the major goals for the entire party this year, and we must follow and serve these goals. According to the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we must firmly embrace the central task of economic construction, insist that development is the last word, focus on the key links vital to Shanghai's overall economic situation, and maintain strong momentum for Shanghai's economic development. We must painstakingly organize the implementation of various major reforms, and strive for new breakthroughs in taking the lead in establishing operational mechanisms of the socialist market economy. We must adhere to the principle of "carrying out two tasks simultaneously and proceeding steadfastly with both," continue to promote socialist spiritual civilization, arm people with scientific theory, guide public opinion correctly, mold people with a lofty spirit, and inspire people with excellent works to enhance citizens' quality and the cultural levels of the cities. We must vigorously accelerate the construction of socialist democracy and the legal system, further maintain and develop political stability and unity, and promote social progress in an all-around way. In the new year, the key to opening up a new prospect for various undertakings is to arm ourselves and guide our actions with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must continue to conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, thoroughly master the essence of emancipating our minds and seeking truth from facts, enhance our awareness and determination in carrying out the party's basic line, and improve our ability to lead socialist modernization and master the market economy. We must be modest and prudent, make constant progress, boldly explore new ways, courageously practice newfound ways, and work creatively with a higher goal in mind. Now that the objectives and tasks for reform and construction, as well as the guiding principles and policies, have been formulated, we should work hard and in a down-to-earth manner to implement them in 1994, and should earnestly improve our work style and leading methods. We should study more often and socialize less frequently; should conduct more investigation and research and reduce wishful acts; and should perform more actual work and curtail rhetoric. When facing heavy tasks of reform and construction, we should be good at keeping the overall situation in mind; should earnestly study new conditions and new problems; and should promptly summarize experiences in an effort to actively, steadily, and realistically make progress in various tasks. In 1994, to correctly understand the relations among reform, development, and stability is of utmost importance for us to accomplish various missions. Economic development is the central task of all our work; reform is the driving force for development; and stability is the prerequisite for reform and development. While pursuing reform and development, we should also correctly handle the two types of contradictions; should safeguard social stability; and should provide a favorable social environment for reform, opening up to the outside world, and economic progress. We should conscientiously strengthen and improve party building; should promote the party's fine traditions; should foster close ties with the masses; and should unite all Shanghai people to join in the great cause of Shanghai's modernization drive. Comrades and Friends: We are shouldering heavy responsibilities in 1994. The party Central Committee, the State Council, proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation including Deng Xiaoping, and people across China are holding keen expectations on Shanghai's progress. It is our glorious historic responsibility to continually initiate new ways of performing tasks in Shanghai and to enhance Shanghai's vigor and prosperity. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, let us perform realistic work with one heart and one mind, and strive to accomplish new victories in Shanghai's reform, opening up to the outside world, and modernization drive! Finally I wish all of you a happy New Year, happy family lives, good health, and prosperous undertakings!
