These states are now to receive a consolation prize once more, in the form of the Partnership for Peace that NATO is to offer them at the summit to be held on Monday [10 January]. The Visegrad states above all -- Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- have a claim for rapid and complete integration into the alliance and the EU that is morally justified. In retrospect, the establishment of the "Solidarity" free trade union in Gdansk represents the first blow that shook the communist giant; in what was formerly Czechoslovakia, the "Charter 77" dissident movement developed the principles of the "velvet revolution" and a civic society to follow communism; and finally, when the barbed wire between East and West was cut in Hungary, the collapse of the Berlin Wall was only a question of time. In view of these historic services, one can understand why the Polish foreign minister bitterly described the NATO offer as worthless, as "a signpost without any information on directions or distances." Shortly before Clinton's departure, the U.S. Government did at least provide some information on the direction: The Partnership for Freedom is a step toward the "evolutionary expansion" of NATO, a transitional stage. This provides little consolation to those states that no longer belong to the East, but (still) cannot join the West. Lacking firm economic and domestic stability, they are being kept in a debilitating intermediate stage and are exposed to the tumult that has seized Europe following the end of the Cold War. They have shaken off Soviet domination and must now learn that Moscow -- even if the West denies it -- still has a say in their affairs.
