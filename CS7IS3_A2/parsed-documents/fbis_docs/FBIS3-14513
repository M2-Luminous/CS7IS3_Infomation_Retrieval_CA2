A statement issued today by the party's Central Secretariat says that with the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and Arab territories and the ongoing Israeli policies of settlement building and violence, oppression, and killing against the Palestinian people, the boycott is the only remaining weapon in the hands of Arabs and Palestinians. The statement says that the Arab League's involvement in lifting any part of the boycott against Israel at this time, before a just and a comprehensive peace is achieved, will represent a harsh judgment on the future of the Arab League and on the conduct of Arab governments.
