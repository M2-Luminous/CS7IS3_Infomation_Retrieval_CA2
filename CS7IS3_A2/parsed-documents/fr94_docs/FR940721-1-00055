FR940721-1-00055 FR940721-1-00014 I. Technology Demonstration The purpose of the Technology Demonstration (see additional information under the headings DATES and ADDRESSES , above) is to provide owners and operators of computer loan origination systems (CLOs) with an opportunity to demonstrate or discuss the operation and benefits of their systems and the impact of the proposed rule on their systems, and to provide consumer groups, industry organizations, and members of the public with an opportunity to witness such presentations or demonstrations. As discussed more fully below, this rule proposes to modify the application of the current Regulation X to CLOs. Information gained by the Department from the Technology Demonstration may be used in developing a final rule. Owners and operators are invited to notify the Department of their interest in participating in this Technology Demonstration. Participants will be free to make visual or conceptual presentations without including actual use of computer loan origination systems. Based upon the number of interested parties and other practical considerations, the Department will determine the format, timing, and logistical arrangements for the Technology Demonstration. To the extent feasible, the Department will provide electrical and telephonic hook-ups for participants. The Department reserves the option of limiting the length of presentations, or setting any other guidelines for participation, in accordance with the number of participants. II. Background On November 2, 1992, HUD published a revised Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) (RESPA) rule (hereinafter ``final rule'' or ``1992 final rule''), which became effective on December 2, 1992, and was amended on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505). Technical corrections were published on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14748). The final rule contained long-awaited provisions implementing amendments to RESPA regarding controlled businesses. These amendments were originally enacted in 1983 as section 461 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act (HURRA), Pub. L. 98&hyph;181. The final rule also updated the original RESPA rule, which had not been amended since 1976. On October 28, 1992, a few days before publication of the final rule in the Federal Register , then-President Bush signed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 202&hyph;550) (1992 Act), which amended RESPA to state specifically that the making of a mortgage loan was a covered transaction (a Federal court case had created uncertainty) and that refinancing transactions were transactions covered by RESPA. The 1992 Act also extended RESPA's coverage to all subordinate liens involving 1- to 4-family residential property. Implementing provisions, along with revisions of the final rule, are set forth in the Federal Register of February 10, 1994, and are effective on August 9, 1994. The effect of the statutory and regulatory changes was to expand substantially the coverage of this criminal and civil statute. Following issuance of the final rule, two lawsuits were filed: one by the Mortgage Bankers Association and one by a group of independent service providers, called CRISIS. Both suits objected to provisions of the final rule and alleged that HUD had not complied with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) in promulgating the November 2, 1992, rule. The cases have been dismissed, but are subject to being reinstituted at any time. Upon assuming office, HUD officials in the new Administration were inundated with comments_mostly complaints_about the final rule issued in the last days of the previous Administration. Notably absent from the interests contacting HUD about the final rule were any representatives of consumer interests. Instead, comments came almost entirely from the affected industries. Some industry representatives argued that the provisions of the final rule benefited consumers, while others argued that the provisions, sometimes the same provisions, were harmful to consumers.
