Among these measures was the possibility of raising the prices and fees of selected products and services that are not considered basic necessities. Considering these elements, the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers adopted, at the suggestion of the Ministry of Finance and Prices, several measures relating to prices and fees, and applicable from the date indicated in each case. The first decision establishes retail prices for cigarettes sold in boxes of 20. In the case of (Rubio) cigarettes, the price will be 2.50 pesos for those sold through the basic controlled quota; 6.50 for those sold though controlled distribution; and 10.50 for those sold uncontrolled. In each of these cases, black cigarettes will be sold at 2, 6 and 10 pesos, respectively. These prices will go into effect for the next selling cycle which begins on 1 June. In the meantime, until a balance is established between production and consumption, a measure leaning toward liberalization of cigarette sales could be developed at prices adjustable to market demand. Regarding twisted tobacco [tabaco torcido], the agreement of the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers establishes the following prices per unit, according to the conditions of sale: twisted tobacco through the controlled basic quota, one peso; twisted tobacco through controlled sale, which is currently a minimal figure, two pesos for Nacionales, Coronas, and the regular Cazadores; three pesos for the special Cazadores. These prices will become effective for the next selling cycle which begins on 1 June. Corresponding prices for twisted tobacco of superior quality, which could be produced in the future, will be established for each case. With the stabilization of production and consumption, a policy leaning toward free sale of twisted tobacco at prices adjusted to the behavior of the market could be developed. Beer distributed in a controlled manner will cost 1.20 pesos for a 350-milliliter container, 1.70 for a 500-milliliter container or its equivalent when sold in large quantities. The price for a bottle of rum will be 40 pesos for class A, 30 for class B, and 20 for class C. Brandy will cost 20 pesos per bottle. These prices will become effective for the next selling cycle beginning on 1 June. As production and consumption are stabilized, measures will lean toward the free sale of beer and alcoholic beverages at prices adjustable to market behavior. In restaurants and recreation centers, prices will be adjusted according to increases in retail sales. Fuel for private vehicles will carry the following prices: Special gasoline will be sold at 1.20 per liter; regular at one peso per liter; gas-oil or diesel, 75 cents per liter. These prices will become effective during the next sales cycle which begins on 1 June. Fees for electric service to the residential sector will be as follows: the first 100 kilowatt-hours of monthly consumption, the current 9 cents per kilowatt-hour; between 100 and 300 kilowatt-hours of monthly consumption, 20 cents per kilowatt-hour; for over 300 kilowatt-hours, 30 cents per kilowatt hour. The new tariffs will become effective in September to be charged in October. In the case of electric service, the agreement explains that the application of the new tariffs does not exclude the interruption of service for those consumers who repeatedly exceed the assigned monthly consumption plan. Regarding transportation fees, the agreement establishes, with the exception of urban and suburban services, a universal increase of 60.8 percent in train transportation, 80 percent in airplane transportation, and 116 percent in nonurban bus transportation. Furthermore, apart from the boarding and [word indistinct] price, each ticket will have a minimum price. In the same manner, vouchers will be given to workers and students for transportation between their residences and work or education centers. Second-class train tickets for medium distance, interurban service and local service will be reduced. Regarding fees for water and sewage service to the residential sector, the agreement proposes that the current tariffs for the metered water system be maintained and that a fixed rate of one peso per person per household be established for water service when consumption is not monitored by meters. It has also been decided that fees for national and international postal and telegraphic services will be adjusted to the average of international costs and prices. Furthermore, state entities are authorized, along with labor unions, to adjust and modify retail prices of meals offered at workers' cafeterias, a measure that will become effective on 1 July.
