As noted in the NPRM, the Commission is using this proceeding as a test of methods to improve the ability of the Commission and the public to review and evaluate data and information through the use of computerized data bases. We therefore encourage all commenters to submit, in addition to the required paper copies ( see NPRM at para. 107), a copy of their comments and reply comments on IBM&hyph;PC compatible diskettes to: (1) The Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC 20554 and (2) the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Services, Inc., Room 246, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554, Attn. Wilbur Thomas. Each diskette submitted to the Office of the Secretary should be labeled CC Docket No. 94&hyph;1, Attn. Adrianne Brent, Industry Analysis Division. All diskettes should be submitted with text files in two formats, one compatible with WordPerfect 5.1 or 4.2 and one in ASCII, and with spreadsheets in a Lotus 1&hyph;2&hyph;3 WK1 or WK3 file, so that they may be included in the data base. All ex parte statements and replies to ex parte statements should be filed in this same manner. In the NPRM, the Commission identified a number of issues for comment. Each issue is categorized as a ``General,'' ``Baseline,'' or ``Transition'' issue. In addition, each issue is assigned a number, and some of the issues also are assigned a letter. For example, the first issue identified for comment in the NPRM is ``General Issue 1''; the third issue identified for comment is ``Baseline Issue 1a''; the last issue identified for comment is ``Transition Issue 6.'' In responding to an issue identified for comment in the NPRM, commenters should specifically reference the category, number, and where applicable, the letter that corresponds to the issue. Further, the category, number, and letter of the issue should precede the corresponding comments. Comments filed in this format should improve the Commission and the public's ability to review and evaluate data and information submitted in this docket. The NPRM provides that comments in this docket are due on April 18, 1994, and replies are due on May 17, 1994. In order to facilitate the creation of useful data bases in this and other Commission proceedings, we encourage comments and suggestions for improvements to these procedures.
