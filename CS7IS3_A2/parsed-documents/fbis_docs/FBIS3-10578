The commander, who is staying at the Military Hospital, said the situation following statements by the president have prompted his decision. In a speech the president of the Republic has said the only obstacle that can keep an officer or noncommissioned officer from returning to active duty in the FAN is his political involvement. He has admitted that of the many officers and NCOs of the 4 February uprising still in prison, "only Hugo Chavez Frias has assumed a permanent and critical political attitude, in his attempt to respond to the expectations of the people who woke up and stood on their feet that night, while all the other officers and NCOs have remained almost completely silent." He accepts responsibility for the position publicly adopted by the 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement and accepts whatever punishment that may result from such statements. Following the reasons given by the commander in chief, I hereby state to my countrymen I will physically leave the Army and hang up my uniform 24 hours after my release, if this should occur." [no opening quotation mark as published] The Conditions Commander Chavez states in his document that to request his resignation the following specific conditions must be met: 1. Freedom and a return to active duty of ALL [previous word published in uppercase] officers, NCOs, and subordinate soldiers still imprisoned for the 4 February and 27 November events, provided this is their wish. 2. Restitution of retirement pension rights and all other social and economic benefits to ALL [previous word published in uppercase] officers and NCOs discharged after 10 or more years of active duty. 3. Solutions to the problems described by senior officers still imprisoned who cannot or do not want to remain on active duty. 4.
