Heli, and Rusby Two Timber Sales in California, Deer Gulch and Typhoon Dixie in Washington AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, USDA. ACTION: Notice of decisions. SUMMARY: On February 3, 1994, James R. Lyons, Assistant Secretary for Natural Resources and the Environment, decided to offer for sale, pending modification of the injunction in SAS v. Lyons, No. C92&hyph;179 (W.D. Washington), 30.861 million board feet of timber from 24 timber sales in Oregon, Washington and California. These decisions resulted from an agreement between Secretaries Espy and Babbit and the plaintiffs to review for possible release from the Court's injunction certain Forest Service timber sales in Pacific Southwest (Region 5) and Pacific Northwest (Region 6) Regions. All 24 sales have been modified to meet the stipulations of the agreement. The plaintiffs agreed not to oppose a motion to release 54 timber sales identified in the agreement. These 24 sales represent a portion of the 54 identified timber sales. EFFECTIVE DATE: The United States Department of Agriculture will be requesting modification of the injunction against auction and award of timber sales in SAS v. Lyons. These 24 timber sales will be implemented as soon as practicable upon such modification by the Court. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information, contact John E. Lowe, Regional Forester, Region 6, P.O. Box 3623, Portland, Oregon 97208&hyph;3623, (503) 326&hyph;3625 (for timber sales in Oregon and Washington) or, Ronald E. Stewart, Regional Forester, Region 5, 630 Sansome Street, San Francisco, California 94111, (415) 705&hyph;2874 (for timber sales in California). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on Management for the Northern Spotted Owl in the National Forests was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on January 31, 1992 and the Record of Decision (ROD) for this FEIS was signed on March 3, 1992. A lawsuit was filed by Seattle Audubon Society on March 25, 1992, (Seattle Audubon Society, et al. v. James R. Moseley, et al.) which challenged the legality of the FEIS and ROD alleging violations of both National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and National Forest Management Act. On May 28, 1992 Judge Dwyer found that the Forest Service had not fully complied with NEPA and that it must take further action under that statute. On May 29, 1992, Judge Dwyer enjoined the Forest Service from auctioning and awarding additional timber sales in suitable spotted owl habitat. On October 6, 1993 an agreement was reached between plaintiffs and Secretaries Espy and Babbit to review for possible release from the Court's injunction certain Forest Service timber sales in Forest Service Regions 5 and 6. All or portions of 54 timber sales were identified in the agreement. The plaintiffs agreed not to oppose a motion to release the 54 timber sales. Environmental analysis and consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have been completed for 24 of the 54 sales. In addition, each of the 24 sales has been adjusted to meet the stipulations found in the October 6 agreement with the plaintiffs.
