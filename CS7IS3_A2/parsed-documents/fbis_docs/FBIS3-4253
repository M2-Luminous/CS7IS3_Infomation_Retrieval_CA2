Thousands of workers at the US$3.7 billion (HK$28.5 billion) Ertan Dam project on the lower reaches of the Yalong River in southwestern China were involved in the strike that ended on March 15, the SUNDAY MORNING POST has learned. Officials at the plant, who declined to be named, confirmed the strike had ended but refused to provide further details. The project, perhaps the largest foreign joint venture in China, is a partnership between German companies Philipp Holzmann and Hochtief AG, together with Ge Zhou Ba (Chinese Dam Company). Sources say at least two of the partners are bidding on work at Three Gorges. The bitter labour dispute, which has not been mentioned in the official Chinese media, illustrates the kind of widespread worker unrest raging across the country. Official Chinese sources have confirmed 10,000 industrial actions nationwide in 1993. Despite a vigorous campaign to curtail illicit labour groups, including the arrest of suspected leaders, direct action by workers is gaining popularity. "There is clearly widespread, spontaneous industrial unrest emerging in China," Robin Munro, director of Human Rights Watch/Asia (formerly Asia Watch) said. "These are wildcat strikes, not organised actions." A crackdown on labour groups has widened in recent months to single out worker leaders, according to a new Human Rights Watch report, China: New Arrests Linked To Worker Rights. The report details the cases of four labour organisers arrested this month, with three -- Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbin and Wang Jiaqi -- still in custody. A U.S. State Department official told the SUNDAY MORNING POST that worker leaders had come under increasing government scrutiny since the crushing of the student democracy movement in 1989. Documents released by Human Rights Watch suggest the grassroots network of labour activists in China is developing into a more cohesive organisation. A group calling itself the League for the Protection of the Rights of the Working People of the People's Republic of China released a five-point petition on workers' rights. Among the demands were: the establishment of a nationwide worker network offering information and support services; an arbitration system to settle labour disputes; protection of worker rights; the right of peasants to form unions; the public declaration of the income of officials, all the way up to the Politburo leadership; protection of migrant workers; workers in joint ventures receiving the right to form unions and conduct collective bargaining. Mr Munro said labour activists, although small in number, were beginning to form a formidable network. "Rather than espouse more abstract notions of democracy, many of them are now talking about worker rights and labour concerns." Under a 1992 law, collective bargaining in China is only permitted by workers in private enterprises, which involve less than five per cent of the Chinese workforce. All labour activity by law must be through the government-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions. At Ertan Dam, workers risk their lives daily in gruelling conditions for the equivalent of $200 to $300 per month. The massive excavation project has been plagued by industrial accidents. Many workers have been killed. Workers at the plant had reportedly been promised bonuses for speeding up work on the dam and to complete a water diversion tunnel before the arrival of Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua. The dispute was sparked when payments were less than workers expected. It was resolved only after salaries were raised to $300 to $400 per month, a source said. Costs for the massive Three Gorges Dam project were estimated to be at least 50 billion yuan in 1990. Philipp Holzmann, among the world's largest construction companies, was recently among the bidders for a share of the work on the West Kowloon Expressway.
