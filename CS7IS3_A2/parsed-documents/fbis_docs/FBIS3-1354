Mr de Klerk announced this at a news conference at the Union Buildings after he met an ANC delegation led by ANC President Nelson Mandela on Thursday [24 March]. Mr Mandela addressed a separate news conference at the Union Buildings after they failed to fully agree on the measures to be taken in kwaZulu. Mr de Klerk said while his government was empowered to take over government functions in kwaZulu, as ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had suggested earlier, this was not what he intended doing. Mr de Klerk briefed the ANC delegation which included Mac Maharaj, Mr Ramaphosa and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo on the government's security contingency plans for Natal. The SADF [South African Defense Force] call-up would obviously involve an increase in manpower levels, he said. On a political level, Mr de Klerk said he would like to meet Mr Buthelezi as soon as possible to discuss arrangements to ensure free electioneering in kwaZulu, and to discuss the possibility of another initiative to involve the region in an inclusive political process. He would see Mr Buthelezi to prevent the necessity for SA Government intervention. Mr Mandela told a separate news conference Mr de Klerk had not reacted like a state president in his comments on Mr Ramaphosa's suggestions, but like a petty politician. Mr Mandela was "completely disgusted" by Mr de Klerk's response. Mr de Klerk had failed to contact Mr Mandela on the matter as he should have handled an issue of national concern. Asked whether there was a rift between him and Mr de Klerk, ?r Mandela said they had "made progress" during their discussions on kwaZulu/Natal's political and security situation. If there was progress, free and fair elections in Natal should be possible. Mr de Klerk had defended kwaZulu's and the IFP's actions, and ignored the fact that state resources were being used to destabilise the political process, Mr Mandela said. Mr de Klerk said he made it clear at the meeting that the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] did not have the powers to tamper with lawfully-elected institutions in kwaZulu. He dismissed any notions that he was part of a strategy to topple the kwaZulu government. Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Johan Kriegler earlier briefed both leaders on meeting with the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly on Wednesday. Mr de Klerk said the IEC's information on the situation in kwaZulu was more negative than initial interpretations had suggested.
