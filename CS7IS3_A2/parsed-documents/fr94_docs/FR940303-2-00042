FR940303-2-00042 FR940303-2-00029 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;142&hyph;000] Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff February 25, 1994. Take notice that on February 22, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets listed on Appendix A of the filing, with an effective date of April 1, 1994. FGT states that on June 16, 1993 FGT filed, pursuant to Rule 602 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (Settlement) resolving all issues in these proceedings except curtailment issues. On September 17, 1993, the Commission issued its Second Order on Compliance Filing and First Order on Rehearing (September 17 Order) finding that the Settlement with modifications as directed therein implemented the fundamental concepts underlying Order No. 636. The September 17 Order accepted the Settlement and approved the accompanying tariff sheets, with certain exceptions and modifications, directed FGT to refile final tariff sheets, and accepted such tariff sheets to be effective on October 1, 1993. Various parties requested rehearing of certain aspects of the September 17 Order. On September 23, 1993, FGT filed its Third Revised Volume No. 1 which reflected the revisions required by the Commission's September 17 Order. The proposed effective date of the tariff was October 1, 1993. In response to a motion filed September 7, 1993, by Peoples Gas System, Inc., on September 24, 1993, the Commission issued an order delaying implementation of FGT's Order No. 636 tariff until November 1, 1993. On December 16, 1993, the Commission issued its Third Order on Compliance Filing and Second Order on Rehearing granting in part and denying in part the various requests for rehearing of the September 17 Order and directing FGT to make certain additional changes to its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1. On January 18, 1994, FGT filed tariff sheets reflecting the changes in compliance with the December 16 Order. The instant filing proposes certain additional changes to FGT's FERC Gas Tariff, generally to correct minor errors and clarify certain provisions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 in accordance with Sections 385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before March 4, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
