It is the theme of why Japan must become a permanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC]. At his talks with French and German leaders, the prime minister expressed Japan's strong desire to become a permanent member and said that "Japan will fulfill its responsibilities (in the United Nations)." His utterances are an extension of "Our Country's Opinion on the Equitable Distribution and Expansion of Security Council Seats," a document worked out by the Foreign Ministry. At its General Assembly meeting last year, the United Nations inaugurated a work team to deal with the "Security Council reorganization issue." The work team is scheduled to finalize a report around June and July and then present it to the 49th UN General Assembly this fall. The work team appears to be desiring to draw a conclusion on this issue in next year when the United Nations greets the 50th anniversary of its founding. Whether Japan has to decide to join the rank of permanent members or not is a question to be discussed fully among the people. It is not the kind of question on which a government office is allowed to work out "our country's opinion" arbitrarily to show it externally. Becoming a permanent member is not a goal, but merely a means for Japan. What matters is to what Japan will say yes and to what Japan will say no. In other words, the important thing is what functions the United Nations should carry out for the security of the world. If the United Nations does not intend to assume the shape that Japan wants it to, Japan should decline to become a permanent member no matter how eagerly it is asked to do so. It is said that with the end of the cold war, the United Nations has revived as a dispute-settling organization. There are now as many as 17 PKO [peacekeeping operations] conducted by the United Nations. However, the United Nations is not omnipotent. While Prime Minister Hata was visiting Europe, the U.S. Government announced a policy through which to decrease U.S. participation in the PKO and to limit the PKO to cases directly connected with national interests. The United States became disgusted with the deaths and injuries caused to its soldiers in Somalia. The activity in Somalia was clearly a failure because the United Nations ceased to be a mediator in the dispute and became a disputing party. Yet the United Nations is not totally powerless either. A democratic election was carried out successfully in Cambodia under the guidance of UNTAC (UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia), and the minds of the people there are stabilized compared with one year ago. Moreover, As a result of a failure in Somalia, there is a growing view that the United Nations should put emphasis on the prevention of disputes and on political solutions. This view is based on the notion that permanent members should not only discuss the appropriateness of military actions, but also study what is called overall security, which combines economic and technical assistance, humanitarian aid, election management, and cease-fire supervision. What do we expect from the United Nations? Some think that we should become a permanent member and be willing to take military actions for collective security while some others view that we should carry through our position of not intervening in any disputes at all. No consensus has been established among the people. In addition, no full understanding seems to have been developed among them as for the meaning of joining in the Security Council as well. We are not objecting to becoming a permanent member itself from the beginning; however, we feel it dangerous that, in the course of time, a grave issue determining Japan's external role has been turning into a kind of established policy before we become aware.
