FR940825-1-00131 FR940825-1-00009 There is also a minor source permit program, under CAA section 110(a)(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(C), and 40 CFR 51.160&hyph;164 which requires SIPs to include a program regulating the modification and construction of any stationary source, regardless of size or attainment status, as necessary to assure that the NAAQS are achieved. In today's action, EPA is proposing to authorize Tribes to include minor source permit programs as part of their TIPs in the same manner as States. Finally, EPA also issues new source performance standards (``NSPS'') that affected new or modified stationary sources must meet in both attainment and nonattainment areas. States are required to submit, and EPA is proposing that Tribes be authorized to submit, plans similar to SIPs or TIPs that provide for the implementation and enforcement of certain requirements for certain pollutants regulated by NSPS. CAA sections 111(d), 129, 42 U.S.C. 7411(d), 7429. Conformity. Section 176 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7506, prohibits Federal agencies from supporting or providing financial assistance for activities that do not conform to an approved SIP or TIP. The restriction extends to State, Tribal and local transportation plans or projects that are approved or funded by a Federal agency. Visibility. Title I also requires States in which certain mandatory ``class I'' Federal areas (certain national parks, wildernesses and international parks as specified in section 162(a), 42 U.S.C. 7472(a)) are located, or States whose emissions may affect such areas, to include provisions in their SIPs to remedy and prevent visibility impairment in those areas. CAA sections 169A & 169B, 42 U.S.C. 7491 & 7492. In today's action, EPA is proposing to authorize Tribes to submit visibility TIPs. Interstate Pollution Provisions. Section 126 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7426, authorizes States to petition the Administrator to find that a major source or group of stationary sources in one State emits air pollutants that contribute significantly to nonattainment, interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS, or interfere with measures under the PSD or visibility protection programs in another State. See also section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act. EPA is proposing that these provisions apply to Tribes in the same fashion that they apply to States so that a Tribe or State may take such action to remedy pollution from an upwind Tribe or State. In addition, sections 169B, 176A and 184, 42 U.S.C. 7492, 7506a & 7511c, were added to the Act in the 1990 Amendments and contain provisions for cooperatively addressing interstate pollution problems. These provisions authorize (and, in some instances, direct) the establishment of interstate transport commissions to address regionwide visibility impairment, ozone pollution and other NAAQS pollution issues. The Governors of the affected States (or their designees) represent the State members of the commissions. Generally, the commissions develop and transmit recommendations to EPA on the specific issues the commissions are charged with addressing. Thus, the commissions provide a vehicle for facilitating interstate cooperation and input in addressing air pollution problems that require a regional solution due to pollutant transport across political boundaries. In today's action, EPA is proposing to extend this authority to Tribes. Among other things, Tribes would be authorized to petition the Administrator for establishment of commissions and Tribal leaders included in commission membership in the same fashion as State leaders. Hazardous Air Pollutants. The provisions governing the emissions of hazardous air pollutants are also contained in Title I. EPA is directed to issue control technology standards (``maximum achievable control technology'' or ``MACT'') covering 189 hazardous air pollutants. CAA section 112, 42 U.S.C. 7412. Section 112 also contains provisions to prevent and minimize the consequences of accidental releases of, among other things, extremely hazardous substances. States or, as proposed today, Tribes may develop and submit to EPA for approval, programs implementing both the hazardous air pollutant emission standards and accidental release requirements. Enforcement and Information Collection. The Clean Air Act general Federal enforcement provisions are contained in Title I. Section 113 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7413, authorizes the imposition of both civil and criminal penalties for violation of Clean Air Act requirements. It also contains provisions authorizing EPA to pay cash awards to persons furnishing information leading to a criminal conviction or certain civil penalties.
