Not elsewhere classified. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1992 Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, April, 1994. Applying the CFOI fatality estimate to the most recent logging employment estimate of 72,100 developed for the Regulatory Impact Analysis (see Section VI of this preamble), the fatality incidence rate is .22. The logging industry fatality incidence rate is 8.1 times higher than the fatality incidence rate the mining sector (.027), the next closest industrial division. In addition, the logging fatality rate is 53.6 times higher than the fatality rate for the manufacturing sector (.0041). 3. BLS Work Injury Report (WIR). The most detailed data source available to the Agency on logging injuries and their causes is a June 1984 BLS Work Injury Report survey of 1,086 injured logging employees, hereafter referred to as the WIR survey (Ex. 2&hyph;1). It is significant to note that all 1,086 injuries occurred within just a three-month period. 3 3 Not all questions were answered by all survey participants, therefore, total responses vary in each table of data presented. Included in the report are employees who were injured while performing logging activities at the logging site or while moving or transporting logs across terrain. Motor vehicle accidents were included when the accident occurred at the work site, while hauling logs to the mill, returning from the mill, or transporting tools, equipment, or workers to or from the logging site in company-owned vehicles. Almost one half (47%) of those responding indicated they were performing non-pulpwood logging operations, therefore they were not covered by OSHA's existing pulpwood logging standard. Another 17 percent did not know what type of timber they were logging. 4 OSHA believes it is reasonable to assume that some percentage of those employees were not covered by OSHA's existing logging standard and therefore, more than one half of the injured employees were not covered by the OSHA standard. Approximately 35 percent of the injured employees were engaged in pulpwood logging operations. 4 Of those who responded, 62 percent were engaged in clear cutting, 27 percent in selective cutting, and 8 percent in salvage logging. Approximately 4 percent did not know the type of logging being conducted. The survey also contained the following information: (1) the work site where the injury occurred (Table 4); (2) work activity being performed at the time of the accident (Table 5); (3) causes of the accidents (Table 6); (4) sources of the accidents (Tables 7&hyph;10); (5) protective equipment in use at the time of the accident (Table 11); (6) safety features of vehicles or equipments operated at the time of the accident (Table 12); (7) safety training given prior to the accident (Table 13); (8) factors contributing to the injury (Table 14); (9) severity of the injury (Table 15&hyph;16). a. Work site where injury occurred. Table 4 shows that more than one-half of employees injured were at cutting sites in the woods, while only 20 percent were injured at landings. In addition, more than one-half of those injured were working on sloping terrain at the time and more than 60 percent reported that the work site contained moderate or heavy brush.
