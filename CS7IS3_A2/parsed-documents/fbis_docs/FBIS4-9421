The surprise speaker of the meeting was Tibor Fuzessy, minister without portfolio and member of the KDNP Executive Committee, who, according to several opinions, "outlined a regular party and chairman program." The audience thanked him with a standing ovation. [Bartha] How different is the KDNP as outlined by you from the actual one? [Fuzessy] It follows a much more marked and firm line than the Christian democracy, a more Christian-social and Christian-socialist line. [Bartha] An unavoidable question nowadays: Who with whom and with whom not? Is the KDNP a bride much in demand? [Fuzessy] The KDNP has a lot of suitors. This could even be flattering, but the richer and stronger suitors do not take into consideration the fact that the bride is not only beautiful and honest, but also choosy and priggish. This bride is not lured away either by richness or power. If necessary, she is also ready to remain a maiden. [Bartha] How do you choose? [Fuzessy] Our Christian and national norms that have been formulated more firmly than ever determine whom we consider and whom we do not consider. Extremists on both sides are excluded. [Bartha] Where do you put the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]? [Fuzessy] I have not believed in Fidesz for a long time, and I continue to have reservations, but it seems that they are now crossing the bridge over the river that separates the national trends from the non-national trends, the right from the left. If they burn this bridge and have no way back, we might become allies. [Bartha] What about the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]? [Fuzessy] In 1990, the SZDSZ was a tough anti-communist party calling for a hard change in the regime. A change took place in the party after two years, and now it is ready to share power with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. I do not use the terms "lies and fraud" in political debates. However, the people formulate tough things, and they cannot put up with such a turnabout, because they feel cheated. I do not believe either that the SZDSZ could make itself suitable for cooperation with the KDNP in the last moment. [Bartha] What about the socialists? [Fuzessy] There is still no approach between the MSZP and the KDNP. I came to know several outstanding people among them who did a lot for the change in the regime, and I am also sure that they did all that out of patriotism and with patriotic conviction. However, these people were forced out of the party or were put into a quarantine within the party. They cannot assert their voices and opinions. Although in its statute, the MSZP also favors the national idea and actions, it nevertheless fails to distance itself from those who played a leading role in the anti-national policy of the last 40 years, a policy that supported foreign oppression. We also miss their distancing from those who played a leading role in quelling the national revolution [of 1956] and in the ensuing repression. Talleyrand used to say about the return of the Bourbons that they did not forget anything and did not learn anything. The same applies to the MSZP. [Bartha] What about the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]? [Fuzessy] They are not our enemies or opponents, but our competitors with whom we must compete in an honest fight. The prospects of the KDNP are better in this struggle in the long run. Our ideology is clearer and easier to outline and this will definitely be felt in four years' time, if not now. [Bartha] What about the Smallholders' Party [FKGP]? [Fuzessy] It is enough to have a tripartite government with the Fidesz and the MDF. [Bartha] You have not even considered the possibility that the MSZP might also be the winner? [Fuzessy] Nothing is impossible. Then, the president of the republic will ask them to form a government. They will return this mandate because they cannot form a majority coalition. But the second largest party, the MDF, will be able to form a majority government with the Fidesz and the KDNP. There are real chances for this. [Bartha] There are rumors according to which your precondition for a coalition is that your refuse to spend a single moment more under the same roof with Tamas Szabo and Geza Jeszenszky. [Fuzessy] It is certain that the KDNP will not form another coalition like the one in 1990, a coalition formed without any guidelines and conditions. Although, as the deputy chairman and later the head of the parliamentary group of the KDNP, I formulated the conditions and exact rules of coalition cooperation at the time, this "work" of mine did not succeed. The MDF rejected it, the Smallholders did not even bother to give an answer, and I also found myself in minority in my own party. I am convinced that this must not be repeated in any circumstances. The KDNP can only join a coalition on the basis of precisely-formulated and detailed rules. No matter which party we are talking about. [Bartha] Many people said about your speech last week that it was not only the program speech of the KDNP but also that of the party's candidate to the position of chairman. [Fuzessy] It was definitely not meant to be one. My goal was to sit down calmly for about two hours in the rat race of the election campaign and think our situation over and examine our conscience. The decision to call up the national committee after the local government elections is still valid, and this committee will decide on organizational, statute, and personnel issues. It would only be justified to hold this meeting earlier if the party failed to achieve the results it hopes for in the elections. However, in my opinion, there is no such danger.
