Russia's head of government announced this today in a short talk with journalists. According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, he knows nothing "about demands Russia is allegedly making of Belarus." He is convinced that "solutions acceptable both to Russia and to Belarus will be found." Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed out that the negotiations between Russia and Belarus "are proceeding normally." "No one has made any demands of anyone else," the prime minister emphasized. Advocating that an agreement on unifying currency systems be signed as soon as possible, the Russian head of government stated that he "opposes hasty decisions." In his opinion, "haste will not help." The prime minister is firmly convinced that the main thing is not only that an agreement should be signed, but that it should be implemented.
