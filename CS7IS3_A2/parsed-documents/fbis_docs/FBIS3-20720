The agreement, apart from the opening of postal communications and roads, anticipates the opening of the FRY office in the Republic of Croatia and the office of the Republic of Croatia in the FRY on 15 February. Vladislav Jovanovic, FRY foreign minister, told DANAS his view of the new thawing process in Serb-Croat relations. [DJ] What does the agreement mean for the signatories, the FRY and the Republic of Croatia, and what are its starting points? [Jovanovic] It means a lot for both sides, as it obliges them, in resolving the problems that divide them, to employ political means, and take the peaceful way rather than use force, which is a great step forward. Moreover, this is a demonstration of the decisiveness to start the process of normalization of relations. Our mutual aim is to complete the process as soon as possible, but naturally it anticipates new realities, primarily the fact that this is the agreement on opening official representative offices, and not an agreement on establishing diplomatic relations or on mutual recognition. This is a step in that direction, and it is in our interest, at least in the interest of the FRY, to have the process continue, develop successfully, and lead to a full normalization of relations. [DJ] What do you expect out of the agreement? [Jovanovic] We expect this agreement to influence the establishment of a better atmosphere, the creation of conditions that will enable the issues yet to arise, political issues, to be solved in conditions of peace, and with the mutual wish to reach a political solution acceptable to both sides. In the beginning we will certainly have to solve the simpler issues, the humanitarian issues that were discussed in Geneva last Sunday, and in the initial stages of the activities of the offices a direct communication will be established, which we hope will make the transfer of information easier, and render a better understanding of positions, while at the same time serve as a very reliable channel of communication between the two governments. At this moment our great common interest is that peace be achieved in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible. The fact that our positions and interests have become closer in this peace process has a positive meaning for the process. This channel of communication will, at least in the beginning, be used to encourage this peace process and to bring it to an end successfully. [DJ] Some analysts in Serbia have interpreted the quoting of the CSCE and UN principles in the signed agreement -- where the inviolability of borders is mentioned, which implies that the "Krajina" is also part of the Republic of Croatia -- as direct recognition of the Republic of Croatia within its AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders. [Jovanovic] There is no need to see in the agreement something that is not there. The agreement clearly states that it is an agreement between the two governments concerning the opening of offices, to make communication easier. It says nothing else. Since it limits its aim to what is said, it does not prejudice a single open issue, not only of the Krajina, but also of the division balance, mutual recognition, and even the establishment of full diplomatic relations. All this should happen when conditions are favorable. There have been instances in the past in which it was shown that the opening of an office in one country does not imply the recognition within the borders it aspires for. For instance, when the United States opened an office in China, that did not mean that the United States was acknowledging Taiwan as an indivisible part of China. The United States still has a different opinion from China's regarding its borders. Therefore, relations should not be unnecessarily complicated by showing wishes as reality, or rushing reality into assuming the form of the wishes. We must bear in mind the fact that the issue of the Krajina is connected to the Vance plan, which says that its political future, its final status, must be resolved through direct negotiations between the legitimate representatives of the Krajina and the Republic of Croatia. This is yet to happen, and with this agreement we have created favorable conditions for starting it. Before the negotiations take place, an absolute end should be put to all hostilities. After that the practical issues will be resolved, which will provide the conditions for starting political negotiations. This is reality; as it is, and not as someone would like to make it. [DJ] As in Yugoslavia, this agreement was met with controversial opinions and interpretations in Croatia.... [Jovanovic] Nothing that has not been done has been acknowledged, and nothing has been written that has not been said. Therefore, it is a matter of wishes and of the approach to a document -- interpreting it in one or another way, seeing various things in it. With much use of political imagination many things can be seen. After all, we live in the world of reality, and political imagination should be used more as an incentive for a constant mending of the world of reality than for replacing it with something illusory. It is natural to have criticism, suspicions, and reservations in both countries, which is probably the consequence of maximalist expectations and wishes, but the essence of this agreement is of a limited, modest scope. It is more important as a demonstration of political will and the decision of the two sides to start, in an organized way, toward full normalization of relations, which assumes the previous conclusion of peace, which is near. If it meant something else, then we would have nothing to deal with; all the problems would have been solved. Unfortunately, the agreement means nothing but a first step toward a real, normal situation, and establishing conditions for general cooperation between neighbors, which we hope will become reality one day. The sooner it does, the better it will be for both sides. [DJ] What is your comment on Mr. Martic's being elected president of the "Krajina"? Is he someone who could make the political negotiations on the future of the "Krajina" and the Serb-Croat relations in general easier or more difficult? [Jovanovic] Individuals can play a certain role in the development of political processes, but not a crucial one. The process will develop within the complex of the relevant elements, and individuals can only adjust these elements in a reasonably successful way. I do not know Mr. Martic personally, and know Mr. Babic only superficially. I think that they are both of the same generation, they have the same attachment to the Krajina, its political goals. I do not believe that there is a great difference between them; Mr. Martic is probably more composed and is probably able to control his emotions and nerves better. This is probably one of his advantages in negotiation processes with any side. According to what I know, he is a man of principle, a fanatic, and at the same time he is serious in conversation. I think that his nomination should not be taken as an additional difficulty in the negotiation process and the normalization of Croat-Serb relations. [DJ] The European Community will consider the introduction of sanctions against the Republic of Croatia, on account of its alleged involvement in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Jovanovic] We do not support sanctions. The entire experience of recent history has shown that sanctions have created more problems than they have solved. This is best seen by the example of Yugoslavia. The sanctions were supposed to lead to peace in Bosnia, and they only lead to the escalation of war, and peace is further away than it was. They also caused destabilization -- not only in Yugoslavia, but in the wider area, and became the greatest obstacle to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned, the fact is that the Serbs and Croats there had no significant dispute, or bitterness, to be more precise. To my knowledge, the conflicts had a relatively limited scope, and there was a great amount of mutual responsibility for the consequences of what they did to each other. This probably resulted in the preservation of mutual trust, and later served as the basis for their intra-Bosnian agreement on peace and cooperation. It is known that they have signed the declaration on stopping the war and establishing offices parallel with the signing of a similar statement by the FRY and the Republic of Croatia. This is in itself a positive fact in all-round Serb-Croat relations, which can have a constructive role on the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia, as well as help to find just final solutions to all the problems that the two most populous south Slavic nations share, and that complicate their relations and their lives. [DJ] What is your comment on the controversies in the foreign policies of some European countries and the United States concerning the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia? [Jovanovic] Relations between the United States and European countries are not too clear, nor can they be interpreted and placed in certain categories. There are many changes, and they alter position frequently, depending on the development of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At this moment it seems that Europe cares more about peace in Bosnia than about keeping the sanctions. Italian minister Andreatta has recently said that the sanctions have turned out to be the main obstacle to peace. [DJ] There is a thesis that weak Muslims are the aim of both Europe and the United States, and that by supporting Alija Izetbegovic's option the United States is in fact paying off its debt to the Islamic countries, and actually encouraging the Muslims to fight the war so that they can lose it. [Jovanovic] The area for speculation is wide open. There is not enough substance for either statement, but there is enough space for various assumptions. What you have said is certain, the United States is trying to pay as much debt to the Islamic countries as possible through the Bosnian crisis, and it thus wishes to be rehabilitated in their eyes. On the other hand, it is in the interest of US politics to divert the attention of the Islamic world from the Middle East for a while, and draw it to Bosnia, so that Israel could freely reach a solution with the PLO that would suit it. These are U.S. strategic interests. Whether, apart from that, it has a strategic view of the so-called Muslim presence in Bosnia, whether it wants to make it weaker, if not destroy it, through this policy, or make it stronger and dominant, remains to be speculated on. The theory of keeping the Muslims in Bosnia, or of repressing them, is not a theory we deal with, because it does not correspond to reality. We even think that it would be wrong if the politics of any country were to contain such a theory concerning the Bosnian crisis. [DJ] How do you see the future of Serb-Croat relations? [Jovanovic] It is too early to say. The fact is that we have started the process that increases the chances of there being mutual political visits and of actualizing political contacts in a direct way, and not, as until now, through mediators. This is the natural means that two countries wishing to settle their relations should employ in order to save time and to prevent foreign commissioners from organizing their relations. The upcoming visit of deputy prime minister Zeljko Simic to Zagreb is a step in that direction. This is a chance of viewing certain problems that will be brought up by either side, and it is difficult to say in advance what the plan for resolving them will be. After that foreign minister Mate Granic will probably visit Belgrade, and it is possible that there will be contacts of a different kind, perhaps at a higher level. [DJ] Apart from the establishing of telephone lines between the Republic of Croatia and the FRY, the opening of the Zagreb-Belgrade highway was also announced. This road partly passes through a "Krajina"-controlled area? [Jovanovic] As far as the opening of these communications is concerned, nothing can be done without the consent of the Krajina and without the Krajina consulting with the Republic of Croatia. I do not see the Krajina being a problem there. On the contrary, it has stated that it was prepared to cooperate with Croatia and Yugoslavia in the opening of these communications, and this, naturally, implies that both sides should benefit from it. This benefit is practical and material, as well as relating to property, which is an advantage of the policy of small steps, reminiscent as it is of the eternal truth that success feeds on success, and success in these relations should mean success for all sides, and not only for one. [Box, p 17] Vladislav Jovanovic on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Statement Mr. Zhirinovskiy made a statement about air attacks to Serb positions in Bosnia being a declaration of war to Russia, and implying Russia's resignation from the UN, in his figurative-rhetorical style, probably to thus substantiate the fact that Russia, the Russian society, is not insensitive to what is happening in the Balkans, and that it is an area in which Russia has traditional interest, so it would be very sensitive to the drastic use of force against one of the nations that belong to the same Christian faith as the Russian people. This is the only way I see that statement, rather than as a literal description of reactions and the form of these reactions. Therefore, I see it as pointing out the well-known fact that any drastic use of force by a non-Balkan people would certainly cause a strong Russian reaction, and that this should be borne in mind before making inaccurate calculations. This is the way I took Mr. Zhirinovskiy's statement, and I hope that others have done the same.
