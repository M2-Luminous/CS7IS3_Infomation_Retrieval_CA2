"China needs the strong government that it has. It may be authoritarian, but it is better than anarchy," said Mahathir. "Business needs order," he declared. "For the moment the interest of the majority demands an orderly society," he said in a speech at a two-day international conference here on the "socialist market economy." Mahathir advocated controlled development of a market economy. He said "it is right in not attempting a radical political about- turn simultaneously" with economic reforms. The Malaysian premier strongly criticised western countries and accused them of wanting to weaken China. "This proselytising for democracy veils only slightly the objective of eliminating competition before it begins," he said. "They would like the East Asian democracies to be weak and unstable like theirs," he said, denouncing proposals by some nations for a worldwide minimum wage clause in the final text of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Mahathir said he supported a strong China, which he described as an "engine of growth firstly for East Asia, including Southeast Asia, and the world." "Southeast Asia should have no fear of a wealthy and strong China."
