Corporal Kim Chol-chin and Private First Class Kim Kyong-chol of the Korean People's Security Forces have returned to the bosom of the socialist fatherland through Panmunjom today. They had their boat shipwrecked on the West Sea off Tungsangot in an unexpected accident on 26 January. Drifting toward the South, they were abducted by the enemy. The South Korean puppets, instead of (?immediately) returning our men whom they took away with them, detained them, and attempted to have them defect with all sorts of appeasement and deception, but failed to bend the revolutionary fidelity and will of the soldiers who had been brought up in the bosom of our comrade supreme commander to be one-a-match-for-a hundred soldiers. Unable to resist the stubborn protest of the detained soldiers and our side's repeated demand, they had to return them to the northern half of the Republic. According to the final agreement between the secretaries of the two sides of the Military Armistice Commission, the soldiers of the Korean People's Security Forces who fought among the enemies sustaining the revolutionary faith came to the bosom of the socialist fatherland crossing the Military Demarcation Line proudly in military uniform at 1510 today. They reported in high spirits to a Korean People's Army major general who came to Panmunjom to greet them on their return to the bosom of comrade supreme commander, and cried out, "Long live our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il." At Panmunjom, the soldiers of the People's Army and the working people of Kaesong warmly greeted them, offering them bundles of flowers and hanging flower garlands on them. Then a news conference was held at Tongilgak. They exposed that the South Korean puppets employed all sorts of maneuvers to have them defect. They said that they were able to return to the bosom of the socialist fatherland thanks to our comrade supreme commander and that they will become loyalists and dutiful children protecting and defending comrade supreme commander by making themselves guns and bombs.
