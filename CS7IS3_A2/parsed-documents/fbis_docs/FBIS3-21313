Lobbying is an accepted way of life in America's democracy, and the institution is nearly as old as the signing of the Declaration of Independence 200 years old. Lobbying firms have proliferated in Washington over the years. For a price these seek to influence policy-makers, legislators and the media in favour of their clients. In the case of the Indian Embassy, the price is half a million dollars a year. This could well represent a sum equal to or greater than the total salary bill of the embassy officials and staff, but that is not the reason for the sense of unease here. The real reasons are possibly two: doubts about what lobbyists can actually achieve, especially when their goals are not clearly defined and may possibly even be difficult to lay down, and an appropriately perceived loss of prestige for the doubtlessly competitive Indian Foreign Service whose officers do not make less effective diplomats than the equivalent service of any other country, no matter how powerful or well-versed in the politics among nations. India slipping in its own eyes?: It is perhaps for these very reasons that the idea of hiring lobbyists had been shot down before by the Government, and constitutes a controversial decision today. The idea did not take off even in the Eighties when Pakistan was playing havoc with the Indian image on both Punjab and Kashmir in the United States through its own hired lobbying firm. Ironically, the "pro-lobbyists" have won when only half that problem remains in the sense that the Punjab militancy is seen as being no longer a day-to-day nightmare. It needs to be noted that big, strong or influential nations do not have a record of hiring lobbyists in Washington. In that sense, going for one now may reflect India slipping in its own eyes. Some of the P-4, i.e., the former USSR or now Russia, Britain, France and China (excluding for this discussion the United States among the Permanent Members of the Security Council, as lobbying is resorted to for a favourable impact inside America) are known to have used the services of lobbyists for specific, single assignments but never on a sustained basis with an omnibus brief, as appears to be the case with the hiring of the firm of Mcauliffe, Kelly and Rafaeilli by India. Indeed, lobbying can achieve little if it is not in tandem with the broad perceptions of U.S. policy. It would no doubt be accepted even by the lobbyists for Pakistan, for instance, that they could not get their client off the hook on Pressler, even though Pakistan has had the ear of the U.S. establishment for four decades as a close associate in the ideological conflict against the former Soviet Union and was a certified "frontline State" while the war in Afghanistan lasted. It is difficult to imagine, for instance, that even the most impressive lobbying effort could sell the case for Iraq, Libya, Cuba or North Korea in Washington, or, for that matter, Moscow, in its earlier incarnation. In India's own case, shortly after independence when New Delhi was yet to be regarded as a "Soviet ally" by Washington, nothing that the powerful world personality of Nehru projected could persuade the United States to back the development of the public sector in this country, though both nations saw each other as civilised democracies. It is doubtful if lobbyists would have succeeded where Nehru had failed. It would not be unfair to the American lobbyists to suggest that their most notable successes lie on the domestic agenda. Lobby firms make it a practice of donating funds to election campaigns of politicians, and this is a key strength in their dealings on Capital Hill. Lobbyists (against India) also do well when constituencies of politicians include Khalistanis, PoK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir] expatriates, or Pakistanis in useful numbers. But in the final analysis they work out best for an overseas client when American policy goals converge with the brief a lobbyist is handed. It is not clear what brief India expects its lobbyist in Washington to handle. Is it the economy and the flow of private foreign capital and business? Boot on other leg: The boot is on the other leg, really. Were the Americans themselves not lobbying India hard at the highest level for decades for a change in its economic structure so that U.S. business interest could be attracted? And when this did begin to happen, did American business not show a keen interest? That was well before a lobbyist was retained. Can India realistically look to a lobbyist to get it past the U.S. establishment on NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], or the Kashmir question, or human rights, especially when these are centre-stage for policy-framers in Washington? Unfortunately, these cannot be achieved through hired retainers, but through national will, and skilful and augmented diplomacy. China presents a striking example of this. Recent visitors from the United States have suggested that the American executive and the legislature are crowded with men and women who have spent time in this country as Peace Corps volunteers, and a large number of them still see India through friendly eyes. Has the embassy in Washington, for a start, even sought to tap a natural reservoir of goodwill such as this, before rushing into lobbies of the image-building industry?
