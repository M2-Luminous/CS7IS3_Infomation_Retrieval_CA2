Kozyrev's statement said the Baltic states violate the rights of people of Russian origin on an ethnic basis. He accused them of planning forcible deportation of thousands of people and an ethnic cleansing. The institute declared that the international CSCE, U.N. and Council of Europe commissions have not observed in the Baltic states violations of human rights on an ethnic basis. The institute voiced the opinion that accusations of human rights violations stem from Russia's interest in keeping its forces in the Baltic states and subjecting those countries to its imperialistic ambitions.
