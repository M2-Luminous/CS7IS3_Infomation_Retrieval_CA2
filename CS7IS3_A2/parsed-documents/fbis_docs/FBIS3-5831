The rights of Michael Fay, the boy in question in a case of vandalism, had not been violated. This was acknowledged by the U.S. Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Ralph Boyce. For the record, President Bill Clinton was not suggesting that, either. He was careful to confine his protest to the Singapore Government to the caning portion of the sentence, the part he found "extreme". He said he hoped this would be "reconsidered" -- after paying due recognition to Singapore's sovereign right to exercise the law in its jurisdiction. Indeed it would; an appeal is pending against the sentence, which was four months' jail, six lashes and a fine of $3,500. As with all appeals, the courts will dispose of this one without undue delay and in strict conformity with the law and the facts of the case. The verdict will take no account of extraneous influences and factors, a fact which Americans who are known to cherish the primacy of the written law should have no difficulty appreciating. Incredulity would be the reaction of many a Singaporean who learns that the world's most powerful politician, upon prompting from a reporter's question in the White House last Friday, has taken a personal interest in a case which concerns neither political hostage-taking nor a breach of national security. The President must be a busy man. The strain of putting out fires abroad (Bosnia, Somalia, difficult relations with China and Japan) and shepherding a controversial health-reform package at home has now been compounded by a deepening personal crisis as he and his wife, Hillary, face an investigation into a land deal they were party to in their early years. But then, incredulity might turn to approval among some that Mr. Clinton, burdened as he is had stood up for a fellow American in his belief -- that privilege he is entitled to -- that the boy had been dealt with harshly. American politicians have to answer to demanding constituents, yes. A subject for political enjoinment can be as big or as trivial as the public chooses to make it. Singaporeans who find his intervention objectionable need to understand that heroic gestures go down well with the American public. Though this case clearly qualifies as interference by the White House, they gain nothing by overreacting. Better a cool and dignified response. Singaporeans have no reason to be defensive about the stringency of the laws they live by and which foreign nationals domiciled here are subject to. This principle is accepted, it is non-negotiable. The Government's response to American pressure has been proper, firm and clinical. It has set out the facts of past prosecutions for vandalism and the equal weight of the law applied, whoever the accused was. Thirteen Singaporeans were among 15 persons aged between 18 and 21 who received jail and caning sentences in the last five years. This should end the argument. The American Chamber of Commerce here, while "shaken" by the caning order, volunteers that Singapore's aggressive enforcement of law and order (its words) is one reason this is an attractive place to live and do business in. Singapore neither seeks nor gets chuffed by such observations. It is just one of numerous societal benchmarks it chose to set for itself. Governments whose nationals have breached these standards must accept that it is improper to do anything which might influence the course of justice. An Australian arrested with eight other foreign students, including Fay, last October jumped bail. He is thought to have fled the country. Cases against a Malaysian, a Hongkonger and a second American are pending. The Malaysian and British authorities have kept clear -- decorously. The U.S. Government, having monitored the Fay case since his arrest, as is its convention of helping nationals in distress abroad, should have known when to back off.
