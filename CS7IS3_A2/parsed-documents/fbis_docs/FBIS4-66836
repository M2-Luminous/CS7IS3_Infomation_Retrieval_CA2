It is an Upper Egyptian society that has alternated much between the oppression of historical changes and the harshness of geographical realities. There are three sensitive points that must be carefully noted when you visit Asyut: - An investigation into the nature of terrorist action there confirms that Asyut's terrorism is a very special case. - A change in the old development program is responsible for the issuance of harsh laws against the dead--who died years ago! - A close reading of the results of the parties' role shows that they define the type of land on which the rising generations stand, and the future of the promising generations, and exposes the gap between the separate generations. These three points meet in vicious circles, and come close enough to meet in a place that was already prepared for high temperatures, and tribal conflicts and struggles passed from grandfather to father to son. The voice of vengeance still prevails as the way to solve most issues. An environment that seeks deliberately to hurt itself by spending most of its money on purchasing and stockpiling arms. There is pride--great pride--taken in owning the greatest number of weapons, and the most modern varieties. Extremism paid a visit, and found the climate suitable; the worry is that this will be not only a visit but a permanent stay! How can the heat been turned down under this smoldering society? What levels of development can turn its tendency toward hostility into the direction of constructive aspirations? And what are the sure ways of delivering it from the evil of extremism? Come, let us move in closer to the details of this picture, and look for the answers in this report. Asyut is now experiencing the calm after the storm, the storm of events it experienced before the month of Ramadan, and the period following the 'Id al-Fitr [post-Ramadan holiday]. But the overworked security forces are trying to consolidate this calm with sufficient guarantees so that it will not be affected by winds blowing from any direction. Despite the extremist groups' claim that the security forces persist in pursuing them and ridding the governorate of them, they have adopted a new tactic in carrying out their criminal operations: trying to take advantage of the nature of the geography in the extremists' areas, far from the commercial center of the governorate. Coca-Cola Vendor The situation did, in fact, turn into something like a cat-and-mouse game. The groups contrived new methods of disguise. The members carrying out the operations were dressed like a variety of persons: a Coca-Cola vendor; a fruit seller; a salesman of ready-to-wear apparel who visited houses to sell his goods. Sometimes they used the role of a distributor of butane gas pipes, and still other methods to find out the addresses of the people they were targeting, as well as to complete the process of misrepresentation. They also depended on people of specific ages, between 14 and 18 years, most of them students, to carry out [their operations]. And so young people of this age are monitored by the security forces, and arouse the suspicions of the citizens of Asyut now, whenever they walk by. On another front, the groups carry out their strikes at any hour of the day or night, while in past months they were confined to night time. They have tried to make their wicked missions successful by relying on two factors: the first is belief that they can act freely now that a number of senior officers have been transferred out of Asyut in the last round of transfers, in the belief that the new officers would need time to find out where they were active; and the second is their attempt to flee and hide within seconds, when they needed, in the topographical slopes in the curving range of hills and cane fields surrounded by the hills on at least three sides. They also have hide-outs in the mountain hollows created by natural formations in long-past geological eras. All These Arms? All these arms and ammunition...where did Asyut get them? Most of the people we asked were as surprised as we were, and were not generous with straight answers. They did just allow us to put our ears to some of the locked doors so that we could hear from one of the "chat" sessions that: - Most of the arms and ammunitions of all types do not come from outside the governorate. - Security forces are sparing no effort to control unlicensed arms and infringements of the licensing and confiscation law. But within just a day or two after the date of withdrawing arms, the violators were obtaining alternative arms by all methods. Because of the revengeful atmosphere, some prominent citizens keep, in their own way, a balance in the quantity and type of arms in their families, to keep up with what neighboring families have. As to those in the middle, who feel secure that they are not condemned by the vengeance of other families, or vice versa, they are not averse to selling some of them at high prices, regardless of who is doing the buying! We cannot ignore another important point, which is that some citizens are hell-bent on revenge; if there happens to be a terrorist incident and the relative of one of these is wounded by a bullet along with the intended target, and if he knows who the terrorist perpetrator was, he only very rarely tells the police. Why? Because he believes that if he passes it on, the legal measures will take a long time reaching trial and punishment. This, he thinks, belittles his honor; it is preferable to to keep the identity secret until such time as he can take his own revenge in Upper Egyptian style. Suspicion Security forces have recently expanded their field of investigation and suspicion, with the aim of establishing control over the movements of terrorist elements and containing them no matter where they are. This is now being implemented by way of vehicle patrols and permanent and mobile ambushes, although the officers involved say their mission is difficult and very tough and the stuff of rumors, for many reasons. Chiefly, the residents of the historically poorest rural areas have never taken much care to register their births, or get identification cards. It has reached the point where marriages are held publicly and licitly but without official documents for a long period. In addition, some fathers hope that by not registering the births of their sons they can save them from having to perform military service. On top of all this, Upper Egyptians by nature have habits and customs grounded on their knowledge of others through the family tree, and are always angered by anyone whose asks them to produce identification cards. The Gap Are the channels of communication and contact open between the university and various other segments of society? Dr. Muhammad al-Subayti, vice rector of Asyut University, was the first to offer an answer: "We have limited responsibility in lecture rooms in all actuality. This has deprived us of political representation, even though most of us are natives of Asyut, and some are afraid to deal with us, to confirm that we will face the bitter truth of the scale of the terrorist tragedy and those behind the escalation of extremism. We will announce publicly: security requires the cooperation of other parties in order for the current wave of terrorism to be overcome. Yet these other parties prefer not to appear." The expression "political opportunism" was used early by Dr. Muhammad Kamil, Dean of the Faculty of Commerce, indicating that the distribution of political roles is not commensurate with the level of the governorate have been overwhelmed by influential families, including prominent citizens, in view of the fact that the majority, which includes numerous intellectuals, found itself prevented from playing any role. The majority thus grew frustrated. Dr. Kamil believes that this frustration could add a new negative dimension to a society in which development has, in recent years, strayed from acknowledged standards--thus leading to the development of extremism. Professor of Chemistry at Asyut University's Faculty of Sciences, Dr. Mahmud Zarif Badr, says, however, that the parties' failure to serve the masses, and to take serious action to find solutions to problems, led to a serious political vaccuum. Had these parties been built on sound foundations, bringing together in their ranks models of awareness, and been keen on the public interest, they would have succeeded in carrying out their mission, and thus helped rid Asyut of the evil of extremism. Assistant Professor of Agriculture at Asyut University Dr. Ibrahim Faraj points to the fact that the door of political participation is closed to professors and intellectuals, helped to attract the circle of terrorism to extremist elements among the young generation. Especially as interest and follow-up on the part of the mosques were late in coming. We asked him: But can't they in turn play a role out of a feeling of responsibility? "It is hard to hold awareness, counsel, and guidance meetings as long as that is not asked of them to avoid misunderstanding!" What of the role of responsibility toward development? "Many commissions visit their committees in the governorate, but their course is being limited and their members are asked not to have friction with the university." Do you have studies and research in this regard? "Many, and linked to the governorate's situation, but unfortunately we send them to specialized authorities, where they remain in desk drawers and we get no reply." So, what, in your view, is the reason? "Ask them!" And so... These are the details of the picture in Asyut; more light needs to be shed upon it. We need to examine and isolate its mingled colors, over and over again, so that we may know which one is blurring the picture of stability in the whole governorate.
