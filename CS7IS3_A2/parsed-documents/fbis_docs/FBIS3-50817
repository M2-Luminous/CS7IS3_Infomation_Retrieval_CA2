It is an "open secret" that if Eduardo Frei is elected president, Juan Villarzu will be his minister of finance. He feels uncomfortable about this "assumption." However, as the man in charge of the economic program of the Concertacion coalition, he was willing to answer our questions. He emphasized: "There has been no discussion about who will head which ministry. Eduardo has been very clear about that. First, we have to win the election." Villarzu Rohde is 49 years old and is married to Maria Olivia Avalos. They have three children of their own, in addition to two children from her first marriage, and one granddaughter. He is of Basque and German descent. He thinks that the German blood which he inherited from his mother, "a German woman born in Germany," is the predominant force in his character. He was practically an only child. (His sister died at an early age.) He was educated in the rigorous program at the Colegio Aleman [German College]. Hence his sense of discipline and the demands he makes on himself. He has a calm and methodical outlook. [Correa] Are you hard or soft? [Villarzu] Neither hard nor soft. I am rather firm in my convictions. [Correa] Are you more a politician or more an economist? [Villarzu] "I find that I am more of an economist, although many people say no." (He laughs discreetly.) "I feel more comfortable as an economist." Having had broad, executive experience, he is recognized as having "good leadership qualities and the ability to direct groups." He is reflective, "although also rather intuitive." He says that he believes very much in what he would call "guts"--"what makes me feel things. I tend to concentrate on the major arguments for or against something." [Correa] And when you have made a decision, are you able to change your mind? [Villarzu] "I am capable of thinking things over. However, frankly, I am a little stubborn." On economic matters in general he says: "I am a great believer in competition as a very central element in the functioning of the economy. I believe in efforts to improve the way markets operate. The only way for Chile to achieve stable development over the medium term of years is in an economic structure which is increasingly more open to the world." [Correa] More open than it already is? [Villarzu] In the sense of the view over the long term, I have no doubt about it. That means making greater efforts at integration with Latin America. [Correa] Does that mean giving priority to economic treaties with the Third World? [Villarzu] Our natural habitat is Latin America. I am not among those who believe in saying, "Goodbye, Latin America." [Correa] Would you rather be on the side of the losers? [Villarzu] "No. I believe that, over the long term, Latin America will be among the winners. Argentina and Bolivia are going in that direction. In general, so is the rest of Latin America. I also believe that we can make much more progress in opening up the Chilean economy from the financial point of view." The other principle in which he firmly believes--although he refuses to consider himself an "original thinker" in this regard--is stability. He said: "I believe very strongly in the need to continue reducing inflation." [Correa] When do you hope to reach single digit inflation? [Villarzu] "In 1997." In his economic credo there is also the view, "that the people can build their own future with their own resources. This is the idea of investment in people." "I am convinced that a mixture of adequate, macroeconomic policies, including opening up the economy and investing in the people, is the recipe for success. If you add political and social stability to that, you have all of the ingredients to turn us into an economic tiger some day." He explains meticulously, "When I talk about an open economy, I am talking about a market economy where the principal, productive element is the private sector, in its different forms." [Correa] Did you learn that at the University of Chicago?" [Villarzu] I have always thought that. This is the Christian Democratic view of things. [Correa] Did you support the establishment of "a communitarian society?" [Villarzu] The concept of a communitarian society traditionally accepted the idea that private parties were essentially private. However, then we gave priority to the idea of companies owned by the workers, and in these the state has always played a subsidiary role. The social doctrine of the [Catholic] Church was the first to introduce into Chile the idea of a subordinate role for the state. Then the Christian Democratic movement incorporated this idea into its view of economic development. [Correa] Are you getting ready to use the stairways to climb the 12 floors of the Ministry of Finance? [Villarzu] He laughed openly and said: "I do not think that I could. I am a half frustrated sportsman. I always try to engage in sports. What I do more regularly is play tennis." He is a good skier and has tried to play golf. He said: "Chess interests me very much and especially bridge." He makes a practice of riding his bike through his neighborhood. However, he is not very determined about sports. He said: "The only consistent thing is that I always try to engage in some kind of physical activity." His favorite weekends are spent at his home in Zapallar, "which we visit as often as possible." He is devoted to reading, from technical books--including books on economic theory--to the poetry of Garcia Lorca. He misses his university offices (He was chairman of the Departments of Economics at the University of Chile and the Catholic University of Chile). Over the past few months he has spent all of his time on the economic program of the Concertacion coalition. He is rather reserved. He prefers to spend his time in the company of friends and hates gambling. He likes to dance and says that he is "good at rock and roll dancing." On his list of "things to learn" he said that he has included the tango. When he talks about "salsa" music, the methodical, serious, and inhibited man that he seems to be disappears completely. He is also devoted to jazz and classical music. His favorite composer is Mozart. He is a successful businessman and international consultant. He believes that, "My heart is more inclined toward economics. From my involvement in economics I have had close contact with the business world but, in fact, I have given up being a businessman. However, although I have done rather well, to tell you the truth, this is not what has given me the most satisfaction. I feel much more comfortable in activity connected to the public service and the government." [Correa] Would you feel very disappointed if Frei were elected and he did not offer you the Ministry of Finance? [Villarzu] This economist, who was born in Arica and is a graduate of the University of Chicago, spoke very seriously and was in perfect control of himself when he replied: "No. Frankly, I would like to be a part of the next government, but that does not mean doing so in any particular ministry. I believe that I am in a position to make a contribution in different areas and as a function of what the president considers appropriate. I believe that if Frei is elected, he will set his stamp on the government." [Correa] And what is the "Frei stamp"? [Villarzu] Senator Frei gives priority to teamwork. He gives a great deal of freedom to those who work with him so that they can fully develop their potential. He listens a great deal and makes decisions with a great sense of timeliness. It is very difficult to force him to make decisions. [Correa] Are you an unusual "Chicago boy"? [Villarzu] "Chicago boys" here are known as those who received an undergraduate degree at the Catholic University of Chile. But some of us also went to the University of Chile--Carlos Massad, Andres Sanfuentes, and Roberto Zahler. In general, their view of the role of the economy and of national development is rather different from the view of those considered to be "Chicago boys." [Correa] But the recipe which you brought back to an economically prostrate Chile was the most "Chicago style" of all. [Villarzu] There are elements--such as stability, an open economy, opening up the economy to the world, and competition--which are considered of very central importance at the School of Economics of the University of Chicago. Even on the subject of investment the people at the University of Chicago were pioneers. This is the neoclassical view of the economy. However, you have to keep in mind that Jorge Cauas, who was a key figure in formulating the economic policy of the Military Government, was not of the Chicago school. [Correa] Which economist should go down in history as the leader of that process? [Villarzu] "There were different phases. Cauas played a much more important role during a very critical period at the beginning of the Military Government." During that phase Villarzu himself was director of the budget. "The opening up of the economy began in a real way in 1975 when Jorge Cauas was minister of finance. He had a great deal of support from De Castro. If I had to list the most important names, I would mention Cauas, De Castro, and Miguel Kast, three men who were of the greatest importance in the formulation of what was called `the model.'" [Correa] He was more important than Buchi? [Villarzu] Buchi was important because during the 1982-1983 crisis the "model" was almost completely abandoned. He returned to the central line of the economic policies begun in 1974. He succeeded in reestablishing credibility and in redirecting the economy. He deserves a great deal of credit for that. [Correa] What was "the great achievement" of Foxley? [Villarzu] He succeeded in giving form to the model of growth with equity which brought in more important elements of macroeconomic leadership, adding to it, and with great determination, the component of social justice. The neoliberal view of Buchi gave priority to growth as the central, controlling element of the strategy of development, fundamentally supported by the activity of the private sector and minimizing state activity to the maximum extent. And the people profited because the benefits of that growth sooner or later went to them. [Correa] And is that not correct? Can there be development without growth? [Villarzu] The fact is that in a society like that of Chile, where great social differences coexist, side by side, it must be assumed that a third party--the Armed Forces or an authoritarian government--will guarantee political, economic, and social stability. In a free society it is very difficult for an economy to move forward quickly in coexistence with economic sectors living in extreme poverty. The "Buchi model" presupposed that social conflict will be regulated in another way. [Correa] Does this mean that Buchi would not have been successful in a democracy? [Villarzu] Exactly. A refusal to raise pensions to allow for inflation and adjusting the economy by decreasing spending on health, education, and infrastructure would have generated such tension that it would have been impossible to succeed in maintaining growth. In a free society long term growth is maintained in a framework of political and social stability. That presupposes that all Chileans clearly perceive that the benefits of the efforts made are distributed equitably. [Correa] But that is not the situation today. [Villarzu] We have made significant progress. And that is the fundamental difference between the "Buchi model" and the "Foxley model." The economy has grown at an average of 6.3 percent over the past four years. This is practically the same as during the last five years of the Military Government, when the figure was 6.4 percent. Simultaneously, inflation has declined from about 30 percent annually, which is what we had at the end of 1989, to about 12 or 12.5 percent in 1993. The external position of the country is much more solid, so solid that it will make it possible for us to resolve our international crisis without any difficulty. [Correa] But the economy is shrinking, and it is expected that 1994 will be "a discouraging year." [Villarzu] I do not think so. Investment, which is what makes it possible to maintain long-term growth, has been extraordinarily high in the private sector. The coefficient of investment--the proportion between investment and Gross Domestic Product--will exceed 27 percent. During this election year, when investment normally tends to stop, private investment will grow between 15 and 20 percent in real terms. During the administration of President Aylwin the economy has performed better than it did during the best years of the Military Government, the period from 1985 to 1989. And, simultaneously, notable progress has been made on social matters, such as reducing the number of the poor to about 1.3 million. Among the poor about 800,000 are destitute. Between 1985 and 1989 minimum salaries fell by 2.7 percent in real terms. During 1993 they will grow by about 10 percent, on the average. The rate of unemployment has declined to a substantial extent. [Correa] The average growth rate of 6.4 percent during the period in office of the present administration will decline to 4.0 or 5.0 percent. Some people say that it will decline even more. [Villarzu] During the present administration the economy grew at an average rate of 6.3 percent, despite the fact that in 1990 it grew by only 3.0 percent, as a result of the restrictive measures taken to slow down too rapid an expansion of the economy, in part caused by the expansionist policy followed by the previous administration for what were, I believe, electoral purposes. That situation made it necessary to cool off the economy. [Correa] And what will the next administration inherit from the present one? [Villarzu] Starting in 1993, the Chilean economy began to feel the full force of the international situation--a recession in Europe and stagnation in the United States and Japan. That process began at the end of 1990, and the greatest impact was felt in the United States in 1991, the only year in which the North American economy recorded a net decline. That situation will have less of an impact in Chile in 1993 than in the past because we have diversified our export base. And now a third of our exports are going to other countries in the Americas; a third of our exports are going to Asia and the Pacific; and a third of our exports are going to Europe and the Middle East. As the impact of the international deterioration has not been the same everywhere, that has also made it possible for us to deal with it more effectively. We are feeling the impact of the recession now because, in addition to the decline in demand, the prices of some of our key export products have fallen. This effect will be with us during part of 1994. [Correa] Will it be stronger than it was in 1993? [Villarzu] No. It is difficult to see how prices--such as that for copper--could deteriorate more than they have up to this point. The average price will be lower than it was in 1993 but not lower than it is today. I would say that the worst period of the international recession is already over. We are feeling its impact, which will continue with us for some time and then will change as the world economy becomes more active. Already there are clear signs of recovery in the external economy. For example, it is expected that in 1993 the United States will have a minimum growth rate of 2.7 percent. Some people are talking about a figure closer to 3.0 percent in 1994. In Europe, where the most complicated case is Germany, it is estimated that in 1993 there will be a decline of between 2.0 and 2.5 percent in Gross Domestic Product. However, virtually all of the analysts are talking about a recovery in the German economy in 1994. That is a situation reflected in all of the economies of the world. The recovery will be slow, and we will feel its effects toward the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995. There be a year of slower growth in 1994 than 1993. The year 1993 was not a "bad year" for an economy which grows at that level, when the world economy has grown by an average of about 2.0 percent. [Correa] Is there no danger of a new adjustment? [Villarzu] No. The adjustment has been taking place only gradually. When an economy like that of Chile--which exports 35 percent of its Gross Domestic Product--encounters weak, external demand, there is less domestic activity. That is what is happening. [Correa] If you were minister of finance, would you favor expanding or diminishing the role of the state? [Villarzu] I am for strengthening the state. Not enlarging it but giving it the necessary tools to transform itself by articulating the process of development and the common efforts being made by employers, workers, and society. [Correa] You have said that you are in favor of privatizing "everything that can be privatized." Where would you begin? [Villarzu] I would begin with companies which are not private monopolies and which are engaged in open activities. [Correa] Would you privatize CODELCO [Chilean Copper Corporation] under any circumstances? [Villarzu] Under no circumstances. Candidate Alessandri used to say that he would privatize CODELCO, but later he changed his mind. CODELCO is a strategic enterprise. It must be made into an efficient one. That is the most profitable kind of company that we could have. [Correa] Chile has assets worth billions of dollars which bring in an average return of 3.0 percent. Without CODELCO that return would decline to 0.5 percent. Do you not consider that sufficient proof of inefficiency? [Villarzu] No. Among that group of state-owned companies is ENACAR [National Coal Enterprise], which loses a lot of money. The company is engaged in a process of rationalization and reconversion. State companies should be in a position to operate as if they were private companies. Therefore, we are preparing a draft Statute of Public Enterprises. We must insist that they be as efficient and open in their operations as if they were private corporations. [Correa] Regarding the program for modernizing CODELCO, are you prepared to reduce employment by 4,000, since, according to some studies, these workers are no longer needed by the company? [Villarzu] We are prepared to do so gradually, in agreement with the workers. [Correa] Do you support a free-floating rate of exchange? [Villarzu] I am not so much a supporter of a free-floating exchange rate as I am in favor of moving forward by eliminating a series of foreign exchange restrictions now in effect which, in view of the world situation and the level of development of the Chilean market, are no longer justified. [Correa] Which of the laws pending approval by Congress are the most urgent? [Villarzu] The law on the capital market and the banking law are of vital importance. I hope that they will be approved by Congress before March 1994. [Correa] Do you share the concern felt by Minister of Finance Foxley about a free trade treaty with the United States? [Villarzu] The Bush administration and the present North American administration have expressed interest in entering into this kind of treaty with Chile. Conditions already exist for that kind of initiative to go well. We will have to begin negotiations on that treaty at some point in 1994. Foxley is ending his term of office, leaving that loaf of bread, as it were, ready to go into the oven. However, like Alejandro Foxley, I think that this is a matter which will have to be handled with a great deal of patience. Negotiations with the United States will be difficult. An eventual TLC [Free Trade Treaty] with the United States would have advantages for Chile. However, during the process of negotiations we should keep very clearly in mind which are our own interests over the medium term of years and which are the interests of the United States. And we must consider our real possibilities, particularly with regard to the sectors of our economy which would be affected, positively or negatively, by that treaty. We have to consider the treaty calmly. This does not mean that we will not complete the negotiations as quickly as possible. Rather, we will do so, but very prudently. [Correa] You said that public spending should be reduced, and your views have been considered to be clear criticism of Minister of Finance Foxley. [Villarzu] No. What I said is that to ensure macroeconomic stability over the medium term, it is important for public spending not to grow more than the potential capacity of the economy. [Correa] But it happens that public spending has been growing more quickly. [Villarzu] Not on a cash basis. [Correa] How can you say that? During the past three years public spending has grown more than Gross Domestic Product. [Villarzu] That happened in 1991 and 1992 and will probably happen also in 1993. However, on the average, over the past four years, it has not grown that much. When the present administration entered office, it clearly pointed out that it had to deal with a tremendous need to make up shortcomings in spending, inherited from the previous government, in the areas of health, education, infrastructure, and housing. And to do this, it reached agreement with RN [the National Renovation party] to raise taxes to finance an increase in spending. That was a campaign promise regarding its program, and it was then supported by a great consensus in the country. [Correa] If you should become responsible for state finances, in what areas would you reduce spending? [Villarzu] The team which has been working on the government program thinks that it is not a matter of reducing spending. That is the first mistake which must be clarified. [Correa] Then the program involves increasing spending? [Villarzu] There will be slower growth in spending because, in effect, it will not be possible to continue the pace of growth of spending recorded in the years 1991 and 1992. Among other things, this is because we will not have new tax reform legislation to deal with. [Correa] However, in the view of public opinion it does not appear that this more substantial level of spending has been translated into social improvement, particularly in the field of health, where spending has more than doubled. [Villarzu] In 1989, $564 million were spent on health. In the budget for 1994 we are talking about expenditures in the vicinity of $1.2 billion. It is the same thing with education. We have to have a little patience about this. A major effort has been made to improve pensions, raise minimum salaries, improve the jobs picture, and increase spending on school lunches. This has been an effort which will bear fruit over the next few years. [Correa] Do you not believe that what should be done is to change the structure of the health system? That is, subsidizing demand instead of subsidizing supply? [Villarzu] I believe that what is being spent on health in Chile is considerable. However, in effect, we have not yet resolved the problems of providing health care. The overall health indicators--infant mortality, life expectancy, etc.--show spectacularly good results, approaching those of a developed country. Our problem is the inadequate attention which we are paying, particularly to the poorest element in the country. That is a fundamental concern of the present and the next administration. It is not a matter of increasing resources now but rather using them more efficiently. It is a problem of management. To do that, we plan to move forward in a decisive way to decentralize the health system. Here we have to make very fundamental changes, but the idea of subsidizing demand instead of the supply of health services has turned out to be a failure throughout the world. It has increased the cost of providing health services in an impressive way. We can move forward in a way which will guarantee greater freedom of choice to the users of health services. However, we are absolutely against the simplistic formula of subsidizing the demand for health services which the right-wing candidacies of Alessandri and Pinera are proposing! [Correa] You have not said where you would reduce public spending. [Villarzu] There is rather little room for maneuver in reducing the budget. The most probable outcome is that we will have to achieve generalized savings in spending which would not affect salaries and allowances and, as far as possible, would not affect spending with a social impact. We may be able to lower spending on the purchase of goods and services and on some investment programs, by reducing the rate of project implementation. [Correa] You have proposed replacing the complementary, overall tax with a tax on private spending. [Villarzu] "In our program we point out that it would be appropriate, while respecting our commitment not to increase the tax burden, to change the tax system to make it into a more effective instrument to encourage savings, both by individuals as well as by companies. We are exploring the idea of a tax on spending which, theoretically, looks very attractive. However, it has proved to be very difficult to implement. It could stimulate tax evasion and a fall in tax collections. Rather than replacing the complementary, overall tax with a tax on general spending, we are thinking of some specific taxes." And he added: "It is said that the public sector should spend less, which would make it possible for the Central Bank to lower the interest rate, because the increase in private spending which would occur in that case would be compensated for by less public spending. We have pointed out that, in effect, we could try to ensure that public spending would grow less and, since it is necessary for aggregate spending by the economy (total public spending plus private spending) to grow less, private spending would also have to grow less." [Correa] To do this, would taxes go up? [Villarzu] If we want to lower interest rates, the only way to do this would be by imposing a specific tax. For example, a tax on gasoline. It could also be done by increasing the VAT [Value Added Tax], but I do not like that kind of solution, since it has another kind of impact. The fact is that what is collected under such a tax, which would be approved in the law, would involve an advance payment to the Central Bank. In that way the Central Bank would be in a position to lower the interest rate, which would be advantageous to the private sector and, in particular, to exporters. [Correa] Increasing taxes? [Villarzu] No. Our basic commitment is to maintain the present tax load. However, this transitional instrument could be necessary. A specific tax would favor the productive sectors of the country and will not be enacted if there is not a sufficient consensus in support of it. [Correa] Will you be as tough as Buchi or as Foxley in not increasing expenditures in response to pressures from various sectors? [Villarzu] I do not like to use the term "tough," but I can be tough when I have to be.
