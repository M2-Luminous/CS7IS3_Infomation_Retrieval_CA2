Brigadier General Arif Pasalic, assistant to the defense minister for military affairs, elaborated on the situation. [Pasalic] In the past 15 days, the Serbo-chetnik aggressor, assisted by Fikret Abdic's so-called western Krajina forces, has been conducting an offensive against the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps. The consequences of this aggression are a great number of killed and wounded, most of them civilians, and based on the military situation in the past 24 hours, the Serbo-chetnik aggressor's lines have moved.... [sentence as heard] [Cumurovic] This offensive perpetrated by the aggressor further complicates the already grave situation in the area under control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 5th Corps. So far, 1,500 civilians have been killed, 160 of them children. Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic discussed the letter that Fikret Abdic sent to Milosevic and Tudjman, in which he set a meeting in Velika Kladusa at which issues pertaining to the status of the so-called west Bosnian Krajina would be reviewed. [Alispahic] We know that Fikret Abdic and his [word indistinct] are in touch with these people. Moreover, they have open support from certain people in these countries [Serbia and Croatia]. We have uncovered open cooperation with the chetnik forces, which, together with the western Bosnia army members, are taking part in the attacks [words indistinct]. This open cooperation and support that has been extended by the two states has (?encouraged) Fikret Abdic to launch an open, terrorist conflict, which has been very damaging for Bihac County. [Cumurovic] A successful operation of the Bihac (?Security Service) cut short the terrorist activity of Abdic's group. The humanitarian situation is critical, particularly in the past 10-15 days, since the aid deliveries have been suspended. [Words indistinct] 78 metric tons of food were delivered to Bihac, while Velika Kladusa received 108 tons of food in the same period of time. Only one state delegation has visited this area to date, stressed Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, because one of the essential problems is the region's isolation from other parts of the republic. The Bihac region is also isolated in terms of communication, since the only way to communicate is through ham radio operators because reestablishing telephone lines has proved impossible. There is a possibility of having a satellite link in the future, explained Minister for Reconstruction and Development Munevar Imamovic. At the end of the open part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government session, at which the situation in the Bihac County was reviewed, a decision was made to call for a UN Security Council session that would review the situation in the area. Second, it was concluded that a corridor had to be opened via Licko Petrovo Selo, which would ensure that aid for Bihac would no longer travel via Velika Kladusa. Moreover, it was decided to ask the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to move its warehouses from Velika Kladusa to Bihac. The proposal to open Bihac airport was also supported, as was the need to enable the return of deputies. [sentence as heard] Finally, it was stressed that the government had so far twice sent humanitarian aid to the legitimate bodies of authority, and that it had enough aid to alleviate the grave situation in the Bihac region.
