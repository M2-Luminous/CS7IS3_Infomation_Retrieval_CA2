Israel and Jordanian officials are hoping that these talks will help to break the deadlock in the peace negotiations. Sources in Washington have said that the talks, which are the fourth round held by the committee, will discuss issues like the issue of the border between Jordan and Israel, as the latter has agreed to discuss it in these talks. The sources denied that the talks are a kind of Jordanian separation to secure a peace agreement with Israel. Meanwhile, Jordanian sources have said that the talks being held in Washington were not allocated to discussing the border issue, but to discussing economic issues in the framework of the tripartite committee. But Israel agreed to discuss the border issue. The sources pointed out that the talks will also deal with the water issue between the two countries. However, they stressed that it is out of the question for Jordan to sign a peace agreement outside the scope of the comprehensive solution on the basis of which the peace process was launched.
