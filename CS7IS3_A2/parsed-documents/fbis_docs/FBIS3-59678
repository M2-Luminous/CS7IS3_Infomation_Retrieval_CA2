While the handshake between the two space powers could be viewed as invigorating the moribund Space Station Project, one could also make the sober observation that the agreement adds the unstable element of Russian participation. Japan, which participates in the Space Station Project, has been asked for a more nearly definite response than that sought from it up to now. Following the signing of the agreement with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, Vice President Gore emphasized that "two countries, who have been competitors in space development, have now entered an era of cooperation." The Vice President spoke as though a powerful supporter had been added. The United States had three basic reasons for taking the decisive step of asking for Russian participation in the Space Station Project at this point: reducing costs, using Russian manned space technology built up by the operation of the MIR Space Station, and utilizing large Russian rockets for propulsion. The construction budget under the original budget for Space Station Freedom was said to be $30 to $40 billion, but under the revised design the prospect is for costs to be held down as far as to about $25 billion. Using Russian technology would enable an even further reduction of consts. As a result of the end of the Cold War there is no longer any need for the United States to compete with the former Soviet Union in space. Moreover the fiscal-deficit reduction measures advocated by President Clinton had strengthened the power of those opposed to the Space Station and had done so at a time when criticism of big science projects was mounting. What made matters worse were the repeated delays of the launch of the space shuttle "Discovery" and the failure of the Mars probe "Mars Observer." The fragility of manned launch methods was revealed and the U.S. space program came under increased criticism in Congress due to the loss of the nearly $1 billion budget for the Mars Observer without having achieved any results. This crisis in U.S. space development accelerated cooperation in Russia. Naturally cooperation with the United States in space would have various benefits for Russia, such as in obtaining foreign currency. Russia is probably aiming to use cooperation in the Space Station Freedom Project to gain a foothold in entering the much desired Western space-services market. Officials at Japan's Science and Technology Agency (STA) concerned with the Space Station acknowledged that they were almost completely taken by surprise when the United States and Russia agreed to cooperate in space this way. Their reaction was "who would have imagined that the United States would go as far as docking Space Station Freedom to the Mir Space Station?" A unilateral review bearing on the Space Station Project was underway prompted by conditions on the U.S. side and it was on the verge of causing Japanese distrust of the United States. For a time members of STA and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) were seized with the uneasy feeling that the United States might make another change in the program without consulting them first. It was 9 September, two days after signing the agreement with Russia, that the United States formally briefed the countries with which it was cooperating, such as Japan, about the agreement. Cooperating countries' questions naturally focused on how Russia's participation would affect the Space Station. On that occasion the United States presented a space-station design final draft that posited on quadrilateral participation by the United States, Japan, Europe, and Canada. The United States emphasized that it was a draft design flexible enough to accomodate docking or not docking with Mir. STA officials participating in the meeting stated that they were "somewhat relieved to find that the United States was more cautious than we had previously thought on considering Russian participation in the Space Station." It seems, however, that Russia's participation cannot avoid having some effect on the project. For example, in order to enable joint use of the Space Station by both the United States and Russia, the shuttle will have to be launched to a higher orbit latitude than previously planned. In that event the space shuttle's payload would be reduced and there is a possibility that this would have an effect upon scheduling and the scale of cooperating country facilities. The United States points to the possibility that the overall program will be expedited by Russia's participation. There are, however, reports to the effect that the Japanese Experimental Module (JEM) will be delayed by one to two years from its initially planned 1999 launch. For the time being STA's stance is to watch what the United States is doing. Th U.S.-Russian agreement symbolizes the end of the Cold War in the space area. In order to actually orbit a space station in which the major nations of the world participate Japan will be asked to take a different approach than it has up to now, such as by closing its eyes to its convenience and switching to a position supporting the project.
