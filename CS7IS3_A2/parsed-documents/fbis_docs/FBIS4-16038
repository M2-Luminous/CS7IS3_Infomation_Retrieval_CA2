Leaving Russia to Reconcile Them With the Muslims and the Croats"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The strategic line of Russian diplomacy from the very start of the Balkan crisis has been based on the postulate, "there are no innocents, all are guilty," boiling down to a very simple but at the same time most effective "pressure on all sides" formula. It is hard to believe that such an approach was shared by the West. Because in that event things might not have reached the point of air strikes. It would have been fairly easy: The United States and the FRG, which have certain influence with the Croats and Muslims, exert the same pressure on them as Russia on the Serbs, and the issue is settled. In fact, however, something totally different happens. Why should the Muslims sit down at the negotiation table if they can simply wait until the Serbs are showered with bombs, abandon their positions, liberating the "vital space" for the enemy, after whose incorporation to the territories that are already under its control the subject of negotiations itself will disappear? Judging by the statement of a Bosnian leader, Ganic, who suggested that after the strikes against the Serb positions fire should be moved to their rear areas, depots, and communications, the Muslims understand this very well. Russia too could be shown its "real place." The latter task, incidentally, is now being tackled by anyone willing. Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana missed no chance, in the course of the Russian Federation president's visit to Madrid, to express his satisfaction with the actions by NATO aviation, although it is difficult to believe that he is unaware of Yeltsin's reaction to Kozyrev's statement in Madrid on this issue. The West is apparently little concerned also about the internal political complications arising from its actions both for the Bosnian Serbs and for Russia. In both countries the hawks' feathers have stood on end. It is one thing to hold debates with Radovan Karadzic and quite another with Ratko Mladic; with professional Russian diplomats or, say, "geopoliticians" from the Duma committee of the same name. In addition to Christopher's statements that the United States and the Russian Federation have the same goals in Bosnia, now even protestations of the West's interest in the success of Russia's reform appear dubious. According to PRES leader and Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, subjected to NATO bombing were "not so much Serb positions in the conflict zone as the internal political situation in Russia." In his opinion, decisionmaking in circumvention of it is "a slap in the face of the Russian Federation" and, indirectly, "a strike against Russian reforms, and a very telling one," which has benefited "the national-patriots."
