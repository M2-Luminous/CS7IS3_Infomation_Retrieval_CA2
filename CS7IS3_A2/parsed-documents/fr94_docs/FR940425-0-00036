FR940425-0-00036 FR940425-0-00018 NHTSA has decided to specify the fill level to be at 100 percent of the service pressure. After reviewing the comments, the agency considered allowing a fill level of between 95 percent to 100 percent of service pressure. However, allowing a fill level of 95 percent of the service pressure (i.e., 2850 psi for a 3000 psi container) would result in a less stringent condition before the crash test. Thus, the agency would no longer be testing a worst case situation. The agency acknowledges that a container will need additional time to stabilize when achieving a 100 percent fill condition. However, the agency believes that it is necessary to allow for this additional time since including a testing tolerance would affect the requirement's stringency. The agency further notes that including a 100 percent fill condition is consistent with Transport Canada's standard for fuel system integrity. 2. Test Gas In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to specify nitrogen (N 2 ) as the test gas. In determining the appropriate test gas, NHTSA sought one that adequately represents CNG, is safe during crash tests and provides a common baseline from which to derive all leakage measurements. The agency decided to propose using nitrogen as the test gas because both nitrogen and CNG are lighter than air and thus would disperse upward into the air through any rupture in the fuel system instead of pooling in cavities of the fuel system or falling to the ground. The agency believed that a volume of nitrogen that is leaked as a test gas would be equal to the same volume of CNG that leaks. In addition, nitrogen is readily available and is safer than CNG for crash tests because it is neither flammable nor toxic. Seven commenters addressed the issue of test gas. Of those commenters, six agreed with the agency's proposal to specify nitrogen as a test gas. Thomas Built requested that dry air be used as a test gas but offered no rationale. NGV Systems stated that the vehicles should be tested with the fuel with which it will operate. After reviewing the comments and other available information, NHTSA has decided to specify that nitrogen be the test gas during crash tests of CNG vehicles. Notwithstanding Thomas Built's request to allow dry air, the agency has decided not to specify dry air as an alternative test gas, even though it has properties similar to nitrogen. The agency believes that the test results will be more consistent and enforcement will be facilitated by permitting only one test gas. As indicated by the majority of commenters addressing this issue, NHTSA believes that nitrogen is stable and readily available and therefore should be specified in the Standard. This decision is consistent with Standard No. 301 which specifies the use of Stoddard Solvent as the single test liquid, and Transport Canada's standard for CNG fuel system integrity which specifies the use of nitrogen as a test gas. The type of test gas is relevant to calculating the allowable pressure drop, since the compressibility factor, ``Z,'' is included in the formula. In the NPRM, NHTSA estimated that the compressibility of nitrogen is 1.00. However, AAMA commented that a compressibility of 1.05 is more accurate for the conditions the test gas will be under when tested in the fuel containers (approximately 20,685 kPa (3,000 psi) and 21.1 ○C (70 ○F)). Upon further review, NHTSA agrees with AAMA that the appropriate compressibility factor is 1.05. 3. Electric Shutoff Valves In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that ``if the vehicle has an electrically driven fuel pump that normally runs when the vehicle's electrical system is activated, it is operated at the time of the barrier crash.'' The agency also proposed that ``Any shutoff valve at the fuel tank is in the open position.'' In this latter statement, the agency was referring to manual shutoff valves, and not those which may be electrically operated. AAMA commented that requiring the crash test to be conducted with shutoff valves held open would be incompatible with the vehicle's normal operation during a crash sequence and with the intent of the standard. AAMA stated that vehicles equipped with manual shutoff valves at each fuel tank should have these valves in the fully open position during vehicle testing. However, electric shutoff valves should be handled in a manner consistent with other electrical devices such as an electric fuel pump.
