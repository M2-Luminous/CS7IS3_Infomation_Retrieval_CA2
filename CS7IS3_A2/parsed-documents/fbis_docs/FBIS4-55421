However, what has been left unclear is whether there was an error in the announcement or whether discrimination against killed fighters, patriots in the defense of the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is really being introduced, something that we cannot support. We expect the error, be it in the announcement or intentional, to be immediately corrected.
