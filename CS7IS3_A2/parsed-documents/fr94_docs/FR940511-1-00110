[WO&hyph;660&hyph;4191&hyph;02&hyph;24 1A] RIN 1004&hyph;AC17 Mining Claims; Rental, Maintenance, and Location Fees; Lands Open to Location, National Parks, King Range National Conservation Area, Indian Reservations, Surface Management; Removal of Obsolete or Expired Regulations, Consolidation of Remaining Sections AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document has two objectives. The rule would implement Title X, Subtitle B, sections 10101 through 10106 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of August 10, 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312) (the Act), which are entitled ``Hardrock Mining Claim Maintenance Fee.'' Section 10106 of the Act requires the Secretary to issue regulations implementing the Act as soon as practicable after enactment. The Act extends, in effect, with certain modifications, the mining claim fee provisions of the Act of October 5, 1992, until September 30, 1998. These Acts require, unless the claimant qualifies for an exemption (or waiver), payment of an annual fee of $100 per mining claim or site located and held on the public lands pursuant to the General Mining Law of 1872. The Act also establishes a new location fee of $25 for each new mining claim or site located on public lands on or after August 11, 1993, and before September 30, 1998, which is required to be paid at the time of recording of the mining claim or site with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) under section 314(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and the regulations in 43 CFR 3833. It also implements the new location and recording requirements for mining claims located on Stockraising Homestead Act lands required by the Act of April 16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60). It removes obsolete or expired provisions, and consolidates provisions that are still in force and effect, in the regulations concerning location and entry of mining claims and sites on coal bearing lands, on the National Park System units, the King Range Conservation Area, and Indian reservations. DATES: Comments should be submitted by June 10, 1994. Comments received or postmarked after this date may not be considered in the decision making process on the issuance of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted to: Director (140), Bureau of Land Management, room 5555 MIB, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240. Comments will be available for public review in room 5555 of the above address during regular business hours (7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.), Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Frank Bruno, (202) 452&hyph;0350, or Roger Haskins, (702) 785&hyph;6576.
