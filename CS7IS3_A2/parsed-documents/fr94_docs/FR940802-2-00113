FR940802-2-00113 FR940802-2-00059 These Model Specifications are not regulations. Organizations and agencies may adopt these Model Specifications and rely on NHTSA's test results or may conduct their own tests according to their own procedures and specifications. It should be noted, however, that transportation employers covered by 49 CFR Part 40, Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs, are required to use only alcohol testing devices that meet the criteria established by that regulation. NHTSA intends to begin testing of alcohol screening devices immediately, and hopes to publish a CPL of devices that have been tested to date and conform to these Model Specifications within 30 days from today's date. The CPL will be updated and published periodically, as further testing is completed. Once the first CPL is published, DOT will develop and issue procedural rules for using approved alcohol screening devices in transportation workplaces, including provisions for how and where such devices can be used and the steps that must be taken to collect bodily fluids. Employers are reminded that these screening devices are not authorized for use under 49 CFR Part 40 until that regulation is amended. Procedures The procedures proposed in the February 15 notice have been adopted without change. Testing of products submitted by manufacturers to these Model Specifications will be conducted by the DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (VNTSC), DTS&hyph;75, Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 02142. Tests will be conducted semiannually, or as necessary. Manufacturers are required to apply to NHTSA for a test date by writing to the Office of Alcohol and State Programs (OASP), NTS&hyph;21, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Normally, at least 30 days will be required from the date of notification until the test can be scheduled. One week prior to the scheduled initiation of the test program, manufacturers will be required to deliver their devices to VNTSC. If the devices are disposable, the manufacturer must deliver 300 such devices; if the devices are disposable, interpretive and require that results be checked through a visual inspection (and therefore must be tested under various light conditions), the manufacturer must deliver 600 such devices; if the devices are reusable, the manufacturer must submit only a single device. If a manufacturer of a reusable device wishes to submit a duplicate, backup instrument, it may do so. The manufacturer shall be responsible for ensuring that the devices operate properly and are packaged correctly. The manufacturer must also deliver the operator's manual (or instructions) and the maintenance manual (if any) normally supplied with the purchase of the device, as well as specifications and drawings which fully describe these devices. Proprietary information will be respected. (See 49 CFR Part 512, regarding the procedure by which NHTSA will consider claims of confidentiality.) In addition, the manufacturer must submit a self-certification, certifying that the manufacturer meets the requirements in FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21 CFR Part 820), and that the device's label meets the requirements in FDA's Labeling regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21 CFR Part 809.10), even if the devices are not to be used for medical purposes. See the Appendix to this notice. The manufacturer has the right to check its devices between the time of their arrival at VNTSC and the start of the tests, but will have no access to the devices during the tests. Any malfunction of a device which results in failure to complete any of the tests satisfactorily will result in a determination that the device does not conform to the Model Specifications. If a device is found not to conform, it may be resubmitted for the next testing series after appropriate corrections have been made. NHTSA plans to begin testing of alcohol screening devices immediately to determine whether they comply with the performance criteria included in the Model Specifications.
