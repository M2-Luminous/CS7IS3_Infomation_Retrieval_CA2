Foreign Ministry Spokesman Michael Geerdts stated that the hostilities were continuing nearby and that the access road was mined. At the moment one was examining several options to evacuate the trapped Germans, one of which was to rescue them by air by helicopter. The Foreign Ministry has thus confuted reports that the 11 Germans -- seven engineers, three spouses, and one child -- had already been flown out of the station by U.S. soldiers. This had been said by the director of Deutsche Welle, Dieter Weirich, in Cologne earlier today.
