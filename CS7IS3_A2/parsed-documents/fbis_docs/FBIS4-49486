Wang Fengchao, member of the political affairs panel of the committee, made the remarks here today during talks with leaders of the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Progressive Alliance. Wang said in the past few days, the political and economic panels of the committee met representatives from some political organizations and grass-roots bodies and listened to their opinions on the political structure, the economy and the people's livelihood in Hong Kong beyond 1997. Some of these opinions, he said, are very constructive and he believed the committee will do a better job together with the support and participation of Hong Kong people. He hoped various organizations, through communication with Hong Kong residents, will jointly take part in formation of the SAR and in preparing "Hong Kong people manage Hong Kong" after 1997. There will be no "through train" as the Sino-British talks has broken down, Wang said, adding the Chinese side still hopes to cooperate with the British side in fields of the economy and the people's livelihood. However, this cooperation depends on the attitude taken by the British side, he said.
