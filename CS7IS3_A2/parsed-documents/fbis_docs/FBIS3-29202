Thus, the Japan-U.S. summit talks ended in a rupture over the pending economic framework talks. Prime Minister Hosokawa stated: "A mature relationship between the two nations should be one in which both say frankly what they are unable to do." There is no choice but to coolly accept this unusual situation and seek a way for building a true "mature relationship" between Japan and the United States. During the joint news conference after the summit talks, both Japanese and U.S. leaders seemed to be cautious as much as possible not to make the situation worse. While President Clinton stressed that "the Japan-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship," Prime Minister Hosokawa pointed out that "the results of the talks should not damage the close and friendly relations between the two nations." Although a breakdown in a summit meeting is not unusual among European nations, as well as between the United States and European nations, past Japan-U.S. summit meetings always ended successfully. For this reason, both leaders were anxious to minimize the shock of the rupture in their talks. It is certain that Japan and the United States are in a state of economic cold war in the wake of the breakdown in the economic framework talks. The President refrained from mentioning the possibility of imposing sanctions against Japan following the breakdown in the talks. However, the U.S. Congress has begun to move to impose sanctions against Japan. For example, Senator Baucus stressed the need for revival of the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. The President himself referred to "fluctuations in exchange rates" as a concrete indicator to measure Japan's progress in opening markets, and the exchange market is moving toward the yen appreciation. Cool-Headed Action Is Required Amid the situation in which the economic framework talks will be frozen for the time being and there will be no way out to break the deadlock in economic relations between Japan and the United States, what is of most concern is that emotional confrontation will spread between the two countries. To avoid such a situation, it is important that Japan and the United States try to strengthen bilateral relations by all means. Although it goes without saying that the economic relations are important, the Japan-U.S. relationship does not consist only of those. What is important is to consider the depth of mutual dependence between Japan and the United States and to take a calm attitude. It seems that despite the breakdown in the summit talks, there is no tremor in the foundation of personal relationship between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa, both of whom seek reform. Nevertheless, it is dangerous that the two countries should rely on the relationship between the two leaders to prevent a decisive confrontation in Japanese-U.S. relations. There is no other adjusting mechanism than a summit between the two countries, and the situation is quite dangerous. It is understandable that trade negotiators of both countries confront each other. However, it is undesirable that the foreign minister and the secretary of state discuss issues in the same way as the negotiators. Why did Japan and the United States make a mistake? It can be said that now that they do not have to be united as a liberalism camp following the end of the Cold War, economic confrontation between Japan and the United States has come to the fore. Nevertheless, this is not the only reason. The Clinton administration, concluding that the post-Cold War era would become an era of the economy, has worked out its economic strategy at the National Economic Council (NEC). However, the administration has forgotten the fact that, in the era of the economy, the leading role is not for the government but companies and consumers, and that decisions are made not at the White House but on the market. It is obvious that numerical targets demanded by the United States will surely lead to "managed trade." The reason why Japan has insisted on this view is not because its bureaucrats are obstinate but because it is common sense in the world. Influential American economists as well as major mass media in Japan, the United States, the UK, and Canada share the Japanese view. The conspicuous view is that "Prime Minister Hosokawa should say `no'" to the U.S. demand, (according to an editorial in the British FINANCIAL TIMES). Although the Clinton administration has strengthened its information strategy toward Japan, it failed to figure out Japan's reform thoroughly because it has stuck to the view of Japan revisionism [nihon ishitsuron]. This indicates that experts on Japanese affairs who think that Japan is a peculiar nation should not be involved in the current Japan-U.S. ties. To secure numerical targets, administrative instructions by Japanese bureaucrats are necessary. Nevertheless, deregulation efforts being promoted by the Hosokawa administration are aimed at decreasing such intervention by the government. Japan also made a mistake. It was busy saying only "no" to the U.S. demand, and did not act on opening its markets, seriously delaying the economic pump-priming measures. Its current account surplus remains large. The trade imbalance between Japan and the United States is widening due to the current economic gap between the two countries. The Japanese Government should have indicated its understanding of the U.S. irritation, with the off-year election near at hand. Japan has been making efforts to open its markets, and the situation of market opening has largely changed. Nevertheless, we cannot help but say that Japan is still protectionist among the industrial nations in the area of opening markets. The biggest mistake is that both Japan and the United States, which should be models for world trade, took a narrow view. The two countries faced off without taking into account the chaotic post-Cold War world. Although it seems that the Clinton administration took the initiative in concluding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round, it did so mainly for the sake of improving the employment situation in the United States. Japan did not take the lead in the Uruguay Round but rather played a role of a victim. The situation in which Japan and the United States are snarling at each other in a manner of pursuing only their own interest will negatively effect not only both sides but also the world economy as a whole. Same Value Should Be Sought The manner of frankly talking is not a way to prevent the economic cold war from expanding and to build a true mature relationship. Although it is said that the Japan-U.S. relationship is maturing, it is different from the relationship between the United States and European nations. This does not refer only to the difference in military structures -- namely, a difference between the Japan-U.S. security system and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Because the same value has rooted in the U.S.- European relationship, a residue of hard feeling would not be left between them even after they quarrel with each other heatedly. During a cooling-off period, Japan and the United States, at first, need to think why the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have been in an impasse, from each other's standpoint. After that, they need to rebuild a new adjusting framework. This should be a trade framework which will be open to the world and be based on the GATT system. Japan and the United States should not only concentrate on the bilateral negotiations but also become cosponsors of a proposal for a new multilateral trade negotiation after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. There are many tasks which the two countries have to tackle immediately, such as working out international rules for trade, environment, and competitive policies. Now is the time to study a new international monetary system in which monetary authorities do not take an action of verbal intervention and in which economic conditions of each country are reflected. This may be a good idea that Japan and the United States will jointly tackle the "Global New Deal" policy which some quarters, including U.S. labor unions, are discussing to solve the employment issue, a world's common issue. Japan and the United States will not reach a true mature relationship until they find the same value through such efforts in the post-Cold War era.
