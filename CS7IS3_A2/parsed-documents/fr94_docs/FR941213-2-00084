FR941213-2-00084 FR941213-2-00053 [Docket No. 94&hyph;61; Notice 2] Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company (Uniroyal) of Greenville, South Carolina, determined that some of its tires failed to comply with 49 CFR 571.109, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 109, ``New Pneumatic Tires,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Uniroyal also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_Motor Vehicle Safety on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. Notice of receipt of the petition was published on July 19, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 36832). This notice grants Uniroyal's petition. Paragraph S4.3.3(b) of FMVSS No. 109 specifies that each tire be labeled with an identification number, the last three digits of which represent the week and year of manufacture. During the period of the 17th through the 20th week of 1994, Uniroyal manufactured approximately 2,800 P175/70R13 MOTOMASTER LE tires with an incorrect week and year of manufacture contained in the tire identification number. The last three digits in the identification numbers on the subject tires are incorrectly marked ``167,'' ``168,'' ``169,'' and ``120.'' The last three digits in the identification numbers for these tires should be ``174,'' ``184,'' ``194,'' and ``204'' signifying the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th weeks of 1994. All tires are sold only in the replacement market. Uniroyal supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: [Uniroyal does] not believe that this error will impact motor vehicle safety since only the week and year of manufacture is incorrect. Uniroyal offered further rationale in its Part 573 Report. The dates marked on these tires could be interpreted as the year 1987 through 1990 or 1997 through 2000. This tire line was introduced during the fourth quarter of 1992; therefore, there would not be pre-existent tires with these numbers. In the event a recall is necessary prior to the week and year (years 1997 through 2000) marked on these tires, there will be no tires that were actually manufactured during these weeks. If it is necessary to recall these tires during or after the weeks marked, the recall population would comprise both the mismarked and properly marked tires. No comments were received on the petition. NHTSA has reviewed FMVSS No. 109 and the petitioner's arguments. The primary purpose that the identification number serves is to facilitate identification of tires that are the subject of notification and remedy campaigns. The erroneous date code marking does not affect the ability to identify the tires in the event a campaign is conducted either before or after the erroneously indicated manufacture date. If a recall campaign is required on the tires before the 16th week of 1997, their date code, like any tire's conforming date code, permits instant identification of a tire in the recall population. Should a campaign be required on tires of this tire line manufactured during the 16th weeks of 1997, 1998, and 1999, and the 12th week of 2000, or on the tires in question, the petitioner will have to campaign both sets of tires, compliant tires as well as noncompliant ones, but this is a burden to be borne by the petitioner and does not affect safety in a negative way. In consideration of the foregoing, the Administrator has decided that Uniroyal has met its burden of persuasion and that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. Accordingly, the Administrator exempts Uniroyal from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118, and the remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30120. (49 U.S.C. 30118, 30120; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8) Issued on December 8, 1994. Barry Felrice, Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.
