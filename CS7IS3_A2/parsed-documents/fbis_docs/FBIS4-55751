His message was clear: Even though Slovakia has broken off its relations with the Czech Republic, it not does not want to be ejected outside Europe. [Gautier] Your government, which opposed the nationalist policy of Meciar, managed to convince the Bratislava government to deal with the issue of the Hungarian minority. How did you do that? [Moravcik] We had prepared an acceptable solution for the Slovaks, the Hungarians, and the other minorities. It was not a problem to convince the deputies. [Gautier] Will you be the first prime minister to take down the "iron curtain" that has appeared between the Czech Republic and Slovakia? [Moravcik] The two republics of the former Czechoslovakia are young countries. They are going through an unnecessary period of restricted freedom of movement. It is difficult to persuade Prague to avoid that kind of obstacle. There is a real problem of migration. But we will abolish the border as soon as it has become unnecessary. [Gautier] Within the framework of a Slovakia integrated into Europe? [Moravcik] Yes. This is the message that we have brought with us to Paris. Slovakia envisages an integration into the European Union. My message is clear: Bratislava must not be ejected outside Europe. This is very important for the stability of the region. [Gautier] Why did you chose France for you first visit as a head of government? [Moravcik] I chose your country because France has understood the importance of Central Europe within Europe. [Gautier] What was your message to President Mitterrand? [Moravcik] We want relations with France to be fruitful for both countries. I stressed that we are working to establish the basis of a stable economy and political system. [Gautier] The elections are scheduled for the end of September. The deposed prime minister has already launched his campaign. Do you think you will survive the election next fall? [Moravcik] A large number of the electors have not made up their minds. Vladimir Meciar's popularity, which had been falling, has started to rise again since he was evicted by the parliament. But this time, it seems that a large part of the electors support our European and democratic policy. [Gautier] What do you think of the scheduled return of the communists and Gyula Horn to power in Hungary? [Moravcik] I have just had very interesting talks with Gyula Horn. I can envision cooperating with him. [Gautier] Better than the cooperation with his predecessor, Peter Bross? [Moravcik] (laughing) The search for solutions to the problems between Bratislava and Budapest is in our mutual interest. [Gautier] Does Slovakia, which sent Blue Helmets to Bosnia, intend to follow the example of France and withdraw its troops? [Moravcik] No. We want to continue with our peacekeeping mission in that region. It is in our interest. [Gautier] Do you have a solution to the Bosnian conflict? [Moravcik] It is a simple solution. We intend to apply the principles of a multiethnic society in Slovakia. These principles must be reintroduced in former Yugoslavia, as they have been in South Africa and the Middle East.
