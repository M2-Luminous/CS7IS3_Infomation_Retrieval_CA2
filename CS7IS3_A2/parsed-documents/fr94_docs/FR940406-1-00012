FR940406-1-00012 FR940406-1-00003 (c) For all Model Super V airplanes, check the static balance of the ruddervator in accordance with Beech Shop Manual 35&hyph;590096A, Section 3, pages 12A, 12B, and 13. Repeat this check anytime the ruddervator is removed or repainted. Prior to further flight, make applicable corrections if any of the following is not achieved: (1) With the root weight removed and a tip weight attached, static balance of 19.80 (plus or minus 1.00) inch-pounds tail heavy; and (2) With the root weight added to the condition specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this AD, static balance of 7.00 (plus or minus 1.00) inch-pounds tail heavy. (d) For Models 35, 35R, A35, B35, C35, D35, E35, F35, and G35 airplanes, accomplish the following: (1) Fabricate a placard (utilizing letters of at least .10-inch minimum height) with the words ``Never exceed speed, Vne, 144 MPH (125 knots) IAS; Maximum structural cruising speed, Vno, 135 MPH (117 knots) IAS; Maneuvering speed, VA, 127 MPH (110 knots) IAS.'' Install this placard on the airplane instrument panel next to the airspeed indicator within the pilot's clear view. (2) Mark the outside surface of the airspeed indicator with lines of approximately 1/16-inch by 3/16-inch as follows: (i) Red line at 144 MPH (125 knots); (ii) Yellow line at 135 MPH (117 knots); and (iii) A white slippage mark between the airspeed indicator glass and case to visually verify glass has not rotated. (3) Place a copy of this AD in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) and FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). (e) For Models H35, J35, K35, M35, N35, P35, S35, V35, V35A, and V35B, accomplish the following: (1) Fabricate a placard (utilizing letters of at least .10-inch minimum height) with the words ``Never exceed speed, Vne, 197 MPH (171 knots) IAS; Maximum structural cruising speed, Vno, 177 MPH (154 knots) IAS; Maneuvering speed, VA, 132 MPH (115 knots) IAS.'' Install this placard on the airplane instrument panel next to the airspeed indicator within the pilot's clear view. (2) Mark the outside surface of the airspeed indicator with lines of approximately 1/16-inch by 3/16-inch as follows: (i) Red line at 197 MPH (171 knots); (ii) Yellow line at 177 MPH (154 knots); and (iii) A white slippage mark between the airspeed indicator glass and case to visually verify glass has not rotated. (3) Place a copy of this AD in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) and FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). (f) For all applicable model airplanes, fabricate a placard (utilizing letters of at least .10-inch minimum height) with the words ``Normal Category Operation Only'' and install this placard on the instrument panel within the pilot's clear view over the existing ``Utility Category'' placard. (g) For Models C35, D35, E35, F35, G35, H35, J35, K35, M35, N35, S35, V35, V35A, and V35B airplanes, accomplish the following: (1) Visually inspect the empennage, aft fuselage, and ruddervator control system for damage in accordance with the applicable Beech kits specified in Beech Service Bulletin (SB) No. 2188. Prior to further flight, accomplish the following in accordance with these instructions: (i) Replace or repair any damaged parts; and (ii) Set the elevator controls, rudder and tab system controls, cable tensions, and rigging. (2) Remove all external stabilizer reinforcements installed during incorporation of either Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SA845GL, STC SA846GL, STC SA1650CE, STC SA2286NM, or STC SA2287NM. Seal or fill any residual holes with appropriate size rivets. (i) The internal stub spar incorporated through SA1649CE and SA1650CE may be retained. (ii) The external angles incorporated through STC SA1649CE may also be retained by properly trimming the leading edge section to permit installing the stabilizer reinforcement referenced in paragraph (g)(3) of this AD. (3) Install stabilizer reinforcements in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;3, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;5, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;7, or 39&hyph;4016&hyph;9, as applicable and specified in Beech SB No. 2188. Set the elevator nose down trim in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;3, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;5, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;7, or 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9, as applicable and specified in Beech SB No. 2188, and replace ruddervator tab control cables with larger diameter cables in accordance with the service information. (h) Ensure correct accuracy of the airplane basic empty weight and balance information by accomplishing one of the three methods presented in Figures 1, 2a through 2c, and 3 of this AD. Prior to further flight, correct any discrepancies in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual.
