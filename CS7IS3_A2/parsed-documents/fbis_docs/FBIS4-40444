[karbovantsi] for survey and prospecting in 1994 of what might prove to be promising to exploit Ukraine's gold and silver deposits. As Vladimir Tishchenko, the planning department superintendent of the State Committee for geology and mineral deposit utilization, disclosed in an interview to UKRINFORM's correspondent, 23 billion krb. have been allotted this year for specialized machinery and equipment to be installed in silver-and gold fields. Five pilot mines are supposed to be thus equipped in three regions after preliminary surveys, which allow to estimate their real silver and gold contents. The State Committee for Geology and Mineral Deposit Utilization is contemplating to channel 2.5 trillion krb., starting with 1994, to setting up and equipment of such pilot mines in the Dnepropetrovsk region (East Ukraine). As experts with the State Committee maintain, the above stated sums will be sufficient for only the initial phase of the survey and prospecting project. However, there is hardly any need for more money pending the survey's results. According to Mr. Tishchenko, it would be too premature and groundless now to conjecture the fields' warranted industrial-scale exploitation, since more or less conclusive evidence may be gathered not earlier than in 1996. As preliminary survey data suggest, the Donetsk region's gold sulfide and silver Bobrinskoe and Zhuravskoe deposits appear to be most accessible in the Nagolny ridge (see UBN no. 17/1994). The project also provides for surveys in virtually all regions of Ukraine, where precious metal deposits were found (Ukraine's Transcarpathia, Dnepropetrovsk and Kirovograd regions, and the Nagolny ridge). The State Committee's Yuzhukrgeologia (South Ukrainian Geology), Severukrgeologia (North Ukrainian Geology) and Karpatukrgeologia (Carpathian Ukrainian Geology) agencies are in charge of survey in their respective regions of Ukraine. In the meantime, Mr. Tishchenko cautions that the early survey's promising results need more substantiation before a feasibility study could be launched. Laymen's emotional optimism should be considered as irrelevant, for the time being, Mr. Tishchenko maintains. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Export of Gold and Gold Jewelry in 1994's 1st Quarter | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Items of export |Importer-nation |Export amounts (k-|Value (thousands | | | |g) |U.S. dollars) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gold |Russia |35.8 |15,400 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gold Jewelry |Russia |132.0 |41,400 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Moldova |9.4 |3,000 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other precious me-|Russia |177.0 |18,000 | |tal jewelry | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Import of Gold and Gold Jewelry in 1994's 1st Quarter | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Items of import |Exporter-nation |Import amounts (k-|Value (thousands | | | |g) |U.S. dollars) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Untreated and sem-|Russia |4.2 |0.4 | |i-treated gold, g-| | | | |old powder | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Germany |182.6 |14,000 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Switzerland |2,562.0 |216,000 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Canada |3.1 |0.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Platinum waste an-|Russia |56.0 |118,000 | |d scrap jewelry | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Germany |8.2 |600 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Poland |26.3 |14,020 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |France |20.0 |700 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |USA |55.2 |23,800 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Including | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Silver jewelry |Poland |9.7 |11,620 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |USA |21.7 |21,200 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other precious me-|Poland |16.6 |2,400 | |tal jewelry | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Germany |8.2 |600 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |France |20.0 |700 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |USA |33.8 |2,600 | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
