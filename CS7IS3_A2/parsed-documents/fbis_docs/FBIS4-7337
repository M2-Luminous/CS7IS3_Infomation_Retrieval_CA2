Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic fighter for reunification. The statement says: "The South side's authorities, still antagonizing Pomminnyon, barred its delegation from participating in the function. This was an insult to the pure heart of condolence of overseas Koreans and an unjust act going against the desire of the 70 million fellow countrymen for reunification. "Today when the United States and other foreign forces are deliberately increasing the military tension on the Korean peninsula, it is of great significance in hastening national reunification for delegates in the North, South and overseas to gather in one place to honor the memory of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan who passed away while devotedly working for the independence of the nation and great unity. "The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon urges the South side's authorities to renounce their hostile policy toward Pomminnyon and make efforts to accomplish the cause of reunification together with us."
