However, this could only be said speculatively since, to the knowledge of the undersigned, there is no accurate way of determining how many foreign troops we actually have here? What is an object? We talk about military objects, but what are they? Let me bring a few examples. The air defense division located in Estonia had 14 radio-technology batallions and 39 missile divisions. If one batallion served several divisions, then how many objects should we be talking about? There were also three border guard units in Estonia. They were in charge of more than 40 check points and 52 technical observation posts. Another picture puzzle: How many objects were there? The staff headquarters of Kaitseliit [Protection League] has 17 objects within a certain system registered in Tallinn, and 11 in the Harjumaa district. These include staff headquarters, ports, storage facilities for ammunition, food, chemicals and fuel, radio technology centers and detached communications batallions, naval divisions, the �amari airport, a medical batallion, a tank regiment, an artillery regiment, and also some anti-artillery and anti-tank divisions. The foreign ministry, however, has a listing of over 500 objects, based on the information received from the staff headquarters of Defense Forces. What accounts for such divergence of data, by a whole order of magnitude? It turns out that the latter method is based on the number of land tracts. The number of land tracts is also the number of objects. The data used for evaluations differ depending on the objectives. When talking about taking over objects, the condition of land and structures is of primary importance, and will be evaluated, to the extent possible. Determining, however, the possible danger of attack, other things would have to be considered, like combat technology and the number of troops. Playing With Numbers Russia has been playing with numbers from the very beginning. When the Estonian-Russian negotiations started in the Spring of 1992, the Estonian delegation was told that there are roughly 20,000 military personnel here. According to our data, there must have been close to 40,000. And there were. After looking into it, it turned out that the Russian delegation had conveniently left out the border guard and the naval personnel, thus politely attempting to conceal their presence. For some reason it was to their benefit to show these numbers smaller than they actually were. Maybe because Estonian independence was viewed at the time as a passing phenomenon? Then a sudden about-face occurred. The word from Moscow was, for example, that there were 4,170 men in the air defense division. Local commanders of the division, however, spoke openly of 1,500. There was also a time at which five or six different Russian agencies all came out with numbers that, on occasion, differed from each other by up to 5,000 men. Our experts explained this with the realization on the part of Russians that they really must leave. But, to get more aid out of the Western countries, they tried to inflate the actual figures at the outset, only to show afterwards how vigorously they are leaving! Everything Hinges on Political Will One small example. Last spring Vassili Svirin, head of the Russian delegation for negotiations, said that they still had 7,600 men here. This number decreased rapidly throughout the summer, but that decrease came to a sudden halt in October. Why? A little later president Yeltsin issued an ukaz about stopping the removal of troops... By now, we have heard that talk about stopping removal in so many versions, and on so many different occasions. At the same time new arguments emerge. When, at first, it was said that the troops have no place to go that fast, then now it is spelled out clearly: The troops are here to defend the Russian minority. However, it seems that even that is not the ultimate truth. More and more factors indicate that this minority being `defended' is another pretext. The actual reason is part of the need to preserve Russia's avant guarde positions, territories conquered at some point in history and now in danger of slipping away. Our eastern neighbors are programmed for imperialism, and there is little we can do about it. Behind the Broad Back of Veterans Now, a new pretext has been found. Those retired officers numbering 10,000 to 11,000 who, according to the foreign laws and government regulations should be leaving the country, have supposedly no place to go. This is nothing more than a military version of protecting the national minority. That, too, has been programmed into our lives a long time ago. During the 70's, Moscow came up with an ingenious plan to ease the pressure of seniors on the city. It was decided to scatter them to the warmer parts of the huge homeland. The Baltic countries received their share, especially in the form of retired or reserve officers. This had its reasons. A good network of roads and relatively decent communications would make it possible for them to be recruited, in case of a general draft. Back then, this was necessary against external enemies. But now? Construction units put up the houses, after which some of them were turned over to be administered by local authorities. But it was military personnel who took up residence there. The officer may have served in the Northern Arctic region but, after entering reserves, chose to live in Tallinn. The `creative construction' of the Estonian SSR was obviously none of his business. There are many like him. Others stayed on living in housing space assigned to the military. Yet others were given apartments bought from the city's housing authority by the Soviet ministry of defense. Just try to get rid of them now. It could not be done without setting off loud complaints about human rights violations. To make things worse, the officer did not come alone, there is usually a family in tow. At Tapa, for example, there are roughly 1,000 people living on the military base, only 600 of them military personnel. So, we get to the next step. Russia does not have to take its officers out, it can demobilize them here. The number of troops decreased? Decreased. If and when men are needed, the same people can be recruited, but now under contract, as civilians. Other Hocus Pocus Tactics For some time now, I have been wondering if diplomat Svirin really knows, for example, the number of military personnel staying here. He gets his information from the foreign ministry who, in turn, gets it from the defense ministry. And the latter could be easily fooled. One air defense unit only had five men left, plus a commander, who was already a board member of some corporation or other. You may recall the incident behind the Marja store in Tallinn, a few years ago. That object, too, had been pawned off to some corporation. One of its board members, however, was an officer of the unit stationed there. When members of Estonia's Defense Forces came to take over the object, marines were summoned promptly, who trampled our boys in the mud, face down. By now, such transformations into businessmen have become part of Russia's national policy. Let us in every way support military and other kinds of businessmen! Could one really believe that the marines who had for a while stayed at the Laidoner estate have left by now? According to some sources, about a third of them are in Tallinn. They live in the city and wear civilian clothes. So much for the military security of the state of Estonia. And, should these pseudo-military corporations get state funds or some other capital to back them up, it could well be the end of our economic independence. But that is another topic.
