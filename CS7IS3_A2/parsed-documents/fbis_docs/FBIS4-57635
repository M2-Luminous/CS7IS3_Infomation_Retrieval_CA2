FBIS4-57635 "drlat099_n_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 Chile _O_ Polls Show Optimism About New Government _O_ Polls Show Optimism About New Government 94P20768A 94P20768A CSO [Editorial Report] Two public opinion polls published recently in Santiago LA NACION show high approval ratings for the Patricio Aylwin and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle governments and indicate popular concern about corruption and the transition to democracy. CERC Poll The results of a poll conducted at the beginning of April by the Center for the Study of Contemporary Reality (CERC), of the Christian Humanism Academy University, were published on 9 April. The report did not include any information on how the poll was conducted. Although 86.2 percent considered democracy the best political system, 75.1 percent expected it to be effective in solving Chile's problems. Regarding the transition "from dictatorship to democracy", 60.5 percent thought it has not been completed, with 16.7 percent saying its end depended on Army Commander in Chief General Augusto Pinochet's retiring, 9.9 percent on solving the problem of the missing persons and "finding out the truth," 5.4 percent on enacting constitutional reforms, and 5.1 percent on "forgetting the past." The approval ratings of both the Aylwin and Frei administrations at the start of their terms exceeded their vote percentages, which the CERC researchers explain as being due to the public's positive attitude toward any legitimate government rather than support for a specific government. In this poll, the Aylwin administration received a retrospective approval rating of 85 percent. Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley was considered the best minister, with 25.5 percent, followed by Interior Minister Enrique Krauss with 11 percent, while Defense Minister Patricio Rojas was considered the worst with 7.6 percent. For the Frei administration, 73.5 percent of the respondents declared that they were supporters, and Frei received an 84-percent approval rating overall. The researchers note that Frei's rating does not seem to be affected by the controversy surrounding Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange's alleged involvement in a case of human rights violations in 1985. In answer to open-ended but unspecified questions about who the most important leaders of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy (CPPD) were, apart from Frei, Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos received 30.1 percent, followed "at a great distance" by Senate President Gabriel Valdes at 8.3 percent and Interior Minister German Correa at 3.4 percent. In the opposition, National Renewal (RN) President Andres Allamand obtained 32.3 percent, followed by former RN senator Sergio Onofre Jarpa with 5.5 percent. When asked questions about the issue of corruption, more respondents thought there was corruption during the Pinochet regime (60 percent) than during the Aylwin administration (52 percent). When comparing the public and private sectors, 82.9 percent responded that the problem of corrupion was "serious or very serious" in the public sector, compared with 70.5 percent for the private sector. When asked where there was the most corruption in the public sector, 12.5 percent cited municipal governments, followed by courts and judges with 11.2 percent, and Codelco (Copper Corporation) with 8.8 percent. Adimark Poll A survey taken by the Adimark polling company in the country's major cities between 4 and 18 March and published in Santiago LA NACION on 26 March revealed that optimism about the economy had increased. Fully 58 percent of the respondents thought their economic situation would improve in the coming year, compared to 45.4 percent in the December Adimark poll. Asked which problems the government should devote the greatest efforts to, 55.8 percent named health care, with crime at 49.7 percent. Aylwin received a 69-percent approval rating, compared with 51.4 percent in December and 73.6 percent in June 1990. His approval rating was higher among women, those above age 55, and independents. He received the highest scores for handling of foreign relations, followed by management of the economy and relations with the Armed Forces. The issues on which he received the lowest ratings were crime, terrorism, handling of corruption, and the health and environmental sectors. With respect to the new Frei administration, 69 percent of the respondents were optimistic while 10 percent were pessimistic. Among the CPPD leadership, Frei received a 44.3-percent rating and Lagos 13 percent. Of the opposition figures, Allamand received the best evaluation with 57 percent, followed "very closely" by Independent Democratic Union (UDI) leader Carlos Bombal. RN deputy Alberto Espina and UDI mayor of Las Condes Joaquin Lavin were third with around 40 percent each.
