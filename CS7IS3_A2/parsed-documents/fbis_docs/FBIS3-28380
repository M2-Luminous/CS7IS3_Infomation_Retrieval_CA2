The sale of construction materials and the opportunity to participate in construction contracts are among the most promising prospects arising from the expected influx of US companies after US President Bill Clinton announced on Thursday night he was lifting the trade embargo, they said. "If we come up with well-thoughtout strategies on the part of both the Government and the private sector the revival of Vietnam can be turned into something complementing, instead of competing with, the Thai economy," Thotsathit Rotprasoet, manager of Thai Military Bank's Ho Chi Minh City branch, told BUSINESS POST. The fact that Vietnam may soon be able to speed up rehabilitation of its war-ravaged infrastructure will boost demand for construction materials, and this presents a potential for growth in bilateral trade with Thailand, said Sinthon Kanthawong, the Thai Commercial Counsellor to Vietnam in Hanoi. Vietnam's domestic cement production capacity is now four million tons, while the country's Ministry of Construction projects demand at 8-10 million tons. Both Mr Thotsathit and Mr Sinthon agreed that opportunities for Thai construction companies were very clear, either in subcontracting from giant multinationals or in supplying construction materials and heavy machinery. Thailand's location is certainly a plus, Mr Sinthon added. "Thai products are in the quality and price ranges that fit the Vietnamese demand and purchasing power besides being in a geographically convenient location," he said. However, Thai companies wishing to invest or develop business opportunities in Vietnam will face tougher competition now with many other players entering the scene, especially the Americans and the Japanese, he noted. Mr Thotsathit called on the Government to promote trade financing facilities in order to allow greater and easier trade in construction materials such as cement, asphalt, cranes and other heavy machinery. He also said it was high time the Thai Construction Contractors' Association moved into the Vietnamese market under the leadership of the Thai Government, in a systematic way. Such a movement has not yet taken place, he added. Mr Thotsathit said Thailand could help fill the gaps existing in Vietnam to create a complementary economy. "There is a reason to fear rivalry with Vietnam if the Thais are not well-prepared. But if we are well-prepared, the growth of Vietnamese economy can benefit the Thai economy, and this is already very clear with the construction sector." Mr Sinthon agreed, saying that competltlon in the production and export of primary agricultural commodities is inevitable. "But for manufactured products such as motorbikes, electric appliances, consumer goods or semi-processed goods, Thailand can meet those rising demands in Vietnam," he added. Thailand has to take the competitiveness factor into consideration in the longer term but not the short term, he noted.
