Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of shares. Applicants believe that their request to permit the CDSC arrangement would permit shareholders the option of having more investment dollars working for them from the time of their share purchases than if they chose a class with a front-end sales load. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in one portfolio of a Company, and will be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of the same portfolio will relate solely to: (a) the impact of (i) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a Plan, (ii) other Class Expenses which would be limited to (A) transfer agency fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares, (B) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholder of a class, (C) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (D) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (E) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (F) litigation or other legal expenses or audit or other accounting expenses relating solely to one class of shares, and (G) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; and (iii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class and which are approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a portfolio's Plans and any other matter submitted to shareholders relating to Class Expenses, except as provided in condition 17 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (d) the designation of each class of shares of a portfolio; and/or (e) certain conversion features offered by some of the classes. 2. The board of directors of a Company, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the multiclass distribution system. The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement a multi-class system will reflect in detail the reasons for the directors' determination that the proposed multi-class system is in the best interests of both the Company involved and its shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors of a Company, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the Company. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Company to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. 4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of a Company, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each portfolio having a multi-class system for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of each portfolio. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. A portfolio's investment adviser and distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, a portfolio's investment adviser and/or distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.
