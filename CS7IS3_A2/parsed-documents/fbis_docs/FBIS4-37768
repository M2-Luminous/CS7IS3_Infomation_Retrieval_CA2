The party stressed that it "it has not taken any decision to resort to military action and it is still committed to a peaceful solution. However, it is leaving the door open to the option of replying to aggression." In a press conference they held in London yesterday, attended by some leaders of the other parties who stressed their parties' solidarity and condemned al-Mahdi's arrest, Ummah Party leaders said that "the Ummah Party's principled position is against assassinations and bombings, which the Sudanese scene has never witnessed before and which conflicts with Sudanese ethics." Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, head of the party's Executive Bureau and official in charge of external action, said: "We chose political struggle as a means to oppose that military regime without seeking to shed blood or request foreign intervention. Historically, we resorted to armed struggle against aggression twice: once against colonialism and once against (former President Ja'far) Numayri after he destroyed the strongholds of Ansar al-Mahdi [followers of Imam al-Mahdi] and killed their imam." He said: "While we adhere to the peaceful struggle option, we keep our other options open. And if the ruling (National Islamic) Front resorts to violence and to bloody liquidation and opens the door of aggression, our party will leave the door open to the resumption of armed action." [passage omitted] Dr. 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, secretary general of the Ummah Party, also spoke at the conference, stressing that "the political and economic crises the regime is experiencing, as well as the crises in its relations with the world, prompted the fabrication of accusations against the party's leaders. The fabrication of this kind of theatrical ploy is characteristic of military regimes, because they are based on conspiracy and have no legitimacy." He said that al-Bashir's regime "has been tyrannical for five years and lacks constitutional legitimacy, as it has done the opposite of what it promised in its first statement." He pointed out that "the rejection of the regime has begun to increase while popular and regional support for it has declined, and there is now a general belief that the regime is about to collapse." He said that the recent accusations against al-Mahdi are made "because he managed to set up a leadership for the Democratic National Grouping inside the country and to establish strong opposition committed to civil resistance." He added that "al-Mahdi insists on this line despite the the great pressures put on him to engage in an armed battle with the regime." He said that the Ummah Party does not want a military confrontation, "because the loser will be the people of Sudan and those representing them, not the small (Islamic) Front organization." He said that an armed confrontation would mean turning Sudan into a situation similar to the one Rwanda is currently experiencing. He believes that leveling accusations at the Ummah Party "is a trick designed to avoid the scandals that the defendants being tried in the Ansar al-Sunnah Mosque massacre case could reveal." He stressed that "the political and economic siege, corruption, the regime's isolation, and international condemnations of it have caused the regime to behave hysterically. And we will confront the Front if it persists in its behavior. We are optimistic that the regime is about to collapse, and its actions will change nothing in the situation. We are against violence and have not yet decided on the armed action option. But if physical liquidations begin, we will have to reply to that aggression." [passage omitted]
