Because of uncertainty in the political situation, the money markets were upset, and the pound-mark exchange rate fell to its lowest point in five months. On the afternoon of 29 March, Prime Minister Major delivered an official statement to Parliament, saying that Britain would accept a package from the Council of Ministers of the EU to reform the current voting mechanism. In his statement, Major defended himself by arguing that the EU had made concessions to Britain by agreeing that, although veto power remained at 27 votes, a resolution could be postponed "for a reasonable time" if there were 23 opposition votes and that Britain would enjoy the prospect of additional provisions in the social charter. Major also explained that this was just "a transitional arrangement," as the EU would renegotiate the voting mechanism in 1996. He said that the EU would be expanded according to schedule in line with Britain's interests. People remember that only one week ago, Major was still using tough words to indicate that he would not make any concessions on reforming the voting mechanism, and announced that he would "fight for Britain's interests." Just one week later, he made a 180-degree turnaround and accepted the voting reform package. Although he tried hard to play down the impact of such a change in position, he still faced strong criticism from MP's. Labour MP's said that Major was "struggling in vain as he knew he could not win" and once again showed the "political stupidity of the Major cabinet." Conservative MP's put Major in a more embarrassing position. Conservative MP Tony Marlow, who has doubts about the European Community, said that this showed John Major had lost his "credibility" and "ability to lead the Conservative Party." He demanded that Major step down and give up his office to a more capable person. His speech was described by the mass media as the "fiercest attack on an incumbent prime minister in the past 30 years," and aroused strong repercussions in the Parliament. Other Euro-skeptics said that he "said what they wanted to say." Some celebrities, newspapers, and magazines in Britain also commented and held that John Major had lost the trust of the Conservative Party and the British public, and it seems it is hard to restore people's trust. In British political circles, a gust of strong wind is blowing to drive Major out of office. The trend to unseat Major has also appeared inside the Conservative Party. Not long ago, four or five members of the British cabinet disagreed with John Major's idea about "returning to basic values"; after that, in an investigation of British arms sales to Iraq, Secretary for Trade and Industry Michael Heseltine, who played a key role as "political assassin" in the action to topple Mrs. Thatcher, held a different attitude from Major and other cabinet members, and this attracted extensive attention from the mass media. It is generally held that Heseltine has ambitions to "make a comeback" and has become a strong threat to Major. Reportedly, in a televised interview, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke also admitted that "when Major has no intention of being leader of the Conservative Party," he would "be willing to succeed Major." Reportedly, four members of Major's cabinet expressed doubts about the EU voting mechanism reforms. Although Heseltine and Clarke indicated separately on 31 March that they would continue to support Major, differences among senior officials of the Conservative Party were exposed. Authoritative people here said that as Major has no definite views of his own, his leading position inside the party would certainly be challenged at the party's annual conference next fall and would be in danger. According to the result of an opinion poll conducted by THE SUNDAY TIMES, one quarter of Conservative MP's agree that Major should step down. In fact, Major was facing unmentionable difficulties when changing his position from strongly opposing the EU's voting mechanism reform to making a compromise. Britain has always had deep misgivings about the process of European integration, and the skeptics have a strong influence. Although Major upheld the point of "returning to the center of Europe," he cannot but make certain concessions to the skeptics from time to time; otherwise, his cabinet would often run into snags in the legislative process and his position would become more unstable. However, while holding a tough attitude toward the European Parliament, his foreign secretary demanded that concessions should be made toward the EU, and this forced Major to make the compromise he was not ready to make. Otherwise, Hurd would have submitted his resignation, which would have led to a cabinet crisis and would have also caused discontent in Germany and France. Moreover, the four new members of the EU would have been further pushed to Germany's side and Britain would have made itself more isolated. Recently, Major indicated that he had no intention of resigning from office; Secretary for Trade and Industry Heseltine and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke also put on a posture of safeguarding party unity. It seems that Major has ridden out another crisis. However, as some people in the ruling and opposition parties still call for deposing Major, it is also an undisputed fact that Major's leadership position has been further weakened.
