Nevertheless, as the sun set on the First Republic, deputy Franceso D'Onofrio did not look like a ghost. Seated, or rather, slouching on a sofa in the Chamber of Deputies, he spent the day shaking hands with those who came to pay tribute, not only DC members. He has already been consecrated as the "bishop" of the split from the Italian People's Party [PPI]: for 24 hours now, D'Onofrio has been the floor leader of the Christian Democratic Center (so far comprising 23 former DC deputies). [Guiglia] You have "split" from [PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli, but will you not make peace sooner or later, as good Christian Democrats? [D'Onofrio] We will certainly remain united within the Catholic Church. In Italian political life, however, we will not be reunited, not at least with those who represent PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] leader Occhetto's hard core within the People's Party. [Guiglia] Was the rift caused by ideological motives or by electoral calculations? [D'Onofrio] Fortunately, the current majority system cannot guarantee anybody a seat. Even the infamous proportional quota, which forms part of the mechanism and is coveted by several parliamentarians, is mere "guesswork." [Guiglia] Within the moderate pole, [Pact for Italy leader Mario] Segni does not want a dialogue with the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. Do Christian Democrats agree? [D'Onofrio] I am one of the few DC supporters who showed some interest in [MSI Secretary Gianfranco] Fini's evolution toward the center. If National Alliance's upcoming convention confirms what Fini has often told me -- namely, that a new right, capable of governing and with a European outlook, is rising from the ashes of the MSI -- then my position is very simple: The alliance of those who really want to constitute an alternative to the left cannot afford not to examine, very closely, the possibility of its platform converging with that of National Alliance. [Guiglia] Can you also trust [League ideologue Gianfranco] Miglio, and his three Italies doctrine? [D'Onofrio] As far as Miglio the academic is concerned, I am a minor colleague of his. As regards Miglio the politician, I never believed that he was one and the same thing as the League, nor that the League was the same thing as him. [Guiglia] Does this also apply to Segni and his "Pact for Italy"? [D'Onofrio] Mariotto [Segni] cannot expect to be umpire and center-field at the same time in this game. He must choose between being the leader of a government coalition whose identity is guaranteed and safeguarded by him, or, alternatively, he must limit himself to leading a platoon of deputies back into parliament. [Guiglia] You are considered a Cossiga man. However, the former president tried to negotiate with Martinazzoli until the very last. Did Cossiga betray the "pickaxe policy"? [D'Onofrio] The former head of state's mission to Brescia aimed simply to confirm whether the First Republic was indeed dead. [Guiglia] Cossiga acting as Martinazzoli's coroner? [D'Onofrio] I think that by meeting Martinazzoli, the chairman simply wished to have direct confirmation, namely, of the fact that he had been the first to read the signs correctly. Cossiga predicted that the end of the Cold War would lead to the disappearance of the DC and the PCI [Italian Communist Party]. He was dead on! [Guiglia] However, did the "pickaxer" congratulate you on your split? [D'Onofrio] Cossiga basically told us the following: "I do not regard you as deserters, because nobody was fighting the war any more." [Guiglia] Martinazzoli, Segni, D'Onofrio -- will we end up with three DC's instead of one? [D'Onofrio] The People's Party can no longer claim to be the sole heir to the democratic tradition. There are many heirs today, all of them legitimate. In addition, we have disproved those who did not wish to talk to the League on the grounds that an agreement on national unity was impossible. [Guiglia] What is the basic difference between Martinazzoli's party and that of D'Onofrio, Casini, and Fumagalli Carulli? [D'Onofrio] On one side, there are those who mistakenly believe that they can carry on happily on their own. On the other side, there are those who hope to bring Italy to make a choice between two alternative government alignments. The former want to go back to the past, we are looking forward to the future -- a future that could begin as early as spring. Martinazzoli's party is getting ready to rebake Occhetto's stale bread, the choice being between the bitter bread of communist Cossutta, and the tasteless bread of the "new" People's Party. [Guiglia] You have been joined by Mastella, [former DC Secretary] De Mita's former spokesperson. What about renewal, then? [D'Onofrio] Mastella was never a secretary nor held a post in the old establishment. Furthermore, today he risks losing his seat in parliament, as we all are. De Mita, on the contrary, is now forced to act as his own spokesperson. [Guiglia] Will you answer "yes" or "no" to [Fininvest President] Berlusconi's appeal to moderates? [D'Onofrio] I believe Berlusconi will enter into politics only if the anti-PDS alignment does not take shape. In such an event, he would do well to join in at full steam, thereby invigorating the whole spectrum constituting the alternative to Occhetto.
