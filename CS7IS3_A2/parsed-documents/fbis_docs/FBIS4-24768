On May 30, the United Nations Security Council adopted a presidential statement, demanding the DPRK to hold consultations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over the measures of the replacement of fuel rods at the reactor. A Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that the statement by the U.N. Security Council "groundlessly" slandered the DPRK. He added, "It is entirely wrong for the Security Council to have discussed the question of the DPRK on the basis of the wrong judgment made by the Secretariat of the agency (IAEA) without any justifiable reason." The presidential statement of the U.N. Security Council also asked the IAEA inspectors to stay in DPRK and continue the inspection. However, the DPRK spokesman argued, "Since we are in a unique status after a temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty on nuclear arms), it is clear that we cannot accept such routine and ad hoc inspection as selected preservation of fuel rods." if the IAEA Secretariat and the U.N. Security Council, bereft of impartiality, insist on pressure with an unreasonable attitude, DPRK will take "decisive countermeasures" to continue its peaceful nuclear activities, said the spokesman. "We will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the intention to deal with the issue in a fair way and resolve it in a peaceful way through dialogue," declared the spokesman. But he added, "We will counter without slightest compromise any intention to unjustifiably put pressure on us, ignoring our sovereignty, if but a little."
