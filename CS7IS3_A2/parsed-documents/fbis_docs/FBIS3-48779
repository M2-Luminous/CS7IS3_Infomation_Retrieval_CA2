The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and manufacturing sectors came to 88.0 against the base 100 for 1990, the ministry said in a preliminary report. The index was the second-lowest under the 1990 base, introduced in May last year, after 87.6 registered last October. Shipments in December decreased 0.3 percent for an index figure of 89.7, also a shift from a 1.0 percent growth in November. The inventory index declined 0.8 percent to 108.4, following a 0.8 percent rise in November. The December inventory-to-sales ratio rose 1.3 percent against a 0.5 percent slide in November, with the index standing at 125.6. Industrial output has been seeing ups and downs alternately in the past five months -- a 1.2 percent fall in August, a 2.2 percent gain in September and a 5.5 percent slide in October, the largest- ever decline. On an unadjusted basis, industrial production in December slid 4.2 percent from a year before for the 27th successive month of decline, the longest ever losing streak.
