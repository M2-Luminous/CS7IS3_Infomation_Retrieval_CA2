Rao, said on Thursday that Russia had expressed its inability to go ahead with the transfer of technology on the controversial cryogenic rocket engines. Talking to newsmen at the inauguration of a private company set up for manufacturing hybrid micro devices which could find application in the realm of space, Prof Rao said discussions were on between the Russian Space Agency, Glavkosmos, and the ISRO on the cryogenic engines deal, and that something had to be evolved to the satisfaction of all. Asked if he was satisfied with the discussions, Prof Rao said if he was happy, he would have said so. The ISRO chief said efforts were on to build the cryogenic engines indigenously and added that he was confident that the Indian engines would be ready by 1998. ISRO had already built a one tonne sub-scale cryogenic engine at its Mahendragiri facility. Facilities for testing the cryogenic engines were being readied, he added. Prof. Rao said ISRO would not pay a rupee more than Rs 235 crore to Glavkosmos for the cryogenic engine deal, whatever may be the outcome of discussions now underway. Nothing will stop us from building our own facilities, he asserted. Prof Rao said ISRO had not approached the General Dynamics Inc. (of the United States), the Arianespace or the Glavkosmos for the knowhow on cryogenic engines. These organisations had contacted the ISRO and the Russian offer was accepted when the Arianespace bid was about to be placed before the Union Cabinet. He said the technology embargo slapped by the United States on the ISRO (for alleged violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime) was nothing new, for such "unpronounced embargos" existed much before the cryo-deal was struck with Russia.
