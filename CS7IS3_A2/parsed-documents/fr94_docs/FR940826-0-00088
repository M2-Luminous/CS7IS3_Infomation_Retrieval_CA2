FR940826-0-00088 FR940826-0-00017 (b) R&hyph;406A._R&hyph;406A, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and isobutane, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted vending machines. See the discussion on R&hyph;406A under retrofitted R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (c) R&hyph;507._R&hyph;507, which consists of HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted vending machines. None of this blend's constituents contains chlorine, and thus this blend poses no threat to stratospheric ozone. However, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a have very high GWPs. EPA strongly encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend in order to reduce its direct global warming impact. Although HFC&hyph;143a is flammable, the blend is not. It is an azeotrope, so it will not fractionate during operation. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable. (d) HCFC Blend Gamma._HCFC Blend Gamma, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and HCFC&hyph;124, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted vending machines. See the discussion on HCFC Blend Gamma under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12, R&hyph;500, and CFC&hyph;502 refrigerated transport. (15) CFC&hyph;12 Vending Machines, New (a) R&hyph;404A._R&hyph;404A, which consists of HFC&hyph;125, HC&hyph;143a, and HFC&hyph;134a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new vending machines. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 vending machines. (b) R&hyph;507._R&hyph;507, which consists of HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new vending machines. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 vending machines. (16) CFC&hyph;12 Water Coolers, Retrofit (a) R&hyph;406A._R&hyph;406A, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and isobutane, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted water coolers. See the discussion on R&hyph;406A under retrofitted R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (b) HCFC Blend Gamma._HCFC Blend Gamma, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and HCFC&hyph;124, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted water coolers. See the discussion on HCFC Blend Gamma under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12, R&hyph;500, and CFC&hyph;502 refrigerated transport. (17) CFC&hyph;12 Household Refrigerators, Retrofit (a) R&hyph;406A._R&hyph;406A, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and isobutane, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted household refrigerators. See the discussion on R&hyph;406A under retrofitted R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (b) HCFC Blend Gamma._HCFC Blend Gamma, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and HCFC&hyph;124, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted household refrigerators. See the discussion on HCFC Blend Gamma under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12, R&hyph;500, and CFC&hyph;502 refrigerated transport. (18) CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 Household Freezers, Retrofit (a) R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B._R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, propane, and HFC&hyph;125, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted household freezers. HCFC&hyph;22 contributes to ozone depletion, and will be phased out according to the accelerated schedule (published 12/10/93, 58 FR 65018), although it has a lower ODP than CFC&hyph;12. The GWP of HFC&hyph;125 is very high and that of HCFC&hyph;22 is somewhat high. Although these blends contain one flammable constituent, propane, the blends themselves are not flammable. In addition, while testing demonstrated that the vapor and liquid compositions changed during leaks, neither phase became flammable. (b) R404A._R&hyph;404A, which consists of HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;143a, and HFC&hyph;134a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted household freezers. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 vending machines. (c) R&hyph;406A._R&hyph;406A, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and isobutane, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted household freezers. See the discussion on R&hyph;406A under retrofitted R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (d) R&hyph;507._R&hyph;507, which consists of HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted household freezers.
