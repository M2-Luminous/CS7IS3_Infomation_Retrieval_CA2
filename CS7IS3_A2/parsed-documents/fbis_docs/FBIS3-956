Terming the story as total lies, Mr. Chelang'a expressed shock that anyone in their right mind could engage himself in disinformation campaign with the aim of inciting people into chaos. He said the government will deal with the authors firmly and ruthlessly. Mr. Chelang'a, who was addressing members of the press in his office, lamented that similar disinformation campaigns responsible for the clashes which hit parts of the province last year, aimed at setting the country on the war path, which could not be allowed [sentence as received]. He called on the security officers in the province to be on the lookout, noting that the story had given a clear indication that last year's instigators of the clashes had embarked on new campaign, which he explained had made a "ritual" towards every end of school term, in order to create tension and fear among residents. The PC said in last year's clashes similar rumours were peddled by the same people which caused people of different tribes to react, and he urged the people of Molo not overreact to the false story and disrupt the peace they were currently enjoying. At the same time, Mr. Chelang'a challenged the editorial of THE STANDARD to send an independent group to Kamara area, where the incident was alleged to have occurred, and witness for themselves how people from different tribes resident in the area were peacefully coexisting. Mr. Chelang'a called on journalists to always countercheck their stories with those on the ground for purposes of authenticity, noting that if THE STANDARD newspaper had bothered to countercheck the story they would have confirmed that it was a fabrication.
