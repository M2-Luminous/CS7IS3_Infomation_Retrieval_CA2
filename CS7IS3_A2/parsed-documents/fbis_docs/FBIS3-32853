Martin Faz from the National Network of Civilian Organizations All Rights for All [Red Nacional de Organismos Civiles Todos los Derechos para Todos] assured at a news conference that Severino, Sebastian, and Hermelindo Santiz were arrested by the Army on 7 January in Altamirano, one of the municipalities taken over by guerrillas. Since then, they had been reported as missing. Faz said ONG members today found the "remains, bones, clothing, and footware, allowing us to assure that they correspond to the people who were reported as missing." According to Faz, reports from residents of Morelia in Altamirano municipality indicate that the three people were "arbitrarily arrested by some Mexican Army soldiers on 7 January." Fax added that "there is no doubt" that the remains correspond to those three people; a relative has identified the clothing and a "dental bridge" that belonged to one of the missing. Thomas Craine, a member of the organization Medical Doctors for Human Rights [Medicos por los Derechos Humanos] that participated in the search, said, "We did not find evidence of the cause of death, but we have asked for a completed forensic and anthropological investigation." Craine said the remains have been turned over to the Attorney General's Office and the National Commission for Human Rights which had initiated earlier investigations. The Mexican Army's conduct during the Indian armed rebellion has been criticized by the ONG for engaging in extreme actions, such as secret executions and arbitrary arrests.
