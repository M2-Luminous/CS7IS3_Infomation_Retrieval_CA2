FBIS4-66801 "jpnea027___94042" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 17 March 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA All-India Trade Union Conference Held All-India Trade Union Conference Held 94AS0268G Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 17 Mar 94 p 9 94AS0268G Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] Patna, March 16--The 35th national conference of the All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) concluded here yesterday with a call for organisational unification of the trade unions, to wage battle against the new economic policies of the Central government, which, according to it, was dictated by the IMF and the World Bank in the name of free market economy and globalisation. Briefing mediapersons on the concluding day of the five-day conference, the newly elected general secretary of the AITUC, Mr A.B. Bardhan, said that it was felt at the conference that there should be one union in an establishment, one industrial federation at state and national levels and one central trade union at the national level, which would function democratically and independently. The AITUC had called upon unions at the grassroot level and trade union centres to come together on the basis of a common outlook and common programme of action, he added. Commenting on the demand of the Centre for Indian Trade Union (CITU) for formation of a confederation of all trade unions, Mr Bardhan said that it could be the beginning, but it was not enough. The merger of trade unions should be the ultimate aim. Hence, the current session welcomed the decision of the AITUC and the Hind Majdoor Sabha (HMS) to constitute co-ordination committees at different levels, with a view to pave the way for an eventual merger. Such a committee at the national level had already been formed, Mr Bardhan said. The resolution, adopted at the conference, says that transnational corporations are being given free access almost in every sphere and public sector enterprises are being systematically dismantled. Workers and employees are facing the grim prospect of closure, retrenchment and mass unemployment under the new economic policies. Alongside this, national unity and integrity are being endangered by communal and other divisive forces. The country's independence and sovereignty are under grave threats. The resolution on minimum wages adopted at the conference pointed to the fact that much larger section of workers were in the unorganised sector and there was disparity in wages in various states and hence this disparity within a region should be removed.
