To calculate mid-1990 dollars, multiply 1987 dollars by a factor of 1.111. Total cost values may not add due to rounding. b Costs for good combustion practices are included in combustor design (no cost). c CI = activated carbon injection. d APCD = air pollution control device. e MB/WW = mass burn waterwall combustor. f SD/FF = spray dryer and fabric filter. g SNCR = selective noncatalytic reduction. h Does not add to 100 percent due to rounding. i MOD/SA = modular starved-air combustor.
