Admiral Baltin Does Not Want To Take Any Risky Steps"] [Text] It has transpired from sources close to the Black Sea Fleet staff that a telegram from Ukrainian Defense Minister General Vitaliy Radetskyy to Admiral Eduard Baltin, Black Sea Fleet commander, was received on 15 April, in which the former categorically objects to the entry of Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels to the Ukrainian ports of Odessa, Izmail, Kherson, and Nikolayev. Meanwhile, the Black Sea Fleet command has been preparing ships for evacuating eight families of the 318th Division's servicemen who refused to take the oath of loyalty to Ukraine. When meeting with them, Vice Admiral Vladimir Beskaravaynyy, commander in chief of the Ukrainian Navy, who heads the naval field staff at the "Slavutich" cruiser in Odessa, proposed that the officers take an oath of allegiance to Ukraine and follow him on board "Slavutich." The commander of "Ilya Azarov," a ship blocked in the Odessa port, responded: "We will not go to an enemy ship; these people have robbed us. They will finish robbing us there." In Odessa, the Black Sea Fleet's surveillance post has also been blocked. Black Sea Fleet staff officers point out that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry has made it clear by its actions that it is carrying out the functions of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and its Foreign Ministry. Currently, the 318th Division of mothballed ships includes three Black Sea Fleet ships, on which Ukrainian flags have already been hoisted. Black Sea Fleet Commander Adm. Baltin has decided not to take any steps to evacuate servicemen, because this may be interpreted by the Ukrainian side as a provocation.
