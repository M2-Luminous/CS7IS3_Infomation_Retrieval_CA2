Karimov: "Islam Karimov: We Are Reliable Partners"] [Text] History itself has predestined Uzbekistan to be at the crossroads of the main roads in Eurasia linking West and East, South and North. Our republic can become a Eurasian economic and cultural bridge where preconditions are created for the movement and exchange of goods, technologies, investment, and cultural assets. Amid the breakdown of the once unified financial and monetary-credit systems, the severing of economic ties, and galloping inflation Uzbekistan found itself in a difficult starting position two years ago, which set us two complex tasks: On the one hand, we had to implement the in-depth reforms involved in the transition to a market economy and, on the other, adopt urgent measures to stabilize the economy and prevent a drastic drop in the population's prosperity. In these conditions, in order to overcome the grave legacy of the past, enable the all-around transformation of the economy, and secure economic independence for Uzbekistan based on historical, national specific conditions, our people's way of life and mentality that have developed over the centuries, and at the same time the difficult experience gleaned by countries that have covered this thorny route, we chose our own means of development based on five basic principles, which boil down to the following: the priority of the economy over politics. At the same time both domestic economic strategy and foreign economic relations must be completely rid of the influence of any political ideology; the regulating role of the state as the initiator of economic reforms and the main implementer thereof. Since it is accountable for choosing strategic priorities in the economy and shaping a legal base and assists in forming and developing entrepreneurial and reforming state managerial structures as well as credit, tax, and currency policy and creating conditions to attract investment, and prepare the population for reforms; the supremacy of the law in all spheres of public life; the implementation of a strong social policy designed to protect the population, particularly socially vulnerable groups, the disabled, children, and large families. The state can only consider itself humane when it can defend its population, particularly during the crucial transitional period; a phased transition to the market. The real economic situation, specific demographic conditions, and the low standard of living of the overwhelming number of families make the "shock therapy" route unacceptable for the republic during the transition to the market. Time is needed to change the organizational, economic, and financial-credit systems, create the appropriate legal base and a market infrastructure, and train cadres. Uzbekistan has a wealth of natural economic and mineral raw material resources. Prospected stocks of over 750 kinds of mineral resources alone are estimated at around $3 trillion. Today we have a program and a fairly clear idea of how to implement reforms in the republic. Our domestic policy is geared to a gradual phased transition to a socially oriented market economy which precludes revolutionary upheaval and the mass impoverishment of the people. Reforms are not an end in themselves for us but a means of really giving broad strata of the population access to property, reviving the sense of ownership, and creating on this basis the conditions for the development of initiative and enterprise. The Uzbek Constitution well and truly paves the way for market relations, ensures freedom of enterprise, and prevents the state having the monopoly to interfere in economic activity. Our Fundamental Law stresses that private ownership comes under state protection. We regard the stage-by-stage implementation of reforms as a necessary condition for the preservation of sociopolitical stability. But it is also true that the very stability of the situation in turn enables reforms to be carried out in a well-considered, well-gauged manner without artificially speeding events up for political motives. The implementation of a strong social policy is a clear priority during all stages of reform and a guarantor of its irreversibility for us. Over the years of independence a new mechanism of social protection has in effect been created for the population, oriented to targeted support for the most needy strata during the transition to the market. This has been reflected in a guaranteed minimum wage and pension, the organization of rationed supply of the most important foodstuffs, the provision of compensatory payments, etc. Attaching great importance to deepening multilateral cooperation between the republics of the former Union, Uzbekistan from the outset supported the idea of forming the Commonwealth of Independent States. We think that its potential has by no means been exhausted. The Treaty of Economic Union reveals good prospects in this respect. At present there is the task of ensuring the real fulfillment of the provisions enshrined therein. While cooperating within the CIS framework, we do at the same time attach great importance to the process of integration within the Central Asian region. Considerable progress has been made here in our relations with the Republic of Kazakhstan and Republic of Kyrgyzstan. Needless to say, by no means all our problems have been resolved, we still have a very difficult life. Over the previous decades our republic's economy developed a great dependence on imports of a wide range of output and consumer goods. The severing of economic ties and the worsening of the payment problem owing to unilateral actions taken by certain circles to bring down the ruble zone are having a painful effect on many of our enterprises and the economy as a whole. Of course, it would be wrong in present-day conditions to raise the question of literally reviving all the economic ties on which the old Union-wide division of labor was based. It is a question of preserving partnership in mutually beneficial spheres and organizing new ties in order to ease for each state not only the process of economic stabilization, but also its structural reorganization in line with the inexorable requirements of the world market. The move to international principles of settlement has considerably reduced our once extensive links with partners in East Europe. Whereas in 1990 CEMA countries accounted for around 60 percent of Uzbekistan's exports, these days they account for less than 8 percent. However, we have no intention of abandoning procurements of transport systems from the Czech Republic, medicines and food from Hungary, and certain kinds of agricultural produce from China. The current stage of economic reforms involves the considerable liberalization of foreign economic relations. It is envisaged that customs duties on imports of all kinds of goods will be abolished, export duties reduced, and a competitive procedure for licensing exports from the republic introduced; a state insurance company for Uzbek and foreign investments has been set up to which some of Uzgoskhran's assets will be transferred. All this creates a good base for expanding our cooperation and for jointly resolving the problems of overcoming crisis processes.
