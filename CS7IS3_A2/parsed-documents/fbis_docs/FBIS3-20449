The center summoned me to get me "informed." Yang Shangkun unequivocally promised me that Li Peng would not be allowed to become general secretary. On 22 May the center sent a telegram, asking me to go to Beijing immediately. I estimated that this was about the center's reorganization. Thus I arrived in Beijing on the 23d. The deputy director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, who met me at the airport, had a very unusual expression on his face and looked very nervous. He told me that Beijing Municipality's public security police could no longer perform their duties, that workers, students, and residents were maintaining checkpoints along the streets in the city, checking pedestrians and vehicles, and that government and military vehicles could be detained at any time if they were found at the checkpoints. Therefore vehicles of party organizations and public institutions as well as government and military vehicles had now all changed into using ordinary municipal license plates. To avoid any trouble, we went from the airport to my place of lodging in a roundabout way. That deputy director also told me that the center had transferred Jiang Zemin, secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, to the center, and that to avoid trouble he had pretended to be a doctor after getting off the plane. I asked him why the center had transferred Jiang Zemin here. He replied that he was "not clear," and that he only heard that Jiang had already replaced Hu Qili as the person in charge of propaganda work. I was already mentally prepared since I had learned that Zhao Ziyang had not participated in the meeting of party, government, and military cadres on the 19th, and therefore did not make any further inquiry. But I did not thought that Jiang Zemin would become general secretary. On the 25th Yang Shangkun met with me in a lounge at Mao Zedong's Zhongnanhai swimming pool. At that time they believed the situation in Beijing to be very grave, and many responsible persons had moved. Yang Shangkun and Li Peng had moved into the Zhongnanhai compound, and had become next-door neighbors. One was living at Mao Zedong's swimming pool, and the other was living in a residence next to the swimming pool, which had been Mao Zedong's residence at the time of his death. While waiting for their summoning, I had learned that this trip was for the purpose of getting me "informed," that responsible persons of most provinces and municipalities had already been to Beijing, and that I was one of the last few persons. As for the question of what I would be told, I could already guess 80-90 percent of the answer. Yang Shangkun did not say to me anything about the things that the two of us had discussed on 4 May. As soon as he saw me, he explained: "The Standing Committee has decided that I should talk to you and several others (Yang Shangkun did not mention who those several people were) because I am well-acquainted with you and those several persons." He also said: "According to the decision of the Standing Committee, Zhao Ziyang has been temporarily relieved of his duties. Comrade Xiaoping has said that there does not exist any route of retreat, and that that is why martial law has been used and why the People's Liberation Army [PLA] is being used to put down the turmoil. It is hoped that you can show understanding and support the center's decision." I felt very bad then, and was speechless for a while. It was only after quite a while that I said: "Be sure that no blood is shed in the course of using the PLA!" Yang Shangkun immediately said: "Of course not. Of course not." He also said: "Several marshals, like Marshal Xu and Marshal Nie, are of the same view. They have also given the center the same advice." Then he said again: "Of course not." I then asked: "Who will be general secretary?" Yang Shangkun replied: "No decision has been made yet." Then he added: "The center has not had time to consider the issue." I immediately said to Yang Shangkun in a serious tone: "Be sure not to let Li Peng assume that office!" Yang also unequivocally replied: "Of course not." During this process of asking and answering questions, I became so emotional that I shed tears. Yang Shangkun also asked about the activities in Hong Kong in support of the student movement and about the situation of the institutions in Hong Kong which had been set up by China. He showed particular concern over the situation of the run on the Bank of China. After the meeting went on for approximately 20 minutes, he said that he had to deal with a matter and asked me to see Li Peng: "You may go there to talk with him about the economic situation in Hong Kong." I asked myself whether it was because I had just criticized Li Peng that he had asked me to see Li Peng so that my relationship with Li Peng could become less tense. After saying goodbye to Yang Shangkun, I immediately went to see Li Peng. Li's secretary said that Li was at a State Council meeting, and asked me to sit there for a while. He said that he would tell Li Peng to come back immediately. After I just sat down in the front room, Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin, came out to greet me, and said, putting on high-official airs,: "You have worked very hard in Hong Kong." I was disgusted and gave a forced smile in reply. After sitting down, Zhu Lin immediately began to sing her husband's praises: "Our Old Li is steadfastly righteous, and is not afraid of being opposed by people. He has not been having an easy time lately!" She then said: "The students are creating so much trouble, but Zhao Ziyang would still play his golf...." She was talkative and arrogant. I had all kinds of emotions, and did not say anything to her. Seeing that she could not engage me in conversation, she left the room. As soon as he came, Li Peng asked in a reproaching manner, even before sitting down: "What was the matter with WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO? How could such an incident have happened." I answered directly: "Because of the effects of Tiananmen." I did not make any further explanation. He might have also sensed something; as at that time he could not do much to punish me, he changed into asking me about the situation in Hong Kong in a relaxed tone. I described how Hong Kong residents had taken energetic actions to support the Tiananmen student movement. After listening to me, Li Peng requested that I take up the matter with the British Hong Kong government, asking the British Hong Kong government to impose restrictions on the movement. He also suggested that the WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO incident be investigated and that stern measures be taken accordingly. I said to Li Peng at once: "Circumstances in Hong Kong are different from those in the hinterland and therefore the way of handling things should also be different." I again refused to cooperate. After hearing my reply, Li Peng became very unhappy, and did not express his views any further. I did not talk to him about the economic situation in Hong Kong as Yang Shangkun had asked. I only raised to his consideration the issue of developing the Yangpu Special Economic Zone of Hainan once again. As said in the preceding pages, I had been asked by Xu Shijie [6079 1102 2638], secretary of the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee, to raise the issue. I thus raised the issue in the hope of persuading Li Peng to approve the report by the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee as soon as possible. Li Peng also repeated his set answer that he would approve the use of land on a project-by-project basis, thereby dodging the issue. This was the last time that I talked with Li Peng alone. As we did not see eye to eye with each other, I left before the talk was half a hour old. (120) [2 Sep 93 p 2] [Text] Got Involved in the Infighting at the Core (Part Three of Three) Li Peng issued three instructions. I transmitted them but had reservations. The CPC changed with the shooting in Beijing. I made up my mind to retire. After Beijing declared that the student movement was a case of turmoil, on two occasions Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378] asked his secretary to telephone me, giving me the "suggestion" (he perhaps knew my inclination concerning the movement) that I follow the three instructions that Li Peng had decided to issue in handling the student movement-related matters in Hong Kong: 1) the student movement in Beijing was a case of turmoil; 2) it was necessary to educate office cadres and workers in a positive manner, asking them not to participate in street activities in support of the students; and 3) it was necessary to persist in carrying out work and production. After discussion, we at the CPC Hong Kong and Macao Work Committee decided: that Li Peng's three instructions should be transmitted, and that those having different views should be permitted to maintain reservations but should nevertheless implement the three instructions. In fact, this was a measure showing some reservation about the three instructions. After the talk with Yang Shangkun, I returned to Hong Kong. I relayed Yang Shangkun's remarks to a meeting of the CPC Work Committee, and reiterated Li Peng's three instructions to those within the institutions. However, in general people did not change their views on the student movement in Beijing and the mass movement in Hong Kong as a result. Some time after 2300 on the night of 3 June, Chen Bojian, deputy president of WEN WEI PO, told me by phone: "Shots have been fired in Beijing!" For his home was at Muxudi in Beijing which was the first place in Beijing where shots were fired. Beginning on the night of 3 June, I was sleepless for three days and nights in a row, that is, on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th. I sat on a sofa and watched television. I would lie down on the sofa when sleepy. Throughout the period of several days, I had two television sets and one radio placed in front of me. There was news on Beijing on television every half hour, and there was news on Beijing on the radio every fifteen minutes. In effect there was 24-hour continuous coverage of the situation in Beijing and reactions from Hong Kong and the outside world. No words can describe my contradictory emotions and indignation at that time. I said to myself that the CPC had changed and that those so-called Communists in Beijing had changed, and asked how they could have stood on the side opposed to the masses of the people. I made up my mind to retire and quit my job. I reasoned that I was nevertheless faced with the issue of making preparations for my leaving, for I did not want some office cadres in Hong Kong to experience problems because of my leaving. In addition I wanted to make some arrangements so that after retiring I would be able to do as much practical and research work as I could with regard to the use of the method of one country, two systems in Hong Kong. I believed that some Communists were finished but that this did not mean the collapse of the CPC, and that communism would be realized eventually in the future. After the CPC Central Committee declared that Zhao Ziyang had been relieved of his duties and that Jiang Zemin had succeeded him as general secretary, I immediately asked someone to deliver to Zhao Ziyang a message of two sentences; one was "people always know who is right," and the other was "keep fit." Later the person delivering the message told me that after listening to the message, Zhao said: "Thanks!" As I recall, in history those upholding truth have often been treated badly and wrongly, but history would do justice to them in the end; people will not forget them, and truth will not be lost. Great Changes in Popular Sentiment (Part One of Two) The statement that today's Beijing would be tomorrow's Hong Kong demonstrated the 1997 mentality. The effort to win over people was dealt a severe blow. We were in a position which was isolated to an unprecedented degree. In the June 4th Incident the Communist Party of China opened fire on the people. The masses shed their blood, and the people of Hong Kong became disappointed to an unprecedented degree. Against the background of the "end of time" 1997 mentality, people of all sectors in Hong Kong, seeing the June 4th Incident, came to think that they themselves might encounter something similar after 1997, and therefore took part in the movement more energetically than ever. The slogan, "today's Beijing is tomorrow's Hong Kong," clearly demonstrated the 1997 mentality of the people of Hong Kong, and touched the residents' heartstrings. Large-scale "black" sit-ins, "black" denunciation meetings, and small rallies and marches of various kinds as well as large million-man rallies and marches stirred Hong Kong, and expelled Hong Kong people's long-standing political apathy; Hong Kong people took part in the movement in an almost frenzied manner. In the past, "The Internationale" and the National Anthem had been songs sung by people on the mainland, but now they were also sung by Hong Kong people. The song, "Bloodstained Elegance," even became a popular song sung by the general public. Seeing such a mentality characterized by the effort to express opinions through songs, one did not know whether to cry or laugh. In addition to those who participated in the marches, in fact many more people were also affected, including all those people of the left, the middle, and the right in Hong Kong. Almost all the local employees of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and leftist organizations participated in the activities. A large portion of our basic masses--patriotic students and workers and CPC members including some old CPC members--participated in the activities. Rightist forces also openly took part in the marches, holding the Taiwan flag of the blue sky, the white sun, and red land. People of all political tendencies, from big capitalists to the working masses, including even some foreign nationals, all participated in the activities. There emerged a phenomenon in Hong Kong society: those who did not participate in the activities would be isolated and discriminated against. In reality such activities in Hong Kong had two sides. On the one hand, in those activities the broad masses exhibited unprecedented enthusiasm for taking good care of China, hoping that the country would further reform and make progress, and supporting the student's patriotic movement demanding democracy and reform. On the other hand, the activities manifested the discontent with, distrust of, and opposition to the policies of the Communist Party of China as well as the resentment against the CPC's practice of suppressing the students, opposing reform, and opposing progress. Surely it could not be ruled out that some forces which were hostile to the Communist Party of China and which hoped to see the collapse of socialist China played a role, thereby constituting another aspect of the activities. But it should be pointed out that such was not the main aspect. As all kinds of forces and people of all walks of life all participated in the movement, a patriotic united front opposed to the erroneous policies of the Beijing authorities was formed. As a consequence there were great changes in popular sentiment, resulting in crushing blows to our protracted work of winning over people in Hong Kong, that is, the work on a united front based on patriotism and the love for Hong Kong, thereby putting us in an unprecedentedly isolated position. (121) [3 Sep 93 p 3] [Text] Great Changes in Popular Sentiment (Part Two of Two) There was a run on the Bank of China. Within three days, HK$17 billion was withdrawn. When mourning for those who had died during the June 4th Incident, Huang Wenfang led employees of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in holding a memorial ceremony. After shots were fired in Beijing during the June 4th Incident, the people of Hong Kong were in an uninterrupted state of indignation. Many people expressed their mourning for the compatriots who had died in Beijing by carrying out workers' strikes, students' strikes, and shopkeepers' strikes. The stock market fell by 1,000 points, resulting in a loss of HK$200 billion in the market value. The market value of real estate also fell by at least HK$200 billion. That is, the stock market and real estate alone experienced a loss of nearly HK$400 billion. As people could not express their anger in a political way, they staged a run on the Bank of China. Within three days, HK$17 billion was withdrawn, creating a huge momentum. In the 1960s and 1970s many young students at Hong Kong's universities had been followers of Mao Zedong Thought, and had loved socialist China, thereby being called the Chinese cultural quintessence faction. Now those young people had mostly become the elites of Hong Kong society. Some were presidents or managers of Hong Kong branches of foreign banks, and some were chief executives of some large corporations. After the June 4th Incident, some of them held meetings. Most indignantly advocated bringing down the Bank of China by exploiting the run on the bank. What did this show? Once they had been the young people who had been the most patriotic and who had loved the Communist Party of China the most among the people of Hong Kong. But they had now undergone such a radical change! Surely the run on the bank did produce destructive effects on Hong Kong's financial industry, but those who were hurt the most were in the final analysis the people of Hong Kong. After some discussion, the CPC Work Committee asked the Bank of China to take up the matter with the British Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in an urgent manner. They agreed to give help. The British Hong Kong government would issue a statement, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank also planned to mobilize some funds to provide help. Surely the Bank of China would mainly rely on its own capabilities, and mobilized funds. The headquarters on the mainland also transferred funds here to provide help. Thus the run on the bank was terminated as quickly as possible. After the June 4th incident, there was another upsurge of emigration. There were long lines of immigration applicants outside foreign consulates. Many of the hinterland-sent cadres who had acquired Hong Kong residence status were also planning to emigrate, openly standing in lines outside the consulates. There were intermittent reports of defections of personnel of Chinese embassies to foreign countries. There was another wave of getting Hong Kong corporations and enterprises chartered in other countries. Even Li Ka-shing who had always indicated his disinclination to emigrate and change the chartering country also changed his tone and said that the matter of whether to change the chartering country would be decided by the board of directors. Before the June 4th incident the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY had been much visited. Even during the period of petitions and marches, there was contact with many people of all kinds. After the "shooting," things suddenly cooled down. Many people who had maintained good relations with China began to keep a distance. Even those people who had been close to China would not see us, and they also wanted to draw a demarcation line with Beijing and keep Beijing at a distance. Some merchants stopped doing business with entities inside China or even withdrew their offices from the hinterland. After the June 4th Incident, some Hong Kong organizations in support of the student movement in Beijing set up a mourning site opposite the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Building to mourn for those who had died in the June 4th incident. Passersby would all take part in the mourning and pay last respects. Zheng Hua told me nervously that Huang Wenfang had prepared a banner, intending to take some cadres and employees of the branch with him to the mourning site to take part in the mourning. Huang Wenfang was director of the Taiwan work department, and he had also taken the lead when the department directors had given their signatures some time before. Zheng Hua told me that their efforts to persuade Huang Wenfang had failed. Zheng Hua suggested that I try to persuade Huang Wenfang, and that he himself try to persuade the masses. I expressed agreement. I told Huang Wenfang the opinion of the CPC Work Committee, and expressed the hope that he would not take the lead and that he himself would also refrain from taking part in the morning activities. Huang Wenfang said nothing. But immediately afterwards he still led a group of local employees in walking out of the door of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, with a banner being held high. They conducted mourning activities at the mourning site. Zheng Hua's persuasion efforts only produced some effects on a few hinterland employees, and they did not take part in the mourning activities. For four months the walls of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Building and the gymnasium across the street had been covered with big character posters and cartoons of all kinds. A little over a month after the June 4th Incident, having received permission from the British Hong Kong government, we planned to have employees of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY clean the walls. As the big character posters had been attached with glue, they could not be washed away. Thus the administrative department asked a cleaning company which belonged to Chinese-owned institutions to help clean the walls. Of course money would have to be paid. However, when the cleaning company under "leftist" institutions learned that it was to wash away the big character posters on the walls of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Building, it resolutely refused to do the job. The national go master, Nie Weiping, stopped over in Hong Kong, when traveling to Southeast Asia to participate in a go tournament. The bridge team of Zhejiang Province was also traveling with him. I invited them to a dinner at the Stanley guest-house of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. According to the appointment, they were supposed to arrive at 1600. For I also liked to play go and wanted to take the opportunity to get some coaching from Nie Weiping. Nie Weiping and some others came a little after 1600. The captain of the bridge team needed to run some errand in Kowloon, and therefore would come a bit late. We waited for him, while chatting. He did not came until 2100. We asked why he had come so late. According to him, when he had tried to hire a taxi in Kowloon, the taxi drivers would immediately drive away and refuse to take him after learning that the destination would be the Stanley guest-house of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. He said that four taxis had all behaved in that manner. Later he could not but ask a passerby to hire a taxi for him, only giving the address but not making clear that the place belonged to the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. Only in this way had he succeeded in getting a taxi to bring him here. I and Nie Weiping were shocked to hear the story. We had not thought that even the basic masses such as taxi drivers would assume such an attitude toward us. After the June 4th Incident, in order to have Hong Kong people resume contact with China so as to understand the policy of the new leadership in Beijing, I made active efforts to talk to those upper- and middle-strata personalities in Hong Kong who were willing to have contact with us, encouraging them to visit Beijing. Yue-kong Pao and Li Ka-shing agreed to go to Beijing, but would see Deng Xiaoping only. I agreed to make arrangements for them. Pao and Li saw Deng Xiaoping on separate occasions. After coming back, they both met with me, and discussed their meetings. Yue-kong Pao mentioned Deng Xiaoping's attitude of confronting toughness with toughness towards the British Government. Li Ka-shing expressed his worries in a not very clear manner: "Mr. Deng's continuing to do what he said will not be good for Hong Kong." I understood that "Mr. Deng's statements" he referred to were the same thing Yue-kong Pao had talked about. Successively a few other groups of people also agreed to go to Beijing, but the condition was that they would see only Jiang Zemin but not Li Peng. I also expressed my consent, and made arrangements. They saw Jiang Zemin. Some agreed to see both Jiang and Li, but demanded that the meeting with Li be not made public and that no news report be issued. I also accepted the demand and made arrangements. Only Lo Tak-shing did not express refusal. He saw Li Peng, and the meeting was publicly reported. No matter whom they had seen, most of those who had visited Beijing would say the same thing in talking to me about their feelings: "The Beijing leadership does not understand the situation in Hong Kong." They would indicate their great disappointment. Some even said: "They (referring to the leaders they met) regard Hong Kong as an enemy." I did not feel proper to make nay further inquiry, and thus it was difficult to make explanation to those people. Later Li Hou [2621 0683] telephoned me, saying that Jiang Zemin was no longer willing to see people by himself, and that the reason was that if they did not want to see Li Peng, then it would not be proper for him to see those people by himself. As a result several groups of people for whom arrangements had been made delayed their trips. At the same time it was not advisable to tell them Jiang Zemin's reason explicitly; so I could not but evade the issue. I deeply felt that there had been great changes in popular sentiment in Hong Kong, but Beijing was unable, and did not want, to understand the situation. The work on Hong Kong would be very difficult in the days to come. (122)
