ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The EPA is proposing to approve a petition from the State of Texas requesting that Victoria County, an incomplete data ozone nonattainment area, be exempted from the requirement to perform the oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) portion of the build/no-build test required by the new Federal transportation conformity rule. This petition for exemption was submitted on May 4, 1994. In the Final Rules Section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving this exemption request as a direct final rulemaking without prior proposal because the EPA views this action as noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Thomas H. Diggs, Chief, Air Planning Section (6T&hyph;AP), U.S. EPA Region 6, 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75202&hyph;2733.
