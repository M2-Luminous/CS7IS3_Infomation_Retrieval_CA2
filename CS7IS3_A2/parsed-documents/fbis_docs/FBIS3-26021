However, the problem of market has begun to raise its head remarkably. It is expected that for a period of time to come, the problem of market will become more conspicuous than that of funds. The central authorities will make plans to solve the problem to avoid a market crisis which may possibly occur. The authoritative source said: As the central authorities saw it, the robustness of the domestic market in the previous period of time was largely a result of man-made price hikes. For example, the robustness in the car market was such a case. On the one hand, vehicles were purchased with public money, and on the other hand, foreign-invested enterprises upgraded their vehicles one after another by making use of preferential policies. Hence, there was a service-life cycle of 5 to 10 years. Moreover, the mainland pursues a control policy over car purchases and as a result, car prices have stood at a high level, thus landing China's car industry in a predicament. Again, take the consumption market for example. From 1992 to 1993, there was extreme unfairness in distribution on the mainland. Consequently, commodity demand was generated by upstarts, and the entire society's expenses characterized by high wages and bonuses driven by such demand were not sustainable. Moreover, domestically there was also unfairness in distribution between different trades, enterprises, departments, and even wage earners. A considerable number of poor counties in our country are unable to pay out wages. The price scissors of agricultural and sideline products are widening. Therefore, the robust consumption market will surely cool off. Based on an analysis of the market prospects, the central leadership suggested: 1. It is necessary from now on to closely watch and study the market problem and adopt prompt measures to solve it. The injection of funds must be made after taking on board changes in the market. Otherwise, if we still increase input when the market has already gone down, it will end up in stockpiling of products and it will difficult to avoid sharp fluctuations in the economy. 2. Enterprises must make great efforts to improve themselves, change the way they operate, raise product quality, increase product varieties, and pay close attention to scientific and technological development and technological transformation. Construction banks and industrial and commercial banks must ensure enterprise technological funds. 3. Great stress should be placed on readjusting the price policy and developing markets. Prices of domestic products such as television sets, washing machines, and refrigerators can be cut a little to achieve larger sales at a smaller profit. Taxes on some products can be reduced. The price problem should be resolved in accordance with the laws governing the market rather than by rushing headlong into mass action. 4. Examination and approval procedures for controls over the purchase of domestic limousines should be scraped. We must consider cutting the selling prices of domestic vehicles. 5. Enterprise should make vigorous efforts to export more goods and develop both domestic and international markets. To promote export, apart from prohibiting enterprises to engage in real estate and stock trading at a profit, we must ensure the need of funds for the Bank of China to purchase foreign exchange. 6. The growth rates of township and town enterprises should be scaled down. Now township and town enterprises are keeping too many products in stock. We should no longer support them in turning out unsalable products blindly. Township and town enterprises must pay attention to industrial structural readjustments and product variety and quality. When it has surpluses in procurement funds, an agricultural bank must support township and town enterprises in carrying out technological transformation and scientific and technological development to readjust the industrial structure. 7. Labor prices call for attention. To make labor more appealing to foreign investors, it is necessary to bring the strong point of domestic labor being relatively cheap into play. Now a relatively too rapid labor wage increase has become a trend in some coastal regions. Too high wages will hamper our competitiveness in developing an export-oriented economy.
