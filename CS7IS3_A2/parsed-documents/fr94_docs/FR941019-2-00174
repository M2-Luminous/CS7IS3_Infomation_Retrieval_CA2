FR941019-2-00174 FR941019-2-00092 For purposes of the Exchange's position limit framework, the CBOE proposes that Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the same position limits as standard CAPS. Accordingly, (1) Q&hyph;CAPS will be aggregated with and treated identically to A.M. Settled, European-style option contracts on the S&P 500 Index, including CAPS and QIX options on the S&P 500, for all position limit purposes, including being subject to the 25,000 contract index arbitrage limit; 15 (2) Q&hyph;CAPS on the S&P 100 Index will be treated like all other OEX options, including CAPS and QIX options, for all position limit purposes, except for the requirement that limits the number of contracts in the series of any broad-based index option with the nearest expiration (``telescoping requirement''). 16 Additionally, aggregate P.M. Settled FLEX options based on the same index (i.e., OEX or SPX), with the same expiration date as QIXs and Q&hyph;CAPS will be aggregated. 17 Q&hyph;CAPS will also be subject to the same hedge exemptions applicable to QIXs and CAPS. 18 15 See Amendment No. 3. 16 See Amendment No. 3 and CBOE Rule 24.4(c). 17 See CBOE Rule 24A.7(c) and Amendment No. 1. 18 See CBOE Rule 24.4, Interpretations .01, .02 and .03. III. Discussion The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5), 19 and, therefore, approves the Exchange's proposal and grants accelerated approval of the amendments thereto. In particular, the Commission believes that Q&hyph;CAPS will provide additional choice and flexibility to investors in their use of derivatives and provide a tailored quarterly portfolio hedge that may be more suitable to their investment needs by allowing them to participate in the options markets at predetermined maximum gains or losses, on a quarterly basis. The Commission believes it is reasonable for the Exchange to set a cap interval of 30 in that the cap price is placed sufficiently far from the exercise price so that the Q&hyph;CAPS will not be exercised automatically on a frequent basis. 20 19 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1982). 20 In addition, both the CBOE and the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') have represented that they have the necessary systems capacity to support those new series of index options that would result from the introduction of Q&hyph;CAPS.
