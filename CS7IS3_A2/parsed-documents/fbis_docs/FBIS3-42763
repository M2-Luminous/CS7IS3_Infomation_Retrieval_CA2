It is operating on the principles of full voluntariness and collegiality. Groups of experts of each of the countries are preparing questions which will be submitted later for the consideration of the members of the council that assembles each time in one of the founder-countries. Four such meetings have already been held--in Tashkent, Moscow, Minsk, and Kiev. At the last one, the Kiev meeting, a resolution was passed on the organization of a permanently operating secretariat of the council. Numerous urgent questions have piled up. The council members were instructed to complete the development of lists of organizations and joint-stock companies involved in the conclusion of bilateral treaties. The development of multilateral agreements is considered unsuitable. It was proposed to continue the extension of credits of accounts for mutual supplies, the exemption of machine-building enterprises from customs duties, the allocation of quotas, and the issuance of licenses. To reinforce mutual relations and simplify settlements it was decided to begin joint conversion to joint-stock companies of related enterprises and establish joint enterprises and joint-stock companies, transnational financial-industrial groups, and other types of joint economic activity. Without putting the matter off indefinitely, Belarus signed a treaty on bilateral cooperation with Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Ukraine; Georgia--with Tajikistan and Ukraine; and Ukraine--with Moldova, Russia, and Tajikistan. The next important decision was the adoption of a long-term program of joint investment and support of capacities in the most important types of products. Joint investment will be conducted by means of the creation of enterprises with shared or joint forms of ownership. Such treaties between the Goskomprom [State Committee for Industry] of Belarus and Roskommash [Russian Federation Committee on Machine Building] were signed for five installations: the Tver machine-building plant AO [joint-stock company], the Altayvagonmash AO, the Demikhovo machine-building plant AO, the Minsk engine plant, and the Minsk tractor plant, and between the Ministry of Industry of Kazakhstan and Roskommash for four installations, between the Radioelektrontekhpribor concern of Uzbekistan and Roskommash for the Vostoklift enterprise. Unfortunately, Ukraine has rejected joint investments. It has no money. For the same reason, Ukraine did not contribute resources to the charter fund of the International Bank of Machine-Building Development MBM-Bank, though fully supporting the idea of its creation. It will significantly speed up the movement of payments and will promote purposeful investment and credit extension. In a word, payments to the charter fund were made only by Russia, Moldova, and Tajikistan--30 million rubles [R] each. The others either do not have the resources or the legislative basis is lagging. It must be said that the last factor was a dissonance in the activity of the council. For example, because of this there was a delay of two months in the preparation of founding documents and state registration of the transnational joint-stock company on the basis of the UralAZ [Ural Automobile Plant] AO and the Kustanayskiy diesel plant. An agreement was reached to prepare a proposal in the governments of the states in the first half year about making refinements and additions in them, taking into account the convergence of legislative principles and the formation of an integrated investment space. The first months of work of the council once again confirmed an old truth: It is always simpler to destroy than to create. Revival of the market space and integration within the framework of the CIS is proceeding slowly, at times painfully. This is associated first and foremost with the fear of a return to the former relations, and it is also associated among machine builders with the work that has been started in the republics on national programs for the structural restructuring of the economy. However, V. Lyashchev, deputy minister of machine-building of the VPK [military-industrial complex] and conversion in Ukraine, noted that neither one nor the other should be feared. Already today the council is viewed as a former CEMA, in its similarity, and relations are being built between the council's member states. Much has been said about the creation of a machine builders' newspaper of council member states. But why engender a new publication, it was heard in debates, when there is a newspaper that fits the profile and is published in all the CIS countries--RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. It could put out supplements, special issues, and enclosures for machine builders, would help them join other related branches of industry, and this would be cheaper, simpler, and with a high level of professionalism.
