The two governments agreed on the global cooperation, one of three pillars in the trade framework negotiations along with macroeconomic and microeconomic areas, at the summit talks between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Under the accord, Japan and the U.S. together will offer 12 billion dollars over seven years to tackle issues involving AIDS and population problems. Of the total amount, the U.S. is to disburse 9 billion dollars and Japan will offer 3 billion dollars. The two countries will also cooperate in developing environmental technologies and developing human resources. Tokyo and Washington failed to strike a deal on the other areas of the framework talks to slash Japan's huge trade surplus and boost the share of imports in its markets. The two sides remain deadlocked over the definition of "objective criteria" in accessing foreign access to Japanese markets such as autos and auto parts, insurance and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment.
