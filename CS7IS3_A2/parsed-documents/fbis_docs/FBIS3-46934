This was disclosed on 25 December by a source familiar with Japan-North Korea relations. The accord was first concluded between nongovernmental organizations of the two countries in 1977, and it has since been extended almost every two years. This time, however, there have been no prospects for consultations on extending the accord on the eve of its expiration. Difficult relations between Japan and North Korea following the suspension of normalization talks and the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development are believed to have adversely affected the extension of the accord. If the accord is invalidated, it would make it impossible for Japanese fishermen in the Hokuriku and Sanin regions to continue catching squid in the eastern waters near the Korean peninsula. A North Korean source in Tokyo, however, says: "Japanese fishermen usually begin catching squid in spring following a three-month break from January to March, so they should not suffer any damage for the time being." Hajime Fukada, a member of the House of Councilors (from the Social Democratic Party of Japan), plans to visit North Korea on 28 December to sound out North Korean intentions.
