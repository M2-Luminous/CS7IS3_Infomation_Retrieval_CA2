FR940906-0-00028 FR940906-0-00016 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 90 [PR Docket No. 94&hyph;94; FCC 94&hyph;216] 900 MHz Emission Mask agency: Federal Communications Commission. action: Final rule. summary: This action responds to a request by Geotek Communications, Inc. (Geotek) for clarification of the FCC's rules concerning the 900 MHz emission mask. Geotek brought to our attention that the 900 MHz emission mask included in our Rules has the effect of unintentionally restricting the use of low power digital equipment in this band. The intended effect of this action is to eliminate the anomaly. effective date: October 6, 1994. for further information contact: Karen Rackley, Private Radio Bureau, (202) 634&hyph;2443. supplementary information: This is a summary of the Commission's order in PR Docket No. 94&hyph;94, FCC 94&hyph;216, adopted August 12, 1994, and released August 30, 1994. The full text of this Commission decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (Room 230), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision also may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. Summary of the Order 1. Geotek Communications, Inc. (Geotek) brought to our attention that the 900 MHz emission mask included in Section 90.209(h) of our Rules has the effect of restricting the use of low power digital equipment in this band. Geotek went on to point out that the restrictive effect of this rule conflicts with the Commission's intent, as stated in our Report and Order in GEN Docket 84&hyph;1233, 2 FCC Rcd 1825 (1986), 51 FR 37398, October 22, 1986, to permit any type of modulation in this band, including digital modulation. 2. The 900 MHz band was allocated for use by the Private Land Mobile Services in 1986. The regulatory structure established for this new band was designed to provide as much flexibility as possible for licensees to use a variety of technologies to satisfy their mobile communications requirements. The technology that Geotek proposes to use in this band is just the type of new technology that we had intended our flexible rules to be able to accommodate. Unfortunately, as pointed out in Geotek's letters, the emission mask for the 896&hyph;901/935&hyph;940 MHz bands has the unintended effect of precluding use of Geotek's particular technology. Very simply, the current emission mask penalizes Geotek's system because of its use of relatively low power (4 watt) portable transceivers. The emission mask currently in effect in our rules requires various levels of attenuation relative to the actual unmodulated carrier power of the transmitter, regardless of how small that transmitter power might be. For very low power transmitters, the effect of this requirement can be very severe on the design of the equipment, with no apparent corresponding benefit with respect to interference reduction. This anomaly in our rules was clearly unintended. We are, therefore, amending Section 90.209(h) of our Rules to eliminate this anomaly in the emissions mask that unintentionally restricts the use of low power digital equipment. For example, for a 4 Watt transmitter on a frequency removed 15 kHz from the channel's assigned (center) frequency, the current mask requires a relative attenuation of 71 decibels while the new mask requires only 56. 3. This rule change is being made to conform our rules to the intent stated in the text of the Report and Order in Docket 84&hyph;1233 at paragraph 68: We desire to allow as much flexibility as possible for end users to choose the equipment that best meets their needs at a cost they can afford. We want to establish appropriate incentives for the development of new technologies. However, we do not want to adopt a plan that essentially requires end users to employ one particular modulation method *␣*␣*. Furthermore, we want the channeling plan for this spectrum to accommodate technologies such as digital that have been developed, but require further advances to make them marketable to private land mobile users. This rule change is noncontroversial because it does not infringe on any current or potential licensee's substantive rights. Therefore, for the above stated reasons, and because this rule change is clearly in the public interest, we find good cause to conclude that notice and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). 4. Accordingly, It Is Ordered that, effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register , Section 90.209(h) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 90.209(h) is amended as indicated below.
