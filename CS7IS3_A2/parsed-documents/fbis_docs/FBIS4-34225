[Santos] First of all, the signing of the G-3 [Group of Three -- Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico] Agreement. As President Gaviria said, it is the most important trade agreement in Colombian history. This was a specific achievement. Another important point is that the main subject of the summit was integration and commerce. For us, it has been very satisfying to see that what we have been doing for the past two or three years is precisely what all the other Ibero-American countries want to do: promote integration and free trade, create more jobs, increase production. The conclusion of this summit in the areas of commerce and integration totally coincide with Colombian policies. Therefore, it has been very satisfactory for us to see that what we have done during the past three years is supported at the Ibero-American and international levels. [Reporter] We will now interview Development Minister Mauricio Cardenas on today's working session. What are the plans for investment and development for these countries? [Cardenas] We had a very interesting meeting this morning, during which Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez presented important recommendations on ways to accelerate economic growth in Latin America. We believe it is fundamental to follow up on the proposed initiatives with special emphasis on social investment, particularly on education. Those aspects are considered necessary to accelerate economic development in our region and to enable us to achieve an annual economic growth rate of 7 or 8 percent, which is the goal of all Latin American countries.
