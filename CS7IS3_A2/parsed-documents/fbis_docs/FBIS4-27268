FBIS4-27268 "dreas105_a_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Agency Trying To Confirm Reports of DPRK Mine Laying Agency Trying To Confirm Reports of DPRK Mine Laying OW0106142594 Tokyo KYODO in English 1409 GMT 1 Jun 94 OW0106142594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Defense Agency is trying to quickly verify reports that North Korea has laid sea mines off its coast, defense officials said Wednesday. "At the moment we cannot confirm the mine-laying," an official said. "But if the reports prove true, we might say this is a move indicating the North Korean side is hardening its stance in the direction of military confrontation," he said. The information was received just after North Korea, under international scrutiny for its suspected nuclear weapons program, was reported to have test fired a "Silkworm" antiship missile into the Sea of Japan on Tuesday. North Korean sea mines would also constitute "a big, direct safety threat" to maritime transport in the region, the officials said. With mined coastal waters, North Korea hopes to ward off the landing of enemy troops, sources well-versed in defense issues said. The move is apparently modeled after Iraq's mining of the Persian Gulf off Kuwait to counter the U.S.-led allied forces in the 1991 Gulf war, they said. Should North Korea have actually mined its coastal waters, it could suggest that the Pyongyang leadership believes the nuclear standoff has been pushed to the brink and is ready to risk an attack from the United States and its allies, the sources said. Floating sea mines, laid off North Korea's coasts during the 1950-53 Korean war to cut off reinforcements and provisions for UN troops fighting on the South Korean side, have endangered sea traffic around Japan. More than 300 mines that came loose in rough seas have submerged in the past. "A similar situation might arise. And traffic in the Sea of Japan, for instance, is incomparably higher than in those (Korean war) times," the sources said. They said the antimining capacity of the U.S. Navy stationed in the Asia-Pacific region comes close to "zero." Therefore, Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force, which has helped clear the Persian Gulf from Iraqi mines, could be forced to dispatch minesweepers if it came to the worst, they said. The agency will have to closely watch North Korea's development and testing of ballistic missiles and mines issue, the sources suggested.
