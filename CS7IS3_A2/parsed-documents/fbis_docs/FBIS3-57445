[Gaydar] If I had sufficient opportunities to keep a check on monetary, loan, and financial policies. That is, the political fields that our society, but also the whole world, always believed to be my responsibility anyway. [DER SPIEGEL] You said that the monetary union with Belarus was one of the main reasons for your resignation. Why is it dangerous? [Gaydar] In general, the extension of the ruble zone and the integration of other states, too, are conceivable. But only if the coordination mechanisms work very well and the uncontrolled printing of money can be ruled out for sure. If, however, there are only vague formulations instead, this will, in the end, only result in a competition for the faster printing of money. Why should the Belarusians deliver something to Russia if they can pay for our goods with freshly printed rubles? [DER SPIEGEL] Is your resignation alone to blame for the present, almost free fall of the ruble? [Gaydar] It was caused by a negative change in inflationary expectations. [DER SPIEGEL] Can the new government do something against it? [Gaydar] Let us hope that the government will manage to keep a check on inflation, without reaching a deadlock. At any rate, Russia's complicated problems cannot be solved by new national credit presents. However, there is the great risk that precisely this course will be taken. [DER SPIEGEL] Your parliamentary party colleague, Boris Fedorov, who has been finance minister so far, also no longer wants to participate in the new government. He had called for the replacement of Central Bank chief Gerashchenko and Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha, who is responsible for agriculture. Are they the people who forced the change of course? [Gaydar] These demands come from Fedorov. I am keeping out of it. It is our joint hope that the worst can be prevented. The worse, the better -- this is not our attitude. [DER SPIEGEL] Will you go into the opposition with your adherents? [Gaydar] Our parliamentary group in the State Duma will do everything to block irresponsible economic and budget decisions. This is all the more important since Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's statements have clearly shown that he is succumbing to illusions that inflation could also be counteracted by other than monetary measures. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you also assume partial responsibility for having caused Zhirinovskiy's rise by shock methods of the market economy? [Gaydar] Failures in the implementation of reforms definitely contributed to Zhirinovskiy's success. However, one has to be precise regarding the causes of the failures. Profound reforms aiming at privatization and price decontrol were carried out. However, financial policies always remained soft. But they are meant when people talk about a shock therapy. As a result of pressure from the Supreme Soviet and the regions, burdens that were impossible to fulfill were put on the state budget again and again. What was precisely needed was a shock. [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds as if you had liked to drive even more voters to Zhirinovskiy... [Gaydar] ... our polls have shown that those who voted for this man come from neither the impoverished nor from social fringe groups, but from the middle class: better qualified workers, people with handsome incomes. They are not primarily dissatisfied with their material situation, but with the lack of order, crime, which is getting out of hand, and Russia's present situation in the world. [DER SPIEGEL] Is there now the danger that, on the one hand, Western help will be discontinued, while, on the other, Russia will turn away from Western economic and political values? [Gaydar] This is a very serious danger. I am convinced that long-term relations of partnership suit Russia's strategic objectives best. Here I have always proceeded on the assumption that Russia has to solve its problems by its own. No financial help from the West, however voluminous it may be, will be able to save the Russian economy as a whole. However, Western help can mitigate the social effects of our economic problems. [DER SPIEGEL] The doubts of foreign financial backers about whether their loans are appropriately used in Russia are increasing. [Gaydar] Transfers from abroad, however voluminous they may be, cannot replace a reasonable monetary policy in one's own country. At most, they will result in an increase of Russian assets in Western accounts. As fast as the money would come to Russia, it would it be transferred again as fast. This cannot be prevented by foreign exchange control, but only by sufficient economic stability. [DER SPIEGEL] Will President Yeltsin become a prisoner of the parliamentary majority of communists, centrists, and right-wing extremists? [Gaydar] I know that the president sees himself as a reformer and wants to continue this course. Therefore, I hope that he will spare no effort to achieve this objective. However, we neither put him on the tsar's throne nor on God's throne, but we only elected him president. He has to see how he can cope with the new restrictions. [DER SPIEGEL] And with his opponents... [Gaydar] ...they will introduce draft laws, in order to invalidate again all the market and property mechanisms that are already effective today. The law on the rights of the work collectives alone, which has been prepared by the communists, would fully suffice to paralyze the market economy in Russia. Moreover, they will resolve a gigantic expenditure that cannot be financed. However, the new government will have to answer for this. [DER SPIEGEL] What is the next target of your ambition -- a [university] chair of economic sciences or the chair of the Russian president? [Gaydar] The seat at my desk at home attracts me most.
