Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), exchanged views with the JNP legislators of both the House of Representative and the House of Councillors at a restaurant in Tokyo over the political situation and a future realignment of political parties, they said. Ozawa called on those present to step up ties in the coalition to maintain the Hosokawa administration, the members said. Prior to Friday's meeting, he had also met with three other JNP legislators on Monday, they said. The powerful politician has been staying out of public sight since Hosokawa gave up his attempt to make changes to his seven-month-old cabinet early this month because of strong opposition from within the coalition and a tight Diet schedule. Ozawa is widely believed to have urged Hosokawa to push for the cabinet reshuffle, whose primary purpose was to replace the premier's chief spokesman and chief of staff, Masayoshi Takemura. Political sources said the honeymoon between Hosokawa and Takemura ended last December over their differences on policies. Speculation has arisen that Hosokawa was tilting in favor of ties with Ozawa, who is reported to be at odds with Takemura. Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the third largest coalition bloc, are pursuing establishment of a two-party political system and insisted on unifying coalition parties to fight off the leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general elections under a new electoral system mixing single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. The largest coalition bloc, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), as well new party Sakigake (Harbinger) headed by Takemura and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), meanwhile, are aiming at multiparty system, but with fewer parties than at present. The remaining coalition component is the minor United Social Democratic Party (USDP).
