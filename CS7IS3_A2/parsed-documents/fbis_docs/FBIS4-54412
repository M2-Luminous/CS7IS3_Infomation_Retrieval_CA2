He said the Environment Ministry's idea of the bill differed considerably from that of the Ministry of the Economy. Both ministries had been charged with the joint preparation of the principles for the bill. At the beginning of the year Benda pointed out that the Environment Ministry would seek to include all important aspects concerning the protection of the mining environment in the initial bill drawn up by the Economy Ministry. He said today that the two bills have just joined together, whereas he had expected that a single bill would be drafted. A completely unacceptable situation arose in which about "ten diametrically opposed views" stand against each other. Disputes between the ministries concerned, for example, the definition of public interest which had been defined very liberally and on a low level as regards the protection of owners' rights or the protection of the environment or mining site, Benda said. The two ministries are using the same words but their notions are different, he said.
