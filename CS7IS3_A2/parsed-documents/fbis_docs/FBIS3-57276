A SAKINFORM [Georgian press agency] correspondent, Tengiz Pachkoria, asked Akaki Gasviani, deputy chairman of Abkhazia's Council of Ministers, to comment on this statement. Gasviani said: We consider Ardzinba's statement to reflect an attempt to revise and reconsider the Geneva agreement envisaging the return of all refugees. Ardzinba and his supporters, who on several occasions violated the Sochi agreement on settling the Abkhaz conflict peacefully, are now trying to violate the Geneva agreements and the communique. Obviously, the return of dozens of thousands of refugees to the Gali and Abkhazia's other rayons is not suitable for them. This statement by Ardzinba is a fresh attempt at holding the Georgian population and the Georgian Government responsible for the actions committed by the Abkhaz and the north Caucasian combatants who had killed and pillaged the civilian population of the autonomous republic--Georgians, Russians, Greeks, and others--and for the combatants' actions--bombing and shelling residential areas of Sukhumi and Abkhazia's other towns and rayons. As for the criminal offenses committed in Abkhazia in 1992-93, we must investigate thoroughly these instances, and criminal proceedings must be instituted against perpetrators irrespective of their nationality.
