The talks were held in a sincere, friendly atmosphere. This has already become a good tradition and reflects the particularly genial relations that have developed between our states over the past few years", Russian President Boris Yeltsin told a joint news conference here on Wednesday. According to Yeltsin, the talks demonstrated once more that the two sides were unanimous in their assessment of the current state of Russian-German relations. "The federal chancellor and I agreed that our two countries had proceeded far along the way towards each other. We have managed to solve most of the thorny problems inherited from the war and the post-war period. The agreements reached during our talks have begun working", the Russian president stressed. Yeltsin reported that he had discussed today in details with Chancellor Kohl arrangements for the farewell ceremony to mark the complete withdrawal of Russia's West Army Group from Germany, scheduled for this coming August. The sides agreed that the ceremony should be held in style. This event, the Russian leader went on to say, "is designed to symbolize the completion of a certain historic stage and to mark the beginning of a new era of relations our states, and Europe on the whole, are to enter". The planned actions will become a sort of prologue to next year's celebration of the 50th anniversary of the victory in World War II, Yeltsin stressed. According to him, Russia and Germany would like these celebrations to acquire an all-European scale. "We suggest that a political declaration to be passed at this December's CSCE summit in Budapest include special provisions concerning the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. They should reflect the principles of world order and international relations to be brought by CSCE member-countries into the 3rd millennium", the Russian president pointed out. Yeltsin said the talks had also touched upon the issues of human rights and democracy. "Life has brought us to these objectives in different ways. Russia is presently at the stage of democratic consolidation, and this process cannot be called entirely smooth. The pace, methods and instruments of democratic reforms may change depending on the state of society", the Russian leader noted. But this process is irreversible, he stressed, which has been proved by the course of developments following last December's parliamentary elections and the passage of the new constitution by people's vote. The memorandum on civil accord recently signed by Russia's major political and public forces is another evidence of the fact that the overwhelming majority of the Russians favour further peaceful democratic reforms, Yeltsin said.
