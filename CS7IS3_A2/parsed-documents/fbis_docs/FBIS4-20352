In this respect, the necessary condition for the rapid development of the national economy is the maintaining of a high investment rate over a long period of time; meanwhile the sufficient condition for the healthy development of the national economy is that this high investment rate is supported by a corresponding savings rate. Only under the situation in which the savings rate and investment rate are kept in equilibrium on a constant basis, will it be possible to achieve the sustained development of the national economy. In short, balancing investment with savings is the key to implementing this general policy. Effectively mobilizing savings, or in other words establishing a highly efficient capital market, will be of even greater importance to China because investment demand has always been high in China. Under the traditional system, there was basically no capital market in our country. Then the situation was based on a fiscal system characterized by unified revenue collection and expenditures, and savings of the entire society were concentrated in the hands of the government and were then allocated to enterprises in the form of fiscal appropriations to be used for investment. Such a method of fund handling could be said to be a special form of internal-source fund gathering. Since the start of reform of the economic system, with the adjustment of the structure of primary distribution of national income, the share of government savings in overall savings of society has gradually decreased (the amount of net government savings is now negative), and the shares of enterprise and resident savings have gradually increased. Based on such a savings structure, external-source fund gathering has gradually come to occupy a dominant position in China. According to statistics, external-source fund gathering accounts for approximately 70 percent of the sources of funds for enterprise investments in our country; the manifestation in the "plate" of state investments is that bank loans and enterprises' self-gathered funds have become the main sources of funds. Compared with the external-source fund gathering rate of 30-50 percent in developed market-economy countries, this rate is rather high. Because of the aforementioned changes of various kinds, financial policy has come to assume a leading role in our country's macroeconomic regulation and control system. Such a change manifested itself as a tendency in the early period of reform; after the three years of improvement and rectification, the change has been widely appreciated by people. But the reform of the financial regulation and control system in our country has failed to keep up with this change. The main manifestations are: First, we are still using the traditional means of credit allocation to manage finance; however, not only is it increasingly difficult to use such a means to control the total amount of credit and the total money supply in society, but the situation regarding the distribution and circulation of credit funds in the economy is also very far from conforming to the subjective wishes of the financial authorities. Second, we are still using the method used for managing credit funds to manage the issuance of various securities, artificially setting volume limits. Third, we still lack effective means of regulating the fund-gathering activities of various kinds carried out independently by enterprises outside the direct fund gathering carried out by the state. All this has resulted in financial disorder over the past few years. Rectifying financial order is certainly very important; but, while there exist the so-called unhealthy tendencies as well as the inertia of the old system behind the various phenomena of disorder, there are also buds of financial renovation. It can even be said that some of the current financial problems are a kind of spontaneous reactions which represent market economy forces' breaking down the confines of the rigid financial system. Without an appropriate analysis of the various factors, not only will it be difficult for rectification to produce the desired results, but even the further growth of the Chinese economy may be hampered. As we have seen, since the start of economic reform, with the transformation of the system, the growth mechanism of the Chinese economy has undergone significant changes, The economic growth over the past decade and more has mainly stemmed from the rapid development of nonstate enterprises as far as economic actors are concerned, has been mainly due to the expansion of tertiary industry as far as the different industries are concerned, and has mainly depended on the rapid growth of coastal regions as far as geographical regions are concerned. Nevertheless those economic actors and industries do not occupy an important position in the state's credit plan; meanwhile the gains made by economically developed regions are obviously insufficient as far as their demands are concerned. A profound contradiction has consequently emerged: on the one hand economic development is to a large extent dependent on nonstate enterprises and tertiary industry as well as on the growth of coastal regions; on the other hand the state's official credit plan does not satisfy the needs of those enterprises, industries, and regions for funds. As a result, moving funds from state banks to nonstate-owned banks, nonbank financial institutions, nonstate-owned enterprises, tertiary industry, and economically developed regions in the form of "short-term financing" became an unavoidable trend. As the needs for funds thus created are not mainly based on the objective of solving liquidity problems, it is inevitable that "day-to-day financing" turns into "month-to-month financing," "quarter-to-quarter financing," and "year-to-year financing." As such financing is mostly outside the scope of activities permitted by the state, discipline violations are inevitable, and high prices for funds are also to be expected. The situation is rather similar in the area of direct fund gathering: as many new investment projects are unable to get fund supplies through regular channels, the phenomena of unauthorized fund gathering and of levies not approved by the regulatory authorities have occurred on a widespread basis. If so, is it possible to use the method of "perfecting" fund allocation to improve the situation? We believe that the method is not proper and will not work. First, having the monetary authorities allocate funds in society is a typical planned-economy method, and it is logically consistent with plan-based overall management, unified allocation of materials, and unified fiscal revenue collection and fiscal expenditures; but those economic conditions have now basically disappeared. Second, successful fund allocation also requires several conditions regarding the financial system. Firstly, financial institutions should be highly unified (a situation just like what we experienced in the past when there was only one bank in the entire society); in this way there would not be the problem of large-scale flows of funds within the financial system. Secondly, actors making expenditures in society are uniform (a situation just like what we experienced in the past when state-owned enterprises constituted the dominant, largest sector while the government practiced unified revenue collection and unified expenditures with regard to them); in this way there would not be the phenomenon of flows of funds among different economic actors. Thirdly, financial products are undiversified (a situation just like what we experienced in the past when there were only simple deposits and loans across society); in this way there would not be the exchange of various financial products for one another, which would result in the problem of fund transfers. Fourthly, the national economy should be closed (a situation just like what we experienced in the past when one-sided emphasis was given to self-reliance); in this way there would not be the problem of unanticipated disruptive effects of increases or decreases in international reserves and fluctuations in exchange rates on the domestic money supply. All such conditions have obviously disappeared today. Without the necessary foundations and conditions, it is impossible to carry out the "perfecting" of such a system. More important, today when the marketization reform has been deepened significantly, the credit plan is not only increasingly unable to meet the demands of increasingly vigorous economic development, but has also to an ever greater extent become a huge haven for "rent seeking." Therefore it should be terminated as soon as possible. It is necessary to establish a set of mechanisms for indirectly regulating and controlling the money supply to replace the credit plan. Under such a system, the monetary authorities will mainly use indirect regulation and control means to regulate the total money supply and market interest rates; the direction of flow of funds in society is mainly determined by profit-oriented financial institutions and securities markets in accordance with market signals. Under the new situation regarding financial regulation and control, establishing an efficient capital market has become an important task. In the area of indirect fund gathering, establishing policy banks is surely important, but they can only resolve fund demand problems encountered by a few industries with bearings on state plans and people's lives. Transforming existing specialized banks is absolutely necessary. But, relying on commercial banks for long-term funds is not only unable to meet the needs, but also dangerous to some extent. This is so because commercial banks acquire their funds mainly from the highly fluid savings deposits of residents and enterprises and because their liabilities also constitute the main part of the money supply; relying on such fund sources for sustaining long-term investment expenditures is very prone to lead to payment crisis. This is the fundamental reason why the monetary authorities require commercial banks to keep reserves and disbursement funds in relation to their deposits, enforce strict requirements on the banks' own-capital rates, regulate the banks' asset-liability ratios, and impose strict restrictions on the banks' asset operations. In terms of the situation in market economy countries, the long-term funds supplied through indirect fund-gathering channels mainly come from nonbank financial institutions. The nonbank financial institutions discussed here mainly refer to various insurance companies, pension funds, trust and investment companies, common funds, savings and loan associations and financial companies. The common characteristic of those financial institutions is that they all have long-term, stable sources of funds. It is exactly under such a liability structure that they are able to play a leading role on the capital market. If it is said that our country's financial institutions are very underdeveloped, then our country's nonbank financial institutions are just in the beginning stage. Therefore, vigorously developing nonbank financial institutions on the basis of proceeding from the demand for the establishment of an efficient capital market should become a focus of the efforts to renovate our country's financial system. In the area of direct fund gathering, the important thing is to vigorously develop standardized stock and corporate bond markets. It should be soberly realized that volume-based regulation of securities issuance will inevitably hamper the process of transforming enterprises into corporations currently under way. Furthermore, this is a regulatory means which conflicts with principles of market economics; only by terminating such volume restrictions would it be possible to achieve the healthy development of the securities market or even the market economy as a whole of our country. However, some ideas on the issue of stocks should be clarified. When being transformed into a corporation, an enterprise certainly has to convert its existing assets into a certain number of shares. Nevertheless, first, converting corporate assets into shares does not mainly mean a simultaneous increase in assets and in the number of shares. It is absolutely necessary to prevent the kind of transformation into corporations which is focused on expanding the investment scale, while neglecting the adjustment of the structure of property rights. Second, transforming enterprises into joint-stock companies does not necessarily mean that their stocks have to be listed; should they be listed, such listing does not necessarily mean that they have to be listed in securities exchanges. After the joint stock company becomes the main form of enterprise in our country, stocks of most enterprises should be traded on the over-the-counter market. That is, we may have to maintain a steady pace with regard to the listing of stocks in securities exchanges, but we should certainly promote the development of over-the-counter trading in stocks. We propose that any enterprise which meets requirements regarding securities issuance should be permitted to gather funds on the market. Artificially setting volume limits on securities issuance can only contribute to the expansion of irregular fund-gathering activities. In view of the abnormal situation of excessively high debt ratios of our country's enterprises and in view of the fact that such a situation can be fundamentally resolved only through transforming enterprises' capital structure, vigorously developing the stock market and the corporate bond market is unavoidable. In short, it is necessary to endeavour to create a more relaxed, liberal, pluralistic, and competitive financial system through financial reform. Only on the basis of such a financial system will the central bank be able to assume a detached position and be truly capable of playing the role as the umpire. On the other hand, if there are only a very small number of financial institutions and a very small number of financial instruments in the economy, resulting in a situation in which "leadership is rendered ineffectual by recalcitrant subordinates," the central bank's macro-regulation and -control will become truly irrelevant.
