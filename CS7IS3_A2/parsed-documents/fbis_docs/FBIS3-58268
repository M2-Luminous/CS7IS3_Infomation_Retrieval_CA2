Denktas today received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant envoy for Cyprus. John Paul Cavanaugh, UN peace force adviser, and Necati Munir Ertekun, presidential adviser, also attended the meeting, which is continuing through lunch as well. Denktas remarked before the meeting that the sides must converge on a common point if a solution is to be reached in Cyprus. We have not yet reached such a point and it is still early for this, Denktas added. Reacting to recent Kliridhis statements, the president explained that Kliridhis is defending his own cause and this is natural. Denktas noted that the Turkish Cypriots, in turn, defend their own just cause in their own way and will continue to do so. Asked if he is hopeful, Denktas said that in order for that to happen, the two sides must first meet at the negotiating table and bilateral talks must begin. In reply to another question, Denktas reported that the Cyprus problem may be discussed with Turkey at the beginning of February, and that an assessment will be conducted with the government and the Republican Assembly before that. In his statement before the meeting, Feissel noted that Joe Clark's arrival was postponed in an effort to schedule a suitable time to meet with officials in Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus.
