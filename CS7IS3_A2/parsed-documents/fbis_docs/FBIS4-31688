This will be an unofficial meeting of the two heads of state, like the one held in Brdo near Kranj in October 1992, when Mr. Kucan and Mr. Tudjman agreed that it would be useful to meet at least once a year. Instead of that, it came to a break which has lasted for almost 20 months now, and during which a series of unsolved questions between the two states has appeared. We asked President Kucan to give an interview for VECERNJI LIST immediately before his visit to Croatia. We asked him to refer primarily to the relations between Slovenia and Croatia, but also to other important issues. [Zagorac] Can you tell us something about the relations between Slovenia and Croatia during the period in which you have not met with President Tudjman? [Kucan] We should in any case go back into the history of our relations in order to see that they can be divided into two parts. Our cooperation was excellent during the period when both Slovenia and Croatia fought for their independence. Although we knew that the situation in Croatia was more difficult, and that that fact might affect the materialization of Slovene ambitions, we still required that the Croatian right of self-determination be implemented in the same way as ours. Since independence was achieved, our cooperation has deteriorated, but I do not think that there is a plausible reason for it. It is true that the conditions in Croatia are different from those in Slovenia, but this does not justify the present situation. I think that Slovenia has much understanding for special problems Croatia has, but this understanding has its limits, too, simply because the burden of unsolved problems has become heavier than the understanding for the more difficult conditions in which Croatia lives. There was a period of time during which there had been no political dialogue whatsoever between Slovenia and Croatia; relations were then resumed only on the level of governments and ministries. In other words, there has been no cooperation on the level of presidents for a long time, so that I think that the understanding of problems and the interest to solve them has been considerably reduced. What is even more important is that the mutual confidence which is necessary if we want to solve problems has significantly fallen, too. I support the political dialogue and I think that it is not only good, but also necessary to talk; the attitudes, interests, and arguments of the other side have to be known in order to be able to search for solutions. If there is no dialogue, only short-term solutions, or no solutions at all, can be expected. [Zagorac] Relations between states are usually defined as being on a high, low, or medium level. Where would you put the Slovene-Croatian relations on that scale? [Kucan] It cannot be claimed that they are on a high level. They are far below the level which is necessary in order to solve the existing problems on the onehand , and our vital interests on the other hand. I have noticed the lack of political will; there have been numerous opportunities which allowed us to start solving our problems, but they have simply not been taken. Chances have often been missed because of egoistic political interests of both states and because of the ambition to solve all problems at once. It is in my opinion, however, impossible to solve all problems at once because they are too complicated and too sensitive. Since this approach has not borne fruit, I think that we should now decide to solve problems gradually. Priority has to be given to those problems which have to be solved in order to normalize life along the Croatian-Slovene border, and economic life in general. The Slovene Government has proposed such an approach, and I hope that we could reach a solution more easily in this way. [Zagorac] Is Slovenia ready to make special efforts for the improvement of the present situation? [Kucan] I would like to repeat that the present situation is contradictory to the vital interests of both states, so that it is only logical that it must be changed, and it can be changed only if both sides are ready to change it. This means that alternatives to old solutions and attitudes have to be found, without giving up each state's own principles, though. A way for the materialization of interests of both sides has to be found in order to enhance the mutual respect which is necessary in the search for a solution. I think that comments on internal circumstances in other states only harm the positive atmosphere. The assessment was made, for example, that Slovenia belongs to those countries between the Baltic and the Black Sea in which communists are returning to power, and which are characterized by rifts between coalitions. As far as I am concerned, I think that this is a Slovene matter. I think that Slovenia does not assess the situation in other states and that it does not interfere with internal political matters of other states. It leaves it to the citizens of those states to realize whether their regime is democratic or not. I think that I can generalize and say that there is an unhealthy competition between Croatia and Slovenia, as it can be seen between the former Eastern European states, for example, since they are trying to confirm their European affiliation by exaggerating their own and diminishing the achievements of the others in the field of transformation, which is certainly a demanding and a long-lasting process. Expressions such as, "compared with others, we have the advantage...," or "we have achieved much more than others," can often be heard. To whom do they want to prove this? The international community knows very well what they have achieved. They cannot prove such a thing to their neighbors because this only causes suspicion and misunderstanding. In other words, this is only used for political conflicts in domestic politics. If I look at Slovene-Croatian relations in the light of what I said before, I still think -- although I have just made a very pessimistic statement -- that the circle of our bilateral relations has not been closed yet. It must only be established whether there is political will and readiness in both states to solve problems in the atmosphere of mutual understanding. Mutual respect has to be encouraged, and the starting point of the search for solutions has to be the assumption that the interests of both states have the same value. [Zagorac] Can it be expected, and is it realistic to expect international help in the sense of an arbitration or similar in solving problems between Croatia and Slovenia? When I say this, I primarily have the problem with the border in the Bay of Piran in mind. [Kucan] The international community has certain institutions of "preventive diplomacy," which should enable peaceful solutions to conflicts when it is impossible to achieve a solution through bilateral cooperation. These instruments are even being enlarged now. If we fail to reach an agreement about the border in the Bay of Piran, there is the possibility of international arbitration. I think, however, that this would harm the prestige of both Slovenia and Croatia, because it would mean we cannot find a criterion or a combination of criteria for the definition of a state border and solve the problem ourselves. International institutions can apply the same criteria as we, they do not have any additional. [Zagorac] Have Croatia and Slovenia reached the point at which such help is necessary? [Kucan] The question is whether our two states have exhausted all possibilities which could enable us to solve the problems ourselves. If there are no further possibilities, it could be considered to cede the responsibility to an international institution. The same is true of arbitration. [Zagorac] Does this mean that we still have not tried everything? [Kucan] I think so. That is why we have problems. The old attitudes have simply not changed. If no solution can be found with these attitudes, it is obvious that other approaches have to be looked for. There is the tendency to simplify this complex issue and reduce it to single problems such as the border crossings at Raskrizje, Sveta Gera, or the Bay of Piran, but these are not real problems and difficulties. Furthermore, if emotions are added to the whole thing, the picture can easily become blurred. The biggest problem is that the economic relations between Slovenia and Croatia have been deteriorating for a long time already. Economists usually claim that cooperation is made impossible by politicians. This means that we are in fact confronted with two sorts of problems, the border issue and economy. It is bad that border issues have not been solved yet. This harms the sovereignty of both countries, since this is a condition for a legitimate status in international associations. But as long as there is no solution, the best thing would be to accept the situation as it is and look for new solution in the meantime. It is bad to try to change the present situation by imposing things on the other side. This creates suspicion and diminishes the possibility to reach a long-term solution. If one of the international criteria for border determination is applied, it should be possible to draw the border at those places where it is controversial from the point of view of any side. [Zagorac] What in your opinion are the elements of force applied by either side with the aim to change the present situation? [Kucan] It is certain that felling of trees in the area of Sneznik is a one-sided measure, since the property of citizens of the other state is made use of. Take, for example, the construction of the border crossing facility in Secovlje by the Croatian side. It is being built on ground which can be assumed to belong to Slovenia. These things cannot contribute to a better understanding. In my opinion, these are some of the unnecessary one-sided measures; the present situation should remain unchanged until final solutions are found. If no solution can be found to a problem, it is better to apply alternatives as temporary solutions. Could not Plovanija, for example, be used as the alternative border crossing for Secovlje, and is it not possible that the Bay of Piran is under Slovene supervision as it has been by now? I would like to repeat that these could be temporary solutions until final solutions are found. If there is not this minimum of will, people have the feeling that there is no readiness to solve problems, or that both sides are incapable of finding a solution. Life is already requiring certain regulations, and the unsolved border, economic, estate, and other issues inevitably affect the intensity of economic relations. This is what I have in mind when I say that politicians disturb the cooperation of economists. If there is no good will, if there is no agreement on a free trade zone, or on investments, if there is no anti double tax treaty, in short, if there is no basic legal infrastructure for the regulation of economic relations, people will look for illegal possibilities. This affects the economic power of both Slovenia and Croatia. This also affects their integration into Europe. [Zagorac] There are countries in the world in which economists are quicker than politicians, but this seems to be impossible here; our economists are waiting for politicians to prepare the situation for their activities. [Kucan] Yes, they are, but I still think that economic relations have not been completely frozen yet. This is good. [Zagorac] This is true, but their scope and value have been considerably decreasing. [Kucan] There are well-founded grounds for this situation, but politics cannot be the excuse for everything. [Zagorac] What is the position you would like Slovenia to achieve in the international community? After the idea about a confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina had been confirmed, it was heard that Slovenia might join that association. Are these expectations realistic? [Kucan] I would like to stress that Slovenia already has its recognizable position in international life, which it would still like to improve, though. It is a member of the Council of Europe, it has signed the agreement on cooperation within the Partnership for Peace, it has signed the agreement on cooperation with the European Union, and it has started negotiating on its associate membership in the EU. I hope that the EU Commission will formally approve of these negotiations in the meeting of the EU ministers in June. Slovenia has been invited to join the Treaty on Stability, it is a UN member, and a member of international financial institutions. It lives a normal international life. As a young state it has difficulties with the confirmation of its rating in international life. Since it is aware of the fact that it cannot live alone, and does not want to live alone, it is therefore trying to make contacts with the world, but by trying to establish international contacts it is confronted with the danger of losing its still not very recognizable identity. I would say that the most important Slovene task is to make sure that its identity does not get lost in the search for economic, political, defense, and other connections with the world. Regarding Yugoslavia and, I would say, "exotic" thinking of certain poor, superficial, and ignorant "experts" on the political situation in the Balkans and on the history of the Slovene, the Croatian, and other peoples in the former Yugoslavia, on the reasons for its collapse, and on the founded wish of Slovenia and Croatia for independence and their improvised ideas about the creation of a third Yugoslavia -- I can say that this is not a realistic project for Slovenia. As far as the confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned, this is probably a realistic interest of these states, but Slovenia does not have any formal relation to that confederation, and it does not want to have one. Slovenia's interest is to cooperate with all European states, including the European southeast, the Balkans, and, naturally, all the states which arose or will arise from the former Yugoslavia. When everything normalizes, the quality of the cooperation will be significantly different from the one we had when we lived in one state. These relations will be neither better nor worse than they were as long as we lived together. They will be determined by interests. [Zagorac] There are opinions in Europe that Slovenia could join Europe more easily in association with some other countries. [Kucan] This is how those people think who do not want to face complicated problems and who want to make things easy for themselves. The case of Yugoslavia proved, however, that this makes things more difficult. Every country is a separate matter. We were in "one package" with Croatia when this was necessary, we even insisted on it, but we are two separate states now. If we regulate our bilateral relations, we shall both be able to reach what we want more easily, and that is Europe, without being in "a package." [Zagorac] There were opinions in European political circles that Slovenia was lucky because it was taken as the example of a peaceful disintegration . [Kucan] I did not feel the benevolence of such a judgment in my work. I do not know whether this judgment is realistic. It is true that Slovenia supported a peaceful disintegration of Yugoslavia. We made efforts and concrete proposals, also together with Croatia, but they were all strictly rejected by Belgrade and the federal leadership at that time. Our proposals were similar to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but they applied them in a much better way, without bothering the international community with their disintegration. [Zagorac] Slovenia has lately been confronted with demonstrations and similar forms of political life outside the parliament. [Kucan] I think that the scandals we have been confronted with lately are a part of the democratization process in all countries in transition. These phenomena are more or less normal, although they are not desirable in countries with a parliamentary democracy. The scandals in Slovenia have had a positive effect, too. They have contributed to the awareness of the real value of a parliamentary democracy, of human dignity and rights. Their most important effect is, however, that they have made people aware of the necessity to use and respect the instruments of the constitutional state since this is the basis of democracy. [Zagorac] To what extent did these events affect the reputation of Slovenia in the world? [Kucan] We have been much more concerned on how this might affect our reputation in the world than the world itself. We have our idea on how the transition process should go and know that it is affected by such phenomena, but this is not of great interest for other states. What is important for them is that Slovenia makes sure that it will carry out its economic and political reforms, that it will respect human rights and grant rights to its minorities, that it is ready not only to materialize its rights in the international community, but also to take over responsibilities. These are the basic elements for political judgments. To my knowledge they have so far been more or less positive regarding Slovenia. There have been suggestions to make certain improvements in Slovenia, but generally speaking they have been positive and benevolent. [Zagorac] During the preparations for this meeting with President Tudjman, there arose the question in Slovenia about different powers of the two presidents according to the respective constitutions. There were even rumors that it would be better to organize a meeting between Mr. Tudjman and Mr. Drnovsek (Slovene prime minister), or between Tudjman, Valentic, Kucan, and Drnovsek. Are these differences an impediment to successful negotiations? [Kucan] I think that all contacts are useful, regardless of the fact whether they are organized between two or four people. It is important that it comes to negotiations and that they are continuous. It is important to bring arguments and solve problems, because this improves the confidence in the other partner. I do not underestimate the problem of the formal power of the president. This is a problem. The Croatian Constitution introduced the presidential system in contrast to the Slovene, which is a typical parliamentarian system with clearly defined and very restricted powers of the president, but this is no reason why the political dialogue on that level should be given up. Regarding my negotiations with President Tudjman, I can say that they can represent a serious effort for the creation of a favorable negotiating atmosphere. In other words, we shall not solve concrete problems, but we shall try to define them and express our political will that they be solved. Concrete solutions will have to be offered by our governments and other institutions. Apart from that, bilateral relations will be only one of the topics discussed. They can, however, best be discussed in a broader, in the European context, for example, if we know that Slovenia and Croatia want to join the European Union and other political, economic, and defense associations. With the burden of unsolved bilateral problems we shall not be able to join European associations, though. This can best be proven by the example of bilateral difficulties Slovenia has with Italy. This problem could slow down the Slovenian integration into Europe. [Box, p 10] Unpleasant and Worrying [Zagorac] A new, very unpleasant chapter has been opened in the relations between Slovenia and Italy. [Kucan] This is a very unpleasant and worrying matter. Mr. Drnovsek has recently said that our relations, including the problems regarding the estate cases of those people who chose one of the two citizenships, were solved by the Ossimo Agreements. Slovenia insists that it is the legal successor to the agreement signed between Yugoslavia and Italy. Slovenia was recognized the status of the legal successor of Yugoslavia by the Italian government. Whether the confidence and the political atmosphere will improve remains to be seen. In any case, this has to be the will of both states. I think that it is contradictory to the logic of contemporary democratic relations in the international community to make bilateral matters a condition for Slovenian integration into multilateral associations, as this is the European Union, for example. [Box, p 11] Markovic and the Attack Against Slovenia [Zagorac] Ante Markovic has appeared in Slovenian media with the opinion that "there was an agreement between the Slovenian leadership and Serbia about a forged attack against Slovenia." Is this true? [Kucan] If he had really made that statement, I am very surprised. I cannot imagine that a man like Ante Markovic would make statements without any arguments. It would be better for him to think about his responsibility for the things which have happened in Yugoslavia. As the federal prime minister he had the possibility to contribute to the process of peaceful disintegration of Yugoslavia at the moment when it was clear that it was impossible to save it. It would be good to remind him of the conversation President Tudjman and I had with him in the Villa Weiss [in Zagreb] on 29 November 1990 about his possible future role in the process of peaceful disintegration. He refused such a possibility then. This is true. The Slovene agreement with Serbia he mentioned is simply not true. I do not know who made such an agreement. It was not me, this is certain.
