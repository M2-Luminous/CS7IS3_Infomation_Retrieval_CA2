"Defense Logistics Agency [DLA] Director, I do not quite understand. After all your logical explanations, you yourself do not understand clearly either. Do you?" "Defense Security Commander, when did you learn about this case [fraudulent shell purchase incident]? The above is a scene from the high-ranking military officials' "hearing" that took place in the first meeting room of the Ministry of National Defense [MND] called suddenly on 22 December 1993. Such "hearings" and "lectures" followed one after another in the MND after new Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae took office. It is difficult to imagine Minister Yi's continuous unpredictable acts. On 22 December, immediately after his appointment, the first formal meeting was held with 120 high-ranking military officials from the MND, the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS], and chief of each service. There, Minister Yi made the participants sweat by unceasingly reprimanding the director of the DLA (lieutenant general), the head of the special prosecution team (lieutenant general), the chief of the Logistics Bureau (major general), the second assistant vice minister, and the commander of Defense Security Command (brigadier general) for the recent controversy over the gun shell purchase fraud case. In the meeting, Minister Yi urged the relevant military officials to wake up, asking how the people could accept the case when he himself barely understood it. In addition to the "hearing-style" reprimand, Minister Yi surprised many relevant officials once again that day by personally writing on the board to explain, as if he were a teacher giving a lecture, each time he was supposed to stand up to defend his dignity. By taking an example of U.S. Generals Vessey and Meyers, Minister Yi drew a diagram in an attempt to dispel some people's worries that there would be a large-scale personnel reshuffle because JCS Chief Yi Yang-ho is one year Minister Yi's senior, and Kim Tong-chin, chief of Staff of the ROK Army, is a fellow graduate of the 17th class of the Military Academy. Like an instructor of an institute talking to students, Minister Yi repeatedly stressed, "This is the point. Please underline (or take a second look)," about the subjects he wanted to emphasize. Minister Yi's "diagram-style lecture" continued on 28 December when he declared the full-scale re-audit and inspection of the Yulgok Project [ROK Army weapons purchase program] and the defense logistics system and facilities. After reading the prepared announcement, he continued to give his own 15-minute "enthusiastic lecture" while drawing diagrams on the board. He stressed the following four points: The Yulgok Project reform is a true reform; two major directions to improve the Yulgok Project; the inspection is not aimed at specific figures like a "witch hunt" inspection; and supplementary measures for audit and inspection. He used a unique expression of "making the Yulgok Project truly worthy of Yulgok." Sudden proposal of silent tribute during inauguration speech, "Let us think of the beloved soldiers" [subhead] Such "Don Quixote-style" acts were seen again at his inauguration ceremony. At the inauguration ceremony held on the morning of 22 December in the Army Hall inside the MND, after reading only the usual greeting part from his prepared inauguration speech, he said, "Now, I will talk about three major points I want to emphasize," and gave an impromptu speech for over 10 minutes. "First of all, we should prevent a disastrous war, which would cause common destruction of the North and the South, by maximizing combat capabilities. Second, we should achieve a true reform in the national defense field by driving out inefficiency, incompetency, corruption, and irregularities. Third, we should have a strict sense of professionalism over our duty and the Army." Stating that the next year's [1994] National Defense budget is a tremendous burden to the people forcing each household to share 910,000 won, Minister Yi continued to say in a high tone of voice: "The Army should manage and administer defense manpower and resource with heart-trembling piety." Minister Yi repeated with particular emphasis the phrase "with heart-trembling piety." He also added in a high tone of voice, "(the soldiers) should not spend their time by merely reading newspapers and magazines but they should read about the enemy (North Korea) which threatens us." Stating "Let us think of our beloved soldiers who are on guard duty day and night and are engaged in operation while exposed to severe cold temperatures and cold wind blowing from the North," Minister Yi paid silent tribute to soldiers, momentarily suspending his inaugural address. There are two contradictory reactions among military personnel concerning Minister Yi's "eccentric behavior." One is the group of "affirmative assessment" which interprets his behavior as an expression of strong will to push ahead with genuine reform drive in order to make the military worthy of the military, and another is the "critics" group that claims he deals lightly with high-ranking general officers, who regard honor and authority as their own lives; by holding press interviews too frequently; and being conscious of his own publicity. However, most of military-related officials share the view that Minister Yi is doing his utmost to recover the honor of the military, which has been driven into a corner with the shells import incident. It was learned that for the first two weeks after he came to office, Minister Yi stayed late in his office, between 2200 to 0130, in order to acquaint himself with the work, except when he had to attend an unavoidable official dinner meeting or other functions. With the minister's forced march, working-level officials could not return to their homes until late at night, even during the year-end days. Many military officials are concerned with the fact that the scope of Minister Yi's choice is not wide under the present situation. Former Minister Kwon Yong-hae was relieved and Minister Yi took office as a result of the shell import incident, and the interest of the people, including the supreme commander of the military, is so great that Minister Yi is being pressed hard to eliminate the people's suspicion on this incident. Besides, he is assigned a task to resolve the doubt on the Yulgok Project [ROK Army weapons purchase program] and on logistic irregularities. Phenomena, far distant from Minister Yi's public pledge, already began to appear. In the first meeting with military officials on the day of his inauguration, he clearly stated that there would be no shocking personnel reshuffle within the military. However, he suddenly dismissed two lieutenant general-grade officers, including Kim Sang-chun, JCS chief of operations; and Yi Taek-hyong, JSC chief of strategy, last 30 December. They were all members of Hanahoe [a private circle of military academy graduates] and were already on the reshuffle list last October. However, since a step was taken throughout the entire armed forces to strengthen combat readiness through March 1994, their replacement is to be withheld until that time. Thus, there were many speculations about the change in this policy. Lieutenant General Yi reported the greatest amount of personal properties among the military general officers during the period of official registration of personal properties by government officials last September. He has been even suspected of real estate speculation. Lt Gen Kim also belonged to the top group when the military generals made public their personal assets. As a result, some believe that the reshuffle was prompted by the disclosure of their assets. The reshuffle contradicts some people's speculation that since Minister Yi himself is a Hanahoe member, those from Hanahoe will be saved in the future, thus attracting public attention. Some are concerned with a possibility that the personnel reshuffle to be carried out sooner or later in connection with the shell import incident will be a large-scale one. Minister Yi is also given a difficult task of figuring out how he should accept in the future "the wind" blowing from outside forces, including Chongwadae [presidential office], that expect reform, regardless of his own will for a reform drive, in a way that the military would not fall to pieces [wahae]. He also needs to overcome some people's criticism that Minister Yi has been merely posturing when he has expressed his will for reform over the past two weeks. In conclusion, Minister Yi's "clever moves" to overcome such a difficult situation facing the military is the target of the people's attention.
