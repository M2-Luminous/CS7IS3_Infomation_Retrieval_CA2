At a press conference, he said this would depend on developments in the former Yugoslavia and in southern areas of the former Soviet Union as well as on what the political and economic consequences of the first democratic elections in Russia would be and how they would be reflected in concrete steps, given the economic and political stabilisation of the country. Baudys said that the reduction of military forces is a historical process currently underway in Europe as a result of the break-up of the bipolar world. He said it was a natural response by certain states but not all of them. In this context he mentioned Sweden, which is increasing its army budget, and Austria, which is strengthening its anti-aircraft defence. Baudys said that, in his opinion, there should be no cuts in the army in future, but rather that its effectiveness should increase. Therefore, it is necessary to build effective systems of management and command and effective defence systems. But this is rather expensive, and "we must take into consideration what our budget is," he concluded.
