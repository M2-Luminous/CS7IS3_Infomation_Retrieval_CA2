On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, Li Peng extended his warm congratulations to the 40th anniversary of the founding of the CPAFWFC and to the opening of the meeting of the CPAFWFC's new national council. He said: Since the founding of the CPAFWFC 40 years ago, it has held high the banner of peace and friendship, has set its eyes on the whole world, has made friends all over the world, and has done a great deal to win international support and sympathy for the country's construction. Today, China's international status is the highest it has ever been, and we have friends around the world -- these are the result of the painstaking labor of the proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation in promoting people-to-people diplomatic work, and of the diligent work of the large numbers of comrades engaging in people-to-people diplomatic work. Li Peng said: Diplomatic and domestic work are closely related. Achievements in domestic work are the foundation for diplomatic work, and achievements in diplomatic work boost the development of domestic work. The underlying purpose of China's independent foreign policy of peace is to create a good international environment for the country's four modernizations drive. Li Peng added: The work of the CPAFWFC and other nongovernment friendship organizations and groups shows that people-to-people diplomatic work is an effective supplement to official diplomatic efforts. Official diplomatic efforts should be integrated with people-to-people diplomatic work, and the two should be made mutually supporting; the prospects for people-to-people diplomatic work are very broad. Li Peng said: "During the session of the CPAFWFC's last council meeting, I met with representatives attending a conference on friendship cities work. I told the conference's attendees that the spring of China's diplomatic work had arrived. Judging from the current situation, our prediction then has become a reality." Speaking on the international situation and China's diplomatic principle, Li Peng said: The international situation currently is in a period in which the old setup is being transformed into a new one; the multipolar trend has further developed. Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's guidelines, over the last few years we have kept ourselves coolheaded and sober in observing, analyzing, and judging the development of the international situation, thus enabling us to continue to open up new situations in diplomatic work. The international community has widely applauded China's important proposals to establish a fair and reasonable new international order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to respect the right of the peoples of all countries to choose on their own their own path of development, and to promote equal and mutually beneficial international economic cooperation and trade exchanges. Li Peng said: China adheres to the policy of maintaining neighborly and friendly relations with its neighbors and of developing friendly and cooperative relations with them. This policy has played an increasingly important role in reinforcing and developing the good environments around the country. China's relations with the four Central Asian nations, Mongolia, and other Asian countries fully attest this. Li Peng expressed his hope that the CPAFWFC will attune its work to the new situation. He said: All comrades engaging in people-to-people diplomatic work should take advantage of the current favorable international situation to make more friends in order to create a new situation in promoting people-to-people friendship. They should be familiar with the domestic situation and situations outside the country, should have a good understanding of the country's foreign policy, and should study harder to further improve themselves. They should further unite themselves, cooperate with each other, and truly work as veteran comrades long engaged in promoting people-to-people friendship. I hope they will make new contributions to promoting people-to-people friendship in the new period. Concluding his speech, Li Peng said that he hoped all comrades attending the meeting, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, will strive for new development and progress to bring about more lasting peace and friendship for China and the world, which will soon enter the 21st century. Li Lanqing, Wang Guangying, Luo Gan, and other comrades attended the meeting.
