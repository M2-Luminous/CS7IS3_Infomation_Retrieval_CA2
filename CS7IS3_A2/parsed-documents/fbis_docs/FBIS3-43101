A. Golovan, L. A. Mironovskiy; UDC 681.326.74] [Abstract]A functional diagnosis of a Kalman filtration algorithm is examined. Kalman filtration is carried out in an on- board digital computer which is subjected to upsets and failures. Upsets, failures and interference when information is transferred can cause the computer to produce incorrect results. Among the several possible control and diagnostics methods, the method chosen is based on analytical redundancy, which is algorithmic in nature. To test this method, the dimensions of the filter are increased by one unit of measure in order to establish the control. This allowed the whole range of control relations to be obtained, including algebraic invariants which are used to locate and localize defects. This methods occupies relatively few resources of the computer and makes it possible to discover failures and mistakes in the operation of the digital computer as they occur, which allows distorted results to be blocked, as well as prohibits mistakes from multiplying. 2 tables and 16 references.
