According to the poll, which was prepared by the Mexican consulting firm Moti, four basic questions were posed to people throughout the Mexican Republic. The poll was conducted in the Federal District, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Tijuana, and Merida The questions included: 1. Who do you prefer most, Manuel Camacho Solis or Luis Donaldo Colosio? 2. What is your opinion with respect to Zapatist National Liberation Army leader Subcommander Marcos? 3. Which of the presidential candidates do you expect to vote for on 21 August 1994? 4. Do you believe the people's vote will be respected in the upcoming elections? This random-sample poll was conducted on 11 February, and, according to the fax sent by Federico Reyes Heroles, the interviews were conducted in person and publicly. The poll was sponsored by the monthly magazine ESTE PAIS, and it included interviews with 320 people. The margin of error is approximately 6 percent with a 90 percent statistical reliability. Let us take a look at what the public had to say with respect to the four questions I already mentioned. First, who do you like the most, Camacho or Colosio? In addition to this question, the respondents were also asked to which political party they belonged or sympathized most. Nearly 43 percent of those who selected Luis Donaldo Colosio replied that they were members or supporters of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], while 23 percent indicated that they liked Camacho as well as Colosio. In addition, 18 percent pointed out that they preferred Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. Meanwhile, 11 percent of those who said they were PRI members or supported the party stated they did not like either man. Of the 320 people polled, there were also those who said they were either supporters or members of the National Action Party [PAN]. Here, we begin to observe drastic changes in preferences toward Camacho and Colosio. Of the PAN members interviewed, 18 percent expressed more inclination toward Manuel Camacho Solis, while 16 percent stated their preference for Luis Donaldo Colosio. At the same time, 34 percent of the PAN members interviewed expressed equal support for both men, while 32 percent said they did not support either. Finally, 17 percent of the PRI members and supporters polled said they preferred Camacho, 11 percent said they preferred Colosio, 23 percent said they liked both men equally, and 43 percent indicated they did not like either. The poll also included some citizens who did not identify themselves with any political party. Of this group, 16 percent said they preferred Luis Donaldo Colosio, 12 percent selected Manuel Camacho Solis, 34 percent said they liked both men equally, and 30 percent said the did not approve of either. While it is quite interesting to note how the Mexican people feel with respect to Manuel Camacho Solis and Luis Donaldo Colosio, according to this poll released by ESTE PAIS magazine, there are still three more questions to consider. The people polled were also asked their opinion of Subcommander Marcos. Overall, 30 percent of those interviewed said they held a poor opinion of Subcommander Marcos, 27 percent said they did not have a good or bad opinion, 24 percent said they had a favorable opinion, and 19 percent said they did not know. With respect to the third question of how each person polled would vote on 21 August, 35 percent said they did not yet know or did not want to say, 33 percent said they planned to vote for Luis Donaldo Colosio, 17 percent said they planned to vote for PAN Candidate Diego Fernandez de Zevallos, and 14 percent said they intended to vote for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate for the Party of the Democratic Revolution. What is really interesting in all of this is that, if we compare this poll with earlier polls, we observe several things: First, Luis Donaldo Colosio's popularity has increased from 28 percent to 33 percent. Second, PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Zevallo's popularity has increased dramatically from 11 percent to 17 percent. Meanwhile, Cuauthemoc Cardenas' popularity has fallen noticeably from 11 percent to 14 percent. I repeat, all of this is in relation to an earlier poll conducted on 11 February. In conclusion, let us examine the results of the final question as to whether or not the election results will be respected. What do you think the people answered? Of those polled, 43 percent indicated that they did not believe the election results would be respected, 34 percent said they believed the results would indeed be respected, 17 percent did not answer, and 8 percent said they did not know. Interesting, huh?
