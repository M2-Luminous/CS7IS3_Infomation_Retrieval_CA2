'Arafat went to Cairo despite the Palestinian leadership's decision to send a delegation headed by PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and including Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), to be joined there by Nabil Sha'th, 'Arafat's adviser, and Faysal al-Husayni from the occupied territories, as Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) refused to head the delegation, insisting on his previous position, namely not to return to the negotiating table until progress has been made and results produced in "'Arafat's negotiations." [passage omitted] According to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's sources, this solution appealed to a number of PLO Executive Committee members, as it saves 'Arafat's "face." 'Arafat was exposed to strong criticisms during the Palestinian leadership's recent meetings in Tunis because of the situation to which he has led the negotiations. Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the negotiations file is now full of ambiguity and the issues have become confused as a result of 'Arafat's interference, since he led the negotiations to the Davos agreement, which ignores all previous agreements. The sources criticize 'Arafat's practices and his noncompliance with what was agreed by Palestinian negotiators in the past. [passage omitted] PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that huge and serious loopholes have emerged in Palestinian negotiation performance. Numerous forces warned about the danger of this even before the negotiations. And many people expressed this inside the Central Council, which endorsed the Declaration of Principles agreement. Al-Najjab adds: "The most marked loophole is the nonexistence of a body to refer to or an integrated negotiation plan." Al-Najjab stressed that after the present negotiations in Cairo the causes of these loopholes will be examined and ways of tackling them explored. He said that the only way out of the present situation in the negotiations is to return to what the Central Council decided, namely the need to set up an authority for the negotiations, draw up a plan for them, and select professional and political capabilities to continue this process. And also to adhere to the negotiation mechanism specified by the declaration of principles agreement to secure the required agreements, whether with regard to Gaza and Jericho, the transitional phase, the final agreement, and so on. Al-Najjab said that the Israelis feel that the time factor is in their favor, which is why they are resorting to procrastination to gain more time and continuing their previous policy before the Declaration of Principles agreement is implemented. Another Palestinian official, who asked to remain anonymous, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: The Israelis want now to consolidate the new negotiation mechanism between 'Arafat and Peres, because this mechanism gives more room to maneuver and play for time. The official did not conceal that as a result of the mechanism consolidated by 'Arafat, Israel is now in a better and more comfortable position, so they are now in a position to step up their conditions.
