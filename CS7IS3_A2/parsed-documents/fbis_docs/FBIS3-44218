The topic on today's agenda was the reduction by half of the value of the CFA franc in the franc zone and its impact on the financial agreements between financial backers and countries that share the use of the CFA franc, which was devalued on 11 January. Our country Cote d'Ivoire, which is very concerned about solving the problems caused by this new economic situation, has been holding discussions led by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, in attempt to ensure the revamping of the Ivorian economy with the support of international financial institutions. Late this morning, Prime Minister Duncan granted audience to an IMF delegation. The focus of the meeting was to sign the letter of intent concerning the Ivorian economic program endorsed by the IMF for the establishment of an enhanced three-year structural adjustment program worth 281 billion CFA francs. This program will enable the country to reach as early as 1996--that is within two years--a 6-percent growth rate with, in particular, the active resumption of investments to consolidate and strengthen public finances, and finally, the establishment of measures that will benefit the poorer categories of the society. [Begin Duncan recording] The particularity of this program compared with previous ones is that it has been launched in the aftermath of the devaluation of the CFA franc which was decided by franc zone member countries. As a classic instrument of economic policy, the modification of the exchange rate has its constraints, the most important of them being the control of prices, the control of monetary creation, and the resorption of public deficit. The change in parity also brings about an improvement in competitiveness and should play a decisive role in the growth of our economy. Simultaneously, external aid will make it possible to finance important economic and social programs. [passage omitted] [end recording]
