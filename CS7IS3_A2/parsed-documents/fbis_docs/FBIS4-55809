The forces of Bosnian Croats from the area of the Croat enclave of Orasje in the Sava valley northwest of Brcko opened fire from mortars and infantry weaponry. The Croat attack caused no effects on the Serb side and the Serb units did not respond. The forces of Bosnian Serbs also did not respond to fire opened towards them on Sunday by Moslem troops in a location 8 km southwest of the Serb town of Brcko in the Sava valley. A narrow strip of Serb territory in northern Bosnia which links the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) is only a few kilometers wide near Brcko. The Moslems have been for weeks amassing their troops to the south, and the Bosnian Croats to the north of the corridor in an attempt to cut it. The Republic of Croatia has also been concentrating its troops on the northern side of the corridor, on the Croatian bank of the Sava. Both Moslems and Croats have for days continued with offensive actions against the Serb positions and settlements in spite of the presence of U.N. observers. Brcko was shelled in such an action on Saturday evening, when 5 civilians were wounded, including a one-year-old girl. While Sunday was completely calm in Sarajevo, at the far west of Bosnia, in the Cazin Krajina region, inter-Moslem clashes between the followers of the radical Moslem authorities in Sarajevo and those of Fikret Abdic do not stop. Abdic advocates peace with the Serb and Croats. The Moslem Radio Sarajevo said that Abdic's followers, who proclaimed the autonomous province of western Bosnia, from early morning were opening fire from infantry and artillery weapons along all lines on the positions of the forces loyal to Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic.
