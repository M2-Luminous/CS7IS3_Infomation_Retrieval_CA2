Regarding economic, monetary, and financial policy, Germany and France "must make sure that they switch to an economic offensive," Scharping said during a meeting with Socialist Party Chairman Michel Rocard. The European Union must play a bigger role, and Bonn and Paris must coordinate their foreign and security policy more closely. German-French friendship must be expanded. "The status quo must not just be preserved," Scharping said. Rocard, who enters the European election campaign as the top candidate of the French Socialists, said that things are going pretty well between Germany and France: "So well that one can still do more against unemployment and for an efficient Europe." Scharping wished Rocard, who is strinving to become French president in 1995, "as much success as possible." So far, the German-French relationship has "not" been determined "by party policy constellations." "However, common thinking, common feeling, and common values are beneficial for the development into the future," Scharping said. Rocard paid tribute to the SPD chairman as a "man of principles and ethics." In view of the election successes of the neofascists in Italy, Scharping vehemently came out in favor of a "complete isolation" of parliamentarians and miters of right-wing extremist and neo-fascist parties in Europe. "Any decent person...must contribute to having neo-fascism, xenophobia...socially and politically ostracized," Scharping said.
