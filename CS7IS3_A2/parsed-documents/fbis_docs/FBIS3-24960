Reacting to the report, Dhlakama described it as artificial and said it comes at a time when the Renamo president is preparing to visit Washington. Afonso Dhlakama said that the U.S. State Department report is meant for the U.S. public not to consider the Renamo leader as a politician. The report denounces serious human rights violations in areas controlled by Renamo, namely, the torture, abduction, and killing of people.
