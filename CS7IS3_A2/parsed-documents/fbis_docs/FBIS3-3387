Deputies attending the Second Session of the Eighth NPC reported that a sharp rise in the prices of chemical fertilizers, diesel fuels, and other means of production, as well as a slow increase in grain procurement prices in recent years, have caused the gap between the prices of industrial and agricultural products to widen progressively. Deputy Ge Lanmei, a peasant from Jiyang Town in Fujian Province's Jianou City, cited her home town as an example: The price of quality chemical fertilizer supplied by the agricultural materials department according to grain output suddenly surged to 1,300 yuan a metric ton in 1993 from 538 yuan in 1992, registering a sharp rise of 142 percent; while that of quality chemical fertilizer for centralized distribution rose to 1,300 yuan a metric ton in 1993 from 775 yuan in 1992, up as much as 68 percent. Figures provided by the state statistics departments also can illustrate a host of facts: Chinese peasants' per capita net income for 1993 was 921.4 yuan, an increase of 3.2 percent in real terms from the previous year. This growth rate represented a 2.7 percentage point decline from the previous year and was lower than that of agriculture and the rural economy. Although their grain harvests piled up like small hills, the peasants' wallets did not expand simultaneously. The production enthusiasm of quite a number of peasants was thus dampened. A deputy from Liaoning Province said: Last year more than 500 farming households at the province's Changtu County gave up a total of 110,000 mu of farmland they had contracted. A Zhejiang deputy put it in an even more acute way: In the past, the peasants were trying by hook or by crook to get more farmland, but now they are asking again and again to return the land instead. If things go on like this, who is going to farm in the future? With what are we going to fill up our rice sacks and vegetable baskets? How should we solve the problem of slow growth in peasants' income? Deputy He Zhukang, secretary of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, believes that the key to increasing peasants' income lies in further improving the overall efficiency of agriculture, in addition to rendering supportive policies and state protection. Deputy Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, said: At present we should concentrate our efforts on solving four problems: First, we should strictly control the margin of increase in the prices of capital goods. Second, we should stabilize and develop grain and cotton production and develop a diversified rural economy. Third, we should coordinate well the relationship between input and output and implement as quickly as possible the central policy of emphatically aiding 500 major counties for commodity grain and 150 major counties for quality cotton. At the same time, we must increase input into agriculture, especially in the central and western regions where we should give some policy preferences. Fourth, handle well the relationship between the primary industry and the secondary and tertiary industries, consolidate and develop village and town enterprises, and vigorously develop the tertiary industry.
