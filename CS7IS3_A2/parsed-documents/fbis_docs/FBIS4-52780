FBIS4-52780 "dreas093_l_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 10 May 1994 Philippines Police Urge Caution for Communist Hit-List Targets Police Urge Caution for Communist Hit-List Targets BK1305045494 Quezon City MALAYA in English 10 May 94 pp 1, 3 BK1305045494 Quezon City MALAYA English BFN [Text] All persons who appear in the Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB] hit list, including eight generals and government officials, had better watch closely their backs. Director Agerico Kagaoan, PNP [Philippine National Police] operations director, said the communist urban terrorist group is "very active" and determined to pursue its "mission" to liquidate people it perceives to have committed "crimes against people." Last Saturday, gunmen killed dismissed Chief Inspector Timoteo Zarcal in front of his residence in Felix Huertas, Sta. [Santa--Holy] Cruz, Manila. Hours later, the ABB through Felimon Lagman, chief of the Manila-Rizal Party Committee, a breakaway faction from the Communist Party of the Philippines, admitted responsibility. Zarcal was ninth on the ABB hit list. Despite the ABB admission, Kagaoan said probers have not counted out other suspects. Chief Inspector Jose Pring said Sunday Zarcal could have been killed by his detractors who were only using the ABB to mislead investigators. Pring and Zarcal were arrested last year at the house of Vice President Joseph Estrada on charges of kidnapping Chinese-Filipinos. Though acquitted last month by a Pasig court, they were included in the ABB hit list released last 16 January. Also on the list are 98 police and military personnel and at least 170 government officials and several civilians, including movie personalities, businessmen, and suspected drug lords for liquidation. The police officers include former PNP Director General Cesar Nazareno; Director Vicente Vinarao, chief of the National Penitentiary; Director Manuel Roxas, Bureau of Immigration and Deportation commissioner; PNP Deputy Director General Gerry Flores; Chief Superintendent Dictador Alqueza, former Regional Command 11 director; Director Marino Filart, former Capcom [Capital Command] chief; Maj. Gen. (ret.) Ramon Montano, presidential consultant for police affairs; Chief Supt. (ret.) Ernesto Diokno, former WPDC [Western Police District Command] chief. The list also includes Speaker Jose de Venecia, former Councilor and cager Abe King, and movie producer Cheng Muhlach. The ABB said the personalities were involved in graft and corruption, drug pushing, prostitution, and kidnap-for-ransom cases. Last month, suspected ABB members gunned down Isidro Florentino, father of Allan Florentino, a suspect in the rape-slay of Rosielyn Federico, a fastfood employee.
