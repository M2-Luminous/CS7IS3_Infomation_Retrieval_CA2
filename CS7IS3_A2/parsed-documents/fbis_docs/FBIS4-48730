After about a five-day break, the Angolan peace talks exercise has resumed here in Lusaka with the magic wand of mediator Alioune Blondin Beye in operation. All Zambian holidays are strictly observed by Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola. Today he broke the tradition, however, by receiving in his apartment this afternoon the negotiating team from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which had returned from Huambo today. Although nothing concrete is known about the meeting, it is thought that the UNITA men briefed Alioune Blondin Beye on the results obtained in their meetings with their leadership on negotiations with the government here in Lusaka. Sources close to the mediator told Luanda Radio Nacional that it is hoped that delegations from the government and UNITA will meet alone tomorrow. The source added, however, that everything will depend on Malian-born Alioune Blondin Beye who will certainly try to use an effective tactic to speed up the negotiating process. The Angolan peace process mediator is meanwhile working on his report to be sent to the meeting of the UN Security Council in New York set for 31 May. The government delegation is all set for talks. The issues under discussion, within the framework of national reconciliation, are the future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel; special status for Jonas Savimbi; his security and the security of senior UNITA officials; and UNITA's participation in the government.
