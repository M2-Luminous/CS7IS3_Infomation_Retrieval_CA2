He said: [Begin Pawlak recording] I think this is not just the issue of Partnership for Peace but also a matter of the association with the European Union. Apart from the issue of security, political, military, and economic matters, partnership for development is also very important, and so is looking for forms of cooperation that would give Poland an opportunity for cooperation with the European Union as a partner. I think this is a fundamental condition, particularly because security issues may be a problem in the future, while economic problems are a problem today and should be solved today.
