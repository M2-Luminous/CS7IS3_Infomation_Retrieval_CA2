The revisions are proposed in order to make the rules easier to understand, eliminate outdated rules and unnecessary information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, and allow licensees greater flexibility in providing service to the public. Generally, the collected information is used to determine the legal and technical qualifications of the respondents. Regulatory Flexibility Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Commission's initial regulatory flexibility analysis follows: Reason for Action and Objective The Commission is proposing to revise title 47, part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations to eliminate unnecessary information collection requirements and, whenever possible, provide greater flexibility to carriers while at the same time promoting the public interest. The objective of this proposal is to provide effective and adaptive regulation for communications. Legal Basis Authority for this further notice is contained in sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(r). Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements The proposed rules would not significantly change the existing reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements. In the case of required map filings, for example, the proposal merely changes the scale of the map filed. Several new requirements are proposed. For example, one of the proposed new rules would require that cellular licensees submit information for each of their external cell sites. Another proposed rule would require that applicants for 931 MHz paging service request specific frequencies in their applications. Federal Rules That Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules None. Description, Potential Impact and Number of Small Entities Affected There are approximately 8,600 licensees subject to the rules in part 22. A substantial portion of these are small entities. There are also a number of small entities whose business is consulting or providing other services in connection with part 22. The proposed further notice would not significantly impact these small entities. Significant Alternatives Minimizing Impact on Small Entities and Consistent With States Objectives The proposals contained in this Further Notice are meant to simplify and ease the regulatory burden on all Public Mobile Services applicants and licensees consistent with the Commission's established public interest objectives. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration will be served with a copy of this Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in accordance with section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
