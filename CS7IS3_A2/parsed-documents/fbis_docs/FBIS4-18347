President Rauf Denktas described this provocative act by the Greek Cypriot Administration as an effort to create suspicion against the Turkish Cypriots and fear against Turkey, and then to build on that. The president charged that the Greek Cypriots never wanted the confidence-building measures [CBM's] in the first place, but try to blame the Turkish Cypriots and claim it is the Turkish Cypriots who do not want them. He said: Unless the Greek Cypriots remember that they started the Cyprus problem in the first place, and that the only thing they think of is to usurp the rights of the Turkish Cypriots, they will not find the right path. The Greek Cypriot radio reported this morning that the Greek Cypriot National Guard took additional measures along the confrontation line. The Greek Cypriot Administration is waging a campaign to blame the Turkish Cypriots for the lack of progress in the talks on the implementation of the CBM's. This latest decision is another dangerous link in that campaign. The Greek Cypriot radio said that the Greek Cypriot National Guardsmen were instructed to be very careful. As a pretext for this provocative act, the Greek Cypriot Administration alleged that the Turkish Cypriots took additional measures along the border.
