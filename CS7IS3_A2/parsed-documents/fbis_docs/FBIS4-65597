A spokesman for the UN agency said the three inspectors had got down to their week-long assignment but he refused to provide details. North Korea said over the weekend that it had already begun replacing spent fuel rods from a reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang. The inspectors are pressing to check the rods to see if fissile material has been diverted to make a nuclear weapon. North Korea denies having a nuclear weapons program. [passage omitted] The IAEA says the operation could take a few months.
