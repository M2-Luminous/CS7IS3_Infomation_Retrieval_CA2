Recalling the declaration of the South Korean authorities that they would stage massive joint military exercises under a changed codename, instead of the "Team Spirit," he said: "This is aimed at putting a spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-U.S. talks and laying a new high hurdle in the solution of the nuclear issue. If they stage the war game, the suspension of the `Team Spirit' nuclear war exercises will practically be meaningless and a more dangerous situation will be created in Korea." "The South Korean authorities must clearly know that if they continue to pursue confrontation and war, turning their back on the compatriots desirous of reconciliation and unity, detente and peace, they will face a stern judgment by the nation, sooner or later," he warned.
