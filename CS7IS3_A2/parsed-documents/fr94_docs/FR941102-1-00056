FR941102-1-00056 FR941102-1-00015 §68.308 [Amended] 6. Section 68.308 is proposed to be amended by revising in the table following paragraph (b)(5) the heading ``Public Switched Network Ports (2-Wire)'' to read ``Public Switched Network Ports (2-Wire) and Enhanced 911 Trunks''. 7. Section 68.320 is proposed to be added to read as follows: §68.320 Enhanced 911 compatibility: technical standards. (a) Trunk interface. Enhanced 911 trunks are analog two-wire or four-wire channels supporting either E&M type 1 or E&M type 3 signaling. (b) Station number identification signaling. The station number identification (SNI) code assigned to the emergency response location of a 911 caller will be sent from the registered equipment to the telephone company 911 system using multifrequency (MF) tone pulses, prompted by a solid off-hook indication from the telephone network. (c) Operability. It shall be possible to access the Enhanced 911 trunk in emergencies whether or not system features are used that block access to normal dial trunks ( i.e., restriction of all calls beginning with ``9''). Access shall be provided whether users dial 911 or additional digits preceding 911. (d) Equipment levels. The minimum number of Enhanced 911 emergency services trunks connecting a private switch to the telephone network shall be one (1). Additional trunks may be used at the user's option. Additional trunks shall be added to maintain an availability of P=0.01 based on the number of users served. (e) Attendant notification. Equipment manufactured or imported after [one year after the effective date of the order adopting rules in this proceeding], or installed after [18 months after the effective date of the order adopting rules in this proceeding], must be capable of notifying an attendant or on-premises personnel, if present, and of providing station number identification and emergency response location to the attendant when a 911 call is dialed. (f) Information requirements. Equipment manufactured or imported after [one year after the effective date of the order adopting rules in this proceeding], or installed after [18 months after the effective date of the order adopting rules in this proceeding], must have the capability to provide the caller's station number identification, caller location identification, and call-back number to PSAP personnel. (g) Labeling requirements. PBX and dispersed telephone systems manufactured or imported one year from [the effective date of the final rule] shall comply with this section. Equipment of earlier manufacture shall comply with this section if installed [18 months from the effective date of the section] or any time thereafter. Such equipment must be reregistered by the manufacturer or other person responsible for equipment compliance with part 68, if already registered but not compliant with §68.320. PBX equipment and associated station equipment that is domestically manufactured or imported on or after [30 days, but not later than one year, from the effective date of the order adopting rules in this proceeding] that does not comply with §68.320 must be labelled by the manufacturer with a warning describing its limitations for those attempting to use it to call enhanced 911. The warning must appear on the devices and on the outside of the packaging in which it is marketed. The domestic manufacture or importation of PBX equipment that does not comply with §68.320 must cease as of one year from [the effective date of the final rule]. Federal Communications Commission.
