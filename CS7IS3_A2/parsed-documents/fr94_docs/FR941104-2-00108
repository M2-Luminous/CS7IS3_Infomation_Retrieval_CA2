By Commission order dated November 21, 1989 (HCAR No. 24988), National was authorized, among other things, to issue and deliver from time-to-time up to one million shares of its authorized but unissued common stock, $1.00 par value (``Additional Common Stock''), to the trustee of its two qualified 401(k) plans, in lieu of the required matching cash contributions. The two plans are the National Fuel Gas Company Tax-Deferred Savings Plan (``TDSP'') and the National Fuel Gas Company Tax-Deferred Savings Plan for Non-union Employees (``Non-union TDSP'') (together, ``Plans''). As of September 30, 1994, 508,000 shares had been issued to the Plans. National now proposes to increase the total number of shares of Additional Common Stock that it may issue and deliver to Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company (``Vanguard''), trustee for the Plans, to two million shares including the previously issued shares, but no more than one million shares to the TDSP and Non-union TDSP, respectively. National further proposes to extend the time in which it may issue and deliver the Additional Common Stock through December 31, 1999. National states that any Additional Common Stock delivered to Vanguard will be valued at fair market value. Fair market value, as defined in the Plans, is the average of the high and low market price for National's Common Stock on the date on which the Additional Common Stock is issued.
