"Boris Yeltsin believes six to seven months is needed" to make a decision, Kostikov said at a Kremlin news conference. "The president will not be rushed, he will discuss the matter with all political parties." Russian and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) officials had previously indicated that Russia would join the program, known as Partnership for Peace, in April. "Russia's interests must be preserved," Kostikov said, adding that "dangers exist" to Russia's membership in the program, which extends a cooperative link from NATO to its former east bloc adversaries. Kostikov said that "many people" in Russia supported membership in the NATO program, notably officials in the foreign ministry, the Defense Ministry and the federal counterespionage service. "But there are arguments against (joining) that must be taken into account," Kostikov said. He said that in particular "one of the documents" involved in Russia's membership in the partnership program "does not correspond to Russia's interests." Kostikov did not specify what document this was, but he stressed that an agreement on trade of Russian-made weapons "needs to be reviewed." Arguments in favor of joining the program focused on closer cooperation with the West and maintaining high efficiency of the Russian Armed Forces comparable to Western levels. Vladimir Lukin, the former Russian ambassador to Washington who now leads a pro-reform faction in parliament, earlier outlined seven questions which he said must be answered before Moscow could sign on to the Partnership scheme. Those questions included how responsibilities were to be divided between member nations, how decisions were to be made, implications for military ties between the former Soviet republics, standardization of military hardware and how Russia was to finance its membership in the scheme. "The answer to these questions is indispensable for a decision to be made on whether Russia will take part in the program," Lukin said at a news conference. He stressed however that he was not necessarily opposed to Russia joining the partnership program, but noted that "long talks" with the NATO countries that proposed the plan were needed before Russia could make a decision. In Warsaw, meanwhile, Polish Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk cast doubt on Moscow's sincerity in wanting to join the Partnership for Peace, suggesting the Russian leadership had political reasons for doing so. "I think I am right in wondering if it is not just an expedient gesture," he told a press conference. "Russia looks like a besieged fortress. It is a self-isolation which helps them with their domestic political games." He said Russian membership would be "a positive thing," adding that "the more secure and stable Russia is, the more secure Europe can feel." "We hope admission to the Partnership for Peace will make Russia treat us as partners, and that they will at last understand that we are no longer their underlings," he said.
