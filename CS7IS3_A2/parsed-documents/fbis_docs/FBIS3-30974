Unfortunately, the miners at these mines are still on strike. Meanwhile, as Romuald Boszko, press spokesman of the protest staff at the JSW, has reported, the signing of this accord has no significance with regard to the course of the strike. The strike is directed, the press spokesman stressed, by the protest staff, the composition of which does not include the ZZGwP. The protest staff, on the other hand, does include three other trade unions: Kontra, Solidarity, and Solidarity '80. The dispatcher at the State Hard Coal Agency in Katowice has confirmed that the work forces have not commenced work at any of the JSW mines. Beginning at 1500 today, additional talks will take place with the protesting miners at the provisional headquarters of the JSW. As we discovered at the board of the company, a consensus has been reached on 95 percent of the proposals. There is still a lack of accord with regard to compensation for the time spent on strike.
