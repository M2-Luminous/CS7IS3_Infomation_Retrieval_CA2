Diplomatic sources have told MENA that the current brief visit to Cairo by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's political adviser Jacques Neriya, comes within these accelerated contacts. 'Arafat categorically rejected a meeting in Cairo with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at Peres' request. MENA has learned that the visiting Israeli envoy is carrying a proposal to hold an urgent meeting in Cairo or Washington between 'Arafat and Rabin to reach a formula for an agreement to resume the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. The agency has also learned that the Israeli side is willing to implement the Gaza-Jericho Agreement within three weeks from the conclusion of negotiations in this connection. The Egyptians and Palestinians are making contacts with the United States in its capacity as a sponsor of the peace process to guarantee the safety of the Palestinian people and work out a new basis for negotiations in the stage to come. Official Palestinian sources have told MENA that no meeting between 'Arafat and Peres is acceptable right now and under the current circumstances, especially as the Palestinian people are worried and lack confidence in the Israeli Government's promises. Diplomatic sources told MENA that in light of the Palestinians' refusal to meet with Peres, Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, current chairman of the EU's Ministerial Council, has requested an urgent meeting with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. In that meeting, held at Cairo Airport, Papoulias handed 'Arafat Israeli proposals aiming to overcome the obstacles facing the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations. The Palestinian side, MENA learned, rejected the Israeli proposals, which aim to reach a bilateral deal sidestepping the UN Security Council. The Israeli proposals are in line with the policy approved by the Israeli cabinet in its 27 February session. The main features of this policy are: - Emptying the Hebron area of settlers. - Forming a committee of inquiry into the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. - Taking tougher measures against "some" extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank, such as: a. The institution of administrative detention. b. The imposition of military restrictions and control on the movement of some extremists into the West Bank, particularly Hebron. c. The cancellation of the gun licenses of some extremist Israeli settlers and their disarmament. d. The Israeli Government's legal adviser is to examine the possibility of outlawing the Kakh and Kahane groups. e. The release of 1,000 Palestinian detainees. Eight hundred were released last week. The Israeli Government also decided to pay compensation for the families of the victims of the Hebron massacre. According to the same diplomatic sources, the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron has created a new reality necessitating a new form of dealing and communication between the Palestinians and the Israelis. The Israelis, for their part, are still trying to prevent the condemnation of the massacre by the UN Security Council. According to these sources, Rabin maintains that he cannot control the domestic situation in Israel in view of the fragility of the current coalition. It is worth noting that a wave of anger swept through Israel following the massacre. The Palestinians, meanwhile, insist on international protection of Palestinians living in the occupied territories. Such protection, the Palestinians say, can be provided through the deployment of international observes working either under a mandate from the UN Security Council or a Palestinian-Israeli agreement. Such agreement would specify the number and nationalities of the observers, along the line of the existing agreement between Egypt and Israel. The Palestinians also insist that all Palestinian detainees in Israel be promptly released. They note that the Palestinian need for security guarantees matches that of the settlers. It is worth noting that 9,400 Palestinians are in Israeli jails and detention camps, in accordance with the latest Red Cross count. The Palestinians also seek improved living conditions for the Palestinians living in the occupied territories until the implementation of the self-rule agreement.
