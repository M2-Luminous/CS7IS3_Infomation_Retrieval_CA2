Kebich signed a secret Cabinet of Ministers resolution "On Ensuring the Secrecy Regime on the Territory of the Belarusian Republic." Through unofficial sources, SVABODA has secured a copy of this document. We quote: "The Cabinet of Ministers resolves that before the Supreme Soviet, a legal act regulating issues related to protecting state secrets, government institutions, organizations, and economic entities should comply with instructions on ensuring the secrecy regime in ministries, institutions, enterprises, and organizations of the USSR, approved by the USSR Council of Ministers on 12 May 1987." We know that the Cabinet of Ministers tried but failed to draft its own instructions. It is not clear whether the reason was shortage of time or brains... So they decided to reinstate the Soviet secrecy regime, which was proven by practice. According to a SVABODA correspondent, this 60-page document was written by Comrade Kryuchkov, former chief of the Soviet KGB. The document is perfect. In compliance with it, information on, for example, the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster was kept secret.
