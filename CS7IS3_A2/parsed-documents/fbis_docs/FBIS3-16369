They discussed the seriousness of the situation which has taken shape in the defense industry and adopted an appeal to the government in connection with the draft state budget for 1994. The tangle of problems here seems already to have exceeded its critical mass. As is known, the first state budget drafting stage ended with the government adopting a "compromise" version. It is already clear, however, that this "compromise" will not bring appeasement but will merely increase the intensity of the struggle in parliament. Many specialists doubt the possibility of keeping the budget deficit below 10 percent (61.5 trillion rubles [R]) and reducing the average monthly rate of inflation to 5-7 percent by the end of 1994. The reluctance to improve the tax system and the exhaustion of other sources of budget revenues are just a few of the reasons for this. This is why the drastic cutting of the expenditure part from R237 trillion to R182 trillion only appears to confirm the resoluteness of the government's aspirations but does not actually do so. Such a budget will hardly be implemented. What, then, will happen? Sectors and regions that have adapted to the market will find nonbudgetary money and will extricate themselves from the 1994 noose by redistributing financial resources. Only budget-funded organizations will be unable to do this -- i.e., the defense enterprises again, for which the draft budget has prepared "tertiary conversion," which is certainly the last conversion and which they will not withstand. It will clearly be impossible to fit the defense industry into "Trishka's coat," even if we were to call on the assistance of the most skilled masters. For it is impossible to finance the 5,000 research and development tasks currently under way with the present R3.5 trillion. Even if we cut all the longer-term tasks, leaving specific ones relating to new models of weapons (there are approximately 600 of these), this sum will suffice only for about 10 particularly important ones on whose completion the country's strategic security depends. Together with the sum allocated to purchasing VVT [expansion unknown], the planned budget appropriations can provide approximately 300,000 people with work. (In the United States the military sector of the economy has 3 million employees.) This is tantamount to the defense industry's final degradation. As a result, the capacities left unloaded will, at best, be gradually "assimilated" into civilian industry or, most likely, will come to a halt altogether, and specialists estimate that approximately 15 million people will move from the sphere of physical production to the position of unemployed or partially unemployed people. On behalf of the military-industrial complex enterprise leaders and the chairmen of trade unions and labor collective councils, A. Shulunov, president of the Defense Enterprises Assistance League, and A. Breusov, chairman of the Association of Trade Unions of Defense Sectors of Industry, put a proposal to the government to take immediate measures to ensure the efficiency of the credit-financial system, and to take control of structural transformations in industry by amending the present statute with the formation of financial-industrial groups. Within the very near future, the appeal states, it is necessary to approve Russia's defense program and adopt the Russian Federation Law "On Military Production," as well as a new version of the Law "On Conversion."
