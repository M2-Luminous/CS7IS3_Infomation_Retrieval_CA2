Can you hear me? [Dipico] I can hear you. [Announcer] How are you? [Dipico] OK. I'm fine. [Announcer] How are things going that side? [Dipico] Things are pretty calm. Eerybody is out in the street. They have not got the...[pauses] They are looking first at the TVs, and they are looking to the radios, they are awaiting the final results. No one wants to jump out and open the champagne bottles before the final results are announced. So, I can tell you there is excitement in the air, but no one wants to open it up. [Announcer] But what is the feeling of your party at the moment? [Dipico] The feeling of our party is that we feel extremely honored. Our people, to go out in their thousands to vote, and endured hardships, and exercised patience from the 26th to the 28th, and standing in long rows of queues for hours to cast their votes for the first time. And we thank them very much. They have shown tolerance, they have shown that they are prepared to work together to be able to achieve a very stable province, and to be able to deal with issues which are going to affect their daily lives, in particular their basic needs, which are of importance, particularly in our province because it is really not developed. [Announcer] Manne, the fight here is for the colored vote. Do you think your party has done enough? [Dipico] The results actually put it very clear to you that the majority of our voters in the Province of the Northern Cape are coloreds, which clearly put a point and a message across that our people will never be fooled by all those who have been going around that the colored community vote NP [National Party], or the colored does not trust the ANC. It is a clear message that our people know who are the right leaders. They know which are the organizations which they can trust their lives on. And the message of the results of the Northern Cape clearly demonstrates that our people, even in the colored community, wanted a change, and a change for a better future, and the ANC can provide that. They have put their confidence in the hands of the ANC, in the hands of the leadership, which is tested and proven from Mandela up to the provincial leadership. [Announcer] Thank you very much. [Dipico] Thank you very much.
