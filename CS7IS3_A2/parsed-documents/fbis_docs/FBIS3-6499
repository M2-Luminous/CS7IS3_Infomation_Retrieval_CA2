"Visits to these countries are not only for security reasons but also to strengthen economic cooperation to beat off the competition," Kim told top-grade graduates of 126 universities and their parents whom he invited over for lunch. Government officials say it is yet to be decided when Kim will visit Russia, but a likely date is around June. A European tour timed with his visit to Russia is also being considered, they say.
