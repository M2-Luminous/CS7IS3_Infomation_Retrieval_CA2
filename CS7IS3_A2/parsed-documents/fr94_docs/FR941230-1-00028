FR941230-1-00028 FR941230-1-00004 (9) Research agreements. As provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an agreement by a nongovernmental person to sponsor research performed by a governmental person may result in use of the related property for purposes of the private business use test. (10) Other actual or beneficial use. For purposes of the private business use test, use includes any other actual or beneficial use of a financed facility other than use as a member of the general public (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section). (c) Qualified management contracts _(1) In general. A management contract is a qualified management contract if it meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section. See also paragraphs (c)(5) and (e) of this section for de minimis exceptions. (2) General compensation requirements. The contract must provide for reasonable compensation for services rendered with no compensation based, in whole or in part, on a share of net profits from the operation of the facility. Reimbursement of the service provider for actual and direct expenses paid by the service provider to unrelated parties is not by itself treated as compensation. (i) Compensation based on (A) a percentage of gross revenues (or adjusted gross revenues) of a facility or a percentage of expenses from a facility, but not both, (B) a capitation fee, or (C) a per-unit fee is generally not considered to be based on a share of net profits. (ii) Similarly, a productivity reward equal to a stated dollar amount based on increases or decreases in gross revenues, reductions in total expenses, but not both, generally does not cause the compensation to be based on a share of net profits. (3) Permissible arrangements. The management contract must be described in paragraph (c)(3)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section.
