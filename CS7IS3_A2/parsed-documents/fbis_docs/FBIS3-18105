Armed with these calculations, the party leaders are hurling abuse at one another. But what is it all about? Employment, wages, or the environment? Which is the most social party? And who is leading the field? VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] leader Bolkestein: "The voter is nobody's fool." [passage omitted] The VVD leader aims his attacks at the report which Lubbers and Kok submitted to the Parliament yesterday. This contains details of the government's decision to reduce the tax burden by five billion guilders. "What a mess. It brings chaos to public funds," states Bolkestein. "The report states that the country's financial debt will amount to 3.75 percent of the national income in 1996." The VVD leader throws up his hands: "3.75 percent, that is the percentage which the government had promised for 1993. This year it was supposed to fall to 3.25 percent. What a muddle." The opposition leader could challenge Lubbers and Kok to a debate in Parliament, but he is not going to. "First things first. First the local elections." "The debt must be further reduced," argues Bolkestein. "This government is not doing anything any more. The future offers little hope. The CDA [Christian Democrat Appeal] is letting the debt increase over the next three years. Mind you, they are behind the other parties in the polls, including the Green Left. The CDA reasons that they will make up for it at the end. Any politician knows that it doesn't work like that. You can see this now. This government has reduced the debt, but has allowed the tax burden to increase by an amount which is greater than the fall in the public debt. I could do that too. There's nothing clever about that." An expected tax gift of 3.3 billion guilders in 1994, rising to 4.5 billion in 1995, is described by Bolkestein as "hot air." Seeing is believing, is the VVD leader's reaction. You must be careful, and first do your homework, says Bolkestein. "Why is Kok getting involved in this, perhaps he is going to be mayor of Amsterdam during the next government." [NRC HANDELSBLAD] At an election meeting in Westzaan the CDA leader Brinkman seemed pleased. The CPB had calculated that pensioners lose more under the VVD than the CDA. While the VVD links pensions to wages and the CDA doesn't. [Bolkestein] I don't know of any purchasing power outlines drawn up by the CPB which have ever proved to be correct. We have made the decision in principle that pensions would follow trends in prosperity. This means that the purchasing power of pensioners may fall. But if wages suddenly increase, pensioners benefit with us. But not with the CDA. What are we talking about here? The CPB calculates the difference in the purchasing power of pensioners between the VVD and CDA as one quarter of one percent per year. We must stop this purchasing power talk. [passage omitted] [NRC HANDELSBLAD] For new registrations, the VVD wants social security payments to be limited to 60 percent of the minimum wage. Unemployment benefit is also to drop to 60 percent of the minimum wage, while people cannot take out additional insurance against unemployment? [Bolkestein] I do not know how the market is going to react. Insurance products will no doubt be created, and the Planning Bureau is also taking this into account. But I do not pretend that it is always going to be easy. But do we want a flexible labor market or not? If you do, then you must provide financial incentives. A more dynamic economy is not achieved all by itself. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] You have people who are on benefit payments bear all the burden. PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok is proposing that benefits should be linked to a limited degree by as early as next year. [Bolkestein] The linkage idea is at odds with economic growth. Linkage destroys jobs. Everybody knows that. So when Kok says that "next year we can perhaps have some linkage" he is only doing himself harm. He also wants job growth. We must move toward a more flexible economy. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Is the VVD program socially acceptable? [Bolkestein] And what do you mean by "socially acceptable?" It is all a matter of action versus inaction. We choose for a growth in employment, with 124,000 new jobs. Under the VVD program in 1998 there will be 80 people on benefit for every 100 people with a job. With all the other parties this figure is higher. Our policy shows that it is perfectly easy to solve, but it is being made extremely complicated by many people in this country -- and especially Lubbers. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Politics aside, The Hague is no basis for your ideas in the social sphere. [BOLKESTEIN] The basis is determined by one fact alone, and that is a parliamentary majority. How representative is the trade union movement, for example, when it represents just one quarter of workers? The government must govern, and then you have a basis. When Lubber forcefully states that we are facing a new reality from Asia, East Europe and the United States -- in short, more competition -- than the people will act. Then you have the choice between superficial change and a change to the system. We choose for a change to the system. The voter is nobody's fool; people can say what they like.
