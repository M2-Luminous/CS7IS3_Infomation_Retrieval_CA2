FBIS4-14249 "drnes082_l_94001" FBIS-NES-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Peres on Golan Withdrawal, Peace With Syria Peres on Golan Withdrawal, Peace With Syria TA2604202194 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew 1830 GMT 26 Apr 94 TA2604202194 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew 1830 GMT 26 Apr 94 Hebrew BFN [Interview and public phone-in with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Nisim Mish'al in the studio on the weekly "Conference Call" program -- live] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Unidentified caller] The press reports that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has advised the prime minister against a full withdraw from the Golan Heights, while the prime minister declared he is willing to fully withdraw in return for full peace with Syria. In 1973, the chief of staff advised the cabinet to call up the reserves and, regrettably, the government decided otherwise, though the price was different. In view of this, does the foreign minister not think that maybe we should take the IDF estimate that we should not withdraw from the Golan Heights more seriously? [Peres] Allow me first to correct you. The prime minister never said he favors a full withdrawal from the Golan. He said that the depth of withdrawal will match the depth of peace, but he did not say that we want full withdrawal. There are two questions here: one is military and regards the General Staff, the other is political and regards the government. The Army was asked how can we win a war -- that is, should we hold on to another mountain, which is reasonable. The government is asked how to prevent a war. Let me ask you, which is more important -- winning a war or preventing it? To prevent war, you need to attain peace. Hence, the question is not whether or not to get off the Golan Heights but how to attain peace. You should honestly ask yourself: Can we attain peace with Syria while holding on to the Golan Heights? If you want the State of Israel to live from one war to another while always thinking about how to win the next one, what kind of security is this? In terms of security, peace is an asset more important than army deployment. Peace is a weapon which protects Israel's security. [Mish'al] Mr. Peres, let us review your stands on the issue of the Golan: You are for removing settlements from the Golan, as the prime minister said, and you are for ceding the Golan in return for a peace agreement. If so, what is there left to negotiate; the duration of the withdrawal? [Peres] I never said I am for relinquishing, or even for saying I am for relinquishing, the entire Golan Heights. [Mish'al] You are not for it? [Peres] I am not for saying it. There are many questions that I have asked, and I am not willing to give answers regarding Israel before receiving answers that concern Israel. [Mish'al] Excuse me, Mr. Peres, the press carry daily reports in which you and Mr. Rabin announce concessions on the Golan Heights, declare evacuation of settlements. Where else did the Israeli public get this idea from? [Peres] This will not work. You will not mislead me. Let me tell you this: We say that we are willing to make concessions on the Golan in order to reach peace with Syria. It is clear to us that if we cede parts of the Golan Heights -- and I am not referring to their size at this time -- no settlements will remain there. The one follows from the other. I believe in saying the truth. The time has come to stop pretending. [Mish'al] Please, say the truth. [Peres] I am. I believe that attaining a comprehensive peace arrangement with Syria, including the Golan Heights, calls for the attainment of several goals: I want this to be the last agreement with the Arab world -- that is, after it is signed, the Arab world will no longer boycott us, threaten us, or be in a state of war with us. Al-Asad claims he is the leader of the Arab world. This is the last peak over which we haggle. I want this to be the last war we discuss. [Mish'al] But while you attempt to conquer this peak, you, Mr. Rabin, in fact the entire Israeli Government, announce a willingness to make concessions. At the same time, we have not heard anything from al-Asad. [Peres] Why are you worried? If he makes no concessions, there will be no agreement. Why are you so worried? [Mish'al] You, who are negotiating with him, should be worried. [Peres] I am not worried. In general, we are talking as if this is some ball. Everyone knows we have an agreement with Egypt, and that this agreement was signed by a person who said he will never give up the Sinai and he gave up on the entire Sinai, thus setting a precedent. [Mish'al] But there was a slight difference: Al-Sadat announced he is ready to come to Jerusalem and address the Israeli nation and the Knesset and announce his willingness to make peace. [Peres] I am all for al-Asad doing the same thing. [Mish'al] Only he does not want to. [Peres] We have no peace yet. Also, this is why we have no agreement. I say that peace with Syria should be accompanied by two types of agreements: A comprehensive peace between the states and a thorough peace in terms of the issues, including the strategic, tactical, and economic issues. This time, we want a comprehensive peace. We do want an open wound. We want real and comprehensive peace. We know the price; we know it is painful; I do not have to announce it at the beginning of the negotiations. [passage omitted]
