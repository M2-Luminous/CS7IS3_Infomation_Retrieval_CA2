FR940620-0-00165 FR940620-0-00030 Monday June 20, 1994 Part V Department of Transportation Research and Special Programs Administration 49 CFR Part 172 Hazardous Substances; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 117␣/␣Monday, June 20, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Research and Special Programs Administration 49 CFR Part 172 [Docket No. HM&hyph;145J; Amdt No. 172&hyph;135] RIN 2137&hyph;AA56 Hazardous Substances AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this final rule, RSPA is amending the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) by revising the ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities'' which appears in an Appendix to the hazardous materials table. This action is necessary to comply with the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, which amended the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to mandate that RSPA regulate, under the HMR, all hazardous substances designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The intended effect of this action is to enable shippers and carriers to identify CERCLA hazardous substances, thereby enabling them to comply with all applicable HMR requirements and to make the required notifications if a discharge of a hazardous substance occurs. DATES: This amendment is effective August 29, 1994. However, immediate compliance with the regulations as amended herein is authorized. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John A. Gale (202) 366&hyph;8553, Office of Hazardous Materials Standards, or George Cushmac (202) 366&hyph;4545, Office of Hazardous Materials Technology, RSPA, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. Questions about hazardous substance designations or reportable quantities should be directed to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Call the RCRA/Superfund hotline at (800) 424&hyph;9346 or, in Washington, DC, (202) 382&hyph;3000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 202 of SARA (Pub. L. 99&hyph;499) amended Section 306(a) of CERCLA (Pub. L. 96&hyph;510), 42 U.S.C. 9656(a), by requiring the Secretary of Transportation to list and regulate hazardous substances, listed or designated under Section 101(14) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9601(14), as hazardous materials under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA; 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). RSPA carries out the rulemaking responsibilities of the Secretary of Transportation under the HMTA. 49 CFR 1.53(b). This final rule is necessary to comply with 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) as amended by Section 202 of SARA. In carrying out that statutory mandate, RSPA has no discretion to determine what is or is not a hazardous substance or the appropriate reportable quantity (RQ) for materials designated as hazardous substances. This authority is vested in EPA. Therefore, under the CERCLA scheme EPA must issue final rules amending the list of CERCLA hazardous substances, including adjusting RQ's, before RSPA can amend its list of hazardous substances. In the preamble to the final rule on this subject issued under Docket HM&hyph;145F (51 FR 42174; November 21, 1986), RSPA included the following statement: It is RSPA's intention to make changes from time to time to the list of hazardous substances or their RQ's in the Appendix as adjustments are made by EPA. This document adjusts the ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities'' that appears in Appendix A to §172.101, based on several final rules EPA has published. On November 2, 1990 (55 FR 46354), EPA published a final rule which added the waste codes F037 and F038 to the list of hazardous substances with RQ's of 1 pound. On December 6, 1990 (55 FR 50450), EPA published a final rule which added the waste codes FO32, F034, and F035 to the list of hazardous substances with RQ's of 1 pound. On August 18, 1992 (57 FR 37194), EPA published a final rule which added the waste codes K141, K142, K143, K144, K145, K147 and K148 to the list of hazardous substances with RQ's of 1 pound. On October 15, 1992 (57 FR 47376), EPA published a final rule which added the waste codes K149, K150 and K151 to the list of hazardous substances, with RQ's of 10 pounds. On June 30, 1993 (58 FR 35314), EPA published a final rule which revised the RQ for 34 hazardous substances. These substances include lead metal, 12 lead compounds, 15 waste streams that contain lead, characteristic wastes that fail the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure based on their lead constituents, and methyl isocyanate. The following table identifies those substances that have had their RQ's revised.
