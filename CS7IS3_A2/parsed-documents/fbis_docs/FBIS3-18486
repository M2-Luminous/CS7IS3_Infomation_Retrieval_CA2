FBIS3-18486 "drweu043__a94004" FBIS-WEU-94-043-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 March 1994 ANNEX Netherlands Far Right Reported To Win Municipal Elections BR0303130894 The Hague ANP in Dutch 2336 GMT 2 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR0303130894 The Hague ANP Language: Dutch Article Type:BFN [Article signed MTH: "Blows for CDA and PvdA, Gain of D66 Disappointing"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] [Text] The Hague -- All leaders of the major parties called the advance of the far right, the election result's main setback. In Amsterdam, the CDA [Center Democratic Appeal] climbed from 2 to 4 seats. In Rotterdam, the combined ultraright-wing parties will probably become the second largest movement, with a total of almost 14 percent. The CD has five councilors, CP '86 [Central Party 86] keeps its only present councilor. In Utrecht, Janmaat's party (CD) tripled, and has now three councilors. In addition, the city is witnessing the entry of the Dutch Block, headed by Janmaat's former companion Vreeswijk. In the Hague, the CD doubles its number of seats from 2 to 4, while CP'86 keeps its only present seat. A conversion to the consequences for the House of Representatives, is very precarious. First of all, the municipal elections are characterized by the phenomenon of local lists, secondly the turnout is generally higher for parliamentary elections, and a third uncertain factor is that, in local elections, the voter may vote for a well-known candidate of a different (national) party than in national elections. However, this does not alter the fact that municipal elections are generally considered to be a reliable poll for parliamentary elections. Converted to the House, the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] would take a dramatic plunge of 15 seats to only 39 seats. The PvdA [Labor Party] would also suffer a considerable loss, and would keep 32 of its present 49 seats. The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] would win six seats, and arrive at 28 seats. D66 [Democrats 66] would soar from 10 to 22 seats, Groenlinks [Green Left] would double its number of seats to 12. SGP [Political Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed Political Union] and RPF [Reformational Political Federation]) combined would climb from 6 to 11 seats. The CD would grow from its present one seat to 4. The SP [Socialist Party] would enter Parliament with 2 seats. The outcome of the municipal elections shows an almost terrifying correspondence with the latest poll conducted by Inter/view last Monday on behalf of Press Agency ANP and current affairs feature Nova. Considering a reliability margin of 1.5 percent for the major parties, the poll was perfectly correct. The only exception is the considerably lower gain for D66 (22 seats instead of the anticipated 28), which Inter/view failed to forecast. CDA's 39 seats correspond to the 38 forecasted on Monday. This is also true for PvdA's 32 seats (was 31). VVD's score of 28 was perfectly correct, as well as GroenLinks' 12. The CD's converted 4 seats were also exactly as forecasted.
