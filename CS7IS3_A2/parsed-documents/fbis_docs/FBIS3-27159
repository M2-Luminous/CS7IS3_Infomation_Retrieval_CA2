On a German radio program this morning, he said he was satisfied with the developments in Bosnia which have seen virtually all of the Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons either moved to a location 20 kilometers or more from Sarajevo or controlled by United Nations forces. But the German minister emphasized that the action was just a minor step towards future peace and added that fresh political talks should be resumed immediately. He also called for vigilance in case the weapons moved away from the Bosnian capital city appear in other war zones of the country. Kinkel expressed his hope that the progress achieved so far would turn out to be the start of a total solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict.
