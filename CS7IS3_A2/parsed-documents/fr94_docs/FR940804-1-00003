FR940804-1-00003 FR940804-1-00001 (1) More than 25 percent, the ARP shall not be less than 10 percent or more than 20 percent; or (2) Equal to or less than 25 percent, the ARP may not be more than 12.5 percent. The S/U for the 1994/95 marketing year is estimated to be 15.1 percent. Based on this estimate, the 1995 ARP may be not more than 12.5 percent. In the case of grain sorghum and barley, the Secretary may choose a 1995 ARP percentage in the range from 0 to 20 percent. For oats, the 1995 ARP is statutorily mandated not to exceed 0 percent. Section 1104 of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1990 provides that the acreage reduction factor for the 1995 crops of corn, grain sorghum, and barley may not be less than 7.5 percent unless the estimated corn S/U for the 1994/95 marketing year is less than 20 percent. Currently the S/U of corn for the 1993/94 corn marketing year is less than 20 percent. Thus, the minimum 7.5-percent-ARP provision is not currently applicable. The final ARP decision process could consider higher ARP percentages up to 20 percent if the S/U exceeds 25 percent. The ARP options included in this analysis are the most likely possibilities, based on May 1994 data. If ending stocks increase, due to weaker demand or higher than expected yields, and raise the S/U ratio to 25 percent or higher, ARP levels between 12.5 and 20 percent may be considered before a final decision is made. The 1995 ARP options considered are shown in table 1. Table 1._Proposed 1995 Feed Grain ARP Options 1Item 1Option 21 22 23 3 Percent 0 n,s Corn 0 5 12.5 Grain Sorghum 0 0 5 Barley 0 0 5 Oats 0 0 0 For grain sorghum and barley, ARP percentages higher than 5 percent are not considered because expected sorghum and barley S/U's are low compared with historical levels. The 1994/95 grain sorghum S/U is forecast at 20.1, which with the exceptions of 1991/92 and 1993/94, the lowest level since 1976/77 (17.3 percent). The 1994/95 barley S/U is forecast at 29.1, a level reached only one other time since 1974/75. ARP levels above 5 percent would limit supplies of barley and grain sorghum to the point of not allowing export and domestic needs to be met. However, ARP levels above 5 percent will be considered when making the final ARP decision if feed grain supply and demand changes are large enough to warrant their consideration. The estimated impacts of the ARP options are shown in tables 2 through 4.
