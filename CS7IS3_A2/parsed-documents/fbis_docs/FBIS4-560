FBIS4-560 "drafr071_b_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 EAST AFRICA Uganda Rwandan Shells Hit Southwest Areas; Border Calm Rwandan Shells Hit Southwest Areas; Border Calm EA1204163194 Nairobi KNA in English 1330 GMT 12 Apr 94 EA1204163194 Nairobi KNA English BFN [Text] Kampala, 12 Apr (KNA) -- Ugandan border villages in Ntungamo and Kabale districts came under attack from Rwandan troops on Sunday [10 April], the independent MONITOR newspaper reported Tuesday. Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda, works, transport and communications minister and National Resistance Council (NRC) (Parliament) member for Kabale Municipality, on Tuesday confirmed the shelling, but said he lacked details. "We don't have any specific details of the incident," he said. The state-owned NEW VISION newspaper said four artillery shells form the Rwandan hill of Muriha landed in Kamwezi in Kabale District on Sunday near the UN Military Observers' team [UN Observer Mission for Uganda and Rwanda -- UNOMUR] station. The shells from Rwandan Government troops currently engaged in a shoot out with the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) hit Kamwezi at midday, but caused no injury or damage to property. Increased fighting between the Armed Forces and the RPA has been reported since the death of Rwandan President Major General Juvenal Habyarimana in a plane crash on Wednesday. The situation along the Uganda-Rwanda border areas is, however, said to be calm, although World Food Program (WFP) relief supplies for Rwanda have been stuck in Uganda's border town of Kabale. The trucks were headed for Kigali and other turmoil-hit areas in the north of the country before the outbreak of the chaos in Rwanda. UNOMUR is meanwhile reported to have increased the frequency of its patrols across the border. When the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) invaded Rwanda from Uganda in 1990, Rwanda Government troops retaliated with artillery attacks. Rwanda has accused Uganda of active support for the RPF rebels. Meanwhile, hundreds of Rwandan civilians from the Ruhengeri region have continued to enter Uganda and Zaire as they flee the fighting between the RPF and government troops, THE NEW VISION reported. Reports from the border adjoining the three countries said civilians had not been directly affected by the fresh clashes between the two sides, but had been scared away by the sound of gunfire, which could be heard from a close range. In spite the growing chaos in the troubled state, a number of Rwandan refugees have continued to enter Rwanda through safe areas under the RPA after leaving camps in Uganda. A lorry full of refugees was reportedly seen crossing into Rwanda through an unofficial entry point on Sunday.
