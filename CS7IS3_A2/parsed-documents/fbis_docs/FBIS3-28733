FBIS3-28733 "dreas028__a94010" FBIS-EAS-94-028-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Mondale Called `Astute', `Powerful' U.S. Envoy OW0902070394 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 8 Feb 93 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0902070394 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article] [Text] Amid the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the attitude adopted by Walter Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan for five months now, has become a popular topic of discussion among quarters concerned with Japan-U.S. relations. Unlike former Ambassador Michael Armacost, dubbed "Mr. Gaiatsu [Foreign Pressure]," while Mondale has done nothing astounding, "he applies pressure through legitimate channels, using his extensive personal connections (both in Japan and the United States)" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). Thus, he also proves to be a formidable foe. Mondale, who served in the U.S. Senate for 12 years, was a vice president, and also a Democratic presidential candidate, took office in September 1993 as the second politician-ambassador after former Ambassador Mike Mansfield. Since then, he has held talks energetically with the heads and influential members of all political parties, except the Japan Communist Party, and executives of various economic organizations and U.S. companies in Japan. In late January, in a speech at a gathering organized by the Kansai Federation of Economic Organizations, he argued for the need to reach an agreement in the framework talks with the Japan-U.S. summit meeting close at hand on 11 February. He said, "We need to reach some sort of positive agreement quickly." Many appreciate Mondale's style of doing things through regular channels. Mondale, who has strong connections with the core of the U.S. Administration, "is an ambassador who can call the White House directly, and exercise influence on the U.S. Government's policymaking" (according to a U.S. Embassy source). Japanese Government officials also admit that "unlike Ambassador Armacost, who relied on Mr. Ozawa (Ichiro Ozawa, current secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]), he does not provoke much ill will" (according to a Ministry of International Trade and Industry source). Officials both in Japan and the United States highly appraise Mondale's abilities. They believe the recently concluded Japan-U.S. construction talks were the result of Mondale's meeting with the embassy's economic section twice a week to come up with ways to break the deadlock. According to a U.S. Embassy source, with regard to the present economic framework talks, Mondale has been "advising" the U.S. Administration over the past three months that "instead of the rhetorical arguments about whether or not numerical targets will be accepted, the United States should negotiate on the more concrete issues of what it wants and what it would like Japan to do." Mondale's remarks on the employment issue in relation to the import and export of computers during the 1984 presidential campaign made people think that he took a strongly anti-Japanese stance. However, "(his reputation as a) champion of Japan bashing is a thing of the past. He now behaves very moderately" (according to diplomatic sources in Japan and the United States). Mondale is also said to have favorable feelings toward the Hosokawa administration, which upholds "reform" -- a cause he himself has advocated. Nevertheless, he is an astute politician. Some Japanese government officials simply think that "he is merely being careful now because he knows what came out of Mr. Armacost's methods." Mondale may leave for the United States temporarily on 8 February to give a direct briefing on the Japanese situation to President Clinton. As the framework talks, which may have serious effects on Japan-U.S. relations, enter a critical stage, it is also an opportune time to see how this powerful ambassador will exercise his leadership.
