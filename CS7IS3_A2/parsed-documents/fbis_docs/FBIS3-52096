[Sha'th] Good evening to you. [Mu'addi] You have been holding intensive consultations and contacts. You have received a letter from the Israeli foreign minister. What is it about? [Sha'th] The foreign minister's letter was in reply to one from us on 30 December. He indicated he was prepared to return for another round of talks in Taba. However, he makes this return conditional on our acceptance of what he called the Cairo agreement. Actually, we are ready to return to complete these negotiations tomorrow to hammer out an integrated pact to implement the Declaration of Principles agreement. We made it clear to Minister Peres that there is no Cairo agreement in existence. There are working papers that were drafted in Cairo. We are bound by the points on which we reached agreement. As for the points on which disagreement persists, we are ready to discuss them in Taba. That is what negotiations are about. We consolidate what was agreed upon and the pending issues may be pursued if we went to Taba, hopefully soon. [Mu'addi] The prime minister stated today that the document of understanding worked out in Cairo had the approval of the Israeli and Palestinian sides. [Sha'th] Let met put the record straight: There is no such thing as a document of understanding from Cairo. Minister Peres knows as much. On the night of 28 December, he drafted minutes written in longhand. On the following day we received a draft far removed from the minutes. On the third day, I sent him a clarification of this memorandum, including the points on which we reached agreement in Norway. I have not yet received word from him indicating his approval of any of these formulas. None of these formulas amount to a document of understanding. One is labelled minutes, the second a draft, the third a working paper. We would like to know what is this Cairo document. These minutes were supposed to be sent to the leaderships of both sides for their approval. We sent them to the Palestinian leadership in Tunis, and they okayed part of them, and expressed reservations about the other parts. We want to return to Taba to talk about all these issues. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what's next then? Is the Palestinian side waiting for the Israeli response? [Sha'th] I have just sent our response to Peres, which is, by and large, positive. We are ready to return to the talks to pick up where we left off in Cairo. We are also bound by the Declaration of Principles. I hope the Israeli response will, this time, be positive. [Mu'addi] Egypt's Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said today the Taba talks may resume next Tuesday. [Sha'th] That's fine by us. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you so much. [Sha'th] Thank you.
