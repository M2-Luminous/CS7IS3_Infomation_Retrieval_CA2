ODA Deputy Chairman Daniel Kroupa spoke about this today. [Begin Kroupa recording] The ODA rejects these attacks against our Constitution and considers it fundamental to ask if all parties voting for the Constitution feel committed to defend it against attacks by extremist forces. We think that the attempt to remove the Senate from the Constitution and incorporate into it elements of direct democracy are aimed at creating favorable conditions for these extremist forces taking power. In this respect, I wish to comment on the matter of referenda. You all know well that the ODA has consistently opposed this institution, pointing out that it disturbs our constitutional balance of power. Just now, when our parliament is debating the proposal of introducing referenda into our Constitution, in Slovakia the referendum might be used to take away the citizens' right to elect. This in fact is the substance of Mr. Meciar's proposal to strip disobedient deputies of their mandate by means of a referendum. It is an almost classical illustration of how direct democracy can be used as an instrument to liquidate democracy as such. [end recording]
