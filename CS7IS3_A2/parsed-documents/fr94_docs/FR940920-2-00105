FR940920-2-00105 FR940920-2-00054 The suggestion that the term ``encounter'' in the definition of a public meeting be changed to ``meeting'' was rejected. Had this suggestion been accepted, the definition would have read, ``A public meeting is a formal meeting,*␣*␣*'' phrasing that does not comply with the logical terms of a definition. Exemptions In reviewing the comments regarding the exemptions and scope of the policy statement, the NRC staff recognizes that exemption ``g'' should be clarified. The phrase, ``Is a general information exchange'' has been added to the exemption. Furthermore, guidance has been provided to the staff at the end of Section C.2 as follows: ``Also note that meetings between staff and licensees or trade groups to discuss technical issues or licensee performance would normally be open because they may lead to a specific regulatory decision or action. However, should a meeting involving a general information exchange be closed and should discussions during such a meeting approach issues that might lead to a specific regulatory decision or action, the NRC staff may advise the meeting attendees that such matters cannot be discussed in a closed meeting and propose discussing the issues in a future open meeting.'' Several commenters suggested that the policy statement contain additional specific exemptions for closing a meeting. For example, one commenter suggested closing meetings that are administrative in nature, that are held to discuss scheduling or constraints associated with licensee actions, or that are held to review material submitted to the NRC by licensees. The NRC believes that these types of meetings will be exempt to the extent the definition of a public meeting encompasses only meetings where substantive issues are discussed. Also, exemption ``g'' as rewritten covers those types of meetings because they are held only for the exchange of information. Several commenters suggested closing meetings for the exchange of preliminary, unverified information; meetings held within a licensee's protected areas; and meetings between NRC Resident Inspectors and licensees. The NRC believes that these types of meetings are already exempted by the policy statement in that the first type would be closed under exemption ``f,'' and second and third types would be closed under exemption ``h.'' One commenter suggested that exemptions ``f,'' ``g,'' and ``h'' need to be refined to preserve NRC's flexibility to carry out its health and safety responsibilities without being unduly inhibited by the expanded openness policy. Another commenter believed these exemptions were too broad. NRC believes exemption ``f'' is sufficiently focused to be clearly interpreted. Exemptions ``g'' and ``h'' have been refined and the NRC believes that the policy statement has sufficient flexibility to ensure that NRC meets its safety and regulatory responsibilities. The policy statement clearly enunciates this flexibility in stating, ``[t]his policy is a matter of NRC discretion and may be departed from as NRC convenience and necessity may dictate.'' The commenter specifically requested that the term ``substantially'' be deleted from exemption ``h.'' The NRC agrees because the NRC will not open a meeting if the NRC staff believes the administrative burden will interfere with the efficient performance of its safety and regulatory responsibilities and exemption ``h'' has been broadened to specifically exclude meetings held as an integral part of an NRC inspection. One commenter interpreted the provision in exemption ``f'' in the policy statement as a means to exempt meetings convened to solve potential problems, such as reclamation proposals or enforcement matters. The NRC does not agree with this interpretation. The exemption addresses meetings that could result in the inappropriate disclosure and dissemination of ``preliminary, unverified information.'' The purpose of this exemption is not to close all meetings for which preliminary information, proposals, or concerns are discussed, but to specifically ensure that agency licensees and applicants will not be inhibited in bringing preliminary, unverified information to the attention of the NRC. The NRC staff believes that this reasoning applies to another commenter who believes that meetings between the staff and licensees, where technical issues or approaches to emerging issues are discussed, should also be classified as ``preliminary'' in nature and not open to the public. Meeting Arrangements Several commenters raised issues regarding arrangements for public meetings. One recommended that public recording and transcription of meetings be prohibited. The NRC does not believe it should limit public attendees when they want to record or transcribe proceedings which they have a right to attend. This type of a prohibition would be difficult to enforce and would infringe upon an established practice of media representatives and others who routinely record public proceedings for their convenience and subsequent use.
