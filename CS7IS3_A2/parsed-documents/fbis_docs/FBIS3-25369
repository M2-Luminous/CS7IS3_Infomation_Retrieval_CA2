In a statement to the press, Father Mba Abessole, who placed second in the 5 December presidential elections and contested President Omar Bongo's reelection, also reaffirmed the determination of his party, the National Lumberjacks Rally, not "to participate in any other local or national election" organized by the government, since the ballot paper has no value at present in Gabon." In this regard, the Lumberjacks leader sees yesterday's announcement, that local elections slated for March 27 have been postponed to 28 August, as a "retreat imposed" by the government. Father Mba Abessole also invited opposition members who have rallied round him in the Convention of the Forces of Change "to reject any form of participation in a government of national union or large consensus," which President Bongo has called for several times since his reelection. Those who "join such a government would by that very fact be excluded from our ranks," he warned.
