The majority are of the male sex, single, and from the lower and lower-middle classes. This statement was made by the director of the local Youth Rehabilitation Center (CIJ), Beatriz Montemayor Gonzalez. She added that the conclusion was based on a study made from 1991 to 1993, with a sample of 1,700 patients; stressing that in 70 percent of the cases their schooling did not exceed the basic intermediate level, and that a high rate of school and work instability was recorded. Over 60 percent of the drug addicts in treatment require daily drug consumption; others, on several days a week; and 40 percent are consuming two or more substances simultaneously. Montemayor Gonzalez noted that the most frequent combinations are marijuana with alcohol or inhalants. She indicated that drug consumption most often begins between ages 10 and 19, primarily with marijuana or inhalants. These are followed by depressants intended for medical use, and the first experimenting with drug use is generally with school or work friends or companions. It occurs on public streets, in private residences, or at educational centers. Montemayor Gonzalez concluded by remarking that these are some of the results of an extensive study made by the CIJ with personnel specializing in the treatment of patients suffering from drug addiction within the lake region.
