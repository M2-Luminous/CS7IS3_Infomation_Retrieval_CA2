FR940505-1-00160 FR940505-1-00012 •Number of general aviation operations in 1999 •Number of general aviation aircraft based at the airport •Services provided at the airport This information will provide EPA with a measure of current activity levels, which in turn will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the emission reduction program that is implemented. Beginning January 1, 2001, airports with general aviation activity in the absence of a certificate will be subject to EPA enforcement. Beginning with the 2001 ozone season, civil airports will be required to submit seasonal activity reports during the ozone season on general aviation activity. These reports will include the following information: •Airport name as indicated on the General Aviation Operation Certificate •Total number of general aviation operations for the reported season •For each general aviation operation during the reported season, the aircraft's FAA registration number (``N'' number) These reports will be submitted to EPA no later than the 60 days following end of the ozone season, and will be used to track the effectiveness of the activity reduction program that is implemented. Airports with general aviation activity during the control period that fail to submit reports will be subject to EPA enforcement. The Agency recognizes the potentially burdensome nature of the above comprehensive reporting and recordkeeping scheme, and requests comment on the desirability and need for such a program element. EPA is also interested in receiving comment on the desirability of providing exemptions from the requirements of this control program for certain types of general aviation aircraft operations. General aviation activity at non-tower controlled facilities could be exempted from this program; such activity likely represents only a small fraction of total general aviation activity and would be difficult to control under any of the programs discussed today, relative to the limited emissions benefits likely to result from such control. In addition, atypical aircraft operations beyond the control of a general aviation aircraft operator, such as emergency operations, could be exempted from the requirements of this control program. The Agency also requests comments on three alternative concepts for reducing emissions from this source. Under the first alternative, EPA would implement a slot program for general aviation operations in the control areas. Such a program would require EPA to develop a baseline general aviation activity inventory and a series of declining activity targets designed to achieve emission reduction targets for each control area. The declining activity targets would be expressed as a number of allowable operations during an ozone season. Operation ``slots'' would be distributed to the general aviation community; perhaps through an annual auction. General aviation operations that occur during the ozone season without an approved slot would be subject to enforcement. The program would require registration with EPA for each facility where general aviation operations occur, so that EPA can establish and track an accurate general aviation activity inventory. A slot program provides a great deal of certainty that emission reductions are taking place, but at the expense of an extensive administrative burden imposed on the general aviation community and the government. Under the second alternative, EPA would establish an environmental surcharge on the sale of aviation fuel distributed to facilities that service and refuel general aviation aircraft. This surcharge would be set at a rate high enough to reduce general aviation activity without making such activity prohibitively expensive. The assumption in this case is that declining fuel use on the part of the general aviation community represents declining operations with resultant emissions reductions. Airport proprietors could be responsible for collecting this surcharge each time that a general aviation aircraft refuels; alternatively, those parties supplying aviation fuel to general aviation facilities could collect the surcharge upon delivery of fuel to the facility. In either case, the surcharge would be remitted to the federal government on a regular basis along with a report detailing fuel use during the reporting period. Fuel costs are small relative to the total costs of owning and operating a general aviation aircraft. As a result, the effect of an environmental fuel surcharge is uncertain and the fee may need be quite large relative to the present cost of fuel in order to ensure the activity reductions. Also, refueling an aircraft with non-conforming fuel (e.g., aviation fuel imported from outside the area or automotive gasoline used in certain piston-powered aircraft engines) would have to be made an illegal act in order to prevent cheating. Under the third and final alternative, EPA would implement a annual emissions registration fee for each general aviation aircraft residing in the FIP area. EPA would issue these certificates indicating that all applicable fees had been paid. As with the other programs described here, the FIP emissions registration fee would be set high enough to reduce operations. Airport proprietors or owners may be required to refuse services such as tie-down facilities or refueling to aircraft operators without the appropriate certificate. This alternative has the distinct disadvantage that it bluntly increases the cost of ownership without regard to how much any individual aircraft is used. ( 4 ) Issues for Specific Comment. EPA requests comment on potential methods for obtaining verifiable and enforceable emission reductions from general aviation operations other than the emission reduction programs described today.
