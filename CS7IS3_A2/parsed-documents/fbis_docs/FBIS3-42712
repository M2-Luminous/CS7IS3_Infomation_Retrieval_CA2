The ink had not even managed to dry on the edict about the dismissal of Ye. Gaydar and B. Fedorov had not yet left his office when the dollar dutifully shot up, promising a jump in inflation and prices: as if to say what things will be like without reform's two knights in shining armor. Meanwhile, all the talk about stabilization of the ruble and a deficit-free budget is nothing more than a diversionary maneuver which masks a system of purposeful destruction of the economy, which our shock therapists have been methodically carrying out. In the fall, at the conciliation commission of metallurgists and miners, which was established after coal prices were freed, the leaders of Magnitka [Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine] and the Novokuznetsk and other combines warned that the enterprises could not endure a sevenfold surge in coal prices and that 1993 might turn out to be the last year in the history of domestic metallurgy. And so, recently, the leaders of this sector, at an expanded collegium of their own committee, summed up the results of the past year in the presence of Oleg Soskovets and other members of the government. The increase in coal prices has led to repeated increases in the railroad rates and a sharp increase in electric power prices. The nonpayment fine for it is equal to 2 percent per day and, inasmuch as, as a rule, an enterprise has no money, the payments just for the fines for electricity are beginning to climb above world prices. The increase in the railroad shipping rates, given the enormous expanses of Russia, have led to the fact that the transportation cost has begun to exceed the cost of the ore and even of enriched iron-ore raw material. The Magnitogorsk combine, for example, is paying 10,000 rubles [R] for a metric ton of sinter and R12,000 for shipping it. Taking into account the shipping, the cost of domestic ore has become higher than the world cost. As a result of all the expenses, the prices for metal products have also risen to the world level and, in a number of instances, exceeded it. Exporting is becoming unprofitable. Whereas, back in the summer, for Magnitka, the profitability of exporting was equal to 25 percent, it has currently declined to 2 percent. In the domestic market, the effective demand for metal products has decreased catastrophically and whereas, prior to July of last year, the metallurgical sector was able to make ends meet, after prices were freed, the metallurgy workers found themselves in debt to the miners, the railroad workers and the power industry workers. "I am bankrupt," N. Ordzhonikidze, head of the Krasnyy Oktyabr plant, declared to the managers who had gathered in the hall of the collegium of Roskommetallurgiya [Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy]. "Anyone here who is not bankrupt, raise your hand." And not a single hand was raised. Even I. Frantsenyuk, the manager of the sector's most technically advanced enterprise, the Novokuznetsk combine, stated that his enterprise will become unprofitable this year. There is one mysterious thing: everyone is talking about inflation, emission and the fact that the printing press is operating at full power, yet the enterprises have no money. They are putting out products, but the consumers are not paying them and they themselves, of course, cannot pay for the shipments of raw ore material and coking coals. Really, is this inflation real or artificial, something specially contrived for the purpose of bringing down Russia's economy? The producer does not have the money he earned -- it is sitting in the banks. The latter are especially hindering monetary settlements, so that "payments" are sitting for months; the plants' funds are being withdrawn from the productive sphere and sent into the trade network in the form of high-interest short-term credit. The productive sphere is being brought to ruin during this time, the shadow structures and commercial banks are growing rich and this entire ridiculous system of financial destruction of industry is called inflation, for which, supposedly, those at fault are the plants and kolkhozes established in the "era of totalitarianism" and which, so it is said, are needed by no one. The rails are falling apart, the railroad cars are worn out and high-quality metal for engines cannot be found, yet metal products lie unclaimed and the metallurgy workers have nothing with which to pay for coal and electricity. And so it becomes necessary to turn off the blast furnaces, shut off the electric melting units and, the main thing, shut down the coke-oven batteries. Any manager, no matter what the financial problems, will find money for the coal miners -- he will persuade his colleague, the manager of the mine, to wait and not pay the ore-dressing combine, but he will find funds for the coking needs because the coke-oven batteries must not be shut down: the refractory brickwork would be ruined and shutting down the batteries is tantamount to putting them out of commission. "The most terrible thing is happening now," I. Frantsenyuk acknowledged, "the destruction of the coking supply." The Serov metallurgical combine has been shut down. The pipe plants and the rolled aluminum plants are operating at 20-30 percent of capacity. At the Chelyabinsk combine, the electric-furnace steel shop, which produced metal for space vehicles, has been shut down. The shutting down of enterprises is occurring, first of all, because the state is being led by the money men in price matters. But, under monopoly conditions and the absence of competition, the price does not reflect the actual cost of the product. A monopoly will set prices to cover costs at the expense of the consumer and thus, it will preserve technological backwardness. "The liberalization of prices, which declared as its goal the overcoming of the spending mechanism of the economy, in actuality, is stimulating it," noted S. Afonin, chairman of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy. Almost every enterprise manager talked about the tax situation. The creation of taxes is still one important part of the activities of our glorious money men for eliminating the country's economic potential. And, oh, the kinds of taxes which are being devised and approved by the department of our "No 2 Marketer," Boris Fedorov! A perfect example is the tax devised last year "on the exchange rate difference," which, instead of encouraging the producing exporter, is forcing the latter to pay for the devaluation of the ruble, as if inflation were not ravaging the enterprise, but rather, bringing it a profit. It is significant that B. Fedorov's department has currently established, in essence, the same level of taxes as existed under the planned socialist system (more than 80 kopecks from each ruble of profit), but without the guaranteed delivery of raw materials, assured sales market and budget financing. No other country in the world has such a level of taxation. Yet still, one thought stood out like a sore thumb in all the statements. The metallurgical plants, the mines and the dressing combines are overwhelmingly enterprises which form cities. If the Cherepovets combine closes (and its manager, Yuriy Lipukhin, during the last Vorkuta strike, was already issuing an order about closing the combine), what is to be done with the workers and what are the rest of the residents of Cherepovets, the economy of which is supported by the combine, supposed to do? The same situation is faced by Magnitogorsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Lipetsk.... Meanwhile, the social situation in the metallurgical regions is heating up. Boris Prokudin, the manager of the Chelyabinsk plant, declared that the workers' patience is not without limits and, if the wage payment situation does not change, the people of the Urals "will take up arms." Thus, at the meeting in the collegium hall, the metallurgy workers unrolled before the members of the government a panorama of their own difficult problems. They least of all complained about the situation and they analyzed it: why did a basic industry, on which the country's industry is supported, due to the endeavors of the macroeconomists, find itself threatened with destruction? They thought about how to correct the situation. Russian First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets said that it is necessary to establish a state set of measures for the revitalization of investment activities. He requested that the metallurgy workers prepare, in a thesis format, the most important of their proposals for consideration in the government. Time will show whether or not they find support there, but one thing is clear: the renovated cabinet, before getting down to actual reforms for Russia's economy, will have to do quite a bit of work on doing away with the obstacles left by the money men.
