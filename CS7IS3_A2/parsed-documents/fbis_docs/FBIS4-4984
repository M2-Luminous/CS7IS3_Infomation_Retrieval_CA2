An SDPJ source said that SDPJ upper house member Hajime Fukada met with the North Korean Embassy official in Beijing and proposed that a delegation of coalition Diet members visit North Korea. The North Korean official reportedly demonstrated a positive reaction to Fukada's proposal. Inoue said at the 4 April news conference that he told Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on 2 April that the SDPJ supports the UN Security Council [UNSC] presidential statement on the North Korean nuclear development issue and that it attaches importance to cooperation with the United Nations. He added he had told Qian that "the SDPJ will abide by the UN policy as one of the Japanese ruling parties." Inoue then demonstrated an eagerness to promote diplomatic activities between ruling party lawmakers to solve the issue at the interparty "diplomatic forum" to be set up on 5 April.
