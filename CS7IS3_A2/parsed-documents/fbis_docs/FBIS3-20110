Even at a distance, Forza Italia's leader and the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] secretary are still exchanging very heavy blows, and between the two combatants the center is condemning them both and proclaiming itself the winner: "Occhetto and Berlusconi only know how to fight, and have nothing to say. We do not like either of them, and the voters will vote for us." "No, we cannot accept it: Berlusconi is turning the clocks back. He can only conceive of politics as `anti' something, not as a blueprint applicable to the whole of the national community." The duel is over, but Achille Occhetto has not changed his mind about his adversary, Silvio Berlusconi. Indeed, he is reaffirming and reinforcing it: "Berlusconi does not meet the need for the establishment in this country at last of a new Left and a new Right, both capable of aiming at government. He is unable to acknowledge that we have entered the new phase, of alternative programs." Occhetto absolutely cannot accept Berlusconi's observation that "if the Left wins there will be no return match." Occhetto pointed out that Berlusconi "has not withdrawn it, and this is the most disturbing aspect of this new Right that has rallied around Berlusconi." These were tough and uncompromising assessments. They are not surprising, however, inasmuch as the Forza Italia leader is the number one enemy of the progressive forces. But the comments from the center were no less fierce, though addressed to both rivals, and not just to Berlusconi. The main criticism was for the length of the debate, which lasted much longer than expected and which supposedly jeopardized the center by focusing attention only on the Right and the Left. Mario Segni, the Pact leader, wrote to media watchdog Giuseppe Santaniello to protest and to demand an opportunity to recover his disadvantage. "The `Trial of Strength' television program has always lasted 45 minutes," Segni pointed out. "On the occasion of the debate between Occhetto and Berlusconi, it lasted at least an hour and 40 minutes. Since this creates an objective disadvantage with respect to the time made available to the Pact for Italy, I request that appropriate measures be taken with the necessary promptness to calculate the necessary adjustment in terms of time and benefits due to the Pact for Italy." As for matters of political substance: "If what emerged on television is Italy's Right and Left, then we are in trouble. It was a drawn match, which I believe persuaded people not to vote for either of the two. I believe that the center will benefit from it." Mino Martinazzoli did not watch the duel on television: "Nevertheless, I formed an idea of it from reading the newspapers," the Popular Party secretary commented drily, "and it confirmed to me that people can only watch such things out of pure masochism." Martinazzoli too believes that the voters will have concluded from the duel that neither the Right nor the Left is trustworthy. "They have tried to convince people with the idea that only they will be in the running. They use spectacular methods, and commit many instances of immoderation, both public and private. Ultimately, however, that suits me fine, because the more they talk, the more our own arguments are strengthened." In other words, according to the representatives of the center, the Occhetto-Berlusconi duel backfired. [Italian Republican Party, PRI, Secretary] La Malfa confirmed this: "The debate was the most obvious proof to all voters of the poverty of the arguments of both alignments, both Left and Right. The two contestants oscillated between very petty personal polemics and an absolute lack of incisiveness in presenting their respective stances." La Malfa's conclusion was that "the election campaign has been very useful: It has deflated two sham alignments and brought to light their complete absence of policies and programs." The debate was also examined during the political discussion on RAI channel two. According to Giuseppe Ayala [Democratic Alliance], "Occhetto made the best impression," against a Berlusconi who was "on the defensive," while the National Alliance's Francesco Storace saw in Occhetto "the promise of a defeat. I saw him succumb for the second time, after his encounter with [Italian Social Movement and National Alliance leader] Fini." According to the League's Franco Rocchetta, the PDS leader has "great skills as a performer," whereas Berlusconi "is a more normal person, which is why he has gathered more support." [Radical leader] Marco Pannella said Berlusconi was the winner: "Keeping in mind that it was Berlusconi's first time, whereas Occhetto is an expert in debates, Berlusconi should score an extra point for doing well."
