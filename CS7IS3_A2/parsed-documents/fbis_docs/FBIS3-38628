We will not be drawn into endless and worthless discussions, he said. Speaking in London, Mikhailidhis also said that the UN's next move will be an effort by the special representative to determine the basic issues related to the implementation of the measures. Mikhailidhis was responding to correspondents' questions following his meeting yesterday with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. He added that the message from the United States, the UN secretary general, and Britain is that interest in the success of the confidence-building measures and establishment of a positive climate for talks on an overall solution to the Cyprus issue has increased.
