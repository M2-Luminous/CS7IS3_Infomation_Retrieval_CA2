FBIS4-25258 "drchi110_k_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Investigation of Crash, `Black Box' Continues Investigation of Crash, `Black Box' Continues Airlines President Said To Resign HK0806055894 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 8 Jun 94 p 1 HK0806055894 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [Text] The president of China Northwest Airlines will resign to take the blame for China's worst air accident, airline sources said yesterday. Gao Junyue expressed his desire to resign to civil aviation officials who are in Xian investigating Monday's crash, which killed 160 people. Gao was told the resignation would not be accepted until a preliminary investigation reports whether the accident was a result of poor maintenance. The revelation came as the identities of four Hong Kong people, including a prominent Sydney businesswoman, were released yesterday and workers recovered the aircraft's flight recorder. The official Hong Kong China News Agency said last night the Xian disaster showed China's poor air safety situation had not improved, despite a new leadership in the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). The CAAC's deputy director, Yan Zhixiang, said the air safety situation in China remained "grim". The rapid tendering of Gao's resignation is a result of agreements signed by all airline presidents in March, sources said. When presiding over his first national aviation safety meeting, China's new aviation chief, Chen Guangyi, forced airline presidents to sign agreements promising to "take personal responsibility for any crashes". "I signed, so I must be responsible," Gao was reported to have said yesterday. The vice-president of the airline, Wang Wancai, who is in charge of flight operations, is expected to replace Gao. The Russian-built Tupolev TU-154M crashed at about 8.20am in Changan county, minutes after leaving Xian. It is believed there was an engine failure and the pilot was trying to return to Xian when two explosions tore the aircraft apart. Airline officials identified three of-the Hong Kong victims as Lau Chi-cheung, Chu Ym-ming and Mak Hong, all males. Their ages ranged from 35 to 70. An immigration spokeswoman, Tammy Keung, said the department was able to contact relatives of the three Hong Kong residents. The families left for Xian yesterday. The fourth Hong Kong victim was a businesswoman, Margaret Shen Beaumont, an Australian national who was born in the territory and lived in Sydney. Her family in Australia is expected to leave for China this week. Other victims include a Taiwanese, an Italian couple and their two children, aged nine and 10, two Americans, and two male British tourists. Chinese authorities said all the bodies had been recovered. Shen, a prominent member of Sydney's business community, had been visiting a friend in Xian and was to have joined an Australian trade delegation in Guangzhou before the group, led by the New South Wales Premier, John Fahey, travelled to Beijing yesterday. Fahey expressed his condolences yesterday and said he was "shocked and saddened" by Shen's death. A spokesman for Fahey said Shen, who travelled to China frequently on business, was to have joined the delegation as an adviser because she co-owned a business in Guangzhou. The airline notified Fahey, who spoke with Shen's step-father, a retired senior Hong Kong police officer now living in Sydney. Shen, whose family owned the Noble House Chinese restaurant in Sydney, is survived by a daughter and a grand-daughter.
