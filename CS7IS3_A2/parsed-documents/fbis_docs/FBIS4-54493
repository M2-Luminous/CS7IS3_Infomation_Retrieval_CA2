However, there was a change in his program, caused by the situation in the Slovak National Council, where 35 deputies submitted a proposal to express a vote of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. Because the discussion of this point was expected today, as had been announced in the morning by Government Office Spokesman Lubomir Lintner, the presence in Bratislava of both these representatives of the Cabinet is necessary. Editor Zuzana Stukovska interviewed Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik on this topic last night. She was interested, in connection with the discussion about Roman Kovac in the parliament, in whether the prime minister was concerned about the image of the government he is heading. [Begin recording] [Moravcik] I know Mr. Roman Kovac. I do not think that fabrications--because I think they are only fabrications--could jeopardize his position. I do not underestimate our citizens in this regard, either, because they will be able to make up their own minds about the matter. [Stukovska] Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] Deputies' Club, confirmed to TASR [News Agency of the Slovak Republic] that the Movement has at its disposal actual evidence linking Roman Kovac to corruption. Prime minister, if these findings are serious, will you ask the deputy prime minister to resign? [Moravcik] So far, I have not had the opportunity to familiarize myself with these documents, and I do not think they exist. [Stukovska] In connection with your new post, you have replied several times this week to the question whether or not, by virtue of being elected chairman of the Democratic Union, you were going against the philosophy on the basis of which the current coalition government was formed--that is, the idea that it would be a government without top party political leaders. It appears, however, that your replies have not been altogether convincing because Peter Weiss, chairman of the SDL [Party of Democratic Left], said very clearly--I quote--I do not want to dramatize this, but it means advantages to DEUS [Democratic Union of Slovakia] in contrast to other partners in the elections--end of quote. Prime minister, do you think that this, on the surface, minor reproach means the beginning of various coalition disagreements? [Moravcik] Immediately after this, I contacted Mr. Weiss and we discussed this topic. We arrived at the conclusion that this fact cannot harm our mutual relations. This means that we know how to deal with the new situation, and I firmly believe that this assessment of the situation will last also in the future. [passage omitted] [Stukovska] So, you assume that you will not have to prove that your new post will not make your party the favorite in the early parliamentary elections? [Moravcik] It should not.
