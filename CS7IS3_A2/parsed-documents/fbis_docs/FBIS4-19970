Marchers were jeered by a group of around 80 Serb protestors denouncing what they called a "witch-hunt" against Bosnian Serbs, and police had to intervene to separate the two sides. The march, called by around 20 human rights groups and trades unions, was led by a number of personalities including writers Bernard Henri Levy, Daniel Rondeau and Pascal Bruckner. Organizers said 7,000 people took part in the march. Police put the attendance at around 1,200. Demonstrators chanted "Weapons for Bosnia" and "UN, why do you let them (the Moslems) be killed?" They called for the use of all means, including military, to save the town, which came under renewed Bosnian Serb shelling Saturday in defiance of Friday's ultimatum from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to halt their offensive immediately or face air strikes.
