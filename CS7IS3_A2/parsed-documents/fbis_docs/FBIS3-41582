Dlouhy was giving a lecture on the problems of the north Bohemian region, organized by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation for leading figures of the region. Dlouhy recalled that over 7.7 billion crowns (about $260 million) had been allocated from the state budget and the State Environment Fund in 1991-93 for improving the environment. This contributed to a 36-percent decrease in sulfur-dioxide emissions compared with 1987, a 32-percent drop in nitrogen-oxide emissions, and a 58-percent decrease in fly ash emissions. Dlouhy said that the heritage from the past could only be removed step-by-step, and added that the completion of two reactors at the Temelin nuclear power plant in south Bohemia would be a positive solution also for north Bohemia. He said the goal in north Bohemia is to shut down 1,600-MW units in thermal power plants by 1996. Only four of the present eight north Bohemian mines are to remain in operation in the year 2005, according to Dlouhy.
