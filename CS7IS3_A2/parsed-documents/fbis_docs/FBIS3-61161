Pragmatists submit to it and pay up the set tribute, realists draw up their defenses, and romantics wait for help from the state. Which of them are best protected? Moscow today is like a postwar Moscow: people blow up vehicles and apartments and cut down traffic inspectors and detectives with bursts of rifle fire. But the militia is worse equipped than the organized criminals, the engines of its vehicles are less powerful, and everything is painfully reminiscent of scenes in Govorukhin's unforgettable movie "The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed," in which brave officers of the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department in a low-powered militia bus chase after the bandits' powerful truck. Moscow's modern militia does not appear heroic against the background of this combat panorama. They know that they are backed by a sickly city budget and that the future holds for them the grim fate of being invalids if they are unlucky. You cannot speak of strength of spirit. But some obstinate people have come along who are prepared to change the situation. They have organized a public organization -- "The Program of Social Protection for Professional Groups at Increased Risk" -- with the task of giving social and technical assistance to the Moscow Internal Affairs Main Administration Regional Administration for Organized Crime [RAOC]. "Program" was registered in May of this year and has already done some things: the lives and health of all the personnel of the service and its district departments have been insured for a sum equivalent to $10,000 per employee; payments of 20,000 rubles [R] are made for every underage child and R5,000 for medical supplies for family members; office equipment and an imported minibus have been handed over; and a two-room apartment has been purchased for measures to be taken to protect witnesses and victims. In addition, "Program" holds competitions in subunits for the best in the profession and pays the winners R200,000 each. "Program" leader A.M. Kachur (a candidate of juridical sciences and a former militia colonel) maintains that it is capable of creating technical backup for the RAOC up to the standards of the German police, if not better. In the social and historical aspects "Program" is based on the traditional Russian idea of self-management, whereby society's efforts are directed toward resolving a particular very important task. Kachur has persuaded a number of prominent financiers and entrepreneurs to participate in "Program." His reasoning was founded on a simple argument: They must have an interest in winning the fight against organized crime, and it is possible to achieve success by joining forces. With "Program's" help the outflow of cadres from the RAOC has been entirely stopped in the space of six months. Kachur claims that the RAOC is today in a position to protect anyone who asks it for assistance. Everything is splendid, you might think. Particularly as Moscow Mayor Yu. Luzhkov approved and supported "Program's" activity in his directive of 19 October this year, seeing that it had provided an opportunity to improve the situation in the capital. But it has rightly been noted that Moscow is still not Russia. As though confirming the tenacity of the Russian tradition of officials' rejecting manifestations of self-management, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Main Administration for Organized Crime unexpectedly regards "Program's" activity with great suspicion. Why? Many people see this as professional envy, but they also do not rule out more serious interests, which are now being attacked by the Moscow regional administration. There really is some mystery concealed in the Ministry's rejection of "Program." We will not undertake to fathom it at once, but maybe we will be able to unfold this MVD secret before our readers in the very near future.
