It was chaired by Uzbek President Islam Karimov. The introduction of the national currency, replenishing the home consumer market with necessary goods, strengthening the export potential of the enterprises in the Republic, and the new system of state and social protection of families with children were discussed. The president said the main prerequisite for establishing an independent state, providing for the welfare and [word indistinct] of the people is the creation of a highly developed and independent economy. The main aim of the current economic reforms being carried out in the Republic is directed at this. An independent economy requires that the country has its own currency with a high purchasing power and credibility. The national currency, like the flag, the hymn, and the constitution, is one of the symbols of the state and the people and is a sacred symbol of independence. We prepared ourselves a long time ago for introducing the unit of national currency. Our specialists carefully studied the experiences of foreign countries and CIS countries in this field. During the first phase the sum-coupons will be circulated along with this national currency, and we have gained sufficient experience in this area and carried out necessary checks. With the help of an intermediate currency we tackled a number of financial tasks, and now the time has come for the full national currency, said the president. It is well known that one cannot fulfill great aims only with the introduction of a new currency. It is, therefore, necessary to start preparing now for increasing the purchasing power of our currency and provide it with credibility at world standards. This demands that we replenish the consumer market and ensure the priority of exports over imports. This requires sharp increases abroad in the sale of goods produced in the Republic. A mechanism for a finance and credit policy in the country, reliable social protection for the needy, particularly families with children, is necessary for the country. At the session Mullojonov, chairman of the directorate of the Central Bank; Deputy Prime Ministers Usmonv and Sultanov; and [name indistinct], first deputy minister for labor, talked about the issues in question. The order and time of transfer to the national currency, the government measures to be taken in relation to this, the new structure of the state, and social protection of families with children were discussed in detail. There is an old saying that the humanity of any state and the spirit of the community comes from respect for women and children, said the president. Improving the structure of the social protection of families with children, aimed at their material support, is of great importance. In essence, a child up to 16 years old will be under the care of the state. The budget's contributions to this will be increased many fold. In conclusion, the president noted that independent Uzbekistan is on verge of a taking a great step. We are taking another big step on the path to economic independence and will have our own currency. This is also a great step. We should fully understand that our national currency is like a newborn child of which we should be proud and at the same time take good care of it and protect it. We all must work for increasing the value and the purchasing power of our sum. Prime Minister Mutalov; Bugrov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet; chairmen of the committees of the Supreme Soviet; and deputy prime ministers and heads of corresponding ministries, departments, organizations, and banking institutions participated in this session.
