Shukhostanov, minister of industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria; place and date not given: "Industrial Upturn--Not Only an Economic but Also a Social Problem"] [Text] As already reported in our paper, there has been a meeting of leaders of the republic's industrial enterprises. A report on the results of work in 1993 and the tasks to stabilize the situation in the present year was delivered by B.K. Shukhostanov, minister of industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. He observed that the situation in the republic's industry was characterized by the continued decline in production, a reduction in investment activity, the low solvency of the enterprises, and difficulties in the sale of the finished product. At the same time an analysis shows that the first signs of an easing of the crisis situation appeared in the latter half, although the situation has not been stabilized completely. Despite the fact that in the mechanical engineering complex production constituted 96.7 percent of the 1992 level, far from all enterprises operated at the proper level, and 12 out of the 21 showed a decline in production of more than 10 percent. Some managers reduced their size considerably, not appreciably increasing wages or running up enormous bank credit debts here. These included the Sevkavrentgen, Terekalmaz, the Prokhladnyy Maintenance Plant, the SKEP, Nalchik Telemechanical Apparatus Plant, NZPP, PZPP, and others. A characteristic feature of the decline in production in this sector was the reduction in the manufacture of high-technology and intricate products. Thus the production of instruments and means of automation declined 37.9 percent, of medical equipment, 28.5 percent, high-voltage apparatus, 19.8 percent, and electronic equipment products, 54.1 percent. Particular difficulties were experienced by conversion enterprises of the defense sectors, of which there are six on the territory of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, which employ more than 10,000 persons. Conversion programs of modernization and retooling and renewal of the product list approved in the appropriate departments and committees of the Russian Federation and included in the Federal Conversion Program have been devised for them. Realization of the latter will make it possible thanks to a change in the production structure to create capacity for the manufacture of civilian products and consumer goods worth R5 billion a year in prices of the first quarter of 1993 and to preserve jobs. But under the conditions of the strict financial and resource limitations the conversion programs are not in practice being funded and are not being fulfilled. The task of the current year is to ensure the allocation of credit resources in full and to reorient these enterprises toward the civilian sector of the economy at an accelerated pace. No less disquiet is being aroused by the iron and steel sector, which constitutes 19.7 percent of the republic's total industrial production, and the results of the work of the TVMK are directly reflected in the living conditions and living standard of the population of Tyrnyauz. The main problem for the TVMK and GMZ in the year under review remained the limited nature of the sale of output on account of the high prices, which exceed domestic and world prices by 25-30 percent, the insolvency of the consumers, and the unchecked growth of the price of energy. As a result the works' indebtedness to suppliers, the treasury, and the banks constituted R10.516 billion, of which for electric power, R7.119 billion. The president and the government of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria are constantly rendering the utmost support in the solution of the problems that confront the metallurgical sector. Thanks to this, the question of the depositing in the state reserves of the Russian Federation of 750 tonnes of metallic tungsten was solved, which made it possible to maintain relatively high production in the past year. Within the framework of state support for the sector it was decided to grant the TVMK long-term investment credit for modernization and the preservation of capacity totaling R1.25 billion and to halve the tariff on energy allocated for its needs. The leadership of the republic found an opportunity to purchase and deposit in the state reserves R700 million of concentrate from the working capital allocated the Kabbalkkontrakt. The situation in light industry, which perceives the severance of business ties with the suppliers of raw material from CIS countries and the sharp reduction in effective consumer demand the most, remains difficult. The decline in production in this sector constituted 31.6 percent. A particularly alarming situation has come about at the Iskozh Works, the Garment Association, the Nartkalinskiy Production Combine, and the Kubinskaya Footwear Factory. It is essential to adopt special measures to halt the complete disintegration of the republic's light industry and find an opportunity to resolve its problems not only and not so much thanks to assistance from the federal authorities but by reliance mainly on our own powers and the use of intrinsic reserves and resources. In conjunction with enterprises of light industry the ministry drew up and approved last year a program of intersectoral cooperation based on the Iskozh Works. It provides for the assimilation of new product types at eight enterprises of light industry, which, it is forecast, will provide significant economic benefits and will exclude their dependence on suppliers from other regions. It is essential subsequently to continue work in this direction with the involvement of enterprises of the mechanical engineering complex also. There is also a need now for the elaboration and introduction of a system of a republic (Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria) government contract for products constituting the consumer basket, basic necessities, and commodities of a social focus. This would contribute to the filling of the market with affordable consumer merchandise and would stabilize industrial enterprises' relations with trade. Another lever, of which more efficient use needs to be made, is the privatization as soon as possible of enterprises of light industry in the form of their sale at public auction on a competitive basis. And use of the monies earned for the creation of new jobs and investments in programs of the structural reorganization of light industry. A year ago we considered the "weakest points" the decline in production and the sharp reduction in investments in the national economy inasmuch as this was jeopardizing the structural reorganization of the economy and emergence from the crisis. But with time the accents have begun to shift. An analysis of the actual processes occurring in the country leads to the conclusion that it is not the decline in production but social problems, unemployment primarily, which have become critical today. The present year could be worrying in this respect. According to preliminary estimates, more than 3,500 persons will be laid off. This means that it is necessary to devise a set of measures stimulating tax privileges for the enterprises and entrepreneurial structures which create new jobs and increase output. The wages of the employees of industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria remain extremely low. In December they constituted only R59,329 against an average in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria as a whole of R84,200, and in the Russian Federation, of R141,200. Ministry enterprises continued to experience serious financial difficulties also. True, R16.626 billion of profit were obtained. But the enterprises' contribution to the formation of the republic budget is extremely uneven. The largest profit was obtained by the Kavkazkabel, the Machinery Plant, and the Avtozapchast. Nine enterprises are unprofitable, and their sum total of losses constituted R294.6 million. These include the SKEP, Tekhnopribor, and TZNVA plants, the Kubinskaya Footwear Factory, and others. The level of profitability remains low also. Thus with an annual production of R1.288 billion Telemekhanika obtained a profit of only R2 million. This means that the outfit did not form the necessary accumulation fund and did not participate in formation of the republic budget. The shortage of enterprises' own working capital under the conditions of the wholesale increase in prices and the limited availability of credit resources has caused a most acute nonpayments crisis. The extent of customers' arrears past due for supplied products, jobs performed, and services rendered owed enterprises of the ministry constituted R10.463 billion. At the same time, on the other hand, our enterprises' accounts payable to suppliers constituted R14.365 billion. A reason for this complication of the financial situation was the lack of requirement for individual types of products, as a result of which remnants thereof at warehouses constituted R13.862 billion. The problem in this sphere could be eased to a certain extent by the involvement of the Kabbalkkontrakt in the sale of the industrial product of enterprises of the republic. It is essential also to revive the functions of the former state wholesale depots, which undertook professionally both the purchase and sale of our commodities. The new market structure has today become a reality. There are outfits that have already adapted to its conditions. Their managers did not wait for spectral assistance or instructions from above but created multiprofile production and increased the independence and responsibility of the structural subdivisions. These include the Machinery Plant, the Kavkazkabel, the Machine-Tool Plant, the Avtozapchast, and others. They are increasing production and solving questions of sales and nonpayments independently. Many problems should be resolved by privatization. It is being perceived ambivalently in the republic. Because, most likely, we have yet to obtain the results we were entitled to expect. The actual progress of privatization is not exerting a pronounced influence on production efficiency. It is frequently of a formal nature and is pursued as an end in itself. The unjustified appropriation of state property is taking place, the manageability of the economy is declining, and the privatization process itself is being discredited. It is sufficient to say that at check auctions a substantial part of the shares of the Teleavtomatika and High-Voltage Apparatus plants ended up with three or four persons who had dubious sources of income and who had never had any connection with these outfits. It should be noted that the current privatization program is geared to the accomplishment of a utopian idea--making all citizens of Russia subjects of private property with the aid of vouchers. Whence a whole number of negative consequences. For this reason it is proposed, without calling in question the need for privatization, to correct some of its conceptual principles. In conjunction with enterprises of the republic the Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria also conducted a "stock-taking" and review of the program of structural reorganization of industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria with a view to concentrating resources in the priority areas. Today the task is to provide them with real sources of financing. And these may appear only with the inclusion of our programs in federal programs such as Conversion, Fuel and Energy, Equipment for the Agro-Industrial Complex, the Farmer, Consumer Goods, and so forth. Thirty-two projects have been devised altogether. But the structural reorganization of the economy, an acceleration of scientific and technological progress, and an increase in enterprises' competitiveness must be organized in the expectation not only of government support but also on the basis of the active enlistment of private and joint-stock companies and joint ventures and their capital in the renewal of production. The Government of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria will support primarily those who can step up their business activity, normalize their financial situation, and ensure profitable work under the conditions of the market. There are opportunities for creating the conditions for an escape from the crisis in 1994. Sufficient production engineering, scientific, and personnel potential is preserved as yet. The actual timeframe and scale of realization of this potential, however, will largely be determined by organization and a capacity to tackle the tasks confronting the republic's industry. They consist of a halt to the general decline in production. Together with winding down and changing the production structure of nonviable works it will be necessary, furthermore, to stabilize the manufacture of products in demand and create the conditions for the revitalization and development of promising types of activity shaping the republic's actual economic potential. The accomplishment of these tasks will depend to a considerable extent on the ability of the corps of directors to resolve under the present difficult conditions the problems confronting the work force, initiative, and an ability to get one's bearings under the complex conditions of the market. V.M. Gukepshev, director of the Nalchik Footwear Factory, called attention to the fact that an increase in the price of electricity would complicate even further the situation at the enterprise, which lacks working capital to purchase materials. Nor, as before, is their quality satisfactory either, on account of which our footwear cannot compete with foreign footwear and is not in demand. These difficulties are typical of light industry as a whole, and for this reason they worry M.O. Karmova, director of the Nalchik Leather Notions Factory, also. A whole number of questions concerning the further development of instrument making was broached by the following directors: R.E. Buterus of Kavkazkabel, V.Kh. Khabitov of Elektronmash, V.F. Tishchenko of the NZPP, and A.Kh. Akhokhov of Telemekhanika. The latter also voiced a number of criticisms of the Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. The proposal of D.A. Miziyev, director of the TVMK, concerning the creation on the River Baksan of a hydroelectric power station cascade, which would resolve the problem of the republic's power supply, was interesting. Yu.K. Altudov, chairman of the State Property Committee, familiarized those present with the progress of the privatization process here. He affirmed that only half of the enterprises outlined by the program had taken part in check auctions as yet and that the slowing of the process of privatization was being reflected both in the psychological restructuring of the work force and in investment in production. The far from brilliant situation on the labor market was portrayed by L.V. Pogrebnyak, minister of labor and employment. The need for an improvement in the tax and banking systems was described by Minister of Economics M.N. Tsikanov and V.K. Sokhov, vice premier of the republic. The debate was concluded by V.M. Kokov, president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. He emphasized that the period of political wrangling was over and that the Constitution of the Russian Federation had been adopted. We have all seen for ourselves that the people cannot be fed by slogans, and for this reason the purpose of our entire activity must shift in the direction of the economy. And the most acute problem, what is more, is industrial upturn. A considerable part of the population of the republic, producing material benefits, but living from pay packet to pay packet, is employed in it. Unfortunately, he observed, the speeches of the corps of directors contained more complaints than actual proposals. Nonetheless, the situation cannot be considered hopeless. We have a Ministry of Industry, which, with the support of the Council of Directors, should be the coordinating body and intermediary in a solution of our problems in the center.... And great assertiveness locally should be displayed by the administration chiefs. They have ceased involving themselves as of late in questions of production, have lost contact with the work force, and are unaware of its problems. But the main complaints were leveled at the enterprise managers. V.M. Kokov recalled how many demands had been heard concerning the need for protection against party diktat and the strict planning framework and for independence and freedom of action to be granted. Sufficient time has passed, and if some directors have been unable to reorganize, it is hard to expect this now. The government is trying to support industry. But the Bankruptcy Act will be applied in respect to enterprises that are unable to restore production in the very near future. Lest they perish one by one, the way out of the critical situation for native enterprises could be the creation of industrial and financial groups, which would include those involved in wood processing, the creation of equipment and cable products for the oil workers, and so forth. This would make it possible for them to have their own finances and their own bank and, consequently, conditions for maneuver and product replacement, without which hoping for a production upturn is currently impossible. There are reserves within the republic, and more initiative and perseverance in their use need to be displayed. We have approached the critical line, V.M. Kokov said, but the present year must be a turning point for the industry of Kabardino-Balkaria.
