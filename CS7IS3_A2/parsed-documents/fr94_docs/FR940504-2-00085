FR940504-2-00085 FR940504-2-00075 Northeast Nuclear Energy Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;21, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the licensee), for operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut. The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to change the laboratory testing protocol for the charcoal absorbers for the Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (TS 3.7.6.1) and the Enclosure Building Filtration System (TS 3.6.5.1). Because the present TS requires a test on carbon samples of charcoal absorbers that the licensee's vendor had not and could not perform, the TS must be changed to allow testing of carbon samples to a standard that is more accurate and capable of performance. The plant is presently operating and during a review of the recent ventilation system testing, the licensee's Quality Services Department discovered a discrepancy in the references identified in the vendor test procedure as compared to the Millstone Unit 2 TS requirements. Further, on April 12, 1994, the licensee discovered that the vendor's test equipment could not support the laboratory test required by the testing standard currently referenced in the Millstone Unit No. 2 TS. The inplace charcoal for the ``B'' facilities of the Control Room Emergency Ventilation System and the Enclosure Building Ventilation System were conservatively determined to be inoperable because the surveillance performed on these units had been satisfied utilizing a standard (ASTM Standard D3803&hyph;79/86) not specified in the Millstone Unit 2 TS. Thus the licensee immediately declared the affected facilities inoperable and entered the 7 day action statement. The action statements require the affected systems to be restored to an operable status within 7 days or the plant be placed in at least hot standby within the next 6 hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Due to the fact that the time necessary to process the application for amendment would be longer than the remaining time of the 7 day action statement, exigent action is justified in order to reduce the time of enforcement discretion which was granted until the license amendment is issued. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards (SHC) consideration, which is presented below: The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. NNECO's proposal to revise Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications 4.6.5.1.b.2., 4.6.5.1.c, 4.7.6.1.c.2, 4.7.6.1.d, 4.9.15.b.2, and 4.9.15.c will permit carbon samples to be tested in accordance with ASTM D3803&hyph;89 versus ANSI N509&hyph;1976. ASTM Standard D3803&hyph;89 is used industry wide, and is acknowledged by the NRC as an acceptable method for the testing of activated charcoal bed filters. In addition, testing in accordance with ASTM Standard D3803&hyph;89 yields more accurate results than testing in accordance with ANSI N509&hyph;1976. The removal efficiency requirement is not affected by the proposed changes. NNECO's proposal to correct the reference to Regulatory position C.6.a in Technical Specification 4.9.15.b.2 is an editorial correction. Based on the above, the proposed changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed changes to Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications 4.6.5.1.b.2, 4.6.5.1.c, 4.7.6.1.c.2, 4.7.6.1.d, 4.9.15.b.2, and 4.9.15.c do not involve any physical modifications to any equipment, structures, or components, nor do they involve any changes to any plant operating procedures. The only change would be to use a more reliable method to determine filter efficiency at the laboratory. NNECO's proposal to correct the reference to Regulatory Position C.6.a in Technical Specification 4.9.15.b.2 is an editorial correction. Thus, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
