The International Atomic Energy Agency has already checked those facilities on two separate occasions. Nevertheless, the U.S. Government continues to insist. Recently, the UN Security Council asked North Korea to authorize inspections, which that government later rejected. The UN Security Council's petition was not mandatory. That same day, President William Clinton threatened to isolate the DPRK internationally if they persist in that position. At the same time, the United States began sending Patriot missiles to South Korean territory and placed U.S. troops stationed on the peninsula on alert. The South Korean defense minister made militant statements in an obvious attempt to intensify the situation. The North Korean Government also mobilized its forces to reject any aggression. A state of war has been created, which does not benefit anyone in the world, especially the more powerful Asian countries like China and Japan, or other countries known to possess nuclear weapons, like India and Pakistan. This situation has created a difference of opinion among regional analysts. For some, this is no more than a diplomatic arm-wrestling match, a contest for a more favorable position at the negotiating table. Others believe a real threat of war exists between the two Koreas, the consequences of which would be unpredictable for the region and for the world as a whole. The moderate positions of China and Russia, who on repeated occasions have requested a continuation of negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang, have reduced the possibility of a harsher stance toward North Korea by the Security Council, in accordance, as usual, with Yankee wishes. In any case, for those who believe that in these times, war is impossible because there is a new government in the United States, I would like to read this paragraph from the book, "Mandate for Change," a compilation by the Institute for Progressive Policy affiliated with the Council for Democratic Leadership, which is to be the leading book of the Clinton administration. It reads: The next key challenge for collective security in the new period will be to give the United Nations the power to use preventive diplomacy. It goes on to emphasize: Of course, the United States should never renounce its prerogative to use unilateral force when its vital interests are threatened. Until now, what the United States calls UN preventive diplomacy -- in other words, to do as it pleases -- has failed in the case of Korea. Therefore, I ask myself: Can one dismiss the possibility of a unilateral action by the United States? I do not think so.
