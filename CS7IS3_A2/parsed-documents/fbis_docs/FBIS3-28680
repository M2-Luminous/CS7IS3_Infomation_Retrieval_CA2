The sources said the revenue decrease will amount to about 170 billion yen in the initial year. They said the tax cut will be made by raising the minimum taxable level to 50 million yen from the present 48 million yen and boosting tax exemption for individual heirs to 10 million yen from 9.5 million yen. Tax rates on inherited assets ranging from 10 to 70 percent will remain unchanged but the number of tax gradations will be rearranged to nine from the present 13, they said. The highest tax rate of 70 percent will be applied to inherited assets exceeding 2 billion yen in value, up from the present 1 billion yen, the officials said.
