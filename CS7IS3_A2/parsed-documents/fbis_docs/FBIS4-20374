A Reassessment of China's Investment Climate, and Policy Suggestions The participating delegates held that in the broad setting of the evolving new world economic order and the appearance of an international production-network system, in order to adapt to the ever-changing climate and its new demands and opportunities, and to get onto track with the open international economic situation and become more internationally competitive, China needs to reassess its climate and policy framework for direct foreign investment in China. It was precisely in line with that constructive spirit that this forum made a number of suggestions for consideration by the Chinese government, aimed at helping China to further improve its current foreign-investment-policy laws and regulations, so that it can attract more foreign investment to speed up its economic growth and development, particularly direct investment by large transnational corporations. The delegates' general line of thinking was that on the occasion of China's transition from a planned to a market economy, China's economic reform should be focused on building a market-oriented macroeconomic climate suited to both foreign and Chinese investment, whose climate ought to be both stable and predictable. This will mean establishing the appropriate legal framework and system structure for the sound operation of a market economy; a convertible currency; an effective finance and banking system; a competitive market structure; transportation and communications infrastructures to aid commercial transactions; and constantly improving human capital and technical skills. It will also require policy measures and management plans that will put all domestic and international economic activities on the same track. As to long-range objectives, the pertinent policy laws and regulations on direct foreign investment should be transparent, grant enterprises decisionmaking power, guarantee national treatment without ethnic discrimination, provide procedures for resolving disputes, and permit the outward remittance of bonuses. In order to gradually realize these objectives, the delegates made many suggestions, which were quite constructive and definitely feasible, so that we should pay them adequate attention, to pave the way for choosing the best ones to follow. 1. On Adopting a Policy Slanted Toward Large Investment Projects As to large investment projects in line with China's industrial structural-adjustment orientation (such as high-tech, power, and transportation), we need to provide full encouragement and support, by making a transition of preferential policy from a regional to an industrial slant. 2. On Allowing the Establishment of Holding Companies The forum welcomed the suggestion made by China's foreign-investment management sector to allow the establishment of holding companies. Based on established holding companies, such as the U.S. Hewlett-Packard Co, IBM, Du Pont, and Motorola, and the Netherlands Philips B. V., we could gradually expand the experimental scope, to allow these types of companies to practice effective and integrated management of their subordinate joint-venture enterprises, and to enjoy a nationwide corporate status, in order to bring their overall operating and comprehensive advantages into full play. 3. On Further Opening Up Markets China's current market capacity and market openness are out of proportion, leaving us with the problem of "a large market with a low degree of openness." Except for industries, such as food, industrial and agricultural machinery, metal goods, toys, and sporting goods, where we have no restrictions on foreign investment, we subject all other industries to varying degrees of restrictions. It was suggested that except for projects that involve national security, military affairs, harm to physical health, or destruction of the ecology, all other industrial sectors should be opened up to foreign investment. As China's transnational enterprises have free access to foreign markets, foreign transnational corporations ought also to have relatively free access to the Chinese market. We should let capital- or technology-intensive transnational corporations sell part or all of their products on China's domestic market, and not put any hard limitations on their production scale. To attract high-tech and export-oriented joint ventures, local-content provisions (made-in-country provisions) and raw materials and parts import-restrictions should be eased. 4. On Encouraging Access by Transnational Service Companies As production activities and production services are closely linked, introducing transnational service companies will help to attract direct foreign investment in our manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, transnational service company access will promote competition in our local service-trade market, to stimulate tertiary industry growth. China should encourage foreign investment activity in banking, insurance, air carriers, communications, advisory service, accounting, quality authentication, and other commercial service sectors. When conditions are ripe, we should consider allowing foreign firms to set up trade subsidiaries, to be granted the authority to engage directly in foreign trade. 5. On Reforming Examination and Approval Formalities The Chinese Government revises its project catalog yearly and openly encourages the use of foreign investment, to guide foreign-investment orientation. We need examination and approval jurisdiction based on varying industrial categories instead of on varying overall investment provisions. While we have taken certain steps to speed up the examination and approval process (such as setting up a window investment-service center), the process still needs further streamlining, acceleration, and more transparency. The respective obligations of the central and local governments need to be set forth as clearly as possible in pertinent issued documents. Once a project is approved, the legal documents (such as joint-venture enterprise contracts) should be subject to only legitimate acceptance inspection. 6. On Making Policy-Related Laws and Regulations More Transparent All domestic laws and regulations directly relating to investment in China by foreign firms should be easy obtainable, or openly published. As this process has been started, it needs to be speeded up and continued. Such transparency will contribute on a nationwide basis to the continuity of business and trade policy, and to the consolidation and standardization of laws and regulations, to keep policies from being made in too many places. The current FIE Law should be dovetailed and matched with other laws. We now need to accelerate our formulation of laws and regulations such as a corporation law, an anti-monopoly law, an anti-dumping law, a fair competition law, and a joint-stock company law. As the Uruguay Round has expanded the GATT-standardization field to investment related to trade, we now need to conscientiously study ways to ensure that China's foreign-investment policy is more in line with pertinent GATT regulations and international practice, in order to get it on track with the international direct-investment market. 7. On Ensuring National Treatment Enterprises in China that are part of transnational corporations expect to be able to take part in fair competition on the Chinese market as Chinese enterprises. FIEs should be treated equally without discrimination just as China's state enterprises in areas, such as raw materials supply, prices, and loan acquisition. The government ought to eliminate subsidies and protection for state enterprises. 8. On Protecting IPRs While we have made great progess in protecting intellectual property rights [IPRs], we still need supplemental agencies and formalities that can effectively prevent trademark infringement and fake products (grey commodities). In this area, the Beijing IPR Court that was established in the summer of 1993 is a typical example of such actions that need taken. 9. On Foreign Exchange and Finance In order to help FIEs (particularly transnational corporations investing in large projects) balance their foreign exchange, to raise their foreign exchange availability, we should allow certain high-tech enterprises to collect foreign exchange directly when making domestic market sales; formalities for the acquisition of foreign exchange need to be made more effective. In this area, the greatest hopes are that foreign-exchange conversion markets throughout China will be coordinated, and that a transregional foreign-exchange-transaction computer network will be allowed to be linked up. A consolidated diversified exchange-rate system should be completed as much as possible, with the conditions created to make the yuan a convertible currency. As Vietnam was able to consolidate its currency conversion rates in such a short period of time, it is obvious that this problem is not mainly one of development level, but rather of policy. We should permit foreign banks to operate RMB services. Thee Chinese banking system needs to raise its work efficiency. As its current telegraphic accounts transfer that actually takes 3 weeks is unimaginable, foreign banks could provide technical assistance in this area. As about 50 percent of current global overseas investment is through stock markets, we ought to make securities investment a key means of attracting investment in China by transnational corporations. So it is suggested that we expand the offering of B shares by China's large and midsize listed state companies, to pave the way for access by transnational corporations through purchases; we should expand the experimental scope and offering volume of listed stock offerings by wholly foreign-owned or joint-venture joint-stock companies, with their listed offerings of B shares not subject to domestic restrictions on annual stock-offering volume. 10. On Upgrading Infrastructures The most important task is to reinforce our existing transport system, particularly the transport system that links up China's key cities. Raw materials arriving at our ports now require more than 1 month to get to consumers. Our public-transport scheduling is also very difficult, with it being very hard to know accurate delivery dates in railway transport, many water-transport stoppages, and our long-distance truck transport network being very incomplete, affecting timely and steady provision of products to customers and consumers. 11. On Increasing Labor Mobility Foreign subsidiaries in China should not be subject to obstructions in hiring qualified employees in any area, as well as being without wage-barrier restrictions, and FIE employees should have the right to take their dependents with them. In addition, as FIE local or foreign employees need better housing and related facilities, FIEs that want to improve their employee housing should be allowed to do so through having foreign construction companies do the building. Chinese employees of joint-venture enterprises who need to be sent abroad for training or to engage in commercial activities should be able to obtain very quickly the necessary travel documents (passports and visas); qualified FIE employees sent abroad should be trusted and, when necessary, be provided guarantees. 12. On Emphasizing Education and Training Education and training to develop host-country local human resources, to provide full categories of talent qualitatively and quantitatively, is one of the most important regional terms to attract transnational corporations (particularly high-tech companies). China needs to invest more resources in education and training at all levels, so that the efforts made by transnational corporations in the areas of technical and management training can be fully assimilated throughout China. We now need to focus on post-graduate training, in an attempt to ensure that China's younger generation has favorable qualifications for being more competitive in international business circles as the next century approaches. Transnational corporations need graduate students from schools, such as the China-Europe Management Center and the Nanjing U-John Hopkins China-U.S. Cultural Studies Center, to train into tomorrow's managers and leaders. 13. On Adopting International Criteria It is hoped that China will adopt international criteria to support the development of enterprises set up in China by transnational corporations. In particular, the Chinese Government should adopt current international safety and anti-pollution standards, applying them equally to state and foreign-invested enterprises; all industrial enterprises should adopt uniform international quality and engineering standards, in order to produce high-quality and high-standard raw materials and parts for supply to local purchases by FIEs. 14. On Macroeconomic Stability Transnational corporations are even more hopeful that China's economic development will be steady, and not just fast. Macroeconomic regulation and control needs to consist more of regular fine tuning, in order to keep the economy out of cyclical fluctuations of volatile overheating and overcooling. We need to note the currently existing severe inflation rate, rapid growth of the money supply, plummeting value of the yuan, enormous fiscal budget deficits, large amount of nonproductive real estate speculation and fund misplacement, and huge state-enterprise losses and subsidies. All of these problems are in need of serious government attention.
