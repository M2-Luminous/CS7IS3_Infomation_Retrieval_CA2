But it should be partnership on an equal basis," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in an exclusive interview with TASS on Sunday. "This has been and will be our concept in foreign policy," he stressed. The foreign minister, who was elected to the Russian Parliament's Lower House from the Murmansk constituency, arrived earlier in the day in this city in northern Russia on a trip related to his deputy's duties. Elaborating on Russia's role in the pan-European process, Kozyrev said: "We are not a weak country. We do not have any inferiority complexes. Therefore we are ready for cooperation with NATO as an equal partner." According to the Russian diplomat, the agreement on Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, was not signed in April as scheduled because of "the need to finalize the document offered to us." "I believe we will go ahead with signing not only this framework document, even not this framework document at all, but a broader and more comprehensive programme of cooperation between Russia and NATO," the foreign minister emphasised.
