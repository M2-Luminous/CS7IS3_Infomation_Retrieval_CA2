Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz Vielmann has said that, based on a request from the United States and Taiwan, the government agreed to do this "as a demonstration of cooperation with the OIM," but cautioned that "this decision must not be understood as setting a precedent." Vielmann told the media: "The cooperation being extended now does not constitute a manifestation of a policy in this regard." Guatemala will permit the ship Jinn Yinn I to dock at a Guatemalan port. The passengers, who have been traveling in very crowded conditions, comprise 102 Chinese [as received] who were intercepted without legal documents in waters off California by U.S. Coast Guard units. According to Vielmann, President Ramiro De Leon ordered the Foreign Relations, Government, and Defense Ministries to form a commission to coordinate details for the debarkation and "immediate deportation" of the travelers.
