Li Peng said the decision by the two governments to cooperate in building the Suzhou industrial park constitutes a major event in bilateral ties. This has provided a new pattern for and injected new ingredients into the economic cooperation between the two countries, Li Peng noted, adding that it is of positive significance in the deepening of the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. Li Peng expressed welcome to Premier Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew on their current visit to China and called them old friends of the Chinese people. He praised them for doing a lot of beneficial work to promote the development of the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Singapore. In the past two years, Li Peng said, the relations between China and Singapore have been developing smoothly and the two countries have conducted effective cooperation in various spheres. The conclusion of the agreement in a relatively short period of time demonstrates both sides' sincerity for cooperation, Li Peng said, adding that there will of course be much to be done after the agreement is signed. Li Peng said the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou area is a place propitious for giving birth to great men, with a favorable investment environment and labor of good quality. He expressed the belief that with the support of the two governments and close coordination between relevant departments of both bides, the industrial park will surely achieve fruitful results. Li Peng also briefed the guests on China's economic development last year and so far this year as well as on China's current reform measures on monetary, taxation, finance, and investment structures. He said that since last year, the country has experienced an unprecedented excellent momentum in attracting foreign investment, with the greater part of foreign investment going to basic industry and the sphere of investment expanded into tertiary industry. China is opening its market even wider to the outside world, Li Peng said, adding that it welcomes cooperation of every kind with entrepreneurs and financiers from Singapore and other countries. Goh Chok Tong and the other honorable guests arrived in Beijing this afternoon. During the meeting, he said he was pleased to have the opportunity of making a working visit to China, of attending the signing ceremony of the Suzhou industrial park, and of meeting with Premier Li Peng.
