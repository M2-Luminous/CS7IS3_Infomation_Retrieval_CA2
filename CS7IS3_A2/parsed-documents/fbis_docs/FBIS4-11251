If they were not, they would fly transportation airplanes or sell insurance. That is why when they find two helicopters flying in an exclusion zone it is not surprising that they would shoot their missiles and down their targets. The problem comes afterward, when they find out that the helicopters they downed were American, like the F-15's they were flying in. The 26 American, British, French, and Turkish men who died as a result of "friendly fire" in Iraq were truly victims of a series of mistakes that, considering the first reactions of the U.S. Government, will not be corrected very soon. The helicopters were downed in full daylight. Apparently the Friend or Foe Identification (IFF) systems of the two helicopters, which were being followed by earth radars and an AWACS, did not work. The equipment failure or the pilots' forgetfulness in turning it on was a fatal element, but not the only one. The F-15's made visual contact with the helicopters. They confused American Blackhawk helicopters with Soviet Hinds, but what is really strange is that they did not make any attempt to positively identify or scare away the transgressors from the exclusion area. This shows that the firing rules of the pilots who patrol northern Iraq are extremely strict and leave crucial decisions to the criteria of men submitted to extremely tense conditions. This time, the too-quick finger on the trigger took the lives of 26 fellow countrymen and allies. The tragedy was the result of two prior decisions. The first one, reflected in U.S. interventions in the past few years, lies in the belief in air power as a solution to political problems. Was it necessary to protect the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south? Two air exclusion zones were established and whatever flew there was to be downed. Are the Serbs not bombing Sarajevo and Gorazde? Down them and silence their artillery with air-to-ground fire. No matter how technologically advanced the American air arsenal may be, it cannot solve what should be solved by politics. The situation of the Kurds, the Shiites, and the Iraqis in Iraq and the Moslems in Bosnia will only be solved when somebody presents, at the appropriate moment, a peace plan attending to the needs of all parties. The use of the Air Force may in some cases speed up the moment to which we are referring. But its use will always imply siding with one party, and this decision cannot be made independently of the conflict's context. The United States and NATO cannot pretend that the air exclusion and confiscation of heavy weapons are part of an ideal quest for peace and nothing else. These measures reduce the military capability of the Serbs without interrupting the hostilities. And when the Serbs realize the limitations of the use of air power -- estranged from an efficient policy -- they attempt to reduce or annul the threat. When attacked from the air, the Serbs in Bosnia began to treat the UN land forces as hostages and a foreign army that needs special permission to move. From there to the recovery of the confiscated weapons was nothing but a small step. In Iraq the Kurds were used as a pretext to create conditions that were believed to lead to the downfall of Saddam Husayn. The Iraqi dictator is only one of the Kurds' enemies. The other enemies are the governments of Turkey, Iran, and Russia, countries where the Kurdish nation is disseminated. The Kurdish nation will only be able to build its desired national state through the breaking away of one or several of these countries, which is something practically unthinkable. Thus, the objective of the exclusion zone is to prevent Saddam Husayn from controlling the entire Iraqi territory. Ever since the exclusion zone was imposed, the Kurds in Iraq have been bombed by the Turkish Air Force, a U.S. ally through NATO. The 26 Americans, British, French, and Turks did not die to protect the lives of the Kurds. They were the victims of a confusing and inconsistent policy.
