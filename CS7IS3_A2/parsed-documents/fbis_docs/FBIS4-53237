It was a just anti-imperialist, anti-fascist resistance to thwart the criminal acts of the U.S. imperialists and their servants the Chon Tu-hwan-No Tae-u fascist group and achieve independence, democracy and reunification, and a mass armed uprising in which the people fought a death-defying struggle in the teeth of repression by huge armed forces. NODONG SINMUN says the uprising left a precious lesson that if the South Korean people are to smash the armed crackdown of the oppressors and win a final victory, they must courageously wage an all-people anti-U.S. struggle for independence to terminate the colonial rule of the United States. The news analyst says: It was the lesson learned by the Kwangju resistance fighters and South Korean people at the cost of blood and the sum total of the struggle that as long as the United States occupies South Korea and the flunkeyist traitors and bellicose elements remain in power, independence, democracy and reunification cannot be expected nor can the scourge of nuclear war be averted. The South Korean students and people of all walks of life must firmly unite under the banner of anti-imperialism and independence and more vigorously wage the anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuclear weapon struggle to overthrow the vicious colonial rule of the United States, establish the sovereignty of the nation, check and frustrate the nuclear war provocation moves of the United States and realise peace and security. All parties, groupings and people of South Korea and overseas compatriots must courageously wage a nationwide struggle to reunify the country through a confederacy in accordance with the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the lodestar of national reunification, actively support the patriotic proposal of the North for the convocation of a national conference and turn out as one in the efforts to realise it. An analyst of MINJU CHOSON warns that if the Kim Yong-sam group fails to lend an ear to the voices of the people and thoroughly and correctly solve the Kwangju problem, it will encounter a greater resistance of the people.
