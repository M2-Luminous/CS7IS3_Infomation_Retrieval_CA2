Our ambassador in Kabul met heads of some of the conflicting groups yesterday and expressed our country's readiness to mediate between the belligerent groups to end the conflict and establish peace and tranquility in Afghanistan. The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly expressed its concern over any conflict in Afghanistan, whatever its reason, and supports a political solution. The Iranian nation and Government, acting according to their canonical duties, supported the just struggles by the mojahedin during the 14 years of their jehad against the communists and extended financial and material assistance to it. During the same period, they also hosted 2 million Afghan refugees. The Afghan mojahedin's victory in the war against blasphemy and atheism made the Iranian nation happy, since expectations then were that Islamic rule in Afghanistan would be established and the two Muslim neighboring countries, which share historic, religious, and cultural characteristics, could live in tranquility next to each other. Despite these expectations, bloody clashes among rival groups that once fought against the communists on one front, concerned the Iranian nation. So, the Iranian Government--as a friendly, neighboring, and Muslim country--considers it its duty to spare no effort to end the conflict in that country. Islamic Iran has always wanted Afghanistan's unity and territorial integrity and, having adopted a policy of not interfering in others' domestic affairs, it considers cooperating and coordinating with friendly Muslim countries to overcome their problems to be among the principles of its foreign policy. Afghanistan is facing state organizational problems, problems in economic reconstruction and in establishing social law and order, the problem of refugees, and fuel and food problems. The Islamic Republic of Iran has always expressed its readiness to help the Afghan nation to overcome any need it has. Hopefully, cooperation by friendly, Muslim, and neighboring countries can help to end the clashes in Afghanistan and stability and tranquility can be returned to Afghanistan. But success in this calls for cooperation and coordination among the jehadi forces.
