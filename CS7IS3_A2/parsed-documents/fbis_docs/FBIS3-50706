The bodies of Zapatista guerrillas in the streets of this town, with 8,000 residents, are a testimony of the bitter fighting that took place. Journalists have verified that Army Infantry Battalions 17 and 73 occupied the city Wednesday morning. Journalists have counted 37 bodies, apparently members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN], which seized Ocosingo. Most of the dead had head wounds. Inside the Municipal Marketplace, where the stench of death pervades the environment, 12 bodies laid. Next to some of them were wooden rifles turned into rudimentary bayonets. Armed Forces personnel at the site refused to comment, and no official report on the number of casualties has been made. According to certain reports, however, more than 100 people could have died in Ocosingo. The townspeople, who had been hiding for three days, took to the streets this morning with white flags to inspect the damage. They covered their noses to avoid the stench. The mayor's office, located in the main square, and its interior were burned to a cinder. The neighboring bank saw the same fate, and the facades of many buildings are riddled with bullet holes. Resident Jorge Gomez said that "there were several hundred guerrillas, and they only brought us misfortune." According to several witnesses, some of the rebels were heavily armed, but others--mostly young Indians--carried only old rifles or machetes. According to these witnesses, the leaders were not Mexican but Guatemalan and Salvadoran. Jorge Gomez added: "I think the peasants were fooled by professional guerrillas who led them to a carnage." The road leading to San Cristobal de las Casas and Ocosingo was blocked with felled trees and large rocks. The Army was all but absent. Nevertheless, the presence of the Armed Forces around San Cristobal was heavy, and the press was barred from that road on Wednesday.
