This notice also announces a 60-day public comment period. The REDs for the chemicals listed above are the Agency's formal regulatory assessments of the health and environmental data base of the subject chemicals and present the Agency's determination regarding which pesticidal uses are eligible for reregistration. DATES: Written comments on the REDs must be submitted by January 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of comments identified with the docket number ``OPP&hyph;00392'' and the case number (noted above), should be submitted to: By mail: OPP Pesticide Docket, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Agency has issued Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) documents for the pesticidal active ingredients listed above. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended in 1988, EPA is conducting an accelerated reregistration program to reevaluate existing pesticides to make sure they meet current scientific and regulatory standards. The data base to support the reregistration of each of the chemicals listed above is substantially complete. EPA has determined that all currently registered products subject to reregistration containing these active ingredients are eligible for reregistration. All registrants of products containing one or more of the above listed active ingredients have been sent the appropriate RED documents and must respond to labeling requirements and product-specific data requirements (if applicable) within 8 months of receipt. Products containing other active ingredients will not be reregistered until those other active ingredients are determined to be eligible for reregistration. The reregistration program is being conducted under Congressionally mandated time frames, and EPA recognizes both the need to make timely reregistration decisions and to involve the public. Therefore, EPA is issuing these REDs as final documents with a 60-day comment period. Although the 60-day public comment period does not affect the registrant's response due date, it is intended to provide an opportunity for public input and a mechanism for initiating any necessary amendments to the RED. All comments will be carefully considered by the Agency. If any comment significantly affects a RED, EPA will amend the RED by publishing the amendment in the Federal Register . Dated: October 31, 1994. Louis True, Acting Director, Special Review and Reregistration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs.
