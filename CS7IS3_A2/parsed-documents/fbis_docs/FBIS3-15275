Observers point to the rigid tone of Boris Yeltsin's statement. In accordance with the political amnesty resolution, the defendants figuring in the trial over the organizers of last-October's disturbances, among them Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov, were freed from the Lefortovo jail last Saturday. Yeltsin said that the crime situation was very serious in Russia and that organized crime had risen to an inter-reguional and international levels. Russian criminals are penetrating into the former Soviet republics and foreign countries, he said. Yeltsin believes that this is tied to the Russian law enforcement bodies' inefficient work. He said that he attached great importance to the federal program of combating crime for 1994-95 which will be discussed by the Security Council. "The Russian citizens must be confident that the government can be effective against crime," he said. IF [INTERFAX] Note: In his February 24th message to parliament the president said that the implementation of measures planned in the program is connected with corresponding financing, which will compel Russia's parliament to take "hard budgetary decisions. No matter how hard the economic situation in the country is, there is a need to do all in human power to satisfy the most urgent financial and material requirements of the law-enforcement agencies," Yeltsin stressed. In his message the president points to the need to dismantle interdepartment barriers and liquidate the legal and organizational confusion in the work of the law-enforcement agencies. He also mentions the need to form in the structure of the Interior Ministry a strictly centralized system of units for combating organized crime, and provide them without delay with the best personnel, equipment and finances.
