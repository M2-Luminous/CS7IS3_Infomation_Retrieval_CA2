First to comment was former General Luigi Caligaris, who could assume a post (foreign affairs or defense) in a future Berlusconi government. Caligaris stated that he was against NATO intervention in the skies over Bosnia: "The deterrence function of NATO aircraft above Gorazde," Caligaris stated, "has no influence once the situation on the ground is uncontrollable. The political world," the general added, "must show that it is willing to intervene in this situation. However, it does not wish to risk a ground operation which, at the present time, no one is in a position to undertake." The United States itself, according to Caligaris, is afraid of getting mixed up in an operation which could last for years and result in a large number of human casualties. The sole solution to the problem should come, in the opinion of the Forza Italia expert, from a political intervention aimed at the protagonists, "as is currently being done." The Northern League, on the other hand, has come out in favor of a hard line in Bosnia and "approves and supports Butrus-Ghali's and NATO's firmness in having the UN ultimatums respected." Christian Monti, League foreign affairs spokesman, stated that "the NATO bombardments of Gorazde are nothing more than the logical and necessary implementation of the UN resolution, following the umpteenth violation by the Serbs of the ultimatum issued to safeguard the Bosnian community." Meanwhile, Forza Italia parliamentarians meeting in Fiuggi yesterday approved an agenda reminding the Ciampi government of the need "not to prejudice, by irreversible actions, the question of Slovenia and Croatia's accession to the European Union." The agenda, promoted by Antonietta Vascon, an Istrian refugee and deputy for Trieste, emphasizes that this is a question which "involves" the rights of 350,000 exiles from Istria and Dalmatia and Italian minorities in these states. Forza Italia reminded the government "of its duty to stick strictly to day-to-day administrative responsibilities." According to Forza Italia, "the government which is in power for a few days longer, and which is an expression of political balances that have been displaced by the popular vote, has, in recent weeks, made decisions which prejudice, at times irreversibly, questions which are delicate and frequently crucial to future developments." For this reason the Forza Italia parliamentarians "give warning that this practice must be stopped immediately out of respect for the most elementary democratic principles." "Very great satisfaction" at Vascon's agenda, also supported by Berlusconi, was expressed by lawyer Paolo Sardos Albertini, president of the Federation of Istrian, Fiume, and Dalmatian exiles.
