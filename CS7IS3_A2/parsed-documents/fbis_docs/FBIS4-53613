This is the first time that a senior government official spoke in favor of having veto power equal to that of the five existing member countries--the United States, Russia, China, the UK, and France. Germany has also expressed hope that it would become a permanent UNSC member with veto power. But the senior official added he would not be too insistent on having veto rights.
