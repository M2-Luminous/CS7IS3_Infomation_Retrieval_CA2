Getting Mr. Yeltsin to line up with Washington is no big achievement for Mr. Clinton. Moscow showed its eagerness to join the United States and other members of the Nuclear Club to force India and Pakistan to sign the NPT or a regional treaty even during the Republican regime in Washington. American support is so vital for Mr. Clinton to survive politically even in his own country that his international views will be suspect, especially in India which has experienced his ability to go back on a contract (on cryogenic rocket engine technology), a feat unusual for the President of a great country like Russia. The Russian concurrence with the US on forcing India to give up its nuclear and missiles programmes should not be taken as an irrepressible pacifist urge. Its logic is to kowtow to the US, and its net impact is to endorse the American approach of being even-handed towards India and Pakistan. This, in practice, has been a smokescreen for pursuing a policy of not to let India grow in power. Even before the Moscow declaration, it had been the consistent Western policy to magnify the threat of Pakistan's nuclear capability which, as the world knows, was developed within reasonable knowledge of Washington. It is pertinent to ask: Did the US show an intemperate concern about Iraq's nuclear capability because it posed a threat to Israel, and did not show a comparable anxiety at Pakistan's nuclear programme because it was aimed at India, and not Tel Aviv? Pakistan has declared on several occasions that it would sign the NPT only if India did so. This country-specific approach does not worry the US, but Larry Pressler's country-specific law for a nuclear Pakistan causes great unease in the State Department. Washington's partisan approach on nuclear and missile issues is likely to raise complex bilateral questions between New Delhi and Washington. By getting Mr. Yeltsin's consent, Mr. Clinton may have formally mobilised additional international support for non-proliferation, but it need not necessarily force India's hands. The time has come for India to tell the US that it is prepared to discuss the nuclear question, but unencumbered by what Pakistan did or did not do in the matter. In fact, the US must learn how to deal with India without the Pakistan factor for any reasonable success in achieving a convergence of views on key issues. On the question of NPT, the crucial question is discrimination. Neither the US nor others in the Nuclear Club show an inclination to address this matter. Without doing so, the charge of intransigence against India is so much of nonsense. If a government in New Delhi were to succumb to pressure and sign the NPT against national consensus, its continuance would be in jeopardy under an onslaught of ultranationalist forces. It will be unfortunate if this were to happen.
