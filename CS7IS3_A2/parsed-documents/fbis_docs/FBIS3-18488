Sweden, Finland and Austria yesterday signalled acceptance of the terms offered for their entry to the European Union [EU]. If the deal is endorsed in the promised referendums, the EU's borders will be extended from next January east to the Russian frontier and north beyond the Arctic Circle. The inclusion of these three rich, stable democracies ends the long and unfortunate exclusion of Scandinavia and the Alps from the political and economic mainstream. Apart from Denmark, no country from Europe's northernmost tier has been able to bring to the continental union its enormous assets: a rich history, a vibrant culture, a deeply embedded commitment to democracy, a disproportionate influence within the United Nations and a moral outreach far beyond the lakes and forests of its isolated region. Britain has long pressed for their inclusion; enlargement of the Community was the main task the British presidency set itself. Federalists feared that widening would prevent deepening and would dilute the cohesion of the cosy continental club. If this was ever true, it only strengthened the argument for enlargement. British sympathy for its former partners in the European Free Trade Association may have played a part, as may the unvoiced hope that northern Protestant rectitude would be a useful counterbalance to the more excitable political traditions of the Mediterranean. The disappointment yesterday was that only three instead of four applicants were able to clinch agreement. Hours after the expiration of Monday's midnight deadline, Austria was still locked in tense negotiations, mostly over its insistence on keeping a limit for the next 10 years on heavy lorries crossing the Alps, worries that alpine chalets will be snapped up by non-Austrians and difficulties in compensating high-cost mountain farmers who must cut prices to EU levels. But at the last moment a deal was struck. Norway, by contrast, was always the most problematic applicant. It has admitted deadlock and put off further discussions until next week. Its failure to conclude a deal would be deeply disappointing. Even the Austrian Government, once buoyed by public opinion, has seen a steady fall in support for membership as one issue after another -- the environment, traditional neutrality, disillusion over Brussels bureaucracy and a growing right-wing Austria-first nationalism -- has undermined the case for membership. Norway, on the rim of Europe, is a much more difficult case. Norwegians, separate from Sweden for less than a century, care passionately about their sovereignty, their fisheries and their simple way of life on their sparse, long northern coastline. All are under threat, and the Spanish demand for access to Norwegian fishing waters may be the last straw that turns a suspicious public against any outcome. Once before Norway has fallen at the final hurdle. Another rebuff would so scar the political establishment that no Oslo government might be able to contemplate membership again. Even in Finland and Sweden, public opinion cannot yet be taken for granted. Finland is probably now the most pro-membership, converted by its current recession and the new security threat from an unstable Russia. If a referendum is held here first, the result might encourage wavering Swedish and Austrian voters. All four countries have made substantial concessions to accept the entire EU post-Maastricht deal. Brussels must now do its utmost to offer terms that Norway can accept. A wider union is a better union, one that in the future must also include Central and East Europe.
