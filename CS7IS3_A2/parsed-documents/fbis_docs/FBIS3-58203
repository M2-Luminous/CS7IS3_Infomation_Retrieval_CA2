What President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev have said is "potentially imperialistic," said CDU foreign policy spokesman Karl Lamers on 6 January. He called upon the West, and above all Germany, "to show" Russia that one could not only be a partner, but "also an opponent." Lamers accused Yeltsin and Kozyrev of exerting political and economic pressure on Russia's neighbor states and of using its armed forces for "intimidation" in some cases, such as the Baltics and the Caucasus. Moscow was only interested in "ensuring maximum influence," said Lamers. To prevent the West from extending NATO to the Russian border, the Russian leadership was using "the West's concerns" about a new Russian imperialism "as an instrument," said Lamers a few days prior to the NATO summit in Brussels on 10 January, which will discuss a possible opening up of the alliance to the East.
