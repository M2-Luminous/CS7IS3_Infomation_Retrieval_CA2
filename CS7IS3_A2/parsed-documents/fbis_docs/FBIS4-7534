We asked Alexandr Vondra for details. [CESKY DENIK] Deputy Minister, have there been any agreements signed yet to regulate the local borderland traffic [maly pohranicni styk] and the state-border problems? [Vondra] Not so far. Both agreements were discussed at the expert level. In the instance of the so-called large-scale border treaty, the Czech Government already expressed its approval of the text, and all that is left to do is to decide by whom, where, and when the agreement will be signed. The agreement on the local borderland traffic that deals, above all, with the problem of tourist zones and paths crossing the common border is almost finished, and only some technical details must still be approved. [CESKY DENIK] How will the joint clearance at the border be expedited? [Vondra] The treaty on the simplification of the border clearance in railroad, highway, and water transport between the Czech Republic and the FRG is almost finished. The treaty assumes the establishment of joint clearance facilities for the customs and passport control on either side of the border. A gradual increase in the number of border crossings also contributes to expediting the border clearance between the two countries. [CESKY DENIK] Will the regime be altered at the state border in connection with complaints from the German side concerning criminal activities, for instance, by Czech citizens on the German side? [Vondra] The regime at our common border will be defined in detail by the aforementioned treaty regulations. The treaty on cooperation in the struggle against organized crime, which was signed already in 1991, deals with the eradication of crime transgressing the border. The effectiveness of the detection and punishment of crime is improved also, for instance, by the possibility of direct contact between the Bavarian and the Czech police. An intergovernment agreement on cooperation of police bodies is also in the works. [CESKY DENIK] Has there been any discussion regarding the use of names of communities in two languages? [Vondra] After the latest talks with Dieter Kastrup, state secretary at the FRG Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it seems that a solution to this controversial problem was found that is acceptable to both sides. I expect that, following the appropriate internal talks on both sides, the problem of using local names in joint documents will be definitively solved. At this time, I do not wish to discuss the details of the solution.
