Artillery fire on Teslic caused considerable material damage, a statement said. It also noted that one member of a Moslem commando-terrorist group was liquidated and several were wounded when this group attempted to infiltrate the Serb territory around Teslic. All the Moslem attacks were repelled, and the Moslem forces forced to withdraw, the statement said. The Serbs in Doboj have been for over a month under sustained Moslem fire and suffered high casualties among the civilian population. As part of a general offensive on the Serb territories launched in late March, the Moslems especially stepped up combat activity against Doboj in an attempt to cut the Serb corridor in northern Bosnia linking eastern and western parts of the R.S. The Moslem forces opened antiaircraft artillery and infantry fire also on the positions of the R.S. army around Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf) in central Bosnia, the statement said.
