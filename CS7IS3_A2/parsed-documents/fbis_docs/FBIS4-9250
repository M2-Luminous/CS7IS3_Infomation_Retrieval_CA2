FBIS4-9250 "dreeu078__a94032" FBIS-EEU-94-078-A Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Uhde Comments on Coalition Debate on Senate Uhde Comments on Coalition Debate on Senate AU2004163694 Prague CTK in English 1543 GMT 20 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2004163694 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Hradec Kralove, East Bohemia April 20 (CTK) -- Czech Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde today described the government coalition's ability to agree on the method for elections to the Senate as a "test of its maturity." At a press conference here today, Uhde (Civic Democratic Party -- ODS) said that ODS deputies had voted for a Constitution which embeds the creation of the Senate, the upper chamber of the Czech parliament yet to be established. "If the coalition agrees on a principle for the election law to the Senate... the whole problem is over," Uhde said. Then it would only be necessary to "find a suitable term for the elections to take place -- 1995 or 1996." From the outset, said Uhde, considerations were apparent that, if the Senate were not created, Czechs would "get accustomed to its absence." Uhde dislikes the idea of abandoning the creation of a Senate simply because of the failure to agree on an election method. The government proposal of the election law to the parliament's Chamber of Deputies and the Senate envisages the creation of 81 constituencies, with one Senator being elected to each of them. Premier Vaclav Klaus's ruling ODS is pushing for this variant, but the other coalition partners -- the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) -- oppose it.
