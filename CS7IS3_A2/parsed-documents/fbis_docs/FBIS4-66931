Such is the position taken by the Russian diplomacy on the pact for stability in Europe which is planned to be signed on 26-27 May in Paris, as members of the Russian delegation that took part in a preparatory meeting of senior officials held in Athens on Thursday told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. The meeting was attended by delegations from almost all European countries, the United States and Canada, as well as seven international organizations including the United Nations, CSCE, the European Commission, WEU [Western European Union] and NATO. The CIS countries were represented by delegations from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. Armenia and Azerbaijan were present as observers. [passage omitted: initiative of the pact was originally proposed by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, and later became an EC project] As ITAR-TASS correspondent learned, Russian diplomatic circles are especially concerned about the question of borders. Russia believes that this question should be considered only on the basis of such fundamental principles of the CSCE as inviolability of the borders, respect for territorial integrity of the states and their sovereignty. [passage omitted: general topics under consideration at the conference included questions of national minorities and setting up regional negotiation tables for the Baltic and Central European regions]
