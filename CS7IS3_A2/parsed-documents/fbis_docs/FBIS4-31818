Martic said that RSK representatives have so far not taken part in the work of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia regarding succession issues. Martic said that no newly-created state in the territory of ex-Yugoslavia, including RSK, can be excluded from the succession talks. He asked Owen and Stoltenberg to mediate in the resolution of the problem of the deposits of RSK citizens in Ljubljanska Banka, one of the major commercial banks in the former Yugoslavia which was located in Ljubljana, capital of Slovenia, to prevent Slovenia from transferring the funds to the account of the state of Croatia. RSK was proclaimed by the local Serbs in 1991 in their ancestral lands in Croatia in response to its violent secession from the former Yugoslav federation and the downgrading of their status. RSK is a U.N. protected area since March 1992.
