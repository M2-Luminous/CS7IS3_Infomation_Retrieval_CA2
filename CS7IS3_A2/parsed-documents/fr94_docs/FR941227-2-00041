FR941227-2-00041 FR941227-2-00034 [Docket No. RP95&hyph;88&hyph;000] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.; Notice of Tariff Modification Filing December 20, 1994. Take notice that on December 15, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), filed revised tariff sheets in which Tennessee proposes a series of tariff corrections, clarifications and modifications of its Fifth Revised Natural Gas Tariff, Volume No. I. Tennessee further states that the revised tariff sheets are a result of its discovery over the course of its first year under restructuring and in administering its capacity release program of a number of ambiguities in its Tariff as well as a number of typographical and formatting errors. Tennessee has also identified various minor tariff modifications that appear appropriate with the benefit of hindsight and experience. Tennessee states that these tariff modifications are proposed with the overall intent of enhancing service to Tennessee's customers. Tennessee requests that the revised tariff sheets be accepted and allowed to go into effect on February 1, 1995. Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a petition to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214. All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before December 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to this proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file and available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
