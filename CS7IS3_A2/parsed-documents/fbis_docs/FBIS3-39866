Like the interior minister, Ciller also described the DEP people as traitors. After meeting Catherine Lalumiere, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, the prime minister participated in the meeting of her party's parliamentary group. Saying that she wants to draw attention to incidents that have troubled the public in recent days, Ciller went on to discuss the DEP deputies. [Ciller] Neither our lofty parliament nor the True Path Party will allow the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] to take shelter under the roof of that lofty parliament. [Kilinc] Indicating that DEP deputies are hiding behind their immunity, the prime minister added: [Ciller] The decision that has passed the commissions is now before the lofty parliament, which will do what is necessary on this issue. We, the True Path Party, will take the lead on this issue. [Kilinc] There was uproar in the hall when she addressed DEP leader Hatip Dicle as mister. [Ciller amid shouts from the floor of: He is a traitor] Yes, he is a traitor. [Kilinc] Ciller said that with his statement after the incident at Tuzla, DEP leader Hatip Dicle openly violated his parliamentary oath. The coalition partner SHP [Social Democratic Populist Party] did not support the prime minister in the debate on lifting the immunity of the deputies from the southeast. Speaking to his party group meeting, SHP leader Murat Karayalcin did not express his views on the immunity of DEP deputies. He later replied to questions from Kanal-6's correspondent. Karayalcin said that during the voting on the report on DEP deputies, SHP deputies will vote according to their personal preferences. The SHP leader also indicated that, in principle, his party group does not consider it appropriate to lift immunity on political grounds.
