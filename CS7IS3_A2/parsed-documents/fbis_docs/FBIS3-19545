Our correspondent Antigona Qena reports: [Qena] A grand protest rally attended by more than 2,000 Albanians was held in the square of Oslo University, at the very center of the city. Fatmir Zymberi, chairman of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] branch in Oslo, opened the rally. Pointing out that these are difficult times -- when the Academy of Sciences and the Albanological Intitute are being closed and the school buildings are kept occupied in the violently conquered Kosova -- among other things, Zyberi made an appeal to the Albanians not to think of themselves, but to raise their voice, wherever they are, about the free and sovereign Kosova. A petition demanding the granting of nationhood to Kosova, banning the Serbian terror against the Albanian population in Kosova, demilitarizing Kosova, and placing it under an international protectorate was also read. From this rally, the petition was sent to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, NATO, the president of the Norwegian Parliament, and the Norwegian prime minister and foreign minister. Then well-wishers of the Albanian people greeted the rally. Professor Bergefuehre, who was in Kosova some time ago, addressed a harsh protest to the Norwegian Government to change its policy toward the Serbian Government and accept the nationhood of the Republic of Kosova to prevent a massacre that the spread of war could bring there. Jon Brotnes, the Albanian honorary consul in Norway, reminded that Albanians are the most ancient people in the Balkans. They will win their sovereignty, with or without the Serbs' consent, because history is with them. Parliamentarian Soldi Ksajli from the Christian Democratic Party greeted the protest. She has been to Kosova and, terrified by the situation she saw there, she appealed to the Norwegian Government for understanding and assistance. She promised that her own party will organize humanitarian aid in food and medications. Erling Forplatz from the so-called Red Alliance Party supported the protest. He asked that the Norwegian Parliament exert pressure on the Serbian state to grant sovereignty and return freedom to impoverished Kosova, and together with Kosova, to the people who emigrated to the four ends of the Earth.
