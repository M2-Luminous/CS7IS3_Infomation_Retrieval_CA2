In an interview with journalists on Thursday, Chachua explained his call by the fact that the state of emergency imposed in the city on September 20, 1993 for two months and then prolonged for another two months has failed to restore law and order and combat crime in the capital. Chachua stressed that at least 15,000 to 20,000 people are needed to keep up order in the city. At present the total number of Interior Ministry and regional police troops in the whole republic does not exceed 25,000 people. Chachua said that during the state of emergency law enforcement bodies have confiscated 160 sub-machine guns, six machine guns, three grenade launchers, about 70 grenades, large amounts of ammunition and explosives and even one large-caliber gun from an armoured personnel carrier. One to two out of 100 crimes reported in Tbilisi are committed at night when a curfew is in effect, the commandant said.
