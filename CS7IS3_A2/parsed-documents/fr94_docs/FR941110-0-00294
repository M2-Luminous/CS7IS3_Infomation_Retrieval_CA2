FR941110-0-00294 FR941110-0-00018 Spermolepis hawaiiensis is known from various vegetation types, including 'ohi'a forests, 'A'ali'i Lowland Dry Shrubland, cultivated fields, and pastures between about 300 and 600 m (1,000 and 2,000 ft) in elevation (HHP 1992L2, 1992L8, 1992L9; HPCC 1991n). Associated plant species include 'ilima, Doryopteris sp., Gouania hillebrandii , and the alien plant, Leucaena leucocephala (koa haole) (HHP 1992L1). The primary threats to Spermolepis hawaiiensis are habitat degradation by axis deer and competition with the alien plant, koa haole. Vigna o-wahuensis (Oahu vigna) was described by T. Vogel in 1836 from a specimen from the Waianae Mountains of Oahu (Gray 1854). In 1854, Gray described another species, Vigna sandwicensis , for which Rock later designated two varieties: var. heterophylla and var. sandwicensis (Rock 1920b). The currently accepted treatment places V. sandwicensis in synonymy under V. o-wahuensis (Geesink et al. 1990). Vigna o-wahuensis , a member of the pea family, is a slender twining annual or perennial herb with fuzzy stems that grows to 0.4 m (1.3 ft) in length. Each leaf is made up of three leaflets that vary in shape from round to linear, are 1.2 to 8 cm (0.5 to 3 in) long and 0.1 to 2.5 cm (0.04 to 1 in) wide, and are sparsely or moderately covered with coarse hairs. Flowers, in clusters of one to four, have thin, translucent, pale yellow or greenish yellow petals about 2 to 2.5 cm (0.8 to 1 in) long. The two lowermost petals are fused and appear distinctly beaked. The sparsely hairy calyx is 4 to 8 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long with asymmetrical lobes that measure about 3 mm (0.1 in) long. The fruits are long slender pods 4 to 9 cm (1.6 to 3.5 in) long and about 5 mm (0.2 in) wide, that may or may not be slightly inflated and contain 7 to 15 gray to black seeds less than 6 mm (0.2 in) long. This species differs from others in the genus by its thin yellowish petals, sparsely hairy calyx, and thin pods which may or may not be slightly inflated (Geesink et al. 1990). Historically, Vigna o-wahuensis was known from Niihau and from an unspecified location on Kauai (HHP 1992m10, 1992m16). On Oahu, this taxon was known from between Waimanalo and Makapuu Point, the Mokulua Islets, and the Waianae Mountains (HHP 1992m13 to 1992m15, 1992m20). On Maui, Vigna o-wahuensis was known from an unspecified site on West Maui and from Makawao, Waiakoa, and Haleakala on East Maui (HHP 1992m2 to 1992m4, 1992m25). There are no currently known populations on Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, or Maui. On Molokai, Vigna o-wahuensis was known historically from the western end of the island in the vicinity of Ilio Point (HHP 1992m18). On Lanai, this species occurred historically at scattered locations across the island's southern half (HHP 1992m5, 1992m6, 1992m8, 1992m9, 1992m17). On the island of Hawaii, this taxon was known from Mauna Loa and Kau at unspecified sites (HHP 1992m1, 1992m19, 1992m24).
