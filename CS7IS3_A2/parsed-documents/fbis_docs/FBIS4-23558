Jose Francisco Goncalves, head of the Organization and Mobilization Department, who once again contacted us in Milange, reiterated that they want money for Udemo, otherwise they will attack government and Renamo military positions. They are awaiting a reply from the president of the republic. We tried to contact Phiri in Milange, and we were told that the meeting could only take place on the Namuli mountain. Out of the 2,000 Udemo soldiers said to be confined with government soldiers, we saw only 500 in the Milange assembly area. We learned that FAM [Mozambique Armed Forces] soldiers born in that region are not awaiting orders for the official demobilization. Many have already gone home. Goncalves added that "we have been meeting along the way" with MYP [Malawi Young Pioneers] members from bases located in Malawi's Thyolo District, mixed with Renamo personnel. He alleged that these are Young Pioneers, which Renamo calls Rombezia [Rovuma-Zambezia separatist movement] Movement, located in Zambezia Province's Lugela District. Goncalves says: "Rombezia existed and disappeared in the 70s." He said, "We have also requested Mr. Dhlakama to withdraw his men, who for two months have been moving in our area in Namuli." Colonel Elias Dhlakama, based in the Renamo assembly area in Sabelua, has categorically refuted the existence of MYP elements in his movement's bases. On the emergence of Rombezia, he said: "There might be something." He said: "These bandits can only be the creation of Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front], such as Naparama [Government- sponsored counterinsurgency unit] and Phiri's men. They have always bet on people bent on destroying Renamo." The civilian sources we contacted in Milange said they have not detected area any movement of the so-called Rombezia in the area. On this issue they only know what the press has been reporting.
