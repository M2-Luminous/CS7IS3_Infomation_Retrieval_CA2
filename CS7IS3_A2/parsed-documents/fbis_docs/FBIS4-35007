"If the United States is negotiating the membership of other countries in NAFTA it is because its two partners agree," Menem told Canadian congressmen, who asked him to define his position on the country which they describe as "the elephant that sleeps by our side." Apparently, Menem's answer did not please the leader of Congress. He told him that if he had trouble negotiating with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], he "can seek our advice." All this was said amid smiles. Today, Menem will watch the Argentine soccer team play its first match in the World Soccer Cup, one of the reasons that prompted him to travel to these latitudes. One activity on his official agenda is to watch the Argentine national soccer team play Greece. Menem will attend the next match, against Nigeria, from a seat in the stadium in Boston. A few months ago, Menem planned to attend the matches of the Argentine national team in the United States, so a meeting with Clinton was slated. Following the electoral setback last April, however, Menem changed his mind and canceled everything. A little later, in May, he again changed his mind and he tried to resume the original agenda. "So far nothing has been arranged," Menem said about his possible meeting with Clinton while Argentine delegation sources gave the meeting "a 0.01-percent chance," adding that if it happens it will be a "real surprise for everyone." And so it was. Sweeping aside all pessimistic forecasts, it was later learned that Clinton would receive Menem on 24 June at the White House. Perhaps with the Constituent Assembly in mind, Menem made an observation about the role of the vice president. He recalled the resignation of his predecessor Raul Alfonsin, saying that in that case, "it would have been logical for the vice president to take charge." Menem made more definitions: - The Argentine proposal to send troops to the Bosnian front stands, even if congressional approval is necessary. "Every Argentine soldier knows his mission is to defend peace and to reinstate it where it is lost," Menem said. A decision on this subject is imminent. "Perhaps next week," Menem said. - Argentina will sign an agreement next week for the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. - Argentina may join NAFTA, but has yet to be invited to do so. Menem said it would best be to invite the whole of Mercosur to join. NAFTA was one of the points discussed during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. The Argentine Government invited a Canadian delegation to visit Buenos Aires to explain its position regarding the trade agreement with the United States and Mexico. Although it belongs to NAFTA, Canada has some disagreements with Washington and is attempting to counterbalance Washington's enormous weight by bringing new members into the group. Most of Menem's entourage members kept an eye on Washington. "The fast track [preceding two words in English] was approved, the fast track was approved!" someone said in a low voice regarding the U.S. Government petition to speed up in Congress a list, which has yet to be drafted, of countries that could join NAFTA. Will Argentina be included? The impression of entourage members yesterday was yes, but they doubt if the status given to Argentina "will be the same as that given to Chile... which will be on better terms." Menem wants to broaden his enthusiasm for sport. "I may soon begin to play rugby," Menem told the members of a national softball team that is playing in a championship here and who invited him to attend one of their matches. "Just give me a bat, tell me what to do, and I will learn fast," he said.
