At the same time a conflict emerged on Saturday [2 April] between the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] over the possibility of tax reductions as of 1996. Referring to accusations by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] that the Federal Government is considering tax increases as of 1995, Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) told WELT AM SONNTAG: "The tax increases that the citizens will be facing in 1995, including the 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge, have been stipulated by law." At about 44 percent of the national product, the burden of taxes and fees will "reach a climax" in 1995. Efforts must be made to "reduce this burden over the medium term, so that the willingness for achievement and investment power are not weakened." The date will mainly depend on progress concerning the consolidation of the budget. Waigel warned the coalition partner FDP: "However, those who believe that taxes can be reduced as early as in 1996 are throwing dust in people's eyes." "There will not be anything to distribute in 1996 either." The consolidation task will not be completed by then. Last week Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) announced a reduction of the top tax rates as of 1996. To promote the economy, the top rates of the income and corporate tax are to be cut to below 45 percent in a three-stage reform. The CSU chairman sharply criticized the SPD's tax plans. The plan, announced by SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping, to introduce a 10-percent unification surcharge for singles earning up to 50,000 German marks [DM] and for couples earning up to DM100,000 is "not thought out at all." The unification surcharge that Scharping wants to levy for an unlimited period does not ensure a "fair distribution of burdens." Already at this point, the existing tax progression represents a larger burden for the high-income earners. Thus, one-fourth of all taxpayers "carries over 70 percent of the tax burden at an available income of approximately 51 percent." A single person with a gross salary of DM6,000 per month, for example, would have to pay a solidarity surcharge that is twice as high as that of a person earning DM4,000 per month as of 1995. Waigel accused the SPD of a "loss of memory." When the solidarity pact was adopted in the spring of 1993, it agreed to the introduction of the solidarity surcharge, but now it is trying to confuse people with its tax proposals. It remains to be seen what the SPD wants to adopt as the "tolerable tax limit." If it realizes the current plans, "DM6-7.5 billion are still missing in the budget." "The SPD is cheating people if it promises them a relief as a result of the unification surcharge," Waigel stressed. With its plans, it is increasing the state's indebtedness, for which "all must pay." The SPD continues to be Germany's debt party. Moreover, it is not certain whether Scharping "will be able to control the contradictory tax forces within his party." Waigel pointed out that, as recently as this week, leading officials of the SPD's left wing called for a "gradual and predictable increase" in gasoline prices over the next 15 years. SPD official Horst Peter demanded an increase in the gasoline tax by 30 pfennig per year per liter. Waigel categorically rejected SPD plans for spot checks of bank accounts to control interest taxation: "Spot checks would undermine the banker's discretion." Capital is "as shy as deer." The SPD statements about controls are "increasing the flight of capital and endangering investments and jobs in Germany." The CSU chairman demanded that capital must be able to "move freely in Europe and the world." However, there should not be a distortion of competition among the financial markets. Thus, Bonn will intensively use its presidency in the European Union as of 1 July "to ensure the harmonization of interest taxation not only in Europe but also within the OECD." Referring to the ruling by the Constitutional Court, according to which the tax exemption of the subsistence minimum must be stipulated in the tax law by 1 January 1996, Waigel did not rule out that this ruling "may only be realized in several stages." This is no violation of the Karlsruhe verdict. Waigel mentioned the income tax committee that he established and which is to present its proposals on this issue. By the way, the "tax exemption of the subsistence minimum is ensured even at this point." The SPD financial spokesman Joachim Poss called on the Federal Government to "immediately present its plans concerning the Karlsruhe ruling." Waigel stressed that, even in the election year 1994, the draft of the 1995 budget "will be presented to the cabinet at the beginning of July, as usual." Thus, the voters will know as early as in the summer what the government's budget plans are. The consolidation of the budget "will be continued with the same force. There will be no election baits." According to FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer, the SPD's chances for the Bundestag elections have "dramatically declined" after the most recent quarrel about the SPD's government program. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping "has made an enormous blunder" with his proposal for the unification surcharge, Hoyer told the news agency DDP. This also applies to the inheritance and property tax, which the SPD wants to increase. Thus, the SPD has lost its credibility as a party of the economy. Hoyer described the SPD tax program as a "catalogue of horrors" -- particularly because there seems to be no readiness "to improve the state finances through spending cuts."
