The fighters, which took off from U.S. aircraft carriers in the Adriatic Sea and from bases in Italy, kept a close watch on the movements of Serb troops besieging Sarajevo in a bid to force them to withdraw their heavy weapons, including artillery. Large-scale air raids seem unavoidable. The whole world is closely following developments in Bosnia, because the war is likely to develop into a long-term civil war, which will greatly jeopardize stability in Europe. NATO took the trouble to sternly demand that Serb troops withdraw their heavy weapons within 10 days and place them under UN supervision. It is now only three days away from the deadline, but the Serb authorities, instead of withdrawing their heavy weapons as demanded, have warned the UN and NATO that Serb troops will retaliate if attacked. In that case, the war will escalate and the UN will become a belligerent, making the situation more complicated. Interference Will Spread the Flames of War Since the civil war broke out in Bosnia, 200,000 people have unfortunately been killed, while Sarajevo has suffered the heaviest casualties. Serb troops are now besieging Sarajevo, which is in danger of falling into enemy hands, and they are trying to bottle up the Moslems by using hunger and the terror of war. A large number of Sarajevo citizens were attacked by mortars while lining up for bread on 5 February, and 68 people were killed and 198 wounded. This was the blackest tragedy since the beginning of the civil war. The Bosnian Government, which is mainly composed of Moslems, strongly condemned Serb troops for the atrocity, which made one's blood boil. The Serbs, however, solemnly claimed that the Moslems had tried to win the sympathy of the outside world by inflicting casualties on their own people. They said a similar incident also occurred in Sarajevo in May 1992, when citizens queuing for bread were attacked by three mortars, killing 17 people and wounding more than 100. After the incident, Moslems and Serbs accused each other of the crime. For this reason, the Security Council applied sanctions against the new Yugoslavia [name as published], including a ban on petroleum exports to the country. Up to now, no evidence has shown who should be held responsible for the tragedy. This being the case, it is imprudent [zao ci 6644 2945] for the UN to carry out bombing raids. Chen Jian, China's deputy representative to the UN, said at a Security Council meeting yesterday that the use of air power in Bosnia by the UN should be restricted to protecting its peace-keeping forces. He also pointed out that further military action in Bosnia could possibly lead to undesirable consequences rather than helping provide a political solution to a local conflict. Air Raids Will Not Solve Any Problems Russian Defense Minister Grachev also expressed his opposition to air raids on 14 February for the reason that, after air raids, if Serb troops wage a guerrilla war against UN peace-keeping forces, NATO will be unable to defeat these guerrilla forces unless it sends large numbers of ground troops. In the Gulf war, the powerful U.S. Air Force could play a decisive role because the war was fought over a stretch of desert. But Sarajevo is surrounded by mountains. The UN air forces can destroy Serb artillery bases at one stroke, but it will find it difficult to eliminate guerrilla forces in the mountains. The former Soviet Union, which suffered great losses because of its interference with internal conflicts in Afghanistan, provides a good example in this respect. Again, as soon as any air raid begins, hopes for peace talks among the three nations in Bosnia will be killed, the war will drag on, and there will more casualties. The UN should think about these consequences thrice before it acts.
