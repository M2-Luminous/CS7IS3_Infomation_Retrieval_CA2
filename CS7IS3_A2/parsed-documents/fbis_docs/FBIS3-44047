On entering the Vryburg show grounds where an NP rally was held, a number of black farm workers were handed 10-rand notes. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk's target group in this traditional CP [Conservative Party] country were black and colored South Africans. At mostly closed meetings during the last three days, he made contact with more than 12,000 people. Like yesterday farm laborers were bussed in to today's rally. Eyebrows, however, were raised when farmer Mr. Ben Schoonwinkel gave 30 of his workers 10 rands each. [Schoonwinkel, in Afrikaans] I only gave them the 10 rands in advance -- they are getting paid next week -- so that they could buy food. [Van Zyl] Other farm laborers denied that they received money to attend the rally. [Unidentified laborer, in Afrikaans] No, I was not paid today to come here. I came on my own. [Van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk later rejected allegations of bribery, as well as claims by a handful of ANC [African National Congress] supporters that they were refused entry to the show grounds. [De Klerk] We didn't bribe anybody, and we didn't refuse anybody. [Van Zyl] Turning to a favorite electioneering theme, intimidation, Mr. de Klerk said he had been invited to black townships, but was advised against it. [De Klerk] It is apparent that the ANC has a strategy to make certain areas inaccessible to us. [Van Zyl] This was the first of many campaigns for Mr. de Klerk. He faces a grueling schedule -- at least one road show a week -- until the watershed day in April. [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] At another NP rally, this time in Eldorado Park south of Johannesburg, the party's election machine ran into noisy protests from ANC and Azapo [Azanian People's Organization] supporters. After Government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer made his way past a small group of irate demonstrators, the protesters proceeded into the hall where speakers were interrupted continuously. National Party supporters voiced their dismay with the presence of the intruders and drove the demonstrators from the hall. Mr. Meyer, whose speech was also interrupted, drew cheers from the new NP supporters when he dealt with the issue. [Meyer] They can also say what they want like they do this [as heard]. And there's nothing to be noisy about. They can quietly do it. They can hold their own meetings, and we will tolerate them to have their own meetings. [Alfonso] No serious incidents were reported, but Mr. Meyer opted to leave the building through a side door while protesters waited for him at the main entrance. [end recording]
