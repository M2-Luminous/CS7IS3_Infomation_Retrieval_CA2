Liu's two-week visit to America coincides with the Sixth Meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technological Co-operation, scheduled for tomorrow. He will lead a nine-member mission in talks with the U.S. Agricultural Secretary Mike Espy, as well as join State Councilor Song Jian's science delegation at the biannual commission. Liu is the highest-ranking Chinese agricultural official to visit the United States this year. During his talks with Espy and other officials, Liu is expected to explore Sino-U.S. ties in the farm sector. China wants to introduce the latest American technology in high- quality seed breeding, bio-ecology and the processing of farm and sideline products, the ministry said. "We also hope to strengthen our technical and economic co- operation with U.S. farmers, who have shown interest in China's vast agricultural resources," said Liu Chongmeng, deputy director-general of the ministry's International Co-operation Department. China and the U.S. have enhanced agricultural co-operation over the past years, and China has provided America with more than 12,000 scientific and technical research products on agriculture, especially on disease-resistant plants. In trade, the government has taken positive steps to strengthen ties with the U.S., Liu Chongmeng noted. Agreements signed by Minister Liu and Secretary Espy call for the Chinese to designate South China's Hainan Province for trial production of the American TCK immune wheat seeds, starting this year. The government hopes the U.S. will take a positive attitude toward improving quarantine procedures on imports of Chinese vegetables, fruits and potted landscape, Liu Chongmeng added. During Liu Jiang's U.S. tour, he also plans to visit New York, Chicago and Los Angeles to look at American farms and agricultural business, and to meet local leaders and entrepreneurs. Liu's farm delegation includes the vice-governors of Liaoning and Sichuan, the two top agricultural producing provinces.
