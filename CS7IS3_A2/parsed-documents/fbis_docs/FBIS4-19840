Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Armitage, former commandant of the Royal College for Defence Studies who was also head of Defence Intelligence, said NATO had three options: - They could continue combat air support attacks in support of United Nations troops on the ground - Within the three kilometre withdrawal zone ordered by Manfred Woerner, Secretary General of NATO, aircraft could attack ammunition dumps, local headquarters and tank emplacements - Under the UN Resolution 834, the war could be extended beyond the Gorazde area to include power stations, bridges and roads, destroying the country's infrastructure. Sir Michael said: ``We must have gathered sufficient intelligence by now to know where their supply dumps are and they could be clobbered within a three kilometre area. Under the first option it is very difficult for air attacks to succeed where UN troops may have been ambushed. You can't do it. ``The third thing we could do is extend the war into Serbia. We could bring down bridges and put out the lights in Belgrade, destroy rail links and roads. You would have to warn them in advance that is what we were going to do but it would be pretty serious and make their eyes water. ``The situation there is very dirty indeed. Some of the Serbian commanders may be out of control fighting a war of their own and they are making us look silly. The Serbian leadership is playing games with us. Air power alone will not succeed there.'' Sir Michael said he had met the British UN commander, Lt General Sir Michael Rose, and admired him as a soldier who needed to be backed by his commanders and given the extra troops he required to hold safe havens. He said: "If General Rose says he needs 8,000 troops he should be given them. But on no account should the United Nations contemplate major operations out there. We are being made fools of by the Serbians every day. I have lost count of the number of ceasefires there have been. Even the Russians have given up on them."
