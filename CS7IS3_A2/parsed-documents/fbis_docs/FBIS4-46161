Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi by unidentified correspondent in Tripoli; date not given] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] AL-HAYAH: What is preoccupying you most these days? Al-Qadhdhafi: At the national level, we are preoccupied with the current confrontation between a small country and a small people, that is, the Libyan people, and three major states, all of which are nuclear and Christian states. Libya is a Muslim state and they are imperialist states which have the right of veto (in the Security Council). And they have atomic bombs. Of course, we cannot ignore the fact that we are very busy with the confrontation with three oppressive, arrogant, insolent, and tyrannical states. [passage omitted] At the international level, we are preoccupied with that international arrogance and that insolence. Because the world has turned into a jungle. But we are certain that the small animals in the jungle will fight with their claws and teeth -- which means that the jungle will drown in blood because of what imperialism is doing. [passage omitted] AL-HAYAH: What about Algeria? Is it not preoccupying you? Al-Qadhdhafi: Of course, regrettably, France is currently taking revenge against Algeria. France and the United States are behind all that is happening in Algeria. France is backed primarily by the United States and the Israelis. The Mossad, French intelligence, and the CIA are involved in the murder, financing, training, and armament operations, so that Algeria would pay the price for its independence and rebellion against France. That is what is happening in Algeria. AL-HAYAH: How can you help Algeria? Al-Qadhdhafi: By God, that is a worry.... If the aggression was foreign, the matter would have been clear. But as long as the Algerians are fighting one another inside the country, no one can do anything except offering advice and kind words. They [not further identified] are also trying to get Egypt to pay the price for its war against the Israelis, the 'Abd-al-Nasir era, the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and its leadership of the Arab nation. Egypt is paying the price for that, because the Americans, the West, and the Israelis consider Egypt the archenemy. The Israelis want to destroy Egypt. There is a truce between Egypt and Israel, not peace. They want to exploit this truce to destroy Egypt so that it will be under Israel's heel. AL-HAYAH: With regard to the Libyan issue and the blockade imposed on it, how do you view the possibility of finding a solution or a way out, and do you believe that is possible? Al-Qadhdhafi: If the issue is to do with Lockerbie, there are solutions proposed which are very feasible and which will save face for all the parties. But if the Western states have another objective, then the attempts are improper and we would be facing a state of colonialism and insolence. And thus we should prepare ourselves for a confrontation and a war which the enemy should lose or not win. If the issue is to do with Lockerbie, it can be resolved easily in accordance with the formulas being proposed. All international organizations and the world as a whole support Libya. The three states are isolated, exposed, and lack even a fig leaf to cover their nakedness before the world with regard to the Lockerbie issue and the Libyan position. If their objective is colonialist, then in this case we are facing a new colonialist attempt and we will fight. AL-HAYAH: With regard to the proposed solutions, is there anything new and practical? Al-Qadhdhafi: Of course, there is a proposal from the Arab League and from international jurists, namely that a Scottish court be sent to another country -- The Hague, for example. And that the two suspects be handed over to the Arab League and then to this court under agreed UN guarantees. This is the latest solution we have heard. It is not a Libyan solution or a Libyan proposal. It is a proposal made by international jurists, espoused by the Arab League, and supported by the world as a whole. AL-HAYAH: What is the fate of all the weapons in your possession? Can you look after and service them? You purchased large quantities of weapons.... Al-Qadhdhafi: It has become clear that we were not wrong when we purchased and stockpiled the weapons. Time has shown that Libya is a target for aggression. One day al-Sadat was against us, Bourguiba was against us, al-Numayri was against us, and Hissein Habre was against us. France and the United States fought alongside them in Chad and Egypt. And Niger's Kountche was against us, and U.S. fleets threatened us from the sea. And we were attacked in 1986 by the two biggest states in the world, that is the United States and Britain. Our children were killed while asleep in their homes. It has become clear that we were right when we purchased the weapons and that we were targeted by an oppressive and direct aggression, and that we were entitled to have weapons to defend ourselves. The biggest danger threatening us now is the Israelis' possession of atomic bombs and nuclear missiles with a 4,000-mile range aimed against Libya, North Africa, Sudan, and the other Arab states. It is a very serious matter. Israel has atomic weapons, and the United States and the West are refusing to talk to the Israelis about them or to deprive them of this weapon. While the United States continues to pursue Libya, Korea, Iran, and Pakistan. As for the Israelis, they are exempt from the pursuit, punishment, and questioning. They are above international law. They are above Chapter VII of the UN Charter. If the Security Council decides a punishment for Israel, the United States uses its right of veto. Actually we are faced with a very serious situation: An adversary state is exempt from punishment and from Chapter VII of the UN Charter, is above international law, and is entitled to own any weapon of mass destruction, and no one questions it about anything. They pursued us because of a pharmaceutical plant until they ascertained it was a pharmaceutical plant. Why do they not pursue the Israelis, who admit their possession of atomic bombs and who have not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? AL-HAYAH: You have helped numerous allies since the revolution erupted. Who is now with you, who has turned against you, and who has been able to help you during the blockade period? Al-Qadhdhafi: By God, all those we helped support us, each according to his ability. We helped numerous forces in the world. We helped people who are now presidents of republics and heads of state. The West used to say that these are terrorist camps. These terrorist camps have turned into heads of state and regular armies, like Museveni and Sam Nujoma in Namibia, or the presidents of Congo, Angola, and Mozambique... all of them had their camps in Libya. They [the West] used to call them terrorists. [passage omitted] AL-HAYAH: A final question regarding those describing themselves as oppositionists abroad: What would you say to them? Al-Qadhdhafi: I say that with the establishment of people's power, there is no room for opposition. Oppose whom? The Libyan people? So you are opposing your people and homeland. In that case, the person becomes a stray dog. That person is a stray dog when he opposes his people and his homeland. [passage omitted] There is no possibility of opposition at all. If there are Libyans abroad, they are miserable. Most of them are businessmen. A large number of them returned, carrying catalogs and business contacts from which we have benefited. They enter and leave the country after they realized that matters are different. They laughed at the conditions they had been in. Even people who used to attack us over the radio came and laughed at their previous conditions, admitting they had been miserable and their statements were unreasonable. They told us: Forgive us, and indeed we did when they entered the country... Anyone who wants to return can return, and anyone who repents is forgiven. God accepts repentance, so shouldn't human beings do the same? Anyone who repents enters the country safely. As for anyone who does not repent, his only option is to become an agent for foreign intelligence, and this is what has happened. One escaped after stealing the people's money and another escaped to avoid military service and national service.... These cases do not represent opposition. Opposition takes place when there is colonialism in the country, when there is dictatorship or exploitation.... This is opposition. But when the people have the power, foreigners expelled, and the homeland and the people are free, what do you call those who escaped? Miserable. They are informers for U.S. intelligence. They say things against their own people and their own homeland, like hit Libya, boycott Libyan oil, or attack Libya. What does this incitement mean? It means that intelligence services tell them: say this. So they say it. They do not even merit a question being put about them.
