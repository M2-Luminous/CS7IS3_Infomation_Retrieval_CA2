Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Hideaki Kumano said at a press conference, "I don't think our potential to attain 3 percent level economic growth has changed so much," despite the current business conditions. While noting cyclic factors, Kumano stressed the need for implementation of middle- and long-term policies, both macroeconomic and microeconomic, so as to realize the nation's economic potential in the 21st century. Kumano said the recent drop in the yen's value against the U.S. dollar on foreign exchange markets was not yet enough from the viewpoint of corporate profitability. "Companies were a bit relieved by the recent trend toward a weaker yen, but you should not be too optimistic," Kumano said.
