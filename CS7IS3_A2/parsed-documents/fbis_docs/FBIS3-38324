Ambassador to the Arab Emirates, Giovanni Ferrero, stated that there is no alert, it is merely routine. In fact, it is a maneuver to increase the Italian presence in the region and to ensure a "redistribution of forces." Maurizio Vacca, military attache at the embassy, said that the decision did not mean that Italy had decided to sign a defense cooperation agreement with the Gulf Arab states -- as the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Russia did at the end of the Desert Storm campaign. The naval forces will be used as they are required and on an individual basis. However, the military attache assured, there will be more frequent naval exercises in the Gulf: "We want to increase our presence in the Gulf. We want to contribute to maintaining stability in the region." According to statements by Kuwaiti officials, the exercises will also serve to demonstrate to the Emirates which types of military equipment are most suited to the climate and waters around Kuwait. Since the end of the Gulf war, Kuwait has already participated in 150 naval maneuvers with various allied nations. Two Italian naval vessels have already completed a two-week maneuver in the Gulf with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Unlike the other allies, however, Italy has had a rather limited naval presence in the region to date.
