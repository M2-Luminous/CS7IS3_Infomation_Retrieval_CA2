Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, and Mexico won a second victory when the EU withdrew the offer it was secretly negotiating with Colombia in December 1993 and which had received support from Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The offer was to increase the banana import quota by 200,000 tons. These five countries presented a new proposal this week to the EU based on Guatemala's plan, which consists of increasing the import quota to 3.2 million tons, out of which 2.5 million tons would be for Latin America and 700,000 for Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries. The EU said initially the new Latin American proposal was unrealistic, but in the face of the firm persistence by the proposing countries and the surprising Costa Rican withdrawal from another group that backed the EU proposal, the EU decided to withdraw its December proposal. With the EU withdrawing its proposal, the 4-04 rule becomes effective, the EU allowed to import only 2 million tons of bananas, which must be shared with ACP countries. Nevertheless, GATT officially informed its 117 member countries yesterday of the report by the experts committee (panel), which ruled the EU import regime, in effect since July 1993, violates international trade standards.
