On 3 February, President Bill Clinton put an end to two decades of political and trade embargoes against Vietnam. From that moment on, the Indochinese country faced a new truth: Washington's pressure had been, in effect, devastating. It seemed like a dream, while others saw it as a mere formality. Since the beginning of a profound process of economic reforms in 1986, the Hanoi government had showed prowess and an uncanny ability to maintain the breathing room necessary for its survival. Three months after the lifting of Washington's restrictions, a spectacular flood of political and trade delegations has been arriving weekly to court the so-called "virgin of Southeast Asia." It is the end of the international isolation to which Vietnam was subjected because it dared defeat the United States militarily. The Indochinese nation is the best example of this. Suddenly, the business sector is stampeding to conquer a new market of 71 million inhabitants with oil, gas, and a wide range of natural resources. Businessmen from places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and France have made advance reservations in anticipation of this moment. It cannot be denied the Vietnamese economic boom went a long way by itself without any international help, although it was prevented from acquiring high-technology while brushing aside the ashes of war. Hanoi's authorities, faithful to the Asian tradition of patience, are not acting hastily, and they are not particularly anxious. Therefore, some find their cautious reaction to the lifting of the blockade to be surprising. Concerning this issue, Le Mai, deputy foreign minister in charge of negotiations with Washington in recent years, says the Vietnamese people suffered enough during the war against the United States. This is, of course, a step forward, which should be followed up with the full normalization of relations, but it also serves to display the serious damage caused by the United States with its economic and trade blockade policy during 20 years, Le Mai said. Putting resentment aside, the North American invasion -- now employing the weapons of trade -- has encountered a predictable reality: Those who were here in defiance of the embargo have better knowledge of the market and, now with the White House's consent, have quickly strengthened their positions. There is enough room for everyone, however. Vietnam -- the third-ranked rice exporter in the world, the fourth-ranked oil producer in Asia, and a nation with a single digit inflation rate and 7 percent average growth over the past three years -- urgently needs to improve its infrastructure. Dr. Nguyen Mai, vice president of the State Committee for Cooperation and Inmvestments (CECI), told PRENSA LATINA there will be no preferential treatment for any nation. He said: Logically, an atmosphere of mutual trust is created as a result of the work experience, but our goal is to license projects to real specialists. We want to introduce specialists who possess a high level of training and technology into our country based on mutual benefit. Advisers of the U.S. Business and Assistance Council in Asia recently visited Hanoi and estimated that during the next two years, U.S. investments in Vietnam could reach $2.6 billion. The trend is moving toward reaching agreements and obtaining licenses in fields such as oil, gas, telecommunications, industrial generators, transportation, road building, computers, and consumer goods, says Maureen Flanagan, honorary chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Asia. In her opinion, her country's investments will jump to $8 billion within five years, at which time she expects fluid trade. Noted local economist Le Dang Doang, however, warned that as long as Vietnam does not receive most favored nation (MFN) status in trade with the United States, the possibilities of purchasing U.S. goods are limited. A reduction of tariffs is imperative to position our products in the United States and to have the cash to compete with China or Thailand, two countries awarded MFN status, Doang pointed out. Right now we would like to purchase Boeing airplanes, but if we sell textiles to the United States, it would be at a very low price. At any rate, we will have to wait for the normalization of relations, he added. The first important agreement between Hanoi and the United States, following the end of the embargo, was reached two months ago. Vietnam will export 100,000 tons of rice to the United States. Influential media such as NEWSWEEK, THE NEW YORK TIMES, and the CNN television network have predicted that liaison offices will soon open in Hanoi and Washington, and it is almost certain that embassies will be opened in mid-1995. Diplomats residing in the Vietnamese capital generally agree with this assessment, although they foresee certain obstacles on the road to reestablishing bilateral ties. The resolution of the MIA-POW issue has advanced notably in the wake of close cooperation between Pentagon experts and Vietnam's Defense Ministry. Even though there are more than 2,000 MIA-POW's and 300,000 Vietnamese files, the search for the remains of the missing is becoming increasingly successful. The avalanche of U.S. tourists has become noticeable since the beginning of 1994. The majority of these tourists will help to definitely heal the wounds of the conflict, but certain other people have tried to spoil this atmosphere, a Foreign Ministry official who asked to remain anonymous stressed. The human rights issue is going to play the main role in this effort, and, in terms of this issue, Vietnam has answered the United States the same way some of her Asian neighbors have replied. "Discussions on the issue must be based on mutual respect, independence, sovereignty, and in keeping with the cultural traditions of each country." Today, life in Vietnam, if not completely untroubled, is entering a stage of accelerated growth in what was once the Cinderella of Southeast Asia. If conclusions can be reached, here are two: The U.S. embargo was devastating, but the persistence and valor of the Vietnamese people have won the other war -- the economic war.
