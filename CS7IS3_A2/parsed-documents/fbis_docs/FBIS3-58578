He warned, however, that it would be wrong to misinterpret the goodwill as a willingness to accept a solution that will not secure the withdrawal of the occupation troops and the implementation of human rights and basic freedoms. Kliridhis was speaking at ceremony to unveil a statue of Griyorios Avxendiou dedicated by Lisi Municipality in Kalo Khorion, Larnaca. Kliridhis reiterated that the struggle continues to free Cyprus from the occupation troops and settlers, to secure the right to return of the refugees, to safeguard human rights for all citizens, and to determine the fate of the missing persons. He added that we are also striving for Cyprus to join the European Union and to achieve progress in conditions of permanent peace and security. He stressed: We will accept nothing less than this.
