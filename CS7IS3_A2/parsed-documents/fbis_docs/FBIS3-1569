Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Rong Yiren, and other leading comrades, as well as more than 200 prominent figures from Beijing's intellectual circles, joyfully gathered at the Eastern Main Hall to celebrate the jubilant occasion.

Jiang Zemin, other comrades, and prominent figures from the capital's literary, art, science and technology, education, theoretical, and journalistic circles -- who were seated around round tables -- exchanged Spring Festival greetings while enjoying fine tea and chatting cheerfully. Amid the smiling faces, Hu Jintao stepped up to the podium and, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended his festival greetings and cordial regards to the comrades and friends in the hall and to comrades and friends of the country's intellectual circles. He thanked everyone for making outstanding contributions to the country's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Hu Jintao said that he hoped everyone, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, would further unite and work even harder to take a new step forward, score new achievements, and make new contributions to the development of socialist literature, arts, sciences, technology, education, theories, and journalism. He expressed his hope that the great motherland will become more dynamic and prosperous, wealthier, and stronger. The soiree was preceded by the song "The Moon of the 15th of the Month." Artists attending the soiree performed vocal solos, instrumental solos, instrumental ensembles, Beijing opera songs, vocal duets, and a magic show, winning sustained applause. Jiang Zemin and other comrades, while viewing the performances, chatted with scientists, educators, and artists at their respective tables, and cordially inquired about their work and lives. While listening to the pipa [Chinese musical instrument] solo "The Lantern and the Moon Shine on Each Other," Jiang Zemin said, "The pipa is our national art; we should promote our national arts." While the "Song of the Guerrillas" was being played, Jiang Zemin said, "This is an immortal work." The one hour, 40-minute soiree ended amid the song "Singing the Motherland."
