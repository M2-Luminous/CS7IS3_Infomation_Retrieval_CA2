Regulatory Process Matters Economic Impact The FAA is presently unable to determine the likely costs of imposing regulations affecting an operator flight attendant English language program. Following a review of the responses submitted to this ANPRM, the FAA will determine what regulatory requirements will be proposed, if any, and will review the potential costs and benefits, as required by Executive Order 12866. As discussed above, the FAA is seeking relevant cost data to facilitate the FAA's determinations. Other Regulatory Matters At this preliminary stage, it is not possible to determine whether there will be a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or what the paperwork burden might be. These regulatory matters will be addressed at the time of publication of any NPRM on this subject. Federalism Implications Federalism implications, if any, will be discussed if an NPRM is issued.
