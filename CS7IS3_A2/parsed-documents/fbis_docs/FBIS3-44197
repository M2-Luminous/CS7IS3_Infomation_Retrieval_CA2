FBIS3-44197 "drafr018_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-018 Document Type:Daily Report 27 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Inflation Rate Lowest in 20 Years MB2701122994 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1100 GMT 27 Jan 94 MB2701122994 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pretoria Jan 27 SAPA -- South Africa enjoyed the lowest inflation rate in 20 years during 1993, Central Statistical Services [CSC] in Pretoria reported on Thursday. The average inflation rate was 9.7 percent -- the lowest since 1973 when it was 9.6 percent. Last year's rate was 4.2 percent lower than 13.9 percent in 1992. The average annual rates of change in the CPI [Consuer Price Index] for the higher, middle and lower income groups were 10.2 percent, 9.7 percent and 8.6 percent respectively. In 1992 these rates were 13.3 percent, 14.5 percent and 14.7 percent respectively. The average food inflation rate of 6.8 percent for 1993 was 18.6 percent lower than the corresponding rate of 25.3 percent for 1992. This rate is the lowest since 1971 (3.9 percent). The price index for housing showed a negative inflation rate of -01 percent for 1993. This rate has shown a decreasing tendency since 1989 and is the lowest since 1959 when the index in this format was started, CSC said. December's inflation rate was 9.5 percent -- 0.3 percent higher than November's 9.2 percent. Contributing to this 0.3 per cent increase were the decrease in the price index for housing (-0.2 percent) and increases in the price indices for food (0.2 percent), transport (0.1 percent) and all other items (0.2 percent). December's food inflation rate was 5.2 percent -- 1.3 percent higher than November's 3.9 percent. Against this, the annual increase in the price index for all items excluding food was 10.7 percent, "which indicates that the change in food prices, notwithstanding the increase, still has a retarding effect on the inflation rate," CSS said. The monthly increase of 1.1 per cent in the food price index was due to increases in the price indices for meat (2.8 percent), fruit and nuts (5.5 percent), fish and other seafood (1.3 percent), coffee, tea and cocoa (0.8 percent) grain products (0.7 percent), fats and oils (0.4 percent) and sugar (0.3 percent). "These increases were slightly counteracted by decreases in the price indices for vegetables (-3.5 percent) and milk, cheese and eggs (0.2 percent)," CSS said. The monthly decrease in the housing index (-1.2 percent) was due to the decrease in interest rates on mortgage bonds. The fuel price decrease of December 17 was not taken into account in the CPI for December. The direct effect of this would be reflected in the inflation rate for January. In the urban areas, the highest inflation rate of 12.2 percent for December was recorded in the OFS [Orange Free State] goldfields, while the lowest rate of 8.3 percent occurred in the Vaal Triangle. The food price index for Pietermaritzburg showed the lowest annual increase of 3.3 percent, while the highest of 7.8 percent was shown in the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage area. The inflation rate for pensioners was 10.1 percent -- 0.6 percent higher than december's official inflation rate. The lowest annual rate of increase was recorded in the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage area, while the highest of 12.6 percent occurred in Bloemfontein. Food prices at chain stores showed an annual increase of 5.3 percent and a monthly increase of 1.0 percent, while those at the other retailers showed an annual increase of 4.3 percent and a monthly increase of 1.4 percent.
