In fact, FUNCINPEC is not the most powerful party of the tripartite coalition government, despite its speedy expansion within a short period of time prior to the polls. However, this quantitative growth has brought about many great difficulties for the party to iron out. On top of these problems, FUNCINPEC now faces scores of diverse tendencies among its members. Analysts believe that the tendency to regard the alliance between the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] and the FUNCINPEC Party as a political ploy is a dangerous way of thinking. Of late, the CPP seems to have shown its utmost apprehension over this tendency; it has become more vigilant than ever before. Analysts maintain that there are indications now that this alliance is facing problems and this is probably explained by a series of secret visits to Beijing made by the two party leaders recently. Nevertheless, without talking about the CPP accusations during the election last year, the FUNCINPEC Party's inability to win a majority in the polls demands that it makes further all-out efforts in the second legislative election to be held in the next few years, though election results are unpredicatable. The best way for the FUNCINPEC Party is that it should do its utmost to bring different government plans and programs to success. It is not wise at all for the party to strive to knock down the CPP, its political partner.
