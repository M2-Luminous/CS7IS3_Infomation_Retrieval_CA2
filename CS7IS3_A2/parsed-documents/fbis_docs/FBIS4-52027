In reaction, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], stated on 4 May: "Nagano's remark raises questions about his qualifications as a cabinet member. The Hata cabinet should be held responsible for his remark. His remark carries a heavy responsibility." Kubo made it clear the SDPJ will hold Nagano and the Hata cabinet responsible for the controversial remark. With regard to the Nanjing atrocity perpetrated by Japanese soldiers during the Pacific War, the Tokyo High Court admitted the occurrence of the event in its ruling on the Ienaga textbook trial in October 1993. China is expected to react against, and the Hata cabinet will certainly be hard-pressed to deal with, the justice minister's controversial remark. Commenting on the MAINICHI SHIMBUN report, Kubo lashed out, saying: "There is much evidence that substantiates the Nanjing atrocity. Denying the atrocity perpetrated by Japanese soldiers is tantamount to denying Japan's war of aggression. His remark is based on a wrong position. On what ground did he make it? The Hata cabinet should be held responsible for his remark, and questions about Nagano's qualifications as a cabinet member should be raised." During the interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Justice Minister Nagano said: "It is wrong to view the Pacific War as a Japanese war of aggression." Kubo took this part of his remarks seriously. Noting that former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa definitely stated that "it was a Japanese war of aggression and a wrong war," Kubo stressed: "A minister of the Hata government that is supposed to have succeeded the Hosokawa government made clear his view that flatly denies former Prime Minister Hosokawa's view. We have no choice but to think that the character of the coalition government has changed."
