FR940223-1-00019 FR940223-1-00001 Order Amending the Orders Regulating the Handling of Milk in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon Marketing Areas This order shall not become effective unless and until the requirements of §900.14 of the rules of practice and procedure governing proceedings to formulate marketing agreements and marketing orders have been met. Findings and Determinations The findings and determinations hereinafter set forth supplement those that were made when the orders were first issued and when they were amended. The previous findings and determinations are hereby ratified and confirmed, except where they may conflict with those set forth herein. (a) Findings. A public hearing was held upon certain proposed amendments to the tentative marketing agreements and to the orders regulating the handling of milk in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon marketing areas. The hearing was held pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure (7 CFR part 900). Upon the basis of the evidence introduced at such hearing and the record thereof, it is found that: (1) The said orders as hereby amended, and all of the terms and conditions thereof, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act; (2) The parity prices of milk, as determined pursuant to section 2 of the Act, are not reasonable in view of the price of feeds, available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand for milk in the said marketing areas; and the minimum prices specified in the orders as hereby amended are such prices as will reflect the aforesaid factors, insure a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome milk, and be in the public interest; and (3) The said orders as hereby amended regulate the handling of milk in the same manner as, and are applicable only to persons in the respective classes of industrial or commercial activity specified in, marketing agreements upon which a hearing has been held. Order Relative to Handling It is therefore ordered that on and after the effective date hereof, the handling of milk in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon marketing areas shall be in conformity to and in compliance with the terms and conditions of the orders, as amended, and as hereby amended, as follows: The provisions of the proposed marketing agreements and order amending the orders contained in the recommended decision issued by the Acting Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, on October 7, 1993, and published in the Federal Register on October 15, 1993 [58 FR 53439], shall be and are the terms and provisions of this order, amending the orders, and are set forth in full herein.
