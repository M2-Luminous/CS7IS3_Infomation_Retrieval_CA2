Today's report covers diverse aspects of the efforts of this military division, ranging from task work, personnel, production, and equipment to workers' welfare and productivity. This EJT division, which was created seven months ago, tends 50 percent of Havana's lands and is already attaining significant results. Today, Raul Castro pointed out how much can be done even under the difficult conditions we are experiencing, through optimism, better use of resources, and better organization of the labor force. [Begin recording] [Castro] Yesterday, I briefly mentioned to several leaders in Alquizar, several provincial agriculture leaders, that the EJT is the pride of the FAR and that -- within the framework of the law so no one can say we are threatening anyone -- we are not going to let speculators or the inefficiency of that large bureaucracy called state collection pilfer their work and prevent it from reaching the population. [end recording] Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan states that experiences such as these, given their importance and reach, ought to be extended to state enterprises, Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's], and cooperatives. [Begin Jordan recording] I believe this experience is undoubtedly the most integral and complete I have seen. In the future, it would be good for this type of visit, including Raul's presence, to continue for assessment of the work of the UBPC, and above all, the farming cooperatives, given their importance. I believe there are many interesting things here that we can broaden, implement, and generalize in the rest of the production organizations, which have also accumulated a series of experiences we ought to analyze.
