According to information available to WELT AM SONNTAG, this is the contents of intelligence service tape recordings and an internal report sent to the German Government by the German Embassy in Bulgaria. At the weekend, the German Government expressed "dismay," and also concern about Zhirinovskiy's threats. Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) came out the second strongest party in the December 12 elections for the first freely elected Russian parliament since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Zhirinovskiy made his threats to a German diplomat at Sofia airport. It was there that on Thursday [30 December] the head of the German Embassy's Consular Section in Bulgaria had informed him of the Federal Government's decision not to grant him an entry visa for Germany. Following this decision, the Russian party leader threatened the German diplomat that he would break off diplomatic relations with Bonn. He furiously pointed out that there are still Russian troops stationed on German territory. They would "not be withdrawn." Instead, he would station "300,000 Russian troops" in Germany, if he came to power. The troops should "safeguard Russian compensation claims for damage suffered in World War II." Germany would have to pay up and would become "a poor country" as a result. He said that he would insist that Germany return all the buildings that Russia had put up in eastern Germany over the last 50 years. They would be handed over to Russian industrialists. Decisions made against him by the Federal Government, such as that preventing his entry, could lead to a "Third World War," Zhirinovskiy ranted, which would "completely destroy" Germany. He said the German Embassy official could be sure to be "liquidated" soon. He, Zhirinovskiy, has such good contacts with Russian intelligence that he could make the official simply "disappear." The Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] have been asked by the government to keep an even closer eye on the activities of international right-wing extremists in Germany in the future. Paul Muenstermann, vice president of the BND, which is in charge of foreign intelligence, told WELT AM SONNTAG that his office had, for instance, passed information on the activities of the Russian right-wing radicals and their leader Zhirinovskiy to the Federal Government. This particularly applies to any direct contact that Zhirinovskiy has with German right-wing extremists. The BfV was informed about the nature of such contacts. Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Secretary General Peter Hintze told WELT AM SONNTAG that both the BND and the BfV would have to obtain information with a view to a "right-wing extremist international," which could become a threat to the whole of Europe. Juergen Ruettgers, the manager of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] Bundestag Group, told WELT AM SONNTAG: "Nationalists, fascists, and right-wing extremists are trying to set up a new cooperation network all over Europe, as has become apparent by Zhirinovskiy's appearances before German right-wing radicals." Right-wing extremism must be fought with all possible means not only in Germany; the BND will also have to step up surveillance of all right-wing extremist groups abroad. Zhirinovskiy has close links with German right-wing extremists led by the chairman of the German People's Union (DVU), Gerhard Frey. The DVU has a membership of some 26,000 and is considered to be the biggest right-wing extremist organization in Germany. The most spectacular joint appearance of Zhirinovskiy and Frey so far took place on 2 October 1993 at a rally at the Nibelungen Hall in Passau. In April 1993, at Zhirinovskiy's invitation, Frey took part in the Russian nationalists' party conference in Moscow. In his welcoming speech he called Zhirinovskiy a great politician. On Friday, a spokesman of the Australian Foreign Ministry said in Canberra that Zhirinovskiy has canceled a scheduled visit to Australia. He said this was due to numerous appointments that he had in Moscow. If he had applied for a visa, he would almost certainly have been granted one.
