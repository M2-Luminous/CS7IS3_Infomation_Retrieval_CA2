Chernovil also emphasized that "principles of Ukraine's nuclear policy were determined by parliament during the ratification of the START-I treaty with certain reservations." In Chernovil's words, "all leaders of the country, including the president, must adhere to this course." "If Kravchuk signs an agreement on nuclear weapons during his meeting with Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin on January 14 in Moscow, it will have no juridical force," believes Chernovil. Valentin Lemish, chairman of the parliamentary commission on defense and security, told journalists on Monday that the agreement to be signed by the three presidents in Moscow is subject for ratification by the Ukrainian parliament. According to Lemish, "if the agreement is in line with the parliament resolution on ratification of the START-I treaty, we shall have no questions."
