FR940527-1-00181 FR940527-1-00014 B. The Elimination of the Separate Rural Standardized Amount (Column 1) Section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act provides that, beginning in FY 1995, the rural standardized amount is equal to the other urban standardized amount. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act, as amended by section 13501(a)(1) of Public Law 103&hyph;66, provides that the update to the urban standardized amounts for FY 1995 will equal the market basket rate of increase minus 2.5 percentage points, and the update to the rural standardized amount is the amount necessary to set the rural amount equal to the other urban amount. We project the market basket increase to be 3.6 percent, so the proposed update to the large and other urban standardized amounts is 1.1 percent and the proposed update to the rural standardized amount is 8.4 percent (the market basket rate of increase of 3.6 percent plus 4.8 percent). The process undertaken to set the rural amount equal to the other urban amount, as well as the overall methodology used to determine the FY 1995 proposed standardized payment amounts, is described in the Addendum to this proposed rule. As described there, the net increase in rural hospitals' FY 1995 standardized payment amount compared to FY 1994 is less than 8.4 percent. The difference between the proposed FY 1995 payment rate for rural hospitals and their FY 1994 amount is 4.6 percent. This smaller net increase can be attributed to changing from separate urban and rural outlier offsets (applicable to the previously separate rates) to a single offset after the rural rate is eliminated. To illustrate, for FY 1994, the difference between the other urban and rural final standardized amounts was 3.0 percent. These amounts reflected the differential outlier adjustment factors applied to the urban and rural standardized amounts of 0.945960 and 0.977157, respectively (See the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46349.) Similarly, section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act necessitated different urban and rural budget neutrality factors for geographic reclassification. Removing these differential adjustments from the FY 1994 standardized amounts, and updating the urban amounts by 1.1 percent, increases the difference between the other urban and rural amounts from 3.0 percent to 8.4 percent. Section 1886(d)(3)(B) requires the Secretary to adjust both the large urban and other national standardized amounts by the same outlier adjustment factor beginning in FY 1995. Estimated outlier payments equal 5.1 percent of estimated total DRG payments, so a 5.1 percent offset is applied to the standardized amounts. For FY 1994, the rural outlier offset was 2.3 percent, 2.8 percent smaller than the 5.1 percent offset for FY 1995. For FY 1995, the increase in the size of the outlier offset for rural hospitals reduces the effect of the higher standardized amount. The FY 1995 baseline employs differential outlier offsets to the separate urban and rural amounts. The net difference between the rural and other urban amounts after applying these differential offsets to the FY 1995 baseline rates (without any of the other budget neutrality factors) is 4.3 percent. Because the urban amount increases by 0.3 percent when the 5.1 national outlier offset is applied rather than the larger urban outlier offset, the net increase in the rural standardized amount to bring it up to the other urban amount is 4.6 percent. Finally, in addition to equating the other urban and rural amounts through a higher rural update and a single outlier offset, a national labor share (the portion of the standardized amounts adjusted by the wage index) is necessary to maintain the elimination of the separate amounts. For FY 1994, the rural labor share represents 75.6 percent of the rural standardized amount, while the urban labor share comprises about 70.8 percent of the large and other urban amounts. For FY 1995, we are proposing to determine the labor portion of the standardized amounts based on a national average labor share of 71.4 percent. Column 1 displays the payment changes resulting from eliminating the rural amount, modeled by comparing payments simulated using our FY 1995 baseline model described earlier to simulated payments after eliminating the separate rural amount. The impacts of the higher update to the standardized amount for rural hospitals are evident. Overall, hospitals located in rural counties experience a 2.9 percent increase in payments from this change, compared to a 0.4 percent rise in payments to urban hospitals. Nationally, payments per case are estimated to rise 0.7 percent as a result of this change. The 2.9 percent increase for hospitals in rural areas is below the 4.6 percent increase in the standardized amount for several reasons. First, this row includes all hospitals that are located in rural areas, but some rural hospitals receive a higher urban payment rate. This is reflected in the ``Rural Hospital Types'' rows. Rural referral centers (RRCs) have only a 0.2 percent payment effect resulting from this change. These hospitals currently receive the other urban amount and, therefore, do not gain directly from the elimination of the rural amount. They do apparently benefit slightly from the smaller outlier offset applied to the urban standardized amounts. Another rural hospital group experiencing only a relatively small impact from this change is sole community hospitals (SCHs). Their payments rise 1.8 percent, well below that for most other rural hospital groups. Because these hospitals are paid based on the greater of their applicable Federal rate or their hospital-specific rate, increasing the Federal rate has an impact upon only those SCHs that would be paid based on that rate. Of the 578 SCHs in this row, 435 are paid on the basis of their hospital-specific rate in our FY 1995 baseline model. When the rural amount is eliminated by making it equal to the other urban amount, only 66 SCHs switch from their hospital-specific rate to the Federal rate. This explains the below average payment change compared to other rural hospitals. Conversely, nonspecial status rural hospitals, and rural hospitals receiving DSH all experience above average payment gains (between 5.7 percent and 6.0 percent). This effect appears to be primarily attributable to the decrease in the labor share of the standardized amount. In fact, substituting the current higher rural labor share on both models in this comparison reduces the payment gains for these hospital groups to 4.6 percent (except for MDHs, which fall to 4.4 percent).
