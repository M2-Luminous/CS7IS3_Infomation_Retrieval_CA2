FBIS4-28861 "dreas114_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 North Korea `Craftiness', `Effrontery' Alleged `Craftiness', `Effrontery' Alleged SK1106052494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0509 GMT 11 Jun 94 SK1106052494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Don't Run Riot"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, far from making an official apology for the police raid on the Kyoto Headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and search of houses of Chongnyon officials and other places, blared that "there was nothing wrong in the precedures of the search." Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that this revealed once again the craftiness and effrontery peculiar to Japan. Recalling that a situation resembling that on the eve of the past Korean war has been created in Japan now, the analyst says: The Japanese reactionaries should know clearly what a country the DPRK is, what a people the Koreans are and how great our might is. And they must not doubt the will of our people who mean what they say. Should Japan join in "sanctions" against us, whether she takes the van or is inveigled into it, we will regard it as a declaration of war and then she will not be able to evade a deserved punishment. This warning is anything but an empty word. The Japanese authorities should ponder over the lot in which Japan would find itself, if this warning of ours is carried into practice. The Japanese reactionaries must not run riot but promptly stop their hostile policy against the DPRK and the repression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. This advice is quite beneficial to Japan.
