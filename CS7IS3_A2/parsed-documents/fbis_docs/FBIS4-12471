Two people died and three were wounded in overnight explosions near the Mount Lavinia beach resort, at the deluxe Colombo Marriott, Taj Samudra and the three-star Sapphire Hotel, officials said. Another bomb went off Saturday morning at the Zoological Gardens. Despite the large number of visitors, there were no casualties because the blast occurred in an isolated marshy area. No foreigners were wounded in the blasts, police said. K. H. J. Wijayadasa, secretary to President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga, said the government believed the attacks were carried out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which is fighting for a separate state in the northeast. "From first indications, from the pattern of explosions, it looks as if it is a LTTE job," Wijayadasa told reporters shortly after inspecting a badly damaged toilet at the Marriott. The bombs went off simultaneously at Marriott, Taj, frequented by western tourists, and the Sapphire, which is "usually patronised" by minority Tamils from the LTTE stronghold of northern Jaffna. Wijayadasa said that two suspected LTTE rebels died when a bomb they were carrying exploded prematurely. Another accomplice was seriously wounded in the blast, he said. A Tamil couple, guests at Sapphire, were also injured. Wijayadasa said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presided over a high-level security meeting at which it was decided to tighten security at all hotels in and around Colombo. He said the explosions were aimed at driving out tourists from the Indian Ocean island nation. "Obviously, this is aimed at disrupting tourism and causing a certain element of panic. But I think we have escaped fairly unscathed," Wijayadasa said. Francis Keenan, the resident general manager of Marriott, which is part of the American Marriott chain, said that there had been no panic because the blast occurred inside a toilet outside the dining hall. "The guests hardly knew what had happened. They have taken it in the correct spirit," said Keenan. State Minister for Tourism Gamini Lokuge said he hoped the tourism industry would not be affected as a result of the latest blasts but said that the authorities have taken "very tight security measures" to prevent any harm to foreigners. "I don't think the industry will be affected. To my knowledge no guest has decided to leave," Lokuge said. Lokuge said the industry anticipated a record 450,000 tourists to visit the island this year. About 120,000 tourists have already arrived in the first three months of the year, he said. However, nervous hoteliers and travel agents said they were adopting a wait-and-see attitude for the moment. "This is the kind of thing that frightens most tourists. They are all sensitive to such incidents, especially the Japanese," a senior travel agent official said. Sri Lanka's tourism industry took a heavy battering between 1983 and 1989, when Tamil guerrilla bomb attacks and a separate anti- government campaign by extremist Sinhalese forced tourists to keep away from the island. But the trade began recovering fast after the military crushed the Sinhalese insurgency in 1989.
