FR940527-1-00002 FR940527-1-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 351 RIN 3206&hyph;AF63 Reduction in Force Permissive Temporary Exception AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing regulations that would give agencies broader authority to use permissive temporary exceptions to the regular order of release in reduction in force (RIF) competition. These proposed regulations would assist an agency in meeting a Government obligation to an employee (such as delaying the effective date of an employee's release by RIF long enough to allow a full 60- or 120-day notice to the employee). These proposed regulations would also allow an agency to consider only subgroup standing in releasing employees during the 120-day period immediately before an installation closes. DATES: Written comments will be considered if received no later than July 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver written comments to: Associate Director for Career Entry, room 6F08, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E St. NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas A. Glennon or Edward P. McHugh, (202) 606&hyph;0960; FAX (202) 606&hyph;2329. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The liquidation provision is contained in section 5 CFR 351.605. Under the current regulations, a liquidation situation exists when an agency will abolish all positions in a competitive area within 90 days. In separating employees by RIF, the agency must release employees in group and subgroup order consistent with 5 CFR 351.601(a). However, the liquidation provision permits the agency, at its discretion, to release employees within a subgroup regardless of the employees' relative retention standing for up to 90 days before closure of an activity. An agency may not apply this section to release an employee who is entitled to retention in the subgroup under section 5 CFR 351.606 because of reemployment after military service. We are proposing to revise section 5 CFR 351.605 to provide that the liquidation provisions are applicable when an agency will abolish all positions in a competitive area within 120 days. This change conforms with section 4433 of Public Law 102&hyph;484, which provides that employees of the Department of Defense are entitled to a minimum specific RIF notice period of 120 days when a significant number of employees will be separated. The present provisions covering permissive temporary exceptions are contained in §351.608, as revised January 22, 1993, at 58 FR 5561. Section 351.608(b)(3) would be revised to delete the restriction that an agency may use a permissive temporary exception for not more than 90 days to satisfy a Government obligation to the retained employee. Present §351.608(c) would be redesignated as §351.608(d) and present §351.608(d) would be redesignated as §351.608(e). Section 351.608(c) would be added to provide that an agency may use a permissive temporary exception without time limitation to satisfy a Government obligation to the retained employee. This new section also conforms to the longer RIF notice requirement applicable to certain employees of the Department of Defense under section 4433 of Public Law 102&hyph;484. E.O. 12866 Regulatory Review This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it only affects Federal employees. List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 351 Government employees. U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Lorraine A. Green, Deputy Director. Accordingly, OPM proposed to amend part 351 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows: PART 351_REDUCTION IN FORCE 1. The authority citation for Part 351 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 1302, 3502, 3503. 2. Section 351.605 is revised to read as follows: §351.605 Liquidation provisions. When an agency will abolish all positions in a competitive area within 120 days, it must release employees in group and subgroup order consistent with §351.601(a). At its discretion, the agency may release the employees in group order without regard to retention standing within a subgroup, except as provided in §351.606. When an agency releases an employee under this section, the notice to the employee must cite this authority and give the date the liquidation will be completed. An agency may also apply §351.607 and §351.608 in a liquidation. 3. In §351.608, paragraphs (c) and (d) are redesignated as paragraphs (d) and (e) respectively, paragraph (b) is revised, and paragraph (c) is added to read as follows: §351.608 Permissive temporary exceptions. * * * * * (b) Exception not to exceed 90 days. An agency may make a temporary exception for not more than 90 days when needed to continue an activity without undue interruption. (c) Government obligation.
