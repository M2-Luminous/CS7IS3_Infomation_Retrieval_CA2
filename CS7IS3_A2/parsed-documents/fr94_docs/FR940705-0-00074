ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Aleutian District of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the total allowable catch (TAC) of Atka mackerel specified for this District. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), June 30, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Atka mackerel TAC for the Western Aleutian District was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish for the BSAI (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 8,500 metric tons (mt). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(8), that the Atka mackerel TAC specified for the Western Aleutian District soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 8,000 mt after determining that 500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the Western Aleutian District. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Aleutian District, effective from 12 noon A.l.t., June 30, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: June 29, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
