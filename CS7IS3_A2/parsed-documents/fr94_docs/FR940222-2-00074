FR940222-2-00074 FR940222-2-00062 3. While Cityfed's board of directors has considered from time to time whether to engage in an operating business, the board has determined not to engage in an operating business at the present time because of the claims filed against Cityfed, whose liability thereunder cannot be reasonably estimated and may exceed its assets. 4. On December 7, 1992, the RTC filed suit against Cityfed and two former officers of City Federal seeking damages of $12 million dollars for failure to maintain the net worth of City Federal (the ``First RTC Action''). In connection with this action, the RTC sought a court order to place Cityfed's assets under the control of the court. On January 5, 1993, the RTC and Cityfed entered into an agreement (the ``Agreement'') whereby the RTC would refrain from seeking the above order and Cityfed could continue to make payments for ordinary and reasonable business expenses and certain legal fees. Cityfed, however, must give a monthly accounting of its expenditures to the RTC, and the RTC may apply to the court for an appropriate order to prohibit an expenditure. In addition, Cityfed must give the RTC written notice before paying extraordinary expenses of more than $5,000 and before making certain payments for defense costs, attorneys' fees and other legal disbursements. 5. On September 30, 1993, the OTS staff advised Cityfed that it intended to recommend that the OTS initiate an administrative enforcement proceeding against Cityfed. Applicant represents that in such a proceeding, the OTS will likely assert claims similar to the RTC in the First RTC Action and may attempt to freeze Cityfed's assets. Because such a proceeding may render moot the issues in the First RTC Action, the court entered an order on October 15, 1993 to stay that action for 60 days. The court subsequently ordered the stay extended to January 28, 1994. The orders do not affect the Agreement, except to provide that the Agreement will terminate upon the effective date of any order issued by the OTS, or of any consent order or agreement between the OTS and Cityfed, that addresses the subject matter of the Agreement. As of the date of filing the last amendment to this application, the OTS has not initiated any administrative enforcement proceeding against Cityfed. 6. In addition, the RTC filed suit against several former directors and officers of City Federal alleging gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duty with respect to certain loans (the ``Second RTC Action''). The RTC seeks in excess of $200 million in damages. Under Cityfed's bylaws, Cityfed may be obligated to indemnify these former officers and directors and advance their legal expenses. Currently, Cityfed is advancing reasonable defense costs to the former directors and officers named in the First and Second RTC Actions. Furthermore, Cityfed is currently aware of several other legal actions involving former officers, directors, or employees of Cityfed who have requested that Cityfed advance expenses and indemnify them. Cityfed generally has agreed to advance expenses in connection with these requests. Cityfed is unable to determine with any accuracy the extent of its liability with respect to these indemnification claims, although the amount may be material. 7. Currently, Cityfed's stock is traded sporadically in the over-the-counter market. Cityfed has one employee who is president, chief executive officer and treasurer. Cityfed's secretary does not receive any compensation for her service. If Cityfed is unable to resolve the above claims successfully, Cityfed may seek protection from the bankruptcy courts or liquidate. Cityfed asserts that it probably will not be in a position to determine what course of action to pursue until most, if not all, of its contingent liabilities are resolved. 8. During the term of the proposed exemption, Cityfed will comply with sections 9, 17(a), 17(d), 17(e), 17(f), 36 through 45, and 47 through 51 of the Act and the rules thereunder, subject to the following modifications. With respect to section 17(d), Cityfed represents that it established a stock option plan when it was an operating company. Although the plan has been terminated, certain former employees of City Federal have existing rights under the plan. Cityfed asserts that the plan may be deemed a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan within the meaning of section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder. Because the plan was adopted when Cityfed was an operating company and to the extent there are existing rights under the plan, Cityfed seeks an exemption to the extent necessary from section 17(d). In addition, Cityfed may become subject to the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court. With respect to transactions approved by the bankruptcy court, applicants request an exemption from sections 17(a) and 17(d) as further described in condition 3 below. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Section 3(a)(1) defines an investment company as any issuer of a security who ``is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily *␣*␣* in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.'' Section 3(a)(3) further defines an investment company as an issuer who is engaged in the business of investing in securities that have a value in excess of 40% of the issuer's total assets (excluding government securities and cash). Cityfed acknowledges that it may be deemed to fall within one of the Act's definitions of an investment company. Accordingly, applicant requests an exemption under sections 6(c) and 6(e) from all provisions of the Act, subject to certain exceptions. 2. In determining whether to grant an exemption for a transient investment company, the Commission considers such factors as whether the failure of the company to become primarily engaged in a non-investment business or excepted business or liquidate within one year was due to factors beyond its control; whether the company's officers and employees during that period tried, in good faith, to effect the company's investment of its assets in a non-investment business or excepted business or to cause the liquidation of the company; and whether the company invested in securities solely to preserve the value of its assets. Cityfed asserts that it meets these criteria.
