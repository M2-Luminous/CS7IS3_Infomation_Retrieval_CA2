The group was formed when a delegation led by Dr Mdlalose and an ANC delegation met in Durban in a bid to break the impasse over the allocation of portfolios. The conflict arose last week when Natal's three anc ministers, Mr Zuma, S'bu Ndebele and Zweli Mkhize, excused themselves from the swearing-in ceremony in Pietermaritzburg. The ANC was dissatisfied with the portfolios allocated to the three ministers, and charged Dr Mdlalose should have consulted with them before a decision was taken. A joint statement issued after Tuesday's meeting said the group would meet in Durban on Thursday to finalise matters so the KwaZulu/Natal Executive Council could begin to exercise its responsibility. Mr Zuma said the re-allocation of portfolios was still under discussion. Both delegations committed themselves to working together and Dr Mdlalose said the provincial government of unity was "on track". "Full and frank discussions were held in a cordial atmosphere. Both sides committed themselves as a matter of urgency to finding solutions to outstanding issues and good progress was made in this regard," read the statement.
