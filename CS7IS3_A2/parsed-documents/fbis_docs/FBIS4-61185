The head of the Azerbaijani state will sign a document in the capital of Belgium on the our republic's adherence to this program. Membership in such a program will play an important role in Azerbaijan's rapprochement with the Western countries, and will create wider possibilities to make use of NATO's prestige and influence for the peaceful resolution of the conflict [with Armenia] through talks. Before leaving for Brussels, the Azerbaijani president spoke to reporters on the aim of his visit. [Begin Aliyev recording] I will sign the document. This is the main purpose of my visit. In addition to that, many business circles in Brussels want to meet with me. I will meet with businessmen to solve the economic problems. This is because, as you know, Belgium is the center of European Economic Community. I will also discuss how this economic union could assist Azerbaijan. This is the main aim of my visit. Undoubtedly, the current situation in Azerbaijan, the ongoing war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the continuing aggression by Armenia against Azerbaijan -- these attacks are continuing even today -- will be explained both at NATO headquarters and during my other contacts. I will hold talks on these issues and will set out Azerbaijan's policies. The Armenian Armed Forces have been unceasingly attacking Azerbaijani territory since 10 April, despite the fact that they are suffering heavy losses. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces are causing them major losses. Despite that, they are still pressing ahead with their attacks, and they are not launching these attacks alone. I think that there are many forces helping them. We want to stop the shooting. We have already issued statements to this effect. We agreed to sign the cease-fire agreement sponsored and proposed by Russia's Foreign and Defense Ministries on 28 April. However, the Armenian side has not agreed to this. In the meantime, a large CSCE group has visited Azerbaijan headed by Mr. Mosberg. This delegation also included U.S. generals and representatives of Russia, Italy, and other CSCE countries. Mr. Mosberg held extensive talks with me. He then visited Daghlyk-Karabakh's [Nagorno-Karabakh] Khankendi [Stepanakert], and Yerevan. He returned to Baku for talks with me. They too put forward a draft cease-fire agreement. I agreed to that draft agreement too. However, when they returned to Yerevan and talked with Armenian President Ter-Petrosyan, he and the Armenian leadership did not agree to sign this agreement for the time being, and declared that at present they are not ready for a cessation of hostilities on the pretext that a special mechanism should be prepared to oversee a cease-fire. We too know that a special mechanism is needed to ensure and supervise the cease-fire. However, this mechanism could be created after the establishment of a cease-fire. It will serve neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan if we now sit and work on a mechanism while the fighting continues and people get killed on both sides. Mr. Mosberg phoned us from Yerevan informing us that the Armenian side did not agree with this, and therefore his delegation returned to Vienna. This is the situation for now. The Armenians are continuing their attacks, and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces are retaliating. The Armenian attacks have been repulsed in some sectors and their military goals have been blocked. They have withdrawn and suffered many losses. Despite this, the war is continuing. We are not for war. I again declare today that we favor the establishment of a cease-fire. However, the Armenian side does not agree to this. We will pursue our peace-loving policy.
