FR941227-0-00099 FR941227-0-00020 Section 570.426␣Program Income One commenter wrote favorably of §570.426(c) which provides that if a unit of general local government has no open CDBG grant at the time of closeout, program income of less than $25,000 per year after closeout will not be considered program income, and will not be subject to the requirements of this part. This provision has been retained in the final regulation. Section 570.429␣Hawaii General and Grant Requirements Three counties in the State of Hawaii commented that they did not want the method of distribution of Hawaii Small Cities funds to be changed by the issuance of a NOFA because that would impinge upon the ability of the Hawaii grantees to plan for future use of Small Cities funds. The Department agrees with this comment, and all references to a NOFA for the Hawaii Small Cities program were removed from §570.429. Two commenters from the State of Hawaii thought that paragraph (d)(1) of §570.429 should be revised to better define ``capacity to utilize the grant amount effectively and efficiently''. This term was used in the previous regulation at §570.435(c)(1)(ii)(A), and does not need to be redefined. Two commenters from the State of Hawaii requested that Hawaii grantees follow the application submission requirements in 24 CFR part 570, subpart D. Another commenter said that applications should be accepted and not approved. Section 570.429 has been revised to treat the Hawaii grantees as much like entitlement grantees as possible. Since the program is still discretionary under section 106(d) of Title I, the Department decided that applications should be required to be submitted and approved. Paragraph (g) of §570.429 indicates that the Department will approve the application unless it is shown that ``one or more of the following requirements (relating to completeness, timeliness, certifications, and compliance with this part) have not been met''. This provision gives assurance to Hawaii grantees that applications that are complete, timely, contain the proper certifications, and which are otherwise in compliance with this part will be approved. Another commenter from the State of Hawaii asked that paragraph (d)(2) of §570.429 regarding timely expenditures only consider grants from FY 1995 onward. Since it is the policy of the Department to encourage timely expenditures, the Department decided that all outstanding grants should be used in calculating timely expenditures under §570.902(a). The Department notes that Kauai's disaster grant will not be considered in the calculations. The final rule on the Consolidated Plan, which will be published shortly, will change the application, citizen participation, approval and reporting requirements for the Hawaii grantees. These changes will be incorporated into subpart F at the time the final consolidated plan regulation is promulgated. In view of the probable timing of submission of applications by Hawaii grantees, it is anticipated that these rule changes will apply to FY 1995 applications by Hawaii grantees. Section 570.430␣Hawaii Program Operation Requirements One commenter stated that paragraph (a) of §570.430 should be clarified to indicate that grants received in FY 1995 and thereafter are grants made from FY 1995 allocations and thereafter, and that grants made prior to FY 1995 are grants from allocations prior to FY 1995. This revision has been made in the final rule. Section 570.431␣Citizen Participation Four comments from the State of Hawaii concerned citizen participation requirements. One commenter requested that paragraph (e) of §570.431 be revised to indicate that the citizen participation requirements apply to the State of Hawaii, and two commenters requested that the entitlement citizen participation process be followed, and one commenter requested that the entitlement amendment process be followed by Hawaii grantees. The Department has decided to add a new paragraph (f) to §570.431 to clarify the requirements that Hawaii Small Cities grantees must follow. The citizen participation requirements are being included in the Small Cities final rule for clarity. It is noted that the citizen participation requirements for Hawaii grantees will be revised shortly, when the final rule on consolidated planning requirements is published. Section 570.432␣Repayment of Section 108 Loans Six commenters stated that Section 108 funds should not be used for the New York Small Cities Program because repayment will come from the total allocation of discretionary Small Cities funding for the State of New York. One commenter said that Section 108 funds must be backed by the community's own resources. In making non-entitled units of general local government in the State of New York eligible for the Section 108 program, the Department intends to provide small communities with the opportunity to fund large economic development projects_projects that they would not ordinarily be able to fund. Since it is envisioned that a significant portion of economic development funding will come from the Section 108 loan guarantee fund rather than the HUD-administered Small Cities Program, there will be more Small Cities funds available to fund non-economic development projects, even if a small portion of funds are used under §570.432 to repay amounts due on Section 108 loan obligations. All Section 108 loan obligations will be underwritten to ensure that only high quality projects are funded. In addition, the Department is considering instituting loan insurance pools to further ensure that the cost to the Small Cities Program will be minimized. Section 570.507␣Reports The Department agrees with the three commenters that indicated fifteen working days is insufficient time for New York grantees to submit a performance assessment report and has extended the period to 31 calendar days in the final rule. (See §570.507(a)(2)(ii)(A).) Three commenters from the State of Hawaii requested that HUD consider a uniform period of activity for their Small Cities performance and evaluation report. The Department agrees and §570.507(a)(2)(ii)(B) provides for this.
