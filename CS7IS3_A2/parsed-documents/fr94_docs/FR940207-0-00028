FR940207-0-00028 FR940207-0-00017 e. Review Under Executive Order 12612 f. Review Under Executive Order 12778 a. Regulatory Review This regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this action was not subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. b. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the Department has established guidelines for its compliance with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ). Pursuant to Appendix A of Subpart D of 10 CFR Part 1021, National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures, the Department of Energy has determined that this rule is categorically excluded from the need to prepare an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. c. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act To the extent that new information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposed by this rulemaking they are provided for under Office of Management and Budget paperwork clearance package No. 1910&hyph;0300. d. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will have no impact on interest rates, tax policies or liabilities, the cost of goods or services, or other direct economic factors. It will also not have any indirect economic consequences, such as changed construction rates. DOE certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. e. Review Under Executive Order 12612 Executive Order 12612, entitled ``Federalism,'' 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. This rule will not affect States substantially. f. Review Under Executive Order 12778 Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency subject to Executive Order 12291 to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected legal conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: Specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. DOE certifies that this rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and 2(b) of Executive Order 12778. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 970 Government procurement.
