New forms of management were created, entrepreneurship developed, and enterprises and organizations were privatized. In industry there was no further deepening of the decline of production, and the output of foodstuffs increased. In agriculture the production of animal husbandry products grew steadily, and the productivity of livestock increased. Implementation of the state program for targeted social protection of the population stabilized the standard of living. The growth rates of the monetary incomes of the population outstripped the growth of consumer prices. There was an increase in the consumption of certain basic food products. But the economic reforms are proceeding with difficulty. The crisis of mutual nonpayments has become more severe. Some productions have shut down. The production volume has decreased in many branches of industry except for flour-cereal and manufactured concentrated feeds, printing, forestry, wood processing, and pulp and paper. The volume of cargo shipments has decreased. In spite of the reduction of the inflation level as compared to 1992, it is still fairly high. The commodity supply on the consumer market is decreasing. While foreign economic activity is expanding, the commodity structure of exports is deteriorating. The volume of paid services offered has decreased considerably. Against a background of a relatively low level of officially registered unemployment, there has been an accumulation of concealed unemployment. Indexes, Prices, and Rates During 1993 there was a steady rise of consumer prices in the republic. There was a ninefold increase in the price of foodstuffs, nonfoodstuffs--7.5-fold, and paid services--24.2-fold. Compared to December of the preceding year the prices of meat and poultry increased 13.3-fold, sausage items--11.7-fold, eggs--12.2- fold, vegetables--16.4-fold, margarine products--14.4-fold, and fruits--8.8-fold. Prices at the city markets increased 10.2-fold during this same period, including for crop growing products--10.9-fold, and animal husbandry products--12.1-fold. The cost of a selection of the 19 most important food products in December was (taking the market into account) 22,390 rubles [R] and it increased 8.5-fold as compared to December 1992. Prices of nonfoodstuffs increased 11.7-fold as compared to December 1992; fabric prices increased 7.5-fold, leather and textile footwear--12.6-fold, woolen fabrics--8.1-fold, clothing and linen--12.5-fold, and construction materials--9.9-fold. Prices of durable goods increased 9.5-fold, including: rugs--6.6-fold, furniture-- 13.4-fold, and fur items--10.4-fold. Prices and rates of consumer services increased 13-fold as compared to December 1992, transportation services--ninefold, housing and municipal services--10-fold, cultural institutions--23.7-fold, and services of a legal nature and of banking institutions--20.6 percent. By the end of 1993 there was a retardation of the growth of prices from the producers, which was influenced by the growing shortage of monetary funds among the majority of consumers of industrial products. As compared to December 1992, the highest rates of growth of prices were observed in the following branches: electric energy--16.1-fold, ferrous metallurgy--11.6-fold, electrical engineering--11-fold, and meat--15.3-fold. The Standard of Living The monetary incomes of the population in December amounted to a total of R272 billion and had increased 9.6-fold as compared to the same period of 1992. This came to R72,800 per capita. The average amount of wages paid to workers in December 1993 was R128,100, a 9.5-fold increase as compared to the same period of 1992, including in industry, where it reached R118,100, agriculture--R113,700, construction--R189,100, transportation--R174,900, public education--R82,600, culture and art--R72,100, and public health--R99,900. The subsistence minimum (Footnote 1) (The subsistence minimum was calculated on the basis of the methodology of the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor. According to it the subsistence minimum includes: Costs of food products based on the minimum amounts of their consumption determined by the Institute of Nutrition of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, the Institute of Socioeconomic Problems of the Population of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Ministry of Labor of Russia; expenditures on nonfoodstuffs and services, and also taxes and mandatory payments, based on the structure of expenditures on them among the 10 percent of the least well-off families.) on average per one resident increased 10.2-fold as compared to December 1992 and amounted to R24,900. In 1993 there was a rise in the level of consumption of meat and meat products, fish, fruits and berries, sugar, vegetable oil, and other fats, while there was a reduction of the level of consumption of grain products, dairy products, and vegetables (except potatoes). The overall number of citizens registered with the employment service who were not engaged in labor activity as of 1 January 1994 was 12,800 individuals, 3,800 people, or 0.23 percent of the economically active population, had the official status of unemployed. About 100,000 people are working part time and are potentially unemployed. According to a preliminary estimate, the population of the republic as of the beginning of 1994 amounted to 3.749 million. The reduction of the number was caused by unfavorable changes in the processes of natural reproduction: The level of the death rate (11.8 per 1,000 population) exceeds the level of the birth rate (11 per 1,000 population). In 1993 there were positive aspects in the marriage and divorce processes: The number of marriages increased and the divorce rates slowed up. Education. As of the beginning of the current school year there were 2,504 general educational schools in the republic, in which 551,800 children were studying. There are 90,700 children studying in 457 schools with in-depth study of subjects, including 87 gymnasiums and 28 lyceums. There are seven nonstate schools in operation. In the republic 23 percent of the students attend the second shift and 10 schools conduct classes on three shifts. There are 63,800 students in the 16 higher educational institutions and three branches, and 53,700 students in 65 secondary specialized educational institutions and five branches. Four nonstate VUZ's [higher educational institutions] have received licenses and 1,075 individuals are studying in them. The ecological situation. During 1993 there was a certain reduction of discharges of pollutants into the atmosphere and bodies of water, primarily because of the decline of industrial production. In 1993 there were nine cases of surging and emergency discharges and overflows of pollutants into the atmosphere, bodies of water, and land. The consumer market. The retail commodity turnover of officially registered enterprises of state and cooperative trade, including public catering, during 1993 amounted to R866.9 billion and had increased ninefold in actual prices as compared to the preceding year. The actual volume of commodity turnover in comparable prices decreased by 23.1 percent. Still predominant in trade is the state sector, which accounted for 64 percent of the retail commodity turnover (in 1992--65 percent), consumers' cooperative enterprises--19 percent (20 percent), and the private sector--11 percent (1 percent), and other nonstate forms of ownership--16 percent (14 percent).

The volume of sales of consumer services in the report year was 8.4 times higher than in the preceding year, but in physical mass the volume rendered was 39.6 percent less. There was an increase in the proportion of paid services for keeping children in preschool institutions, health protection, and services of a legal nature because of the sharp increases in prices and rates. The proportion of services of consumer service enterprises is tending to decrease. A large proportion of the population has been forced to do without a number of services because of their high cost. Industry During 1993 industrial enterprises produced R3.103 trillion worth of products in current prices, which is 6.8 times more than during the preceding year. At the same time the index of the physical volume of industrial production was 85.1 percent of the 1992 level. The process of destatization of enterprises has continued in industry this year.

In the timber, wood processing, and pulp and paper industry last year the output of commercial timber decreased by 5.5 percent as compared to the 1992 level. The shortage of wood raw material led to a reduction of the production of window and door frames (by 43.3 percent), and plant manufactured houses (6.4 percent). There was an increase in the output of paper (by 39.8 percent) and cardboard (0.9 percent). In the construction materials industry in 1993 there was a reduction as compared to the 1992 level of the production of construction brick--17.3 percent, linoleum--13.6 percent, prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and parts--13.1 percent.

The number of farmer-run farms has increased and the allotment of land for collective gardening and orchard raising has continued. In animal husbandry there has been a considerable increase in the delivery of products from farms of agricultural enterprises and also from private yards of the citizens. During 1993 the sale of cattle and poultry for slaughter increased, according to calculations, by 3 percent, and milk--by 7 percent. Egg production was at practically the same level as the preceding year. The increase in the volume of production of animal husbandry products was brought about mainly by the increased productivity of the livestock.
