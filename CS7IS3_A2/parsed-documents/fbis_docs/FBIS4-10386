These results are part of the first nationwide poll by Datafolha following the deadline for candidates to resign their current government posts (2 April). Preferences for Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party] and for Orestes Quercia (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] stood at 10 and 8 percent, respectively. FOLHA is for the first time publishing charts comparing the performance of parties in the campaigns of 1989 and 1994. The PT and the PSDB have improved their performance in all regions, while Brizola became weaker, especially in southern Brazil.
