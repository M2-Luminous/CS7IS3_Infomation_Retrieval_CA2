In its place, the KDNP National Board elected a smaller interim presidium with a six-month mandate in Budapest today. The National Board re-elected Laszlo Surjan as party chairman. In the May elections, the Christian Democrats won 22 seats in Hungary's 386-member parliament, corresponding to 5.7 per cent of the mandates. Both the party leadership and the members were dissatisfied with the result. The mandate of the interim presidium will expire within 60 days after the municipal elections this autumn but not later than on December 15. Surjan told the press that the KDNP would hold a national meeting in autumn to discuss the party's political renewal, decide on structural changes, and revise the party rules.
