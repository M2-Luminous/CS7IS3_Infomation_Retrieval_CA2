RCCK Vice Chairman Li Ganliu made the call on behalf of his party at Wednesday's [16 March] meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). "The Taiwan authorities should abandon illusions, face the reality, accept CPC's proposals on opening talks between the two parties and establishing direct exchanges of mail, trade, and shipping and air services between the two sides of the Taiwan straits, and make decisions that will benefit the Chinese nation," he said. Relations across the Straits and the situation relating to the peaceful reunification of China have undergone significant changes in the past year, and the major trend of changes is positive, he said. Li reviewed development of relations between the two sides: economic links between the two sides are growing, with Taiwan investment in the mainland increasing by a big margin; trade and personnel exchanges between the two sides are expanding rapidly; and agreements reached between the two non-governmental organizations, namely the Strait Exchange Foundation of Taiwan and the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits of the mainland, marked a historical step forward in relations between the two sides. He pointed out, however, that the Taiwan authorities stubbornly cling to their policy of blocking direct commercial and communication links with the mainland. On the other hand, they are pursuing a splittist policy of "two Chinas" on the international scene by carrying out "money campaigns" and "flexible diplomacy." Last year, they stepped up activities for Taiwan's "return to the United Nations" in an attempt to gain "dual recognition." After the attempt was thwarted, they have resorted to "holiday-making diplomacy" recently. Facts have shown that there has not been a fundamental change in the Taiwan authorities' wrong stand on the reunification of China. Their activities are in contradiction with their repeatedly proclaimed stand of "one China." He said the reunification of China is an irresistible trend of the times and the aspirations of people on both sides of the straits. Any attempts to delay the cause of reunification and to create "two Chinas" are doomed to fail, he said.
