He said France would call on its partners to help resolve the Chernobyl "problem" at the European Union [EU] summit on June 24 and 25 at Corfu and at next month's meeting of the G7 leading industrial nations in Naples. The question of closing Chernobyl -- which Ukraine says it cannot afford to do unaided -- is on the agenda for both meetings. The plant at Chernobyl -- the site in April 1986 of the world's worst civilian nuclear accident -- constituted "a very serious danger" on safety grounds, Balladur added. The main priority was to "put an end to the production of electricty from the Chernobyl plant," he said. "We must help the Ukranian Government to build three more modern and risk-free power plants.... That presupposes helping Ukraine, whose economic and financial situation is disastrous," he said, adding: "Helping Ukraine is a major priority." Balladur stressed that electricity produced at Chernobyl and sold in Central Europe was one of Kiev's few assets. [passage omitted]
