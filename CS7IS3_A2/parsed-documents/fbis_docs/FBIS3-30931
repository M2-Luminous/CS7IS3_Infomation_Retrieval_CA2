He made it clear that he had received this message from General Angus Ramsey, UNPROFOR headquarters commander. Gvero interprets this decision as an increase in the various pressures and threats aimed in recent days at the people of the Srpska republic as well as its political leadership and army. "Regrettably, it seems that this is being pursued by the international institutions present in this area whose mission should be of a peacemaking and unbiased nature," Gen. Gvero said. "Today, Gen. Ramsey phoned me and said that UNPROFOR had decided to refuse any inspection of their convoys," he said. "In other words, they regard checking convoys as an infringement of their freedom of movement." Gvero, however, stresses that because of a large number of attempts to abuse these convoys the Serb side cannot tolerate their movement without checking their cargo. "We, just like the entire civilized world, regard inspection as a method of confidence-building rather than a curb on movement. No good would come of pushing through, in this way, a decision to refuse any inspection of their convoys," he said. "In other words, they regard checking convoys as an infringement of their freedom of movement." Gvero also said that the Serb side has a report that UNHCR staff have been ordered to leave their offices on the territory of the Srpska republic. "We are checking this report and if it is true we shall prevent them from fleeing our territory," he said. "None of the measures taken by these institutions and organizations have been caused in any way by our conduct or actions." "We do not accept ultimatums of any kind, while we are ready, just as we have been so far, for any kind of equitable and civilized cooperation," Gen. Gvero said in conclusion.
