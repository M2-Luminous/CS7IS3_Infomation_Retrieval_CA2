Both times, the country was handed over to alien powers. Organizations that caused national tragedies have no place in Hungarian public life, he went on. Although outrage was considerable, this should not mean over-evaluating the organization's political weight. Unless the organization commits a specific crime then Boross saw it as a Public Prosecutor's Office matter. He said both the extreme right and the extreme left should be seen as equally dangerous. Discussing the chances of the left-wing at the elections, Boross said victory by the Socialists would imply trouble: "We have already experienced their professionalism and decision-making ability." Boross said governing in a transition period implies unpopular measures. Restructuring comes with sacrifice and loss, and many people have become disillusioned, even with a government which has, uniquely in the region, served all four years in office. But, the Hungarian election system disadvantages non-left-wing parties, as the center and center-right are sharply divided.
