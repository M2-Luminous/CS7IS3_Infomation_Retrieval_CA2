FR940930-2-00056 FR940930-2-00034 Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Eligible Applicants Eligible applicants are national organizations (NOs), including national minority organizations (NMOs). All applicants must provide documentation proving that they meet the following criteria: A. Be an established national (defined by charter or bylaws to operate nationally), nonprofit organization (a nongovernmental, nonprofit corporation or association whose net earnings in no part accrue to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals). Bylaws and/or charter must be furnished with the application. The following is acceptable evidence of nonprofit status: *A copy of a currently valid Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax exemption certificate. B. A national minority organization must furnish a written statement that more than 50 percent of the board of directors of said organization are racial or ethnic minority members. Groups recognized as racial and ethnic populations are: African Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Asian Americans, Caribbean Americans, Latinos/Hispanics, and Pacific Islanders. Proof of nonprofit and organizational status and other eligibility criteria must be submitted with the application for determination of eligibility. No application will be accepted without proof of nonprofit status. Assistance will be provided only to national organizations and national minority organizations as described above. To help prevent the spread of HIV infection, CDC proposes to support such organizations which have existing networks and constituents and the capacity to serve communities across the nation. This ensures that all communities_urban, suburban, and rural_have both public and private sector resources to assist them in their prevention efforts. Availability of Funds Approximately $5 million is expected to be available in FY 1995 to fund approximately 20 awards. It is expected that the average award will be $125,000 per year, ranging from $100,000 to $200,000 per year. Awards to fund programs planned for national minority organizations may range between $250,000 and $300,000 per year. In addition, one award of up to $1,000,000 can be made to support a local condom availability social marketing demonstration project in three communities. It is expected that the awards will begin on or about March 1, 1995. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. Grantees will be asked to submit yearly continuation applications, including verification of eligibility requirements. Programmatic and budget justification are required for all applications. Applicants requesting funding as national minority organizations will be considered separately from non-minority applicants. Subject to the availability of funds and the receipt of technically acceptable, fundable applications, at least twelve awards are expected to be made to national organizations that target business, and labor, religious, voluntary, media and other appropriate sectors (ranging from 2&hyph;5 awards per sector); at least two awards are expected to be made to national professional or academic organizations, specific to health communications and/or behavior and social sciences evaluation; at least one award is expected to be made to a national organization representing public health; at least one award to a national organization that is qualified to effectively reach and impact gay, bisexual, and lesbian audiences; at least two awards to national minority organizations for health communications; and at least one award to a national organization to develop and implement a condom accessibility demonstration project in at least three communities. Awards will be made for a 12-month budget period within a 3-year project period. ( Budget period is the interval of time into which the project period is divided for funding and reporting purposes. Project period is the total time for which a project has been programmatically approved.) Continuation awards for years 2 and 3 within an approved project period are made on the basis of satisfactory performance and the availability of funds. These funds may not supplant or duplicate existing funding from any other public or private source. Although contracts with other organizations are allowable under these cooperative agreement awards, applicants themselves must perform a substantial portion of the activities for which funds are requested. No funds will be provided for patient medical care or purchase of drugs or vaccines.
