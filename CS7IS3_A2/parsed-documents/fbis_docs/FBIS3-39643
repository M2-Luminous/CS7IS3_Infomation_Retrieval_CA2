Afterward, Evert told correspondents that he and the prime minister discussed the sphere of our national issues, which are intense these days. Evert said he could not detail the discussion. He said: I will say only that New Democracy, as a national party, will keep the national front firm. The official opposition leader noted that he was not satisfied with all the answers and thoughts raised in his talks with the prime minister. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos stressed: The Greek Government will not brief foreign governments on its decision [concerning relations with Skopje], which was made within the framework of national sovereignty and with great wisdom. But the spokesman did say that Foreign Ministry Secretary General Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis will brief the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Venizelos made it clear that humanitarian aid is excluded from the trade blockade of Skopje. The blockade includes shipments that are in transit through Greece unless such transport involves items from diplomatic, United Nations, and CSCE missions on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] Greece warns that stronger measures will be implemented unless Skopje's intransigence is bent. Greece is also preparing to refute--on a political and legal level--the objections by the European partners and the United States. The main axis of the Greek argument will be that Greece follows international law. Reference will also be made to the articles of the European Unification Treaty that give member countries the right to invoke action for reasons of particular national interest. Reportedly, there is already a report at the prime minister's office and at Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' office. It was prepared by the legal department of the Foreign Ministry and includes the arguments the Greek representatives will put forward abroad and with international organizations.
