Koran Radio To Transmit 24 Hours Per Day EDITOR ASSAILS AL-AZHAR CRITICS In his back-page 400-word "A Call to Reason" column, Chief Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf mocks "the children of the West" in Egypt who call for minimizing the role of al-Azhar. He cites some of the ideas of these "children," who he says "claim to lead an enlightenment campaign." For example, he says, they accuse al-Azhar of expanding the base of extremism and opening the door to terrorism. They are further quoted as advocating that Islamic education at schools must be kept to a minimum "so that extremist thought may not invade the minds of our sons and daughters and threaten national unity." And they are said to deny the existence of such things as moderate Islam, as opposed to extremist Islam. Commenting on this, the writer says: "May God curse an enlightenment essentially based on demolishing religion, desecrating sanctities, and undermining the constant principles that preserved this nation for centuries despite vicious attacks. May God protect Islam and Egypt from every treacherous hand trying to harm them, either by bullets or the pen." COLUMNIST URGES LAW ORGANIZING RELIGIOUS RULINGS In his 400-word "Rightfully I Say" column on page one, Samir Rajab, the newspaper's board chairman, calls for unifying fatwas [religious rulings]. He calls for legislation imposing severe punishment on anyone passing fatwas without having the official power to do so. To support his call, he claims that mosques, which are open to anyone, "were behind the breeding of terrorism. False muftis emerged along with false preachers, and they both played a serious role in planting the seeds of terrorism." The writer believes that "depending on security alone to face the phenomenon of terrorism is not enough." He urges the government to rush to draft a law unifying fatwas "otherwise the government would be supporting terrorism without knowing it." CONFERENCE LABELLING COPTS AS MINORITY CRITICIZED A 700-word report by Tariq 'Abdallah on page two focuses on a conference on minorities in the Arab world and the Middle East organized by an Egyptian studies center. 'Abdallah says: Many accusations have been leveled against the organizers, especially for characterizing the Copts in Egypt as a minority. Dr. Sa'd al-Din Ibrahim, president of the organizing center, is cited defending the conference and the British organization financing it. Ibrahim says that objection to the presentation of Egypt's Copts as a minority is acceptable but he stresses that the conference aim is to discuss the problems and concerns of the Copts in Egypt, not their status. Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim al-Fayyumi, secretary general of the Higher Council for Islamic Affairs, is quoted criticizing the conference and maintaining that Egypt's Copts cannot be labelled as a minority because they are Egyptians governed by the Egyptian Constitution and have the same rights and duties as Muslims. He says Copts have no special problems or concerns. Former Government Attorney Edward Ghali al-Dhahabi describes the conference as "very bad" and maintains that Copts are an integral part of Egyptian society. A related item on the conference, a 700-word article by Majdi Salim on page 10, discusses attempts to "wake up sedition" under the guise of freedom of expression and thought. Implicitly referring to the minorities conference as one of these attempts, the writer states: "Every citizen in Egypt is Egyptian. They are all of the same race. There is no such thing as a minority or majority and everyone has citizenship rights without discrimination." In his article, Salim also refers to writers who criticized a decision by some governors to prevent the use of satellite dishes in cafes and public places in their governorates to protect youths from watching explicit movies. RELIGIOUS SEMINAR SAYS NO LINK BETWEEN ISLAM AND TERRORISM An approximately 2,000-word report on page four, attributed to Mamduh al-'Ushri, Musa Hal, and Nazih Fudah, details a religious seminar organized by 'AQIDATI at a youth center in al-Daqahliyah Governorate. Speakers addressed the audience and answered questions on religious issues and practices. Asked about Islam's relationship with terrorism, the newspaper's chief editor, al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, is quoted as replying: "There is no relationship between Islam and terrorism. Indeed, Western media are seriously and intentionally promoting this mistaken belief and, regrettably, some news media here are joining them, with bad intentions." He is cited adding: "The assassinations or bombings taking place here cannot be linked with Islam, even if they are perpetrated by Muslims. These people are not real Muslims. Islam is not a bloody religion." He is further quoted as saying that confronting terrorism is the responsibility of all society. SEMINAR SAYS ISLAMIC PENAL CODE REFORMS SOCIETY An approximately 1,500-word unattributed report on page 10 cites speakers at a seminar on "The Concept of Integration of Islam" organized by the Islamic Research and Studies Center at Cairo University. The speakers discuss the foundations of Islam that make it an integrated religion. One of these, according to one speaker, is Islamic legislation--the laws and provisions that organize the life of the Muslim individual and group and that determine punishments. Dr. Muhammad Baltaji, dean of Dar-al-'Ulum College, is cited attacking those who brand the Islamic system of punishment as inhuman. He says the application of the Islamic penal code, which does not differentiate between the rich and the poor, or the strong and the weak, reforms society. He adds: "The application of the penal code is the way out of today's problems. The best proof is that the rate of crime is less in societies that apply shari'ah than in others." "KORANIC MEDICINE" OFFENSE TO ISLAM Pages 12 and 13 feature an approximately 3,500-word report by Jamal Salim discussing "a serious phenomenon spreading in several towns and villages in Egypt's countryside, namely, medical treatment through the Koran." "Koranic doctors" reportedly treat all kinds of illness, from fatigue and colic to paralysis and impotence. The reporter asks Egypt's mufti, Muhammad Tantawi, and other clerics, psychologists, and sociologists about this practice. They maintain that the phenomenon offends Islam and they attribute it to ignorance and to charlatans exploiting people's religious sentiments. Tantawi says the Koran can be used to treat souls for hatred, envy, and similar psychological symptoms but not physical diseases. A related 150-word report by Musa Hal on page one says al-Azhar's Fatwa Committee warned against the Koran being used by charlatans to profit and exploit simple-minded people under the pretext of treating diseases. The committee said that using the Koran to mislead the simple is a major crime and a sin. CHADIAN ISLAMIC OFFICIAL INTERVIEWED On page 20 there is an approximately 1,500-word interview with the chairman of the Higher Islamic Affairs Council in Chad, Imam Husayn Hasan Abu-Bakr, by Tariq 'Abdallah. Abu-Bakr discusses the problems facing Muslims in his country, al-Azhar's important role in serving Islam, and features of an Islamic awakening in Chad. KORAN RADIO TO TRANSMIT 24 HOURS PER DAY A 50-word report by Mamduh al-'Ashri on page one cites Information Minister Muhammad Safwat al-Sharif ordering an extension of the Koran radio's transmission to 24 hours a day throughout the year, effective 31 May 1994. Commenting on the decision in a 200-word article on page 18, Mamduh al-'Ashri thanks the information minister and urges him to instruct the television's management to broadcast religious programs at suitable times so as to serve Islam and spread the right religious awareness.
