Based on the new conditions that have appeared in our economic operations in the first few months of 1994, the experts have recently presented certain differing views. In 1994, China's industrial production, in addition to continuing to be restricted by transportation, energy, and raw materials "bottlenecks," has also run into certain new problems, the more glaring of which are fund shortages and marketing difficulties. In many places, "triangular debt" has resurged, not only interfering with normal enterprise production, but also having a severe impact on fund turnover, profit and tax payments, and employee [wage] distribution. Due to poor sales, the first two months of 1994 contrast with the same period in 1993 as: the manufactured goods sales rate is down 1.6 percent; finished goods inventories of independently accounted industrial enterprises throughout China top 400 billion yuan, up 30 percent from the beginning of 1993. Impacted by funds and sales, state-owned industrial production growth in 1994 is nearly stagnant, up only 1.2 percent for January and February over the same period in 1993. This includes declines in state industrial production of 2.4-4.4 percent in places, such as Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. In light of these phenomena, the analyses of certain economics experts hold that this impact on state industry will gradually be reflected somewhat in the production and sales of township enterprises and other similar types of enterprises, so that the Chinese economy in 1994 is likely to see low or even zero growth. But certain other experts take the absolutely opposite view, holding that 1994's growth rate not only will not be low, but even will be higher than 1993's. Their key grounds are that overall investment and consumer demand are now both brisker. Meanwhile, the growth momentum of coastal and township industry remains quite strong, averaging over 20 percent for the first two months in places, such as Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangsu; township-run industrial output value is still growing at a rate of 49 percent; the growth of the three kinds of foreign trade enterprises and private industry is even higher at 76.4 percent. So will the Chinese economy in 1994 see low growth or high growth? It seems that we still need to analyze more conditions. As long as China's inflationary pressures are quite strong, a too fast economic growth rate will cause high inflation, which in turn will severely threaten 1994's overall reform and social stability, finally forcing us to take "brake-slamming" steps. So while things are tight, an economic slide is inevitable. To prevent this, the center has not only set forth clear macroeconomic regulation and control targets--GNP growth of 9 percent, industrial production growth of 15 percent, an investment scale of 1.3 trillion yuan, and new loans of 470 billion yuan, but has also taken effective steps, such as stopping up "the two floodgates" of money supply and credit, and conducting a strict "two controls"--controlling too fast growth of investment scale and too much expansion of consumption funds. Our experience in the last half of 1993 showed that as long as we exercise timely macroeconomic regulation and control, we can prevent economic overheating, to maintain the sustained and sound growth of our national economy. So it seems that there is little likelihood that the Chinese economy in 1994 will overheat again or see growth rates higher than in 1993. Our 1994 growth rates will be neither too high or too low. While some areas and enterprises have recently run into certain thorny problems, with new conditions appearing in economic activities, this will not be enough to impact and change our good growth momentum of recent years. In short, the international economic climate, domestic public demand, and basic industry supply capability and credit fund conditions will all support the continued rapid growth of the Chinese economy. 1. The faster growth of the world economy, particularly the recovery of the economies of Western countries after 3 years of recession, will provide the opportunity for the rapid growth of the Chinese economy. On one hand, investment by foreign firms in China will maintain its very brisk momentum; on the other, driven by world economic growth, international market demand and trade will increase sharply, which will be highly beneficial to increased Chinese export trade. 2. Since we exercised [tightened] macroeconomic regulation and control in the last half of 1993, our residents' savings are up sharply, and our banking system, after being rectified, has also amassed a sizeable amount of available funds. These will both provide funding sources for maintaining a definite overall investment scale in 1994, as well as for further alleviating enterprise working capital shortages. 3. The series of significant reform steps that we took at the beginning of 1994 will gradually become a new and powerful driving force to promote the sustained growth of the Chinese economy. Meanwhile, local governments at all levels and enterprises remain subject to an inherent impulse calling for faster growth, with the Central Government also emphasizing that development opportunities be seized, and certainly not hoping that its macroeconomic policy orientation will bring growth rates back down too much, to cause a chain reaction and shock. 4. While 1993's macroeconomic regulation and control shrunk capital construction investment somewhat, "projects" still exist, with 1994's ongoing scale still quite large, which is substantial grounds driving rapid economic growth. As to consumer demand, 1994's increase in wages for employees in administrative organs and institutions will bring enterprise employee wage increases; peasant income is also expected to continue to grow steadily. So as both urban and rural incomes grow, overall consumer demand, along with consumer markets, will maintain steady growth. 5. Recently, our transportation, energy, and raw materials supply conflicts have eased somewhat. And in light of the growth of our basic industry supply capability and our import-export adjustment, the rapid growth of the Chinese economy in 1994 is also ensured fundamentally and materially. In addition, township, the three kinds of foreign trade, and private enterprises have not only become a vital new force on our economic front, but also are maintaining a strong growth momentum. So even though our state industry growth rate is not high, this will not have a substantial impact on the rapid growth of our national economy in 1994. According to the general pattern of China's economic-growth boom-and-bust cycle, after two successive years of rapid growth, growth will top out and begin to fall back in 1994, so that our economic growth rate will decline somewhat. But an analysis summing up conditions in all areas shows that this decline will not be very large, so that our 1994 economic growth rate is likely to remain at about 11 percent. The matter that currently needs attention is the need to earnestly tighten and improve our macroeconomic regulation and control, by controlling our investment scale, in order to curb price rises. The appearance of severe inflation would not only have a negative impact on our social stability and reform progress, but also would force our economic operations to a "hard landing."
