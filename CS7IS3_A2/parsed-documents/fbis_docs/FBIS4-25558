The Russian airplane manufacturer will send personnel to assist in the analysis. The plane crash, the most serious incident in China's civil aviation history, shows once again the serious problems in China's civil aviation safety. In order to quickly reverse the situation, the solution is not merely to purchase several more advanced planes from abroad, but more importantly to vigorously import the management system of the modern aviation industry to enable the quality of personnel and management levels to catch up with the speedily developing civil aviation industry. State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua recently urged the management of China's civil aviation to draw a lesson from the air crash and to adopt more measures to step up security. In fact, the authorities' determination to step up aviation security is seen from the placement of new heads of the Civil Aviation General Administration at the end of last year and the upgrading of the General Administration from the vice ministerial level to the ministerial level. Moreover, the new personnel really have had new performance, which includes the promulgation of a series of regulations on air traffic management and several measures to upgrade services and safeguard the safety of civil aviation. Early this month, they held many meetings at which they stressed the paramount importance of "strict control." Despite this, records of civil aviation safety are still worrying. In May, there were 17 incidents, which were followed by a plane explosion in the air. What were the reasons for the frequent incidents? According to an analysis by a senior official of China Northwest Airline, one of the main factors were that the civil aviation industry is developing too quickly and the corresponding technology, equipment, personnel, and management cannot catch up. In recent years, passenger volume of China's civil aviation has continuously increased at a rate of 25 to 30 percent each year and several dozen local airlines have been newly set up. There is no denying that the delegation of executive powers and the increasing purchase of new airplanes from abroad help meet the huge need of the aviation market. But for the civil aviation industry, a special industry that gives priority to safety, introducing modern management concepts and systems and hiring overseas management and technical personnel in the field are important and must not be delayed. China has already placed a record-breaking order for new American passenger planes to replace old models. But the immediate task is that it should, beginning with the management system, make great efforts with regard to personnel, training, maintenance, supervision, control, and logistics to ensure that regulations are implemented.
