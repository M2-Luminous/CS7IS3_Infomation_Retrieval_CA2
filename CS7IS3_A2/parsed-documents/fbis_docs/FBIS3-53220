Commenting on the failure of the meeting, held early this week, to achieve a result, the daily `ABRAR' said that the Syrians accepted to attend the 6 + 2 due to their expanded disputes with Baghdad regime. The paper draw the attention of the Syrian statemen to the fact that since the U.S. looks at 6 + 2 as a `club' for those favoring the compromise trend in the Middle East, Syria's particiaption in such a group might be interpreted as a blow to the political dignity of an independent progressive country. If the U.S. will be able to join Damascus to Tel Aviv there would be no problem, otherwise, said the paper in conlusion, Syria would have no place among the other seven countries. Commenting on the same subject `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' referred to the role that Egypt played in the meeting and said Cairo did not waste any attempt to sow seeds of suspicion over the future of Iran's cooperation with regional countries. "It has always tried to frustrate any proper effort for regional cooperation by creating a state of pessimism and concern among the regional states." As far as Iran is concerned, added the daily, the Islamic republic has never interfered in internal affairs or decision-making of its arab or other neighboring countries and would never do so in future. However, the article noted, Cairo was looking for its own interests in the "troubled waters of the Persian Gulf" and in creating tension in Iran's relations with the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council (P)GCC. The article pointed to the fact that Egypt, due to its severe security crisis and lack of public support, was not able to help the (P)GCC to maintain regional security and stability. Time has proven that regional security should be only maintained by the region's littoral states and any attempt to neglect such a concrete reality would only ruin "golden opportunities" for preserving regional security and might, it concluded.
