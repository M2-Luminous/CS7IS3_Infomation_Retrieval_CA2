Balana and Lynda T. Jumilla] [Text] Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday described as "inappropriate" and "unproductive" the United States decision to send 160 Patriot air defense missiles to South Korea, saying the arms buildup against communist North Korea could lead to "miscalculation" and war. Sharing Romulo's apprehensions, Sen. Blas F. Ople warned the Philippines may again be drawn into a full-scale conflict in the peninsula as in the 1950-53 Korean War. Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, however, called on the Philippines and other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to avoid knee-jerk reactions and "carefully measure their responses to developments in the Korean peninsula." Tensions on the peninsula are high over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. Nearly 2 million troops on both Koreas have been placed on a heightened alert. The situation sharply deteriorated last weekend after Pyongyang barred UN experts from inspecting sites where North Korea is believed to be developing nuclear weapons. While seeking UN sanctions against Pyongyang, the United States decided to ship Patriot missiles, more troops and additional arms to South Korea. Washington also planned to revive "Team Spirit" military exercises with Seoul. North Korea has declared these U.S. measures, if pushed ahead, would be taken as a declaration of war. "I continue to be worried about the Korean situation," Romulo told a press briefing. "All parties must be deliberate in action and not consider the international isolation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." He said the United States approach was "inappropriate, unproductive and may even cause disequilibrium in the Asia-Pacific region." Romulo's statements represented a rare instance when Manila openly refused to toe the U.S. line. He said Washington seemed "unmindful" of the repercussions of its action on ASEAN members, including the Philippines, should the heightened tension on the Korean peninsula lead to war. Like Washington, Manila only has diplomatic relations with Seoul but not with Pyongyang, an isolated, Stalinist state. Still, Romulo said, it would be more productive if North Korea were encouraged to join the international community of nations. Romulo said he has ordered Philippine Ambassador to South Korea Francisco Benedicto to draw up a contingency plan for some 20,000 Filipino workers there should war break out. At the Senate, Ople said he expects the Philippines to be "under pressure" to support any UN-led military action against Pyongyang. During the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Manila sided with Seoul and sent the Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea upon the "request" of the U.S.-dominated United Nations. President Ramos, then a lieutenant, was part of the Philippine military contingent. "If there's going to be war between the United Nations and North Korea, I would expect the Philippines to be put under pressure to send troops," said Ople, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said the imposition of UN economic sanctions would force Pyongyang to resort to war. Ople called on Manila to lead the ASEAN in an "intensified peace diplomacy" to defuse the tension in the Korean peninsula. But Biazon said the Philippines may not necessarily be compelled to send a military contingent should a Korean war erupt anew. "Not one nation can be compelled to do so because sending troops is a function also of its capability to bankroll, equip, and staff such a force," he said. Biazon called on Pacific rim nations, particularly ASEAN members, to "carefully measure their responses to the developments in the Korean peninsula." "This is just the classic military situation of buildup on the frontlines and there may not be cause for alarm at the moment," he said. Biazon said that conditions are no longer the same as in the 1950s because the Cold War is over and countries in the region are more concerned about economic progress. But should tensions degenerate into a military confrontation, "then let it be confined to the peninsula," he said.
