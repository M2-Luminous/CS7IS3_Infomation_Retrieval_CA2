(KOTRA) said Friday. Government permits granted for Korean enterprises' investment in the CIS region totaled 28 cases last year, compared to 21 for the four years between 1989 and 1992. Among the CIS countries, Russia topped the Korean investment list with 23 cases last year, of which the Far Eastern and Siberian region claimed 15. In contrast, investment in Moscow came to only five cases. KOTRA has advised Korean businesses to hike investment in the region around Lake Baikal, where natural resources are abundant and geographical conditions are good, and the Ural mountains, which is Russia's biggest industrial region. Among investments, those in machinery and facilities are promising since Russian state-run enterprises and munitions factories are being converted into civilian industry and privatized, according to KOTRA. Korean businesses need to secure stability by forming a consortium to invest in resources development, because investments require an enormous amount of money and time, KOTRA said. Businesses should seek to reduce risks until Russia's political and economic systems stabilize by focusing on small investments.
