The amendments require offsets to be obtained for both VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NO X ) in ozone nonattainment areas. The amendments also require that major new sources of the nonattainment pollutant locating in a nonattainment area to obtain offsets for the major new source and associated minor sources using a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 for VOC and NO X sources on ozone nonattainment areas and greater than one to one for CO nonattainment areas.

This rule meets the requirement of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 for new sources locating in nonattainment areas.
