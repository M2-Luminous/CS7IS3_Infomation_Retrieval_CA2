Most foreigners have left, including journalists. However, Kigali has still not fallen into the hands of the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], but the Rwandan capital is totally surrounded. Captain Witner was among the paratroopers on the ground. He came back this morning with others. He was able to observe the strategy of the RPF and that of the Rwandan Armed Forces, their adversaries. Listen to the explanations he gave earlier to Francoise Walminck: [Begin Witner recording] From a tactical viewpoint, the RPF behaves in a much more consistent, more ordered manner than the Rwandan Armed Forces. One can see that these people have been trained in Uganda. Very often their leaders were trained in England, and that can be seen in the way they work. They are officers, they wear the same uniforms, they are much more disciplined than the Rwandan Armed Forces. From a tactical viewpoint, each ground attack is preceded by artillery preparation which is methodical, systematic, and ordered. [Walminck] What is their strategy? [Witner] Well, we do not have much information on the forces present around Kigali. I imagine that they work mainly in small groups on foot. They infiltrate at night around the positions of the RPF and the noose is tightening more and more around Kigali. However, it is very difficult for the moment to assess the number of troops given the way they work. There is no classical front such as those in normal conflicts, but they infiltrate, they are light infantry. [Walminck] A few days ago, it was believed that the RPF was about to take the town any minute. However, the presidential guard seems to be resisting. [Witner] The presidential guard is getting ready for the siege of Kigali. It goes without saying that the RPF has practically cut off Kigali from any external reinforcements, from any possibility of external reinforcements. [Walminck] Is the presidential guard confining itself to the inside? [Witner] It has barricaded itself in, it has used as much armament as possible on the main accesses to the town. It is waiting. I believe that it will not let the town of Kigali go easily. [Walminck] Do you think they can hold out for long? [Witner] This could last longer than we expect. [end recording] Captain Witner, whom you have just heard, is one of the officers who returned this morning. These officers took part in the repatriation of foreigners. On board the planes which arrived in Brussels earlier today were 43 paratroopers from Flavinne, companions of the 10 who lost their lives in Rwanda. The leitmotiv in their mouths when they arrived was that rules of engagement and the limitation on the use of weapons which they had to heed is absurd and criminal in their eyes.
