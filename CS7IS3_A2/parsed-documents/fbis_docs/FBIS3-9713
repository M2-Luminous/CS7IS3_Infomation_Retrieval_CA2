The document was signed by Gheorghe Dinca, Romanian minister of national defense, and Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of defense, who arrived today in Bucharest. The two ministers believe today's agreement marks a new stage in Romanian-Russian relations. In this respect, General Pavel Grachev told our radio station that this accord also marks the end of the period of stagnation that emerged in relations between the two countries after the dismemberment of the former Soviet Union and the revolution in Romania. The document signed in Bucharest today, the Russian guest said, is a framework agreement that pertains to all aspects of military cooperation, including technical-military cooperation, thus presupposing normal relations between two neighboring countries. Gheorghe Tinca said that this accord creates a normal framework for ties between the two neighboring countries and is not directed against anybody else. This is the 15th document of military cooperation concluded by Romania with neighboring and other European countries. This evening the Russian guest also met with Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu. After the meeting the Romanian minister of foreign affairs told journalists that he considers General Grachev's visit to be a signal for the relaunching of relations between Russia and Romania.
