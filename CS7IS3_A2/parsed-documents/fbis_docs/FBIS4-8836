He was trying to pay a duty of several million leks to the customs office of another district. He possessed the money, but was in a fix. The problem was that this money was on deposit in foreign currency. This created two problems: If he paid through his account, he would have to incur a severe loss because the bank used one exchange rate and the customs duty calculated on the basis of another used on the parallel market. The second problem arose as a result of trying to solve the first. He tried to withdraw the required sum in foreign currency, but was faced with the fact that he could not withdraw more than $5,000 a day. The entire sum that he was required to pay would take weeks. This is only one of the many problems one encounters in the banking system today. One very serious weakness is the failure to use classic banking documents that the world has used for centuries. One of these is the check. Checks are not used for foreign currency withdrawals. They are replaced by a standard white form called a "foreign currency withdrawal request" that records the sum and is signed and stamped by the applicant. There is of course no question of such documents as bank guarantees, internal letters of credit, etc. The existence of bank guarantees or internal letters of credit would greatly accelerate the movement of money. There would no longer be any need for people to carry briefcases full of money, which often leads to the murder of businessmen: Instead, the briefcase could contain a single piece of paper that becomes valid when the seller and purchaser come to an agreement. Moreover, the existence of such documents, in cases where the purchaser receives the goods before paying, gives the seller security and stops him bothering the purchaser. The existence of such documents would greatly ease the work of customs and tax offices. Such a practice would then lead to money that has accumulated in pockets and bags being put on deposit, which would improve control over the money supply and develop credit policy. Let us consider the latter for a moment. There is dissatisfaction on both sides over this. Clients complain that credit is still very tight, and that obtaining a loan involves a great deal of time, bureaucracy, and, why not, in many cases bribes. Meanwhile, the banks for their part also complain of irregularities on the part of borrowers, who fail to observe repayment schedules or do not pay the loan back at all. The banks' complaints extend to the courts, which fail to repossess properties mortgaged by borrowers. Deposits now earn 20 percent interest a year, compared with 32 percept last year. This 12 percent fall is explained by the decline in inflation. However, both ordinary people and businessmen think differently. They think that, in comparison with one year ago, one can buy fewer goods and services with the same amount of money. For ordinary people, this means higher, not lower inflation. Bank specialists have a different opinion. They argue that an interest rate of 32 percent was artificial and was forced on them in order to attract money to the bank. Once this aim was achieved, the problem was how to pay this rate of interest. The main way to do so was by granting credit. However, at a time when there was little domestic investment, this credit was only short-term, and part of it was never returned. Under such circumstances, the simplest response was to lower the level of interest on deposits. However, the main problem with interest rates is that they are artificial and are of an administrative nature. As long as securities genuinely tied to a real estate market do not exist one cannot talk about the cost of money or, as a result, of a real interest rate that responds to supply and demand for the lek. The final point concerns bank secrecy, which is one of the most vital elements for the existence and growth of the banking system. There are suspicions that the state administration interferes in our banking system through the State Control Commission, the Financial Police, the National Intelligence Service, and the Investigator's Office. Perhaps a special law should be drafted for this, clearly laying down the circumstances under which deposits can be inspected. These occasions, like the organs so authorized, should be as few and serious as possible.
