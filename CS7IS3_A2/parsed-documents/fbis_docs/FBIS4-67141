The only issue pending is the approval by the COB plenum meeting of the agreement sometime this morning. This means roadblocks will be lifted. This agreement must still be approved by the COB, the top-ranking Bolivian union central. We hope this decision will be made by noon today. Nevertheless, the final agreement was signed before dawn today. We will be confirming this report carried by the FIDES and JHATA news agencies. The following is a report by Nicolas [not further identified]: [Nicholas] COB-government negotiations continue despite several stumbling blocks in solving the workers' demands and thus end the social conflict. At 1930 yesterday, negotiations were suspended and a possible rupture seemed imminent following criticism by the executive branch against Coca Farmers leader Evo Morales [as heard] who said: [Begin Morales recording] However, [words indistinct] when peasants are blocking roads, and workers are fasting and on the streets protesting against the government [words indistinct] on their day, 1 of May, the president was on vacation. This is all very fine, but he should have been heeding the problems of the working class on 1 May, Labor Day [passage indistinct] [end recording] This term annoyed the executive branch very much. Government Minister German Quiroga stated that if Evo Morales did not withdraw his statement negotiations would be suspended. This prompted a reaction from labor leaders like Mine Workers Union leader Edgar Ramirez who said it was another way by the government to continue delaying negotiations. [Begin Ramirez recording] The government has all along tried to win more time to surely adopt some measures. In the middle of an agenda on mining issues, the government suddenly asked Comrade Evo Morales to withdraw a statement he made yesterday. [end recording] In view of this, the COB plenum summoned for 1500 yesterday was suspended until 0900 today. As time passed, amid some confusion, the COB and Evo Morales sent a letter to the executive branch in which the coca farmers leader excuses himself and explains his statement. [passage omitted] The letter was handed to the executive branch. In view of an almost unofficial excuse, the COB and the government resumed negotiations at 1930 to define some pending issues including the approval by coca farmers of the establishment of a ministerial committee on coca industrialization. [passage omitted] It is expected the COB plenum meeting will solve the social conflict unleashed three weeks ago. [Studio announcer] Here is a report by Jaime Murillo with Peasant Leader Felix Santos. The roadblocks must be lifted gradually. [Murillo] COB leaders and government officials before dawn today signed some important documents. This means that the social problem currently affecting the country is about to be solved. I will now speak by phone with Felix Santos, a high-ranking leader of the National Confederation of Bolivian Peasant Workers [CNTCB]. He will give us a more detailed report. Good morning. [Santos] Good morning to all Radio Fides listeners. We want to explain what is happening to all our comrades and to all those who are blocking roads. Today at 0416 we solved all the issues raised by (each member of) the confederation. In view of this, different CNTCB commissions have been dispatched to Chapare, Potosi, Chuquisaca, and Santa Cruz. They will be arriving at about 1030 today. These commissions have been instructed to inform the local CNTCB boards so that they may decide (whether or not to lift) roadblocks. A solution will be achieved possibly by noon today. This was decided in this last-minute meeting between the COB, the government and the CNTCB. Agreement was reached during this meeting. However, until this decision is approved we will continue the roadblocks. According to reports I have, we will be in permanent contact with the grassroots to explain this agreement. The grassroots will be contacted to explain this agreement and the conflict will be solved. [passage omitted] [Murillo] You have said the CNTCB executive board met after signing an agreement with the government. Does this mean the peasants support the agreement and the roadblocks will be lifted as of noon today? [Santos] This will be done after we have contacted our grassroots. We have signed an agreement among coca producers and another understanding on the Potosi issue. [passage omitted] Once the grassroots have discussed these agreements, they will inform their decision to COB by noon. Meanwhile, the roadblocks continue. [Murillo] Have you discussed the deaths of some peasants with the government? [Santos] Yes, a high-level commission has been established to investigate these killing and its members will be going to the sites later today. The commission comprises representatives from the Chamber of Deputies constitutional committee, legislators, human rights organizations, [words indistinct], the COB, the government minister and the CNTCB. This commission will go to Potosi to investigate. [passage omitted]
