Speaking at a press conference after the first round of talks between seven Central European presidents here, Weizsacker said that the past was still markedly affecting the two countries' relations and that it was "important to free them of past errors which are still affecting them." This should be done through dialogue "not only between governments, but also between representatives of the groups which themselves experienced these bad times," Weizsacker said. He stressed that not property questions, but "a moral and historical evaluation of the past," a " typical task" for the two countries' presidents, was of priority importance. Weizsacker was probably hinting at the issue of the 2.5 Sudeten Germans who were expelled from Czechoslovakia after World War Two and whose property was expropriated, and at the German occupation of the Czech Lands during the war.
