(1) If AHP fails to divest absolutely and in good faith AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine Assets and to consummate a Divestiture Agreement with an Acquirer within four (4) months from the date this Order becomes final, then any executed Divestiture Agreement with the Acquirer shall be terminated and the Commission may direct the trustee appointed pursuant to Paragraph II of this Order (a) to divest AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine Assets and (b) to enter into a Divestiture Agreement that satisfies the requirements of Paragraph II of this Order with a New Acquirer. The trustee shall have the same authority and responsibilities pursuant to Paragraph III of this Order with respect to the New Acquirer. (2) If the Commission terminates the Divestiture Agreement pursuant to Paragraph II.C.10, the Commission may direct the trustee appointed under Paragraph III of this Order (a) to divest AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine Assets to a New Acquirer and (b) to enter into a new Divestiture Agreement with such New Acquirer. In any case under this subparagraph IV.A(2), the trustee shall have the same authority and responsibilities with respect to the New Acquirer as those described in Paragraph III of this Order. Neither the decision of the Commission to direct the trustee nor the decision of the Commission not to direct the trustee to divest AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine Assets under subparagraph IV.A(1) of this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to section 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by the respondent to comply with this order. B.

The Commission shall extend the authority and responsibilities of the trustee appointed under Paragraph III of this Order to include divesting AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine Assets and directing AHP to enter into a Divestiture Agreement with the New Acquirer, subject to the consent of Respondent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If respondent has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the extension of the authority and responsibilities of the trustee selected under Paragraph III of this Order within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to Respondent that the trustee's authority and responsibilities are to be extended pursuant to this paragraph, respondent shall be deemed to have consented to the extension of the trustee's authority and responsibilities. 2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine Assets to a New Acquirer pursuant to the terms of Paragraph II of this Order and to enter into a Divestiture Agreement with the New Acquirer pursuant to the terms of Paragraph II of this Order, which Divestiture Agreement shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission. The trustee will have the authorities and responsibilities as described in Paragraph III with respect to the New Acquirer. 3. Within ten (10) days after extension of the trustee's authority and responsibilities, respondent shall amend the existing trust agreement, that, subject to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to divest AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine Assets to a New Acquirer and to enter into a Divestiture Agreement with the New Acquirer. 4. The trustee shall have six (6) months from the date the Commission extends his or her authority and responsibilities under Paragraph IV A.(1) of this Order to divest AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccines Assets and to enter into a Divestiture Agreement with the New Acquirer that satisfies the requirements of Paragraph II of this Order. 5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities of AHP related to the manufacture, distribution, or sale of Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccines or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may request. Respondent shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of his or her responsibilities. 6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract that is submitted to the Commission, subject to respondent's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum price; to assure that AHP enters into a Divestiture Agreement that complies with the provisions of paragraph II.A; to assure that AHP complies with the remaining provisions of paragraph II of this Order; and to assure that the New Acquirer obtains all necessary FDA approvals to manufacture Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccines for sale in the United States. The divestiture and the Divestiture Agreement shall be made to the New Acquirer in the manner set forth in Paragraph II of this Order; provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity selected by respondent from among those approved by the Commission.
