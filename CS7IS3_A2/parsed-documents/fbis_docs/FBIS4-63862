His statement came during talks in Moscow on Tuesday [24 May] with visiting British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd who raised the issue. Other issues discussed include European security and Russia's cooperation with the West including the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace program. Yeltsin said that both Russia and NATO wanted to cooperate with each other, but that this cooperation must account for Russia's uniqueness as a great power. He is hopeful for a breakthrough in Moscow's talks with the European Union and Russia's entry into the world trade organization, GATT. Bilateral relations were also discussed by the two men. The Secretary handed Yeltsin a message from Queen Elizabeth II saying she accepted an earlier invitation to visit Russia in autumn, it is to be the first such visit to Russia by a British monarch. On Tuesday morning, Viktor Chernomyrdin and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd discussed relations between Russia and Ukraine in light of the situation in Crimea. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who took part in the talks, told reporters that Chernomyrdin had expressed the conviction that there were no insoluble problems in Russian-Ukrainian relations. He also said that the two states could reach agreement on the basis of the accord on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, signed by Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk last March. Chernomyrdin also confirmed that Crimea was part of Ukraine and that Russia respected Ukraine's territorial integrity. To quote Churkin, Chernomyrdin assured Hurd that no force would be used in tackling political problems. "Confrontation with Ukraine is unthinkable," said Chernomyrdin. "All problems that have arisen or will arise will be tackled in the spirit of cooperation," he added. Russia insists only on political settlement between Kiev and Simferopol, Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin stated at a briefing in Moscow Tuesday. He confirmed that the position of Russia towards the sovereign Republic of Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine remained the same and was well known to the Ukrainian leadership. He stressed that it was necessary to observe territorial integrity and inviolability of the existing borders. Karasin said it was also very important to respect the sovereign will of nations. He emphasized that the parties must refrain from the use of force. He said Russia was concerned over tension in bilateral relations which might emerge due to Crimea. He emphasized that the discord between Kiev and Simferopol was a domestic Ukrainian affair. "However, certain Ukrainian politicians are trying to lay all responsibility at the door of `some external forces' meaning Russia," Karasin pointed out. The situation in Crimea once again proves that the key-issues of Russian-Ukrainian relations must be solved urgently, he said. Karasin added that the current Russian-Ukrainian talks in Moscow were focusing on these issues rather than on Crimea.
