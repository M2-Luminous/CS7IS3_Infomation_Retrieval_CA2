At the end of last year, the province had a total of 754 towns under the county level and 2,498 rural market towns. In 1993, the province spent more than 2.19 billion yuan on the construction of public facilities, industrial buildings and civil residences in towns. Linking cities and the countryside, towns have become a reservoir of surplus labor forces in the countryside. Four towns in Tongling county absorbed more than 16,300 surplus laborers from the countryside, and 22 towns of Huaibei city received nearly 110,000 farmers. Towns have also become a spring-board for farmers to break away from agriculture and engage in other occupations. In a town of Huaibei city more than 13,200 farmers found jobs. Township enterprises also take advantage of the location of towns to edge into urban markets. In Feidong county, markets in 10 minor cities and towns registered a business volume of 330 million yuan. In Caohu city, township enterprises in 11 towns reported an output value of 1.09 billion yuan last year, a great increase in comparison with a few years ago. Because of the accelerated urbanization of the countryside in the province, which used to be widely known as a poor agricultural area, the economic gap between its urban and rural areas is narrowing.
