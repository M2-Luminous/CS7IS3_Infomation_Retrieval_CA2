Gen. Alli made the appeal in Somalia when he visited the United Nations deputy secretary general, Mr. Lansana Kouyate, as part of his tour of areas where Nigerian troops are serving in peacekeeping operations. He said it was an irony that the Nigerian Army, which over the years had made immense contributions towards the maintenance of world peace, had become a victim of international sanctions. The chief of Army staff said the lifting of the sanctions was necessary to enhance the contributions of the Armed Forces to the United Nations peacekeeping operation. He again assured the international community that the present administration had commenced the process of democratization to return the country to complete civil rule.
