FR940811-1-00009 FR940811-1-00006 40 CFR Part 52 [Region II Docket No. 126, PR3&hyph;1&hyph;6331, FRL&hyph;5030&hyph;4] Approval and Promulgation of PM 10 Implementation Plan for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes full approval of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for the purpose of attaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ). The SIP addresses sources impacting the Municipality of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico which has been designated nonattainment. DATES: Comments must be received on or before the later of the following two dates: either September 12, 1994 or 14 days after the date of an EPA public meeting to discuss the proposal. The date, times and place of this public meeting will be announced in Puerto Rico shortly. ADDRESSES: All comments should be addressed to: Jeanne M. Fox, Regional Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY, 10278; or Carl Soderberg, Director, Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, Caribbean Field Office, Centro Europa Building, Suite 417, 1492 Ponce De Leon Avenue, Stop 22, Santurce, Puerto Rico, 00909. Copies of the state submittal are available at the following addresses for inspection during normal business hours: Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, Library, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 402, New York, NY, 10278. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, Caribbean Field Office, Centro Europa Building, Suite 417, 1492 Ponce De Leon Avenue, Stop 22, Santurce, Puerto Rico, 00909.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act), requires all areas that have measured a violation of the NAAQS be designated nonattainment. The Municipality of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico was designated nonattainment for PM 10 and classified as moderate based on violations measured in 1987 in the Municipality. The Act requires state or territorial governments to revise the SIP for all areas that are designated as nonattainment to ensure that the NAAQS will be attained. Under the context of the Act, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is regarded as a state. The reader should refer to the ``General Preamble'' [see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)] for a more detailed discussion of the designation of PM 10 nonattainment areas. II. Clean Air Act Requirements for PM 10 SIP's The air quality planning requirements for areas designated nonattainment for PM 10 are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of Title I of the Act. EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those state submittals addressing moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas according to the ``General Preamble.'' Because EPA is describing the PM 10 requirements here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the ``General Preamble'' for a more detailed discussion of the PM 10 requirements, and guidance on meeting those requirements. States containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the following elements by November 15, 1991: A. Regulations to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) [including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)] shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; B. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; C. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and D. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the nonattainment area (sections 172(c), 188, and 189.) There are requirements for a New Source Review (NSR) permit program and contingency measures that are due at a later date: E. States with a moderate PM 10 nonattainment area were required to submit a NSR permit program SIP revision for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM 10 by June 30, 1992 [section 189 (a)(2)]. The specific NSR requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are: 1. Definition of the term ``major stationary source'' that reflects thresholds of 100 tons per year (tpy) for PM 10 and, presumptively, 100 tpy for each PM 10 precursor for determination of whether a source is subject to Part D requirements as a major source; 2. Provisions to ensure that new or modified major stationary sources obtain emission offsets at an offset ratio of at least one to one; 3. Requirements applicable to major sources of PM 10 are also applicable to major sources of PM 10 precursors, except where EPA determines that the sources of PM 10 precursors do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels which exceed the PM 10 NAAQS in the area. The EPA generally considers sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO X ), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) to be PM 10 precursors for NSR purposes; and 4. Provisions to ensure that the significance threshold for a modification to be major, and therefore subject to the section 173 permit requirements, is 15 tpy for PM 10 and, presumptively, 15 tpy for each PM 10 precursor. F. States must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective without further action by the state or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM 10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. This requirement is described in section 172(c)(9) of the Act and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544. General requirements for implementation plans are contained in section 110 of the Act and sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 1 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a state under the Act must be adopted by such state after reasonable notice and public hearing. EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action [see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565]. EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at Title 40 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 51, Appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). 1 Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2).
