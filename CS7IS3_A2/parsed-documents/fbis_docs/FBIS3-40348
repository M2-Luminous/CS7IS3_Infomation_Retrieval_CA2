Fibre optics is a well-established technology on the ground, but ESA is now developing space optical communications using lasers. The first ever demonstration of such a link will take place in 1997. The deployment of a one-metre telescope on Tenerife, Canary Islands, to receive laser signals from satellites is part of this effort. The telescope, financed by the German Space Agency DARA, was built by Carl Zeiss Jena and was presented for the first time to the public on 23 November 1993. Following comprehensive testing in Germany, the Zeiss telescope will be installed on Tenerife in the second half of 1995, awaiting the launch of ESA's telecommunications satellite ARTEMIS [Advanced Relay and Technology Mission] at the end of 1996 and the comprehensive tests with its SILEX [Semi-Conductor Laser Intersatellite Link Experiment] laser-optical payload. ARTEMIS is an advanced satellite for testing and operating new telecommunications techniques and will also help to introduce several other new services. The SILEX optical terminal carried by ARTEMIS will enable it to exchange data with other satellites or with ground stations, by sending or receiving a laser beam. The Tenerife site chosen for the deployment of the telescope is at 2,500 metres altitude. Observations are almost entirely undisturbed by stray light and the site is particularly well suited to simulating and testing laser optical communications with a satellite in geostationary orbit. The first satellite to make use of ARTEMIS laser communications capabilities will be the French SPOT-4 Earth observation satellite to be launched in early 1997. From its low-Earth orbit some 700 km above the ground, SPOT-4 cannot send its image data to any one ground station for more than ten minutes. Data sent to ground stations overseas often have to be transported over long distances for processing and distribution to users. Thanks to SILEX, an uninterrupted link between SPOT-4 and its operations centre in Toulouse, France, will be possible whenever the satellite is in sight of ARTEMIS on its geostationary orbit 36,000 km above Europe; in practice, SPOT-4 will therefore be able to observe more than half of the Earth's land masses via an ARTEMIS data-relay link. The data rate of SILEX is 50 Mbit per second. SILEX is being developed in close cooperation between ESA and CNES [French National Center for Space Studies]. The manufacture of the optical terminals to be installed on the spacecraft has been entrusted to a consortium of European companies led by Matra-Marconi-Space.
