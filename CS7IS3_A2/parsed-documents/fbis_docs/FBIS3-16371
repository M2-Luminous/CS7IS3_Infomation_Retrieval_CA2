Today, the state company for the export and import of arms, Rosvooruzheniye [Russian Arms], held a presentation for journalists. The former USSR never traded in arms, but simply delivered them according to agreements. So there has only been trade proper since 1991. But in this sphere, liberalization has led to a situation where dozens of Russian firms are tendering for contracts to supply India with artillery shells, all selling the product of the same factory. And the one who got the contract was the one who knocked down his price one and one-half times. By setting up Rosvooruzheniye, the government has created a state monopoly on arms trading. But this does not mean that enterprises are deprived of the opportunity to be involved in foreign trade -- simply that this is now done under the guidance of, or, to be more precise, while observing Rosvooruzheniye's price controls. One of the company's main activities will be investment of profits from promising research work -- at present 3-5 percent of the value of a contract. It will also receive additional income, where the latter has been successful. The arms trade is a subtle business.
