Kotenev, chairman of the Russian Afghanistan Veterans Council Board: "Calling Afghan War Veterans"] [Text] This document, bearing an Afghanistan Veterans' Union [AVU] letterhead and marked "For Official Use Only," was distributed to the heads of the organization's regional branches. There is barely any need for comment. It is easy to see what is going on: They are trying to involve Aghanistan war veterans in dangerous games on the side of political forces yearning for power at any price. [Letter begins] In connection with the rapidly changing sociopolitical situation as a result of the process of the redistribution of material wealth among the major financial and industrial groups, which have already found it necessary to express their own interests in the political sphere and have joined in the active power struggle in the country, the AVU Board is proposing that all regional branches carry out the following measures: 1. At the end of each month, beginning this April, republic, kray, and oblast leaders will report in writing to the AVU Board on the sociopolitical situation in their particular region, the presence of political and public organizations, and their orientation, plans, influence on the masses, and contacts with our movement. 2. In the first report, which we expect by 30 April, we ask you to indicate: -- the precise addresses and telephone numbers of AVU branches, beginning with rayon and settlement components, and also the full names of leaders; -- if any administration leaders in your region are Afghanistan war veterans, whether you have contacts with them (if there are no contacts and mutual understanding, find out the reasons and try to get these people on your side); -- whether there are members of the "Russia's Choice" movement in the region, what posts they occupy, and whether you are seeking a mutual understanding with them; -- the general mood of the population, its political orientation, and the attitude toward local and central authority and our movement; -- whether you have contacts with the local media and at what level. If such contacts do not exist, they should be established immediately and a campaign must begin to propagandize the AVU and its ideas. What newspapers are published in your area, their orientation, addresses, and telephone nunmbers and the full names of the chief editors; -- what work is being done in your area on local self-government elections, if any AVU member has been elected deputy, and whether or not he has severed links with the organization; -- report on the presence of youth and military-patriotic clubs and other associations in your region and what influence you have on them. Resume work immediately in that sphere if you have neglected to do so; -- tell us your proposals on the possibility of a united effort at the future presidential elections. We ask you to treat this letter as seriously and responsibly as possible. Remember that you have saved the homeland from civil war chaos on two occasions already. You have supported the course of reforms and the institution of president, as guarantor of stability, and the form of political organization in Russia and who will head it will soon depend on us. We can also report that we are currently making joint preparations with "Russia's Choice" for a founding congress of a new political party. [signed] A.A. Kotenev, chairman of the Russian Afghanistan Veterans Council Board.
