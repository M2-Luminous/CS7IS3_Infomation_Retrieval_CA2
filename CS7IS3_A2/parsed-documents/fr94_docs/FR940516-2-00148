FR940516-2-00148 FR940516-2-00095 The Board of directors of any nonprofit off-reservation Indian organization may apply for a grant under this announcement. A new application for projects of two years duration may be submitted in response to this announcement. An applicant may not submit more than one application nor be a beneficiary of more than one grant under this or other prior notices. C. Purpose of Off-Reservation Grants The purpose of every Indian child and family services program shall be to prevent the breakup of Indian families, and ensure that the permanent removal of an Indian child from the custody of his/her Indian parent or custodian shall be a last resort. Off-reservation Child and family service programs may include, but are not limited to: (a) A system for regulating, maintaining, and supporting Indian foster and adoptive homes, including a subsidy program under which Indian adoptive children may be provided support comparable to that for which they would be eligible as Indian foster children, taking into account the appropriate state standards of support maintenance and medical needs; (b) The operation and maintenance of facilities and services for the counseling and treatment of Indian families and Indian foster and adoptive children with the goal of strengthening and stabilizing Indian families; (c) Family assistance (including homemaker services and home counselors), protective day care and after school care, employment support services, recreational activities, and respite care with the goal of strengthening Indian families and contributing toward family stability; and (d) Guidance, legal representation and advice to Indian families involved in state child custody proceedings. Part II A. Available Funds In FY 1994, off-reservation Indian organizations will compete for a national allocation of $1,735,000. Grants will be awarded competitively to approved off-reservation Indian organizations on the basis of service area population within the following categories: (a) A maximum of up to $27,500 for eligible applicants with a total service area population of 500 or less; (b) A maximum of up to $35,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 500 but less than 1,500; (c) A maximum of up to $45,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 1,500 but less than 3,000; (d) A maximum of up to $55,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 3,000 but less than 5,000; (e) A maximum of up to $65,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 5,000 but less than 8,000; (f) A maximum of up to $80,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 8,000 but less than 20,000; (g) A maximum of up to $110,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 20,000 but less than 40,000; (h) A maximum of up to $140,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 40,000 but less than 60,000; (i) A maximum of up to $175,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 60,000 but less than 90,000; (j) A maximum of up to $250,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 90,000 but less than 140,000; (k) A maximum of up to $350,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 140,000 but less than 180,000; and (l) A maximum of up to $500,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population over 180,000. Under no circumstances may any off-reservation Indian organization receive Indian Child Welfare Act grant funds greater than the maximum grant amount of $500,000 either through a direct grant or through subgranting procedures with approved applicants. No ICWA grant funds will be withheld at the Central Office for appeals related to off-reservation funding levels; therefore, approved applications will be funded strictly on the basis of funds available to each area office and in accordance with the funding amounts published in this grant notice. The respective Area Director has final funding authority. B. Service Eligibility The service area population is the total number of Indians eligible for services under 25 CFR 23.50(b) in the geographical area to which an off-reservation Indian organization can realistically provide the services proposed in the application. The service area population is used only to determine the maximum grant amount for which an applicant may be eligible. For purposes of eligibility for services provided under 25 U.S.C. 1932 and 1933 of the Act, any person meeting the definition of Indian, Indian child, Indian custodian, or Indian parent of any unmarried person under the age of 18 as defined in 25 CFR Section 23.2, or the definition of Indian as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1603(c), shall be eligible for ICWA services. These service area population figures must be based upon substantiated, identifiable statistical sources. Applicants must submit copies of recent statistical data from sources which support their service area figures, such as off-reservation population information, U.S. Census data, or off-reservation service area population data maintained by the Indian Health Service for urban Indian populations.
