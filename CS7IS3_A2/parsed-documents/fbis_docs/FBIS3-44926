He made the remarks to the press after he met with Deng Nan, vice chairman of the Chinese State Science and Technology Commission at his office here today. "As both of us, China and Malaysia, are developing countries, we have many areas in which we could learn from each other," Law said. He said cooperation can cover many fields as "China is a big country and has a lot of scientists" and Malaysia is trying to "draw a balance between agriculture and industry" during the transition from the past agriculture-based economy. He said he and Deng had "useful and interesting discussions" which will be followed by the first joint committee meeting on science and technology on Monday. "We have worked out a long agenda", said Law, outlining cooperation areas proposed by both sides. By the Malaysian side, he said, they include computer integrated manufacturing system, advanced materials, micro-electronics, computers and information technology, nuclear energy, remote sensing and meteorology. While by the Chinese side, they cover meteorology, standards and quality control systems, medicine, medical equipment and pharmaceutical development, conservation, management and exploitation of marine resources, remote sensing and geological information. The meeting is the follow-up of the Memorandum of Understanding on Science and Technology Cooperation the two governments signed in 1992. Law said Deng expressed China's willingness to take part in the international floating science exhibition, a Malaysian proposal to be further discussed at the ASEAN science and technology ministers' meeting in Manila next month. The six-member delegation led by Deng arrived here last night on a week-long visit during which they will tour Malacca, Penang and Sarawak, and some research institutions such as the Standards and Industrial Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM).
