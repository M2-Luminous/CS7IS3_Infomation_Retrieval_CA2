[Georgiy Kunadze] The two heads will exchange views on a wide range of matters including the international situation and methods for cooperation. Also, in most of the issues they discuss, they will be able to confirm that they have similar or the same points of view. I hope that this will be an opportunity in which the relationship between the two countries will be enhanced to a level of "a mature partner relationship." [Pak] Among the many pending issues between the two countries, what attracts our interest the most is the issue of the $3 billion economic cooperation loan we provided to Russia when No Tae-u and Gorbachev were presidents. What is Russia's position at a time when Russia has not repaid the principal sum or the interest? [Kunadze] I would like to make one thing clear. Our side's debt is half of the $3 billion. The other half was frozen by the ROK Government last year (in August 1993, Hong Sun-yong, the then vice foreign minister, announced that the execution of the loan of $1.53 billion would be stooped except for the already executed loan of $1.47 billion). We were dissatisfied with such a measure because it was a one-sided one, conducted without even receiving our consent, but Russia recognizes the duty of repaying the debt made during the old Soviet period. However, we are of the position that the repayment method must not run counter to the conditions that were promised at the Paris Club (a meeting held by Russia's creditor countries). I expect that this issue will be resolved in the near future. [Pak] Russia is succeeding the "treaty on mutual assistance" with North Korea concluded during the old Soviet period. In this treaty, there is an article which stipulates that if there is a dispute on the Korean peninsula, Russia will automatically interfere. This is bringing about concern. [Kunadze] Many people in Russia as well as the ROK talk about this article, but in reality I think there are many people who do not have a correct understanding of the original text. There is no phrase in the original text that refers to Russia's "automatic interference." Our interference is limited in the case of a non-provocative incident. Even if an incident occurs, Russia will make an independent decision regarding the situation and not insist on taking action according to the treaty. The position of the democratic Russian Government is that implementation of any treaty must be approved by the parliament and that the international law and the UN Charter must be put before the mutual treaty. [Pak] When you were the vice foreign minister early last year, you visited North Korea and presented the issue of revising this treaty. Will this issue be dealt with at the upcoming ROK-Russia summit talks? [Kunadze] Russia will not raise this issue first. This is an issue between Russia and North Korea. The ROK is only a third party. If the ROK side raises this issue, we will explain our position. [Pak] Recently, some North Korea loggers who escaped from logging camps in Siberia defected to the ROK. What is the actual situation of the North Korean loggers in Russia and how does Russia plan to deal with them? [Kunadze] There is not even a single case in which a North Korean logger is under the control of the Russian Government. Therefore, we do not know how many of them want to defect to the ROK. The issue of the status of the North Korean loggers is an issue from the human rights level. The Russian Constitution guarantees foreigners from coming and going freely. Therefore, if the North Korean loggers want to go the ROK, this is completely their personal problem. We have nothing to do with this problem. [Pak] Recently, the Russian Government expressed great dissatisfaction over the ROK media's report on the issue of the North Korean loggers. [Kunadze] We have never expressed dissatisfaction. We are only dissatisfied with the ROK media which is reporting as if Russia was interfering on how to deal with the North Korean loggers. Without even sufficiently explaining our position, the ROK media reported that the Russian Government is not allowing the North Korean loggers from leaving the country and that they are sending the loggers back to North Korea. I have never heard that a North Korean logger was sent to North Korea by force. [Pak] When Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visited Moscow last year, Russia promised to forward to the ROK documents on the 25 June war. Will this promise be kept? [Kunadze] There is no difficulty in delivering the material. Since the amount of material is enormous and research over this matter is difficult, I believe it would be good if a special committee was formed between the two countries to work on this jointly. [Pak] What is the level of North Korea's nuclear development to the knowledge of Russia? [Kunadze] According to the information Russia has, there is no possibility that North Korea produced nuclear weapons. However, we believe that North Korea must unconditionally implement the duties of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Our position has been since last March that we are not providing any atomic energy technology to North Korea as long as North Korea does not implement the treaty. [Pak] What is background for having proposed an eight-party meeting of the South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, China, Russia, the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue? [Kunadze] This proposal is beneficial to all. A new form is being added to the existing framework of the talks. It will be an opportunity for the South and North to have contacts with each other at a time when the South-North dialogue has broken.
