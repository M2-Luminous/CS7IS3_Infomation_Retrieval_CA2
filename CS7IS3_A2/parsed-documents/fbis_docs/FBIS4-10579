FBIS4-10579 "drlat072_r_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 Peru New Electoral System for Elections Disclosed New Electoral System for Elections Disclosed PY1304233694 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 4 Apr 94 p A4 PY1304233694 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Text] In addition to the political reasons of the government majority in Congress for holding the 1995 general elections with the electoral system established in the current Constitution, there are concrete proposals of a technical nature to prevent the new electoral institutions from falling into the bureaucracy and slow procedures of the previous system. For example, the National Election Board [JNE] will be reduced from the current six administrative levels to only three: National Board (five members); General Secretariat, Internal Control, and Auditing (at the same level); and third and last, Special Electoral Boards, Archives and Registry, Public Relations, and General Services. In other words, it will have seven sections that, according to government bloc experts, will not need more than 30 employees. It would be a National Election Board specialized in electoral justice. It would only be a court. The technical report says the JNE currently has more than 1,200 employees--without counting those on contract--and almost half of them are here in Lima. Regarding the National Electoral Process Office, ONPE, the proposal for organizing this office has three levels: National Headquarters; Planning and Organization, and Control and Auditing; Decentralized Process Office, Information, General Services, and Electoral Procedures, which would be in charge of the systems, operations, and logistical offices. The government experts said the ONPE should be a very small institution that should not have more than 30 employees, but temporary organizations with more employees can be established during elections. This office is the most complex of all to the point that the Constitution itself says that the integration of all registries of the country in a single office--which currently are in the hands of the municipalities--will be made gradually.
