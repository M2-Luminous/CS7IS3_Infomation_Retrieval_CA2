FR940603-1-00025 FR940603-1-00007 If a vessel owner applies to NMFS for a groundfish vessel permit, and NMFS determines that the vessel is an ineligible vessel, the vessel owner would be notified in writing by NMFS that a vessel permit would not be issued. The applicant could appeal the initial decision within 45 days of issuance of the written notification according to the appeal procedures described below. Although each GOA and BSAI groundfish vessel would have to apply for and obtain a vessel permit from NMFS, only catcher vessels and catcher/processor vessels would be required to be eligible vessels. Crab A vessel owner that intends to fish for king and Tanner crab in the Federal waters of the BSAI from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1997, would have to submit to the Regional Director a written application for a Federal crab vessel permit in addition to any permit required by the State. The application and issuance procedure, and the appeals procedure for crab vessel permits would be the same as for groundfish. Although all vessels operating in crab fisheries in the BSAI would have to apply for and obtain a vessel permit from NMFS, only catcher vessels and catcher/processor vessels would be required to be eligible vessels. Halibut A vessel owner that intends to harvest halibut from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1997, in the waters in and off Alaska would have to apply for a vessel license from the IPHC. Upon receipt of a written vessel license application, the IPHC would compare the information submitted by the applicant with the NMFS database of eligible vessels. An unrestricted vessel license would be issued if: a. The vessel owner were to submit a completed vessel license application to the IPHC; b. the vessel made a qualifying landing during the qualifying period; and c. the LOA of the vessel did not exceed the maximum LOA. Each unrestricted vessel license issued by the IPHC would list the maximum LOA applicable for the vessel and for any vessel to which the moratorium qualification is transferred. If a vessel owner applies to the IPHC for a halibut vessel license but the information on the application does not correspond to the information in the NMFS database, the IPHC would issue a restricted vessel license, applicable only for IPHC management areas 2A or 2B which are in and off British Columbia, Canada, and the States of California, Oregon, and Washington. At this point, the vessel owner would have the option of submitting additional written information regarding eligibility to NMFS within 45 days of issuance of the restricted vessel license. NMFS would review the additional information and issue a written decision as to whether an unrestricted halibut license would be issued. If NMFS initially determines that the vessel is eligible, NMFS would amend the database and inform the IPHC that the vessel is eligible and an unrestricted vessel license could be issued to the vessel owner. If NMFS initially determines that a restricted halibut license would be issued, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Regional Director within 45 days of issuance of the written notification from NMFS according to the appeal procedures described below. Although vessels operating in the halibut fisheries in the waters in and off of Alaska would have to apply for and obtain a vessel license from the IPHC, only catcher vessels and catcher/processor vessels would be required to be eligible vessels. Vessels Used in the IFQ Sablefish and Halibut Fixed Gear Fisheries A vessel operating under the provisions of the halibut and sablefish fixed gear IFQ program would be exempted from the vessel moratorium as it affects directed halibut and sablefish operations. To implement this exemption, an owner of a vessel used in the IFQ sablefish and halibut fixed gear fisheries from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1997, would have to submit to the Regional Director a written application for a groundfish and crab vessel permit. A vessel permit would be issued if the vessel owner submits a completed application to NMFS as required by §§671.4, 672.4, or §675.4. The type of permit issued would be based on the eligibility of the vessel under the moratorium. An eligible vessel used in the IFQ sablefish and halibut fixed gear fisheries would be issued an unrestricted groundfish and crab vessel permit. A vessel that is issued an unrestricted groundfish and crab vessel permit may retain amounts of other moratorium species subject to applicable directed fishing standards.
