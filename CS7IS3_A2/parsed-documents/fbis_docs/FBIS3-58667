Khasapopoulos: "Turkish Trap on NATO Commands"] [Excerpts] A maneuver by Ankara is creating a crisis in our relations with NATO, creating at this time unpredictable political and military repercussions. The issue of establishing the commands has caused tension in Greek relations with NATO, following a well-planned Turkish trap, which everyone involved (that is, the new armed forces leadership, but also the minister of national defense) is now attempting to defuse through various initiatives. The situation that was created is quite difficult for the Greek Government, since the initiative at this time belongs exclusively to Turkey, which, in a spectacular and sudden policy change, has refused to accept the establishment of commands in Greece, to which it had initially agreed. Greece has already committed its first mistake: during the last meeting of the Alliance's defense ministers, it did not bring up the issue of the commands' establishment, acting on the advice of NATO Secretary General Woerner. Why Greece listened to Mr Woerner's request and failed to bring up the issue of the commands at the defense ministers' meeting, when our minister left Athens for Brussels with the intention of tabling this vital issue on a priority basis has not yet been explained. What is certain is that, with the Turkish veto on the establishment of the Greek commands and the Greek veto on the establishment of all commands (including those in Italy), new tension has emerged in Greece-NATO relations. [passage omitted] Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis is now preparing to give battle to keep the commands in Greece and to avoid the Turkish traps set almost daily at alliance headquarters. Such a trap already exists, with Italy as the main actor. The Italians never understood why they suddenly lost the commands because of Greco-Turkish differences, given that the outcome of the Greek veto was the operational blockage of all five commands located in various areas of Italy. With the encouragement of the Turks and of higher NATO officials, the Italians are already pressuring the Greek Government to lift the veto on Italy and maintain it only against Turkey. At first glance, such a move by the Greek Government seems natural, since there are no military differences between Italy and Greece. However, is this really so? Athens knows very well (as affirmed by political sources) that by lifting the veto on the establishment of all the commands of NATO's southern flank, it loses its most important bargaining chip, as well as the only issue that would enable it to exert pressure to achieve the conditions it hopes for to reinforce its defenses.
