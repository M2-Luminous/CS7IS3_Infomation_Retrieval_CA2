He made the comment as the Government has been reminding legislators that time is running out for the court of final appeal to be set up before the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. But the Chinese official said the Govermnent should just set up the court in accordance with the 1991 Sino-British secret deal on the composition of the court. It stipulates that only one overseas judge out of five may sit in the court of final appeal after 1997, a point which has been a bone of contention between the two countries. The Legislative Council has passed a motion which stated that a bill for the court would be rejected. "Everybody knows that the Legislative Council is just a consultative body to the Governor, who has the right to withhold his consent to Legco decisions," the official said. "It is like the Joint Declaration. Can the Government put the Joint Declaration to the Legco? "Is it the case that only after receiving the approval from the Legco can the Government implement the Joint Declaration?" The comment was echoed by Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the New China News Agency (Xinhua) yesterday. Speaking at a function, Zhang said that by seeking Legco's approval on the issue, the Government was "binding its own hands and feet" and "asking for trouble". "Britain and China have already reached agreement on the court of final appeal. Britain should just act in strict accordance with the agreement," Zhang said. "The Legco is being placed by the Government at an inappropriately high level." Richard Hoare, the director of administration, called the Chinese comments a "misunderstanding". "You can't set up a court without legislation. You can't pass legislation without putting it to the Legco," said Hoare. He said the Joint Declaration certainly did not need to be put to the Legislative Council. "But there are a lot of things that come out of the Joint Declaration that have to be put to Legco for implemention where the change of law is required," he said. He said China ought to feel pleased because the Government was not proposing to go back on the agreement. "We have drafted the bill on the basis of the composition we agreed with the Chinese side," he said. "But we still need to pass the legislation. It is not something that you can just set up. "You've got to set out the composition of the court, the power of the court, the supporting of the court bill, like registrar. There are all sorts of things like these which need to be clearly specified in the legislation." It is understood that the Government has started lobbying legislators to pass the bill once it is approved by the Executive Council next month. China will also be consulted on the draft bill before it is put to Legco. An appointed legislator, Christine Loh, said it would be technically incorrect if the court of final appeal was set up without Legco approval. "What we are talking about is having legislation to set up the court which is something Hong Kong does not have the moment," she said. "In our system we need to sever the links with the Privy Council and to set up the court. So we need legislation. "Perhaps Chinese officials don't understand how our system works," she added. "There is nothing the Government can do without law giving it power."
