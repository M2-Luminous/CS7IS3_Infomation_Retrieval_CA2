Decisions influencing the situation in Bosnia must be taken not by NATO, but by the UN Security Council. Russia must not stand on the sidelines while such actions are being worked out and approved. This was stressed by President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin in his conversations with Western leaders, and this stance is backed by the Russian public and by our parliamentarians. [Lukin] We believe that in this matter the policy of the international community, of all countries including Russia, should be coordinated and based on true partnership. That does not mean some can take decisions and inform the others; it means decisions must be adopted jointly, however difficult that may be. That is mature partnership, based on equal rights. [Kalyagin] Do you fully support the policy of our government in the Bosnian issue, or do you believe that there have been some omissions? [Kalyagin] I believe that now the stance of the foreign ministry as it is being expressed is very close to what is contained in the statement. This position proceeds from the fact that our main task is to prevent bombing, to prevent air strikes, and naturally, to create conditions to stop the bombing of Sarajevo. That is the right aim. It is also right that our Foreign Ministry is demanding a special decision by the UN Security Council on the question of whether to implement the ultimatum, to implement the threat. However, the problem is that one mistake brings others in its wake. I am firmly convinced that the earlier vote approving limited air strikes was a mistake... [Kalyagin, interrupting] To protect UN convoys. [Lukin] Unfortunately it was to protect UN convoys and civilians, which in itself is excellent and noble. But that can be used any way one wants. The Duma may express its point of view. Its statement will be very firm. The essence -- I know this, knowing the mood of the Duma -- is that if the United States and NATO adopt unilateral decisions in spite of our recommendations, in spite of the very insistent opinion of a partner, then the partner can adopt unilateral actions and statements as well. This is another question: it is a matter for executive authority, a matter for separate consultations, but I would not want that. I am in favor of partnership, I am in favor of joint decisions.
