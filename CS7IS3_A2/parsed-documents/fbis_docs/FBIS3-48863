FBIS3-48863 "dreas020__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-020-A Document Type:Daily Report 31 January 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Presents New Demands at Auto Sector Talks OW3001121594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3001121594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It has been disclosed that at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks on the auto and auto parts sectors, the United States has presented a 12-point demand for improvement, maintaining "the Japanese system on auto standards and authorization constitutes an import barrier." Included in these demands are: procedures for inspection of imported cars should be simplified; regulations on standards for designating car-inspection factories should be eased; and information on car registrations should be made available. These are additional demands to those the United States has made since 1992 when (then) U.S. President Gorge Bush brought up a 14-point demand for improvements during his visit to Japan. Japan intends to have these problems settled at the consultations held between experts from the two nations; however, since it will be difficult for Japan to agree to certain demands, it is now faced with another problem in addition to the issue of setting "numerical targets." Regarding the 14-point demand that President Bush made during his visit to Japan, consultations have continued at the talks between Japanese and American experts specializing in auto standards and authorization systems. So far, an accord has been reached on accepting the U.S. system of testing brakes. However, other problems such as the acceptance of U.S. standards on exhaust emissions remain to be settled. Therefore, in addition to these problems, the United States has brought up other demands at the framework talks. Concerning simplification of import procedures, the United States demands that the PHP [expansion unknown] system which gives special treatment to imported cars -- whereby import of a small number of cars requires only documentary inspection -- be further simplified. It was also demanded that the government's inspection of each imported car be eliminated and, moreover, that the number of facilities designated for car inspection be increased. This is because the United States believes that once the number of such facilities is increased, the market for U.S.-made auto parts will be expanded. In concrete terms, the United States demands that when applying for designation as a car-inspection facility, each center should be required to have at least one, but not necessarily two, qualified mechanics. In addition, the United States demands that for the purpose of recalls (of defective cars for free repair), information on car registrations (individual registration data) under the control of the Ministry of Transport [MOT] should be made available; and that the MOT should take measures to publicize use of U.S.-made parts among various garages. With regard to these demands, Japan is rather puzzled because "many of these demands were brought up because of misunderstanding on the part of the United States" (as stated by an MOT source). For example, an inspection is, in principle, required for every new car whether it is domestically manufactured or imported. Moreover, when "the system of model designation," based on which the MOT approves the system of quality control for certain models, is adopted, manufacturers can apply for inspection procedures on behalf of users. With the issue of making individual registration data available, the Japanese side maintains that "since the data are made available to manufacturers for the purposes of analyzing statistics or for recalls, there is no discrimination against foreign manufacturers."
