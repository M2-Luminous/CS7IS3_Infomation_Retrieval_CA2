The reason was purely economic: the editors owe the Pressa publishing house 250 million roubles for printing services and newsprint, Pressa director Vyacheslav Leontiev told ITAR-TASS. He explained that the newspaper had been published practically without payment since the beginning of the year. Since that time SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA received four written warnings, but failed to pay its debt to the publishing house. This is why its publication was suspended last Thursday [31 March]. Similar warnings were sent to the editors of PRAVDA and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, which managed to pay their debts. According to Leontiev, warnings will be sent today to other debtors -- EKONOMIKA i ZHIZN (its debt amounts to 165 million roubles), KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (42 million), NEUES LEBEN (11 million), SELSKAYA ZHIZN (6 million) and KULTURA (3 million). If the editorial boards do not pay their debts soon enough, the publication of those newspapers may also be suspended.
