This problem is aggravated even more by the fact that the Azerbaijani parliament has not ratified the UN Convention on Biodiversity. However, the agency learned that the republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has requested through the UN temporary representation in Baku a package of international conventions on global ecological problems in order to submit them for the consideration of the National Assembly. It should be noted that in the event Azerbaijan does not join these conventions, this precludes the republic's participation in a number of programs of international ecological foundations.
