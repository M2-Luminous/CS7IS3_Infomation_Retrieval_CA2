A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that the DPRK had fully accepted nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) within the time limits set under an accord between the two sides. He noted that the inspections were implemented on the basis of full discussions between IAEA inspectors and DPRK administrative personnel at the country's nuclear facilities. He also said all the problems emerging during the inspections have been solved satisfactorily under the IAEA's requirements, which has been recognized by the authority. The spokesman added that during inter-Korean working-level contacts aimed at realizing an exchange of special envoys, the DPRK unilaterally took a resolute and magnanimous attitude so as to pave the way for that procedure. However, he said, the United States had failed to carry out its own commitments. "The U.S. introduced two additional prerequisites when announcing the suspension of joint military exercises" added the spokesman. They were that the nuclear inspections by IAEA must be implemented satisfactorily and exchanges of North-South Korean envoys be realized. "The United States still insists on these two prerequisites and it is by no means justifiable" the spokesman said. He reiterated that if the United States did not carry out its own agreed commitments, the DPRK would regard it as a break-down of communications and would take appropriate measures, including suspending inter-Korean working-level contacts and refusing to attend the third-round of U.S.-DPRK meetings scheduled for Geneva.
