FR940621-1-00026 FR940621-1-00007 The Service received several thousand written and oral comments associated with the two hearings and the extended comment period regarding the proposed listing of the Alabama sturgeon with critical habitat. Several hundred individuals and organizations supported the listing; however, the vast majority of the respondents did not support the listing. The Service agrees that little information exists on the species' life history, environmental requirements, or its historic and current population levels. Section 4(b)(6)(a)(i) of the Act requires the Service to take one of three alternative actions within one year of a listing proposal: (1) Publish a final regulation listing the species, (2) publish a notice that the listing proposal is being withdrawn, or (3) publish a notice that the one year time period is being extended under section 4(b)(6)(a)(i). That section as implemented by 50 CFR 424.17 (a)(1)(iv), provides that the Service may extend the one year period for up to 6 months upon finding that ``there is a substantial disagreement among scientists knowledgeable about the species concerned'' on whether to list the species. The Service must base its decisions under these provisions on the best scientific and commercial data available. The Service believes there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency of the scientific data relevant to whether the population of Alabama sturgeon in the Mobile River system continues to exist. Since 1985 there have been two anecdotal reports and the capture of one specimen. Biologists from the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources in 1990 and 1992 as well as biologists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have intensively sampled for this fish. Sturgeons are long lived animals and additional sampling may result in additional collections. However, the fact that only a single specimen has been taken during the sampling effort, has led some experts to question the extent of any remaining population of the Alabama sturgeon. Despite the fact that little information exists on the species life history, environmental requirements, or its historic and current population levels, the Act provides in Section 4(b)(1)(A) that a determination to list a species shall be based on the best scientific and commercial information on the species status. The Act does not require the Service to posses detailed or extensive information on these factors to make a listing determination. The Act's information standard does require that the best available information must support a conclusion that the species meet the Act's definition for threatened or endangered species status after consideration of the five factors discussed in Section 4(a)(1). These disagreements on the sufficiency of the scientific data has been found to be substantial. The Service therefore extends until December 15, 1994 the period within which to determine whether the Alabama sturgeon is an endangered species. The Service solicits additional data on the population status of the Alabama sturgeon until September 15, 1994. References Cited Anonymous, 1930. The sturgeon. Alabama Game and Fish News 1930(1):13.
