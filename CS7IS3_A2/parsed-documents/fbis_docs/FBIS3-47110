Armed with Molotov bombs and metal weapons, the local fishermen aboard some 30 to 45 motor boats Friday attacked several Thai boats operating in the waters off the west coast of Aceh, the source said. "Several Thai fishermen were injured, but there were no casualties," the source said. Deputy Police Chief Major Wahid confirmed the report. A fisherman blamed the attack on the marine authorities for their alleged lack of response to reports in the last six months that an increasing number of Thai boats have been operating in Indonesian territorial waters. The fisherman alleged that Indonesian Navy officials based in Sabang had protected the Thai fishermen. The fisherman quoted a Navy official as saying that "the Thai fishermen have the permit to fish around the waters of the exclusive economic zone." But the fisherman said that "in fact, they fish only two miles from the coast, using trawls, which have been banned by the government," the fisherman said. Sabang Navy Base Commander Lieutenant Colonel Azmi Idris told AFP that the Thai fishermen were cooperating with the navy. However, Indonesian marine patrols last month nabbed Thai fishing crews for alleged illegal fishing about 360 kilometers (223 miles) off Aceh. The Thai fishermen held three Indonesian policemen hostage for five hours following the arrest of their colleagues. They demanded to exchange the three police officers for the 16 Thai fishing boat crews the police had arrested earlier. The three policemen were released after an exchange of fire between the Thai fishermen and a police team specially deployed to free the hostages. Reports also said that Indonesian fishermen in Aceh had been repeatedly shot at by Thai fishing boats armed with modern fishing equipment.
