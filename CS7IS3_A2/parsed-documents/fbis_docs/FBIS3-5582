It was because the mass media, particularly worldwide television coverage, carried daily reports and screened footage of Africans -- infants, children, and old people -- reduced to skeletal forms and left hopeless without any future. [passage omitted] Yet another episode also has been witnessed through the mass media to a global audience over the last 22 months, particularly via television: scenes of the ethnic war in Bosnia linked to religion and which pose as a grim reminder with regard to the future of mankind. No accomplishment is derived from the ongoing trend of conflicts and tragedies. Every time one forgets such incidents, he or she is again jolted by what is aired over the television. The situation in Bosnia indicates a totally different and horrific kind of tragedy. Every time a tragic incident occurs, it proves to be more terrifying than the previous ones occuring several weeks before. [passage omitted] Take for example the latest incidents. The latest brutality occurred after the NATO alliance announced its ultimatum that it would bomb Serbian mortar positions if they did not withdraw their troops by the 20 February deadline. It comes as no surprise that there is a discrepancy. The victims of brutality have, in fact, called for effective action. On the one hand, there are brutalities that have claimed lives. On the other, we see a failure to take effective decisions. Indecision has in turn brought about views and evaluations about the existence of double standards as well as ethnic and religious discrimination. The problem is not as simple as we might think. We have constantly heard about hilly regions, the responsibility of the democratic governments, and national interests. Viewing the complexity of the problem and its considerations, we will definitely not be able to get rid of the views that the practise of double standards was employed by the Western nations in facing the war in the former Yugoslavia. At least, the Western nations do not act as effectively as when facing other issues, for example Iraq. Geographically, Bosnia is distant but psychologically nearer to several developing nations, including Indonesia. Our society has witnessed the brutality through mass media on numerous occasions. Our society is also affected by the discrepancy, that is the discrepancy concerning the factual reality with regard to the brutality and the ambigious and indecisive attitude which all point to the practice of double standards. We are disappointed and frustrated from humanitarian and religious angles and we are making a contribution in the form of a concrete action. This gave rise to the recent registration of volunteers to fight in Bosnia. Motivation, enthusiasm, and the background should be given prior consideration before any further action is undertaken. At least a concrete solidarity statement should be drawn up to further consolidate and mobilize public opinion and global solidarity for the Bosnians' fate and a strong call toward ending the Bosnian conflict in a just procedure. Indonesia's permanent representative reported our concerns to the world body while waiting for the order for NATO air strikes from UN headquarters in New York. As the chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, Indonesia is taking an initiative on the possibility of holding a conference on the issue of Bosnia. The move by the Indonesian representative was a follow-up to the views presented by President Suharto during his recent meeting with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Jakarta. Diplomatic measures will be time-consuming. Such measures are considered important because they form a realization of political attitudes and welfare. The mobilization of public opinion and effective solidarity is imperative in the effort toward seeking a just settlement to the Bosnian problem and the strife against ethnic-cleansing -- whether such an action has to be undertaken through diplomatic or military envdeavors. Therefore, it is appropriate for Indonesia, as the leader of the Nonaligned Movement, to utilize such a platform in its effort to end the Bosnian conflict. Such efforts and measures are imperative. The Bosnian problem can never be solved even with the Serbian withdrawal from their mortar bases.
