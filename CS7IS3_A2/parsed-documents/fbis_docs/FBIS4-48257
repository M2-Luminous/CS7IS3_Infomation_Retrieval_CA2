Their main grievance concerns the rate of increase applicable to electricity. The strike notice provided for minimum services, but this has not been not complied with so far. Saidu Mossi has a report. [Mossi] It is not easy to have a clear picture. What is certain is that NIGELEC, in view of the financial problems confronting it, needs to increase the kilowatt per hour rate. However, the management and National Electricity Workers Union [SYNATREN] have been unable to agree on an acceptable increase. Management is said to have proposed a rate that is not satisfactory to the NIGELEC workers. There is talk of a 30 to 40-percent increase while the SYNATREN is asking for more. The various rounds of negotiations have not succeeded in easing the situation, hence the 48-hour strike notice issued by the SYNATREN on 5 May. The strike notice stated that there will be temporary power cuts, however since this morning, there has been no electricity at all. The arrangements stated in the strike notice are no longer being implemented and there is a general power cut. The NIGELEC workers have adopted a harder stand because the NIGELEC management in the meantime requisitioned some of the workers, hence the SYNATREN's anger. At the moment, a meeting is being held between the union leaders and management but we do not have any details on it. Meanwhile, NIGELEC's 46,000 customers do not have any electricity at all. Many offices and businesses are blocked because of the power cut and people are wondering why the NIGELEC workers are asking for increases in electricity rates when the devaluation is making the cost of living increasingly unbearable. Besides, today's 40 degrees in the shade in Niamey is not going to cheer people up.
