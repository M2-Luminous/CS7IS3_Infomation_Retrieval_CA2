The president stressed that the measures proposed by the National Assembly of the People's Government to cleanse the country's economy defend the spirit of socialism without disregarding the reality of a world that is in the hands of multinationals. Appealing to the people's understanding on the need to adopt these measures promptly, the president insisted on the advantages of this action over the neoliberal recipes which, he asserted, have caused crises in various countries, particularly in the social area. Fidel Castro called for a broad dissemination of all topics discussed at the parliament, in search of the broadest popular support. In this regard, he highlighted the earlier speech by Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, who recalled what is the fate proposed for the island from Miami. He added that well-to-do and large landowners, whose properties were expropriated by the 1959 revolution, want to return from Miami to claim their former properties and privileges. The Cuban president noted the need to act perfectly and quickly, while guaranteeing not only the recovery of excess circulating currency but also a progressive improvement of the economic situation to insure that disequilibrium is not reproduced. Fidel Castro affirmed the measures will be gradual but "will not be left unimplemented." He termed the parliament's final resolution "broad and flexible," which will permit the government to act to correct disequilibrium and its causes. According to official figures from this Assembly, Cuba is facing a budget deficit of 4.2 billion pesos (equal to dollars at the official Cuban exchange rate) and an excess of circulating currency estimated at 11.636 billion pesos. These indicators are considered one of the main obstacles on the path to economic recovery.
