FR940516-2-00081 FR940516-2-00050 13. Estimate of Collection Burden For the Section 3 Reporting Form the total universe of potential respondents, including recipients, prime contractors and subcontractors, is approximately 133,403. We anticipate that about 58,403 respondents (HUD recipients) will submit summary reports to HUD. Prime contractors and subcontractors will submit reports, as requested , to the recipients. The required summary report from the recipients is submitted to HUD annually, 10 days after the end of the designated reporting period. The information is generated by the recipient through maintaining documentation that summarizes efforts made, and the results of those efforts, to provide opportunities for training and employment arising from HUD assistance to low- and very low-income residents. The data will be recorded on the Section 3 reporting form (form HUD&hyph;60002, Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons). It is estimated that two hours per reporting period will be required of the recipients, contractors and subcontractors to prepare the Section 3 report. We estimate that the burden will not vary significantly among the respondents.

It is anticipated that it will take the complainant approximately one (1) hour to complete the complaint form. It is anticipated that it will take the respondent approximately four hours to respond to the allegations of the complaint. Of the 100 complaints anticipated for receipt, HUD does not expect to require or receive a response from each respondent. About 10% of the complaints received will be administratively closed for lack of jurisdiction prior to the notification of the respondent. Therefore, the number of responses by the respondent has been lessened by 10% (to 90 responses) resulting in 360 total response hours for a respondent. The total number of burden hours for the Section 3 Complaint Form is 460 hours calculated as follows: Section 3 Complaint Form ␣ 1Number of respondents 1Number of responses 1Hours per response 1Total hours 100 complainants 100 1 100 100 respondents 90 4 360 Recordkeeping: 133,403 recipients, contractors & subcontractors 1 4 266,806 14. Change in Burden The Section 3 Reporting Form is revised to reflect public comments to the proposed rule. This is the first time that the Section 3 Complaint Form information has been requested.
