He said, "We look at the situation as very serious. To find a way out from this crisis as soon as possible, the government should do whatever is in its power." Yamagishi also indicated he would ask the government to formulate Japan's own action program containing market liberalization measures, and measures to expand domestic demand to reduce the trade surplus in March as a measure to effect a new turn in Japan-U.S. economic negotiations. Regarding the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Yamagishi said, "I respect the fact that Japan said no to the United States (its demand for setting numerical targets), but we need measures to reconcile Japan and the United States as soon as possible. We certainly hope the government will continue to work on this."
