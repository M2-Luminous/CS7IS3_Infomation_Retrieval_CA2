Christopher has said his talks reached a serious, substantive level, and that he has conveyed ideas from Damascus. The Israeli foreign minister has acknowledged that the questions conveyed by Christopher were serious and complicated. President Hafiz al-Asad had briefed the U.S. secretary on Syria's view, which stems from a true desire to achieve a just and comprehensive peace that guarantees the rights of all parties. President al-Asad stressed that addressing the basic issues in the peace process would ensure progress. There is no doubt that full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied territories is a major issue. Without acknowledging the principle of complete and speedy withdrawal, it is impossible to realize progress. The question of the Golan is not only that it is Syrian territory occupied by force; there are also tens of thousands of displaced Syrians who were forced to flee from their land and are now awaiting return. There is also the question of the towns destroyed by Israel, especially the city of al-Qunaytirah that was turned to rubble and is now awaiting reconstruction. It is unreasonable to reconstruct this heroic city of martyrs while Israeli threats are still a reality. The occupation has left behind deep, bleeding wounds that must be dressed. This is impossible without a speedy Israeli withdrawal. Syria has for some time now been offering full peace for full withdrawal. If we are to deal with Israel through citing the statements of its officials, then peace, as Rabin himself has acknowledged, is the best guarantee of security. Syria is offering honorable, true, firm, and lasting peace; Israel, on the other hand, will only be withdrawing from Syrian territory that was occupied by force and responding to the resolutions of international legitimacy by putting the record straight and putting an end to many years of illegitimate practices on the Golan. Syria can only understand Israel's reluctance to accept full and comprehensive withdrawal as a way to evade the obligations of the peace process. If we revisit the past, we will find that the leaders of Israel have been shouting loudly, since 1948, calling for peace with the Arabs and appealing to the world to intervene to hold Arab-Israeli peace talks. Yet, as soon as the United States announced a peace initiative in the Middle East, through former President George Bush, the Israeli officials started creating impediments and obstacles to it. Thus, they unwillingly participated in the Madrid conference and wasted two years of the Washington talks. Instead of the comprehensive peace proposed by the Arabs, they have propagated piecemeal peace over long stages in order to prolong the occupation and suffering -- despite the fact that a piecemeal peace is not a solution, nor does it lead to a solution. Rather, it nurtures tension in the region. The Israeli officials are today facing a new test. They have been crying out for some time now that they are concerned about a lasting peace with Syria. Secretary Christopher has taken along with him from Damascus ideas that will lead to a lasting peace if Israel responds to these ideas and truly responds to the UN resolutions and the foundations of the Madrid conference. The Israeli officials are well aware that Syria will not engage in phased settlements and partial solutions and that it looks forward to regaining its occupied territory, and consequently, to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces. The Israeli officials are also well aware that Syria keeps its word and that it makes peace honorably and fights war honorably. However, peace is impossible to build as long as occupation and threats continue. There is no alternative to fully removing occupation, establishing justice, and removing all manifestations of threat and expansion in the region.
