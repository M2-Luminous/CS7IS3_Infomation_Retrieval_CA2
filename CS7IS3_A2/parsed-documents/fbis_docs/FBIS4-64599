Sweden will hold its referendum November 13 and Austria on June 12. Norway has yet to announce a date. Meanwhile, Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, who together with Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto negotiated Finland's membership agreement in Brussels, said he was pleased with the European Parliament's decision Wednesday to admit the four applicant countries. "This is a fantastic result if one considers that 259 votes were required for membership, and we were well over that by 100 and there were few opponents," he said.
