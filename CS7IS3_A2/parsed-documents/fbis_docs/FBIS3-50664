"Days ago we sent a message to this international organization in which Guatemala agrees to sign a shadow agreement [acuerdo sombra] (AS) that will enter into force on 1 January 1994," he pointed out. Zapata added that we are now only awaiting a faxed reply from IMF officials, expected to arrive in the next few days. This is imminent because it is part of agreements we reached in our most recent negotiations, he noted. The official explained that the AS calls on the country to increase fiscal revenues by two percentage points through 0.5 trimestral increases. "The goal is to increase the current 8 percent tax collection [captacion de impuestos] rate to 10 percent," Zapata said. The Central Bank president added that the agreement also calls for an increase in the bank's net internal assets by 490 million quetzals, as established by next year's monetary policy approved by the proper authorities this month. "Another commitment by Guatemala is to keep inflation from going over 8.5 percent and to increase monetary reserves by $40 million in 1994," Zapata pointed out. IMF staff who visited the country in early November had initially proposed a monetary reserve increase of $160 million in 1994. Complying with this requirement, however, would have prompted Banguat to issue more money without backing in order to acquire the respective foreign currency. This would make it more difficult to decrease interest rates for open market operations to neutralize [esterilizar] the liquidity that is generated. As a result, it would be virtually impossible to reduce the current rate [tasa activa] of the financial system, now approximately 32 percent. Signing Opens Doors Zapata added that the signing of this agreement makes it easier for Guatemala to obtain funds from other countries, such as the Advisory Group [Grupo Consultivo -- GC], which is comprised of nations from Latin America, Europe, and Asia. "The World Bank has called a meeting, probably in Paris on 3 March, in which Guatemala must present to the GC its package of projects for raising funds to implement these measures," he added. The World Bank organizes activities like this to help a country that is initiating an agreement with the IMF, Zapata pointed out. The bank president emphasized that "one of the best examples is El Salvador, which obtained donations [donaciones] totaling $60 million and a three-year term. We hope to obtain at least a similar figure, but our success will depend on the number of projects we present." More Dollars for Guatemala He added that the signing of the AS allows the World Bank to disburse $25 million, which is the second installment of a $120 million loan agreed upon in late 1992. The first installment ($48 million) was disbursed to Guatemala in 1992, but the second installment was frozen because of the country's failure to comply with goals agreed upon with the IMF, mainly because of the May political crisis. "Another credit available to Guatemala would be that of the Inter-American Development Bank for $132 million, and we hope that the first installment of $60 million will be disbursed in early 1994," Zapata said. He added that "the only thing needed to receive this credit is congressional approval, as this would increase the country's foreign debt." Certification of Good Conduct The AS has the same terms as the Stand by Precaution USS [preceding four words published in italics and in English] agreement signed by Guatemala in late 1992. The difference is that this one included a precautionary [precautorio] loan of $160 million that the signatory country may use should it face balance of payment problems. But Guatemala never used this money. it did fail to meet the established goals mainly because of the May political crisis. Finance Minister Richard Aitkenhead and the Bank of Guatemala president traveled to IMF headquarters in the second half of September to start talks that would lead to the signing of a new agreement with that international organization. Finally, the country signed an AS -- which does not require congressional approval because it does not involve loans -- but according to Zapata there are plans for Guatemala to sign another standby agreement during the last trimester of 1994. "That is our goal because a stand by agreement creates more international trust than an AS. The government program calls for the administration to work with a standby agreement during its second year in office," Zapata finally said.
