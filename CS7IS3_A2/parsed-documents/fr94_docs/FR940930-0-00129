FR940930-0-00129 FR940930-0-00026 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 092194B] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Inseason adjustment; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS issues an inseason adjustment prohibiting retention of rockfish species of the genera Sebastes and Sebastolobus by vessels using trawl gear in the Central Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent overfishing of Pacific ocean perch (POP). DATES: Effective 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), September 30, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Comments must be received at the following address no later than 4:30 p.m., Alaska local time, October 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802, Attn: Lori Gravel, or be delivered to the fourth floor of the Federal Building, 709 West 9th Street, Juneau, AK. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. The Magnuson Act requires that conservation and management measures prevent overfishing. The 1994 overfishing level for POP in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA is established by the final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 1,100 metric tons (mt) and the acceptable biological catch as 850 mt. The final specifications closed directed fishing for POP in the Central Regulatory Area. As of September 30, 1994, NMFS anticipates that 880 mt of POP will have been caught. NMFS prohibited retention of POP on August 24, 1994 (59 FR 44341). Substantial trawl fishing effort will be directed at remaining amounts of groundfish in the GOA during 1994. These fisheries can have significant bycatch of POP. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with §672.22(a)(1)(i) and (a)(4), that closing the season by prohibiting retention of rockfish species of the genera Sebastes and Sebastolobus by vessels using trawl gear is necessary to prevent overfishing of POP, and is the least restrictive measure to achieve that purpose. Without this prohibition of retention, significant incidental catch of POP would occur by operators of trawl vessels seeking to retain as much rockfish as possible under the standards for directed fishing §672.20(g). Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of rockfish species of the genera Sebastes and Sebastolobus by vessels using trawl gear in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA be treated as prohibited species under §672.20(e) effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., September 30, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds for good cause that providing prior notice and public comment or delaying the effective date of this action is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Without this inseason adjustment, POP in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA will be overfished, jeopardizing the long-term capacity of that stock. Under §672.22(c), interested persons are invited to submit written comments on this action to the above address until October 15, 1994. Classification This action is taken under §672.22 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: September 26, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
