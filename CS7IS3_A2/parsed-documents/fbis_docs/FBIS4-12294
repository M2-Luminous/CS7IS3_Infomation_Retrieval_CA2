Sources in Tehran said yesterday that the invitation came in a written message from "Supreme Leader" 'Ali Khamene'i delivered to al-Asad in Damascus by Iranian Majles Deputy Speaker Hasan Ruhani. Iranian media had reported that President al-Asad would visit Tehran this April to discuss "a new strategy for the Middle East" with Khamene'i and his aides. But sources in Tehran said yesterday that al-Asad accepted the invitation without setting a date for it. Ruhani, who is also secretary general of the Iranian National Security Council, also delivered a message from President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Khamene'i had openly urged Syria to withdraw from the "American peace process" and support the Palestinian factions which pledged to torpedo any agreement with Israel. While in Damascus, Ruhani received a number of Palestinian radical leaders including Ahmad Jibril, Fathi Shaqaqi, and Colonel Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa]. He invited George Habash and Nayif Hawatimah to meet with him but they sent representatives. Ruhani, who is considered to be a member of the small circle of mullahs at the center of power in Tehran, also met with leaders of Lebanon's Hizballah. The Iranian sources say that he asked the Hizballah leaders to persuade the Shiite leaders in Lebanon to accept Khamene'i as the highest Shiite authority. Senior Shiite leaders in Lebanon, including Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah and Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din had expressed support for 'Ali Mohammad Sistani, the Iranian mullah living in al-Najaf in Iraq. Some reports indicate that the Palestinian radical groups have expressed displeasure with Iran for failing so far to provide the massive aid it had promised at a special conference held in Tehran in February 1993. Iranian sources attribute the delay in providing aid for these groups to Tehran's cash flow problems, but in a recent speech Khamene'i reaffirmed his government's commitment "to aid the Palestinian struggle" against the PLO-Israel agreement. Tehran analysts believe that the summit meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Bill Clinton in Geneva last January was a turning point of historic importance in relations between Washington and Damascus. One of the results of that meeting is perhaps Damascus's clear attempts to gradually distance itself from Tehran's radical policies, according to the analysts.
