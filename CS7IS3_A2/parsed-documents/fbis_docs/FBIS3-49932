The letter stresses Turkey's admiration of the progress marked by Romania since 1990 and the satisfaction at the fine and close collaboration within the North-Atlantic Cooperation Council, as well as the interest confirmed by Romania in the collaboration with that forum that has brought NATO and Romania closer. "We see the Partnership for Peace initiative as an operational formula in this period of transition and believe it will help enhancing the security, stability and fertile cooperation in Europe and around it," the January 5, 1994 letter by Turkey's president reads.
