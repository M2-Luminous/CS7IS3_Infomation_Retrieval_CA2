He made this remark during a meeting aboard the icebreaker "Almirante Irizar" with the relatives of seamen killed in the sinking of the cruiser "General Belgrano." President Menem thus appeared to be raising the bet on his most recent remarks on the Malvinas Islands issue, in which he indicated that the islands would again become part of sovereign Argentine territory before the year 2000. The president made this remark before a group of 65 relatives of seamen killed in the sinking of the warship "General Belgrano," which was torpedoed by the British nuclear submarine "Conqueror" 12 years ago. In an emotional tone, Menem addressed the relatives of the "General Belgrano" seamen in one of the icebreaker's holds a few minutes after boarding the ship, within the framework of a tribute that the national government is paying -- for the first time -- to war veterans and relatives of the seamen killed on the "General Belgrano." The tribute in the South Atlantic waters is scheduled to end tomorrow. The president arrived in Ushuaia, from which town the icebreaker was sailing, at 1735, and an hour later went to the naval base, where he boarded the "Almirante Irizar." The president was joined by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella; Defense Minister Oscar Camilion; Army Chief of Staff Martin Balza; Navy Chief of Staff Enrique Molina Pico; Juan Paulik, the Air Force chief of staff; Tierra del Fuego Governor Jose Estabillo; and Public Function Secretary Claudia Bello. Bello, along with Jorge Baeza, the Defense Ministry military affairs secretary, organized the tribute, which was called "Operation Memorial." [passage omitted]
