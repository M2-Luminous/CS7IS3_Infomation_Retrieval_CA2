Bruno Musso, chief executive of the main plant construction arm of IRI's [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] vast Finmeccanica engineering sub-group, painted an alarming picture of the situation in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Of the 58 nuclear plants in Central and East Europe, he said, 15 are of the same RBMK type as Chernobyl, with obsolete cooling systems using normal water. Pointing to "worrying" basic design faults, Musso said these plants "should be shut down as soon as possible." Another 43 plants use the slightly more modern VVER technology, with cooling by pressurized water. Of these, the oldest 10 should be closed, while 23 must be Westernized to improve efficiency and safety, Musso said. The closures would mean a fall in energy supplies in the former Soviet bloc of at least 20,000 megawatts out of a total of 45,500. Musso contended that the situation is "critical" because of the "two major problems that have to be reconciled": on the one hand, the safety demands of the Western world, which "can no longer afford to risk another Chernobyl"; and on the other, the economic needs of the Eastern nations, which "cannot see vital energy cut off from one day to the next." For Lithuania alone, he said, shutting the old power station at Ignalina would mean a 45 percent drop in the country's electricity supplies. He thus launched a proposal embracing the two areas. "The United States, in a confidential report, has declared its willingness to buy the enriched uranium in the nuclear bombs of the former Soviet Union; these resources, together with other funding from the European Union, could be used for modernising the less obsolete plants, restoring efficiency in the multi-fuel plants, and building new sites." These combined efforts should be enough to close the energy gap caused by the cuts, also opening up interesting business prospects for construction and engineering firms like Ansaldo, which last month set up a company in Moscow with the Russian energy agency. Ansaldo's participation in the restructuring programme he envisages, Musso said, could boost the company's turnover from nuclear projects from 70 billion lire at present to 300 billion in 1995, a figure he described as "very satisfactory." He said that Ansaldo is thinking of asking the Italian foreign ministry to have the problem of East European nuclear plants formally placed on the agenda of the July Group of Seven summit in Naples.
