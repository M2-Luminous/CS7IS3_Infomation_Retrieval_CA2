In the process, equipment valued at R[rand]6.5 million will be donated and transferred. The agreement, signed by the defence ministers of South Africa and Namibia, Kobie Coetsee and Peter Mweshihange, was described by Mr Coetsee as signalling the end and beginning of an era. "The new era represents the spirit of mutual understanding that exists on defence matters between the two governments. It also signifies the beginning of an era in which southern Africa could proceed with security co-operation on a country-to-country and on a multilateral basis. The time has come for the countries of the region to work in earnest to improve the quality of life of all our people, and for that purpose mutual schemes and projects could be explored." Mr Coetsee said he believed it would also enable Namibia to have "a more appropriate window to the outside world" and add to the completion of the country's international status. Mr Mweshihange said the signing was a vindication that peacefultco-existence could work where those involved were committed. "What we have witnessed is a complete new chapter in the relationship between our two countries and defence forces. It is a chapter characterised by peace and mutual understanding." He said the fact that the two countries had had a confrontational past had not overwhelmed their desire for good neighbourliness and co-operation. The agreement was a key to more co-operation agreements. Both ministers said a formal non-aggression pact had not been signed because it was unnecessary. According to the agreement, all functions and duties at the military base and Rooikop airport will be handed over by the South African Defence Force [SADF] to the Namibian Defence Force [NDF] and to the Directorate of Civil Aviation on February 28. It was specifically agreed that the SADF would: - leave shooting range boundaries and markers intact; - brief and train appointed members of the NDF in the protection, use and application of the shooting range; - hand over safety templates to the NDF; - donate and transfer to the NDF all furniture, kitchen equipment, garden tools, camping equipment, linen and labour-saving utensils in present use at the base and valued at about R440,000; - transfer telecommunication equipment at the command and control centre at the base, valued at about R510,000; - transfer all flying-related equipment and existing aids rendering the airport international and valued at R5.5 million. Namibia has granted overflight and landing rights at Rooikop airport to enable South African military aircraft to undertake humanitarian missions. South Africa will assist with search and rescue services until Namibia can take over these responsibilities.
