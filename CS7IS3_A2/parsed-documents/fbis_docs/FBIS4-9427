The area is not covered by a NATO ultimatum on Friday which threatened massive air bombing of the Bosnian Serbs if they continued attacking Gorazde in eastern Bosnia or threatened another four mainly-Moslem towns. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forced the Bosnian Serbs to begin pulling back from the battered town of Gorazde at the weekend, after they had mauled it. This means, warned one NATO source, that three brigades -- 10,000 men or more -- could be looking for a new target, along with about 60 tanks and big guns. With Gorazde close to the Serb border, they could easily cross into Serbia and travel quickly and safely northwards towards Brcko in order to widen and strengthen the corridor, he said. The source added that such an attack could provoke NATO air strikes if UN personnel were stationed in the area and their lives were in danger, even though the area was not included in last Friday's ultimatum. Last week the Bosnian Serb chief of staff, General Manjlo Milovanovic, said candidly that Serbian territory between Brcko and Doboj, the eastern and western ends of the narrow corridor, was the next target. The statement was followed by a barrage of reports in the Serb press that Bosnian Moslems were attacking Serb positions around Brcko. Similar allegations preceded the Serb assault on Gorazde which started three weeks ago. But one NATO official said the Bosnian Serbs could not be relied on to follow a consistent strategy. "Who knows what goes on in their minds?" he said when asked if Brcko was the next likely target. The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said it was not clear to NATO strategists whether the Bosnian Serbs were following a master plan, or even whether their generals would follow one if it existed. "There are renegade warlords who owe their power to continued fighting," he said, adding that the Serbs had a pattern of unpredictably hitting wherever their enemies showed signs of weakness. But diplomats here are also hoping that the Bosnian Serbs, having already conquered large parts of Bosnia, might decide that they have won enough to start real negotiations to end the two-year war from a position of strength. "There is a lot of war-weariness on all sides," the official said. Fueling this thesis is a new concertation by the United States, Russia and the European Union to push the warring parties towards a settlement. However, Nedzad Hadzimusic, the head of the Bosnian Government's mission to Brussels, said the Bosnian Serbs would continue to use their military muscle at least until the year-end as long as it was not knocked out by NATO. "There is going to be another Gorazde somewhere else, perhaps even in another safe area like Tuzla," he said. Tuzla, along with Gorazde and the other Moslem-held towns of Bihac, Srebrenica and Zepa, are protected by NATO's air strike ultimatum issued last Friday. But Hadzimusic predicted that the Bosnian Serbs might attack Tuzla, which has a strategically-important airport, to test whether NATO really does have the nerve to launch massive air strikes against them.
