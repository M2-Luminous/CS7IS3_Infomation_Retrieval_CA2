This is the conclusion drawn from a study recently published in MIDDLE EAST QUARTERLY. The scholar who conducted the study, which included 1,000 Lebanese, Syrian, and Palestinian Muslims outside Israel, warns that Arab leaders foresee the danger of delegitimization by their people, who lag behind them in their policies toward Israel. Professor Hilal Qashan of the American University in Beirut found that, on the eve of the signing of the agreement between Israel and the PLO at the White House, none of those surveyed could find a single positive aspect to peace with Israel. The most common opinion was that peace is a temporary tactic designed to enable the Arabs to reorganize themselves in order to strike at Israel at some later time. Of those questioned who supported peace, 90 percent said that they would withdraw their support for it if Israel were to weaken in the future. The scholar concludes that his findings teach that even they do not support a lasting peace. Writing in the WALL STREET JOURNAL, Qashan states that the Arab public's desire to launch an immediate war against Israel indicates an anomaly in the findings, for if the Arabs failed to wipe out Israel when superpower polarization was at its peak, it is irrational to believe that they can succeed at a time when just one superpower exists. He concludes from his survey findings that the Arabs--including those who support peace--are not psychologically ready for this change. The respondents expressed fear that peace would enable Israel to become the leading economic power of the Middle East and to gain a larger share of the region's water sources. Many of the respondents blame Israel for instigating the civil war in Lebanon, inciting the clash with the Qurds in northern Iraq and aggravating the rebellion in southern Sudan. They believe in the existence of a grand Zionist conspiracy to create "ministates" to take the place of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Egypt. The respondents--two-thirds of them engaged in the liberal professions--reveal a very faulty conception of the meaning of peace and its benefits. A majority sees it as surrender and prefers to continue the confrontation with Israel. According to the study, Arab political culture still harbors strong anti-Israel sentiments. Qashan blames Arab leaders for educating their people to distrust Jews, hate Zionists, and dream of destroying Israel. When they decided to open negotiations with Israel, Qashan notes, they did not properly prepare their public for what might ensue. The Arab public feels abandoned by its leaders and bypassed by modernization and political liberalism. Nonetheless, he believes that true peace can be achieved if Arab leaders undertake a new process of socialization in the Arab public. He calls on the United States to make a contribution by promoting mutual interaction, cooperation and understanding so that peace will stand on its own.
