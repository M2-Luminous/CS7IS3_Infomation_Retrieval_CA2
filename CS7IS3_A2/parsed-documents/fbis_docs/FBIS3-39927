A spokeswoman for the Federal Economics Ministry stated on Tuesday [22 February] that, as far as Bonn is concerned, the point is to prevent financial damage, while Iran did not want to cut itself off from the possibility of being granted further Hermes guarantees. Both sides have differing views regarding, among other things, the beginning of the repayment of debts and the number of installments. Before the beginning of a new round of talks, the Iranian side will be contacted by telephone at the end of the week, the spokeswoman said.
