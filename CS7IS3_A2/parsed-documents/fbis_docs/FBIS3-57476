As reported today by Galina Sidorova, political aide to the Russian foreign minister at the end of the first round of Russian-Chinese talks today, the second Russian-Chinese summit will be preceded by a trip by Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, to Beijing, as well as by a trip to Moscow by PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. Russian President Boris Yeltsin made an official visit to Beijing in December 1992. His visit ended the process of complete normalization of relations between the two countries, having opened up extensive possibilities for the establishment of new, good-neighborly and friendly contacts.
