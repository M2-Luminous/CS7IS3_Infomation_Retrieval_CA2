In a statement given to CTK today the Ministry expressed surprise that the Hungarian foreign minister has assumed the right of arbitration in assessing whether the Slovak Republic is fulfilling its multilateral obligations. Jeszenszky again described Slovakia's attitude towards the Hungarian minority as the only problem in Slovak-Hungarian relations and stressed that the problem of borders between the two countries did not exist and that there was thus no need to deal with it. Slovakia is interested in concluding a basic interstate treaty with Hungary and it reiterates its readiness to provide guarantees that Hungarian minority rights will be observed in Slovakia in the spirit of international norms. However at the same time Slovakia demands that a clause on inviolability of borders be included in the treaty, the statement says. Jeszenszky's statements do not serve to create mutual trust and they could lead to the strengthening of the positions of extremists on both sides, which could endanger the atmosphere for solving other open questions between the two countries, the statement says.
