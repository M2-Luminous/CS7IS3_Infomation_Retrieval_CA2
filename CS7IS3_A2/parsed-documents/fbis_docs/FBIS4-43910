In a wide-ranging foreign policy briefing in the run-up to the EU's [European Union] Corfu summit and the G-7 summit in Naples on July 8-10, he also said that he would be seeking to give Italy a higher-profile foreign policy. Other points in the briefing included a proposal to debate the Bosnian crisis at the G-7 summit where he said he hoped to see an acceleration in Russian involvement. Bosnia, said Martino, "can usefully be brought into the sphere of political cooperation in the G-7 plus Russia, not only at the summit itself, but as an appropriate forum for permanent political consultation." On the EU's plans for economic and monetary union, Martino said that he sees the present procedures introduced to achieve the economic convergence needed to create a common currency as "excessively laborious and potentially ineffective, especially where they don't take account of the deeper logic of market forces." Monetary union, he added, would have to be based on a monetary constitution to be put into effect "instantaneously" by all the participants: "Put simply, if you want a single currency for Europe, it will have to be achieved at one go." These apparent criticisms of one proposed aspect of European integration were matched by arguments advanced by Martino in support of submitting some joint EU policies more systematically to the winds of global competition, a development already under way for the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP], whose subsidies are to be largely dismantled under the Uruguay Round. In Corfu, Martino urged, the EU leaders should decide on ways of achieving lower costs by opening Europe to competition from the rest of the world. He also claimed that the CAP had favoured rich farmers and middle-men. In similar points, he said supplementary EU funding for infrastructural and other projects outlined in the Delors White Paper should not distort the European capital market nor create additional expense for the EU budget. Looking forward to a common European foreign policy, the Italian diplomatic chief urged the creation of a new institution on the lines of the European Commission, "with the power to make proposals to the political authorities and the means to execute and maintain actions." In other foreign policy areas, Martino reiterated that Italy has "no territorial demands" against Slovenia or Croatia and that ongoing negotiations should resolve remaining bilateral questions such as minority rights and compensation for confiscated property. He also said that Rome favours Slovenia's gradual movement towards its goal of membership in the EU, but urged it to adopt an "open and constructive" attitude towards Italy's legitimate expectations, "in line with EU principles." In particular, he said Italy is demanding free access to the Slovenian real-estate market for Italians born in ex-Italian territories now forming part of Slovenia, in line with EU regulations on free circulation. He said he expected similar solutions with Croatia. The diplomatic chief then added how Rome favored Slovenia moving "slowly" closer to the European Union in pace with Ljubljana meeting Italy's legitimate demands which "are based on Community principals," such as open markets and free circulation. As to the naming of a new Commission president, Martino said that all the present candidates have the political qualifications to become "potentially excellent presidents," but he also repeated the view that the appointment should form part of an agreement on the whole package of international appointments now falling due. Among these are the candidacy of ex-Foreign Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero to head the new World Trade Organisation, which will succeed the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. "We are examining this question in all its ramifications," said Martino. He also linked the issue of international appointments to his moves to give Italy a more high-profile foreign policy, which he said must be "coherent and recognisable" to be credible. Saying that domestic uncertainties had meant a loss in international prestige, he said the government would be seeking to rebuild Italian participation in international decision-making processes by "making the most" of its current duty presidencies and working for a two-year stint on the UN Security Council. This, he said, now looks a virtual certainty because Sweden has withdrawn its candidacy and because of the "assurances we have received." On Rwanda, Martino voiced the hope that a joint action plan would be adopted in Corfu and said that Italy was ready to play its part, even through the use of its armed forces. He also warned that, if two European countries -- for example, Italy and France -- were to intervene instead of the UN as a whole, the operation would be seen as "neo-colonialism." In other points, he reiterated Italy's plan to use the G-7 summit as a forum for proposing the creation of a small rapid intervention force -- "a small task force," he specified -- for immediate intervention in small crises. Looking at the costs of Italy's participation in international operations, Martino said the time had come for the budget to include ad hoc allocations for peace-keeping expenses. Martino's foreign policy briefing also included reference to his recent meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres who he said was totally satisfied over the political evolution in Italy and confirmed the traditionally excellent relations between Italy and Israel.
