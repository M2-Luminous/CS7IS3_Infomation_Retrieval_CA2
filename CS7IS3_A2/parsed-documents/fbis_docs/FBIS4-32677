The talks with Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic centered on the international community's intensive efforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis, the two countries' contribution in this respect, and certain bilateral issues. The Yugoslav side informed its Italian collocutors about the constructive efforts the FRY is making toward ending the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible by reaching a peace agreement, with respect for the legitimate interests of the parties involved. Voicing support for the new Italian Government's endeavors to become more actively involved in the peaceful resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, the Yugoslav side expressed its hope that Italy -- a neighboring country and influential member of the European Union -- will contribute to a principled approach to the crisis. As Italy will soon be presiding over the summit of the G-7 and Russia in Naples, hope was expressed that Italy will contribute to the shaping of a more objective view of a resolution and a more realistic position regarding the search for a just and lasting peace. Special emphasis was laid in the talks on the need for normalizing relations between the FRY and the CSCE, with the lifting of the ban on the FRY's activities as the final result. The Yugoslav side underscored the necessity for lifting the sanctions, since it has met all the conditions stemming from relevant UN Security Council resolutions. There is a growing awareness among international factors that the FRY is actively engaged in the search for a peaceful solution, while the sanctions are becoming counterproductive because they are encouraging the advocates of the war option and rendering peace talks more difficult. In addition to their dire consequences for the population and the economy of the FRY, the sanctions are adversely affecting neighboring countries and the entire European continent. As a result of the sanctions, Yugoslav-Italian trade has dropped from several billion dollars to zero. The Italian side was informed about the situation in the Balkan region, relations with neighboring countries, and the current process of normalizing relations with the former Yugoslav republics -- something Yugoslavia is sincerely interested in. The meeting reaffirmed the traditionally friendly relations between Yugoslavia and Italy -- relations that are not burdened by open problems. It was mutually concluded that significant prospects exist for the revival of all-encompassing bilateral cooperation after the sanctions are lifted. The conviction was expressed that the development of such cooperation will in future be an important impetus to the overall normalization of economic and political ties in the region of former Yugoslavia.
