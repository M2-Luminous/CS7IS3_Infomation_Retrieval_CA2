FR940826-2-00100 FR940826-2-00055 II. The Boc's Resale of Switched Interexchange Services to Their Cellular Subscribers, Subject to Sufficient Equal Access Safeguards, Should Not Result in an Ability to Raise Prices for Interexchange Service. The BOC's generic wireless waiver motion, unlike the motions by BellSouth and Southwestern, does not seek a modification of Section II's equal access requirement. The only modification sought is that of Section II(D)(1)'s interexchange prohibition. In light of AT&T's opposition, the standard for review is that of Section VIII(C): whether the BOCs have demonstrated that ``there is no substantial possibility that (they) could use (their) monopoly power to impede competition in the markets (they) seek to enter.'' In the Court of Appeals' formulation, that standard requires the BOCs to demonstrate that they will not ``have the ability to raise prices'' in those markets. 900 F.2d at 296. The United States believes that, in an environment in which appropriate equal access safeguards prevent discrimination against interexchange competitors, that showing is made. A. BOC Entry as an Additional Choice, Subject to Equal Access, Should Not Result in an Ability to Raise Prices. As discussed above (pp. 13&hyph;23), the reason that the elimination of equal access would reduce competition is that it would prevent cellular customers from obtaining the benefit of whatever competition there is in the interexchange market. 39 By contrast, if genuine equal access can be preserved, it seems unlikely that BOC entry into cellular long distance, in competition with existing providers, would reduce competition in that market. Their entry might be competitively neutral, or might actually result in lower prices; there does not seem to be a clear reason that_again, subject to genuine equal access_their entry might raise prices. 39 There plainly is some competition in interexchange services, notwithstanding the BOCs' arguments. Indeed their arguments are premised on the proposition that competition in bulk long distance, which they seek to purchase, drives prices far below AT&T's regulated Tariff 1 rates. See p. 20 & n.28 above. Even at the retail level, the benefits of divestiture and the equal access regime it created have substantially reduced long distance prices, as the Court has often noted E.g., AT&T McCaw Decision, 154 F.R.D. at 10. The BOCs will enter the long distance market with no market share, no existing long distance customers, and no ability to convert their current cellular customers to their own long distance services_except by persuading customers that the BOC offers a better service or the same service at a lower price. To the extent the BOCs offer service at prices below AT&T Tariff 1 prices, 40 their customers (and the customers of other interexchange carriers, who may either demand lower prices or switch to BOC long distance service) benefit. To the extent the BOCs offer service at prices higher than AT&T's highest rates, customers have alternatives. 40 The rates contained in AT&T's Tariff No. 1 (sometimes referred to as ``Basket 1'' or ``MTS'' rates) are AT&T's ``undiscounted'' retail rates, from which AT&T offers discounted rate plans. MCI, Sprint and other long distance carriers likewise offer discounted rate plans based on volume. The interexchange carriers' arguments against the waiver, as made to the Department during its investigation, do not challenge this proposition. They challenge instead whether the BOC's provision of access to itself and its competitors can ever be considered ``equal,'' and whether the BOC's control of the landline exchange overwhelms the analysis. 41 The adequacy of equal access (under the Department's proposal, rather than under the BOC's) is discussed at pp. 29&hyph;40 below; whether control of the landline exchange dictates a different result is discussed at pp. 40&hyph;42 below. 41 AT&T's Further Opposition to RBOCs' Motion to Exempt ``Wireless'' Services from Section II of the Decree, pp. 11&hyph;14 (May 3, 1993); Kelly Aff. 19&hyph;21 (MCI submission Apr. 30, 1993). If genuine equal access is provided, the BOC will not have an unfair advantage over its competitors by reason of its providing access to itself and to its competitors. If they have an equal chance to gain customers, the BOCs' competitors will not be foreclosed from the cellular exchange. If the BOCs can only gain business by charging lower prices, that would not seem likely to lead to the higher prices that the Court of Appeals noted was the test for Section VIII(C). These arguments may seem tautological, but their import is that the focus of the inquiry should be on the question whether, and under what conditions, a BOC cellular system can provide access to itself and its competitors without creating a substantial risk that it will discriminate in providing that access. We now turn to that question. B. Appropriate Safeguards are Required To Protect Against Discrimination in Access or Presubscription by the Cellular Exchange Operator. The structure of the Decree rests on equal access. AT&T's discrimination against competing long distance carriers formed the basis of the antitrust violation, and preventing discrimination by the exchange access provider was and is the key to allowing competitive long distance markets to develop. Decree Opinion, 552 F. Supp. at 165. Recognizing that merely enjoining discrimination would be insufficient to prevent that discrimination, the Decree required a permanent separation of AT&T's exchange and long distance businesses, id. at 165, 172, and prohibited the Bell companies from integrating into the long distance business. Id. at 177. However, the Court recognized that the BOCs might lose their monopoly power over time; the Court therefore added Section VIII(C) to the Decree, to permit entry by the BOCs when that entry would be unlikely to reduce competition. Id. at 195.
