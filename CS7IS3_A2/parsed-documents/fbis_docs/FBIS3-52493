He gave them the background of the talks and said Pakistan reiterated its principled stand that the Kashmir problem must be resolved on the basis of UN resolutions which provide for holding plebiscite for the realization of the right of self-determination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. The foreign minister regretted that the Indian side did not show any flexibility on any aspect of the issue. He, however, informed that New Delhi has formulated specific proposals on various issues, including security of the Line of Control, Siachen, Wullar Barrage, Sir Creek and nuclear nonproliferation. The foreign minister told the Kashmiri leaders that Pakistan informed the Indian side that our response to their specific proposals would be conveyed after these proposals have been received and examined on their merit and in the light of ground realities in Jammu and Kashmir. The president and prime minister of AJK [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] and leaders of various political parties of Kashmir were present in the briefing. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali also spoke to PTV correspondent Habibullah Farooqi on the outcome of the Pakistan-India Talks: [Begin recording] [Farooqi] The secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan has produced no result. The Indian foreign secretary has termed the UN resolutions on Kashmir as irrelevant. What are your comments? [Ali] My comments are that principles do not become irrelevant. It is the principle of the UN Resolution 242 which is timeless, universal and will always remain dynamic. If the UN resolutions according to the Indian foreign secretary are irrelevant, then the Simla Agreement is also irrelevant. That is our position. One significant thing that happened in the talks was that out of four sessions of the talks -- the seventh round of talks, two and half sessions were used just for discussion on the Kashmir problem -- Indian-held Kashmir dispute. This is a significant improvement in the sense that at least the Indians are now admitting that it is a very serious problem. Regarding our position, we have said so very clearly that there cannot be any compromise on our position. We will continue to support the Kashmiri people diplomatically, politically, and we will keep the option of using international forums as and when we think it is necessary for the support of the Kashmiri people. But our main thrust and emphasis is that they must improve the ground situation in Kashmir. They must not indulge in human rights violations. They must lift the siege of the Hazratbal shrine and they must release the leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference. Only if we see some improvement in the ground [situation] in Kashmir, then and then only we will agree to the future agenda of the talks. [end recording]
