His wife works part-time in the same restaurant as a waitress. She also has three other jobs. This is an everyday situation in the United States, as described by one U.S. newspaper. It is certainly not an unusual situation. In round figures one in three employees in the United States is considered a part-time or casual worker with a limited contract of employment. By the year 2000 it is expected that more than half the work force will find itself in this situation. The problem is not part-time work in itself. The problem is that part-time and casual work is part of the trend in the United States where employees' rights are rapidly being undermined. Employers do not need to pay health insurance or pension contributions for those who are employed on these terms. They can fire workers as they please, without any notice. And extremely low wages often go hand in hand with this absence of rights. The United States has created a good 2 million jobs over the past 14 months. But many of these jobs are well below the standard that we in Denmark and Europe associate with proper work. The Americans work with the concept: "the working poor." This refers to the many people in the United States who, it is true, have been given work but at a wage under the poverty line. More than half of the over 30 million Americans who live below the official poverty line are a member of families in which at least one person is employed. President Clinton and Labor Secretary Robert Reich have set themselves the task of changing this situation. Reich stated recently: "The question presents itself whether the advanced economies are condemned to choose between more jobs with lower wages or fewer jobs with good wages. I hope and believe that the answer is no." I agree: The answer is no. There is a third way between more jobs with low wages or fewer jobs with good wages. A way that is founded on creating proper jobs. This way will be strengthened with the Nordic countries and Austria as members of the European Union [EU]. And it will continue to be followed when the countries of East Europe join. In the past few years the EU countries have concerned themselves most with staking out this third way on the basis of the European welfare tradition. The Danish Government has been one of the driving forces in this work. We have to admit that over the past 20 years Europe has been much worse at creating new jobs than both the United States and Japan. But we must not combat unemployment by creating social gulfs that are completely unacceptable in our societies. The discussion of this problem was at the center of the EC summit in Copenhagen last year. It was stressed that much more can be done to promote employment if the countries make a concerted effort to get their economies going. In addition, the EC Commission was asked to draft a white book with the title, "Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment." On some central points the EU's initiative is in line with the Danish Government's policy. The European point of departure is that it is not low wages and poor working conditions that will strengthen our economies in international competition. Under no circumstances can we compete in these areas with the Southeast Asian and East European countries, for example. Our economic future depends first and foremost on whether we are able to make our labor forces good enough, whether we are creative enough in the development of new products, and whether we are in the lead in the use of high technology. The EU is preparing the way for major public investment projects in two areas that are very central to our economic development. One is energy and transport. The other is telecommunications. The Danish Government has to a large extent persuaded the other EU countries to attach great importance to restructuring their taxation systems. Taxes on labor must be reduced, and on the other hand taxes on pollution and resource use must be increased. This makes it easier for companies to employ people, but punishes us all for the ruthless exploitation of natural resources. The EU countries are well aware that there is a need for a drastic increase in investment in education, research, and product development in the field of high technology where Europe is clearly lagging behind both Japan and the United States. An important part of European thinking is the better distribution of work. Here too we in Denmark have been in the vanguard with the visionary leave reform that has been introduced. Even though the EU has backed a number of sensible joint approaches, it is clear that the EU countries are unable to agree on everything. Some nonsocialist governments -- headed by the British Conservatives -- would have liked to have given prominence to other aspects that have more in common with the pre-Clinton United States. They advocate lower unemployment benefits, a reduction in the wages of those with low earnings, and cuts in social benefits, for example. In its white book the EU Commission also mentions these views. But it also issues a warning against repeating the U.S. trend -- a warning that both Jacques Delors and I myself have voiced in the European debate. The white book says, among other things: "In particular, a greater downward wage spread would lead to a significant real-term fall in the lowest wages. This would be impossible without a reduction in unemployment benefit and social insurance arrangements. In combination with an increase in the use of part-time employees it would also, all things being equal, make the present distribution of income more unequal and at worst create a poverty group who cannot live decently on their wages and therefore lead to a form of exclusion that is just as destructive as unemployment." Social democratic and nonsocialist attitudes to unemployment are at odds in Europe, as they are in Denmark. The social democratic parties in Europe have jointly drafted an important initiative for a European employment policy. This initiative, which has the title "Put Europe to Work," is a program for what I have called the third way in the battle against unemployment. Here in Denmark nonsocialist politicians have voiced views that are the same as those coming from conservative forces in Europe. Liberal Party deputy chairman Anders Fogh Rasmussen said recently that the United States is the country that comes closest to his ideal of a liberalistic society. The Conservatives' leader, Hans Engell, has argued in a somewhat toned-down version that we should look at U.S. methods of boosting employment. Attitudes to what should happen to the welfare state in Denmark and Europe are inextricably linked. We will work for the third way in Denmark and in Europe. That is why it is so important to elect a large number of social democrats to the European Parliament.
