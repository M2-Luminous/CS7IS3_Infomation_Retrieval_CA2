FR940106-1-00058 FR940106-1-00011 These tidal marshes provide habitat for a large, highly diverse, and increasingly rare ecological community. The recent ``Status and Trends'' reports published by the SFEP listed 154 wildlife species associated with the brackish marshes surrounding Suisun Bay (Harvey, et al. 1992), including a number of candidates for listing under the ESA. These include the Suisun song sparrow ( Melospiza melodia maxillaris ) and the Suisun ornate shrew ( Sorex ornatus sinuosus ), as well as the plants Suisun slough thistle ( Cirsium hydrophilum var. hydrophilum ), Suisun aster ( Aster chilensis var. lentus ), delta tule pea ( Lathyrus jepsonii ), Mason's lilaeopsis ( Lilaeopsis masonii ), and soft-haired bird's beak ( Cordylanthus mollis ). These rare species are all found exclusively in tidally inundated marsh. As part of the SFEP-sponsored workshops, a comprehensive literature review and intensive field surveys of marsh vegetation were undertaken to document the responses of estuarine marsh communities to changes in the salinity regime (Collins and Foin 1993). The study concluded that salinity levels in the tidal marshes play a major role in the distribution and abundance of plant species. In addition, average tidal marsh salinity levels are related to the position of the 2 ppt isohaline, although local controls on salinity are important in some areas. The study also found that recent increases in salinity caused by a combination of upstream diversions and drought have adversely affected the tidal marsh communities. As salinity has intruded, brackish marsh plants which depend on soils low in salt content (especially the tules Scirpus californicus and S. acutus ) have died back in both the shoreline marshes and in some interior marsh channel margins of the western half of Suisun Bay. These plants have been replaced by plants typically growing in saline soils, especially cordgrass ( Spartina foliosa ). This has been associated with erosion of the marsh margins, significantly reducing the tidal marsh acreage in some areas. In addition, tules in the upper intertidal zone have been replaced by the smaller and more salt tolerant alkali bulrush ( Scirpus robustus ). These changes have significantly affected available habitat for a variety of wildlife that nest and feed in these areas, including the Suisun song sparrow, marsh wren, common yellowthroat, black-crowned night heron, and snowy egret (Collins and Foin 1993; Granholm 1987a; 1987b). The loss of habitat for the Suisun song sparrow is of particular concern, since individuals of this species are found only in the already fragmented marshes bordering Suisun Bay, occupy an established territory for their lifetime, and depend on tall tules for successful reproduction and cover from predators (Marshall 1948). Although there have been no studies of the direct effects of salinity on rarer plant species, these species are likely to have the same salinity requirements as non-rare species residing in the same plant communities. Delta tule pea and Suisun aster are associated with tules along the banks of tidal sloughs (CDFG 1991). Mason's lilaeopsis is also found along tidal banks, associated with the more freshwater marsh species, including tules, and in the shade of riparian shrubs such as willows (CDFG 1991). Suisun thistle and soft-haired bird's beak are found in the few remaining higher elevation tidal marshes. All of these species are limited to marsh areas seasonally inundated with fresh to brackish water, and depend on such conditions to varying degrees. For those brackish marsh plants depending on freshwater conditions, the most critical growth period is February through June. If suitable lowlands were present upstream, increases in the estuary's salinity gradient would allow brackish tidal marsh communities to migrate upstream. However, the floodplains and other lowlands suitable for the evolution of tidal marshes are absent upstream of Suisun Bay (SFEP 1993b). As a result, increases in tidal water salinity may significantly reduce the already severely limited freshwater and brackish marsh habitats, and will threaten the natural diversity of the estuary's wetland communities. Maintaining historical levels of low-salinity habitat in Suisun Marsh is therefore essential to protect Estuarine Habitat, Wildlife Habitat, Rare and Endangered Species, and other uses designated for protection by the State's water quality standards. d. Proposed Criteria (1) Preliminary considerations. This section discusses three issues that affect EPA's proposal: the proper level of protection for designated uses, the basis for choosing the locations for measuring the proposed criteria, and the proper time period for maintaining the proposed criteria. _Level of Protection. One of the key recommendations of the SFEP-sponsored workshops was that environmental goals for the estuary would be most effective if expressed in terms of restoring conditions to those that existed at specific historical periods. If a certain level of ecosystem restoration is selected as a goal, then the relationship between abundance and the location of the 2 ppt isohaline (and the amount of water necessary to achieve that isohaline) can be used as a basis for setting standards that will achieve those goals. (SFEP 1993b).
