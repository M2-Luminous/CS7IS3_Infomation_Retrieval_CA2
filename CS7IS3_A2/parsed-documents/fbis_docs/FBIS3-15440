The edict says: In order to improve a grave situation in the supply of petroleum products to Georgia, to ensure fuel supplies to areas of strategic importance, and to ease budget payments, a tax on petroleum products imported to the Republic of Georgia by legal and physical persons--except the state company Saknavtobprodukti--will be paid temporarily in 1994 in kind and will be fixed at 10 percent of the total amount of the imported products, replacing a customs duty, an excise, a value-added tax, an environmental tax, and a profit tax. The products will be sold by the state company Saknavtobprodukti, taking into consideration branch and regional priorities determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Georgia. Railway, maritime transport, and customs departments of the Republic of Georgia will ensure the delivery of the imported petroleum products to their destination only in accordance with papers issued by the aforementioned company. The republic's Ministry of the Internal Affairs will render assistance to the concern in receiving, moving, and guarding the petroleum products. The edict will take effect on 15 March of the current year. The complete text of the edict will be published in the press.
