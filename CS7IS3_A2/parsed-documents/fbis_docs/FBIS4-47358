Kivshyk under the ``Oil and Gas Geology'' rubric [Abstract] Problems of geophysics are closely related to the extremely urgent problem of increasing oil and gas reserves in Ukraine. The current status of geophysical methods for oil and gas prospecting in Ukraine has been determined to a large degree by the status of geophysical service in Ukraine within the former Soviet Union and the level of geophysics in the latter. As a result, in terms of geophysical instrument building and geophysics technology Ukraine is lagging substantially behind highly developed countries. This becomes clear from the comparison of technical and technological means used in Ukraine and in the West. For instance, equipment for recording seismic information can record information in 48 or 96 channels at a time, whereas equipment used in the West and USA can record information in 960 channels plus. The best computers used in Ukraine for processing geophysical information have an 8 MB RAm, 2-4 GB hard disk and operate at 2 million operations per second, while in the West these parameters are 80-100 MB, 12-16 GB and 100 million operations per second, respectively. The use of personal computers in Ukraine is in its initial stage due to the lack of money for buying them. Oil and gas geophysics in Ukraine is in critical state. Immediate retooling of geophysical operations in Ukraine is mandatory. The author suggests measures aimed at solving this problem.
