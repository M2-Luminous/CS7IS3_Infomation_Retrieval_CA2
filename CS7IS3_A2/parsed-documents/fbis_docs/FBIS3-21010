The A319 is the short version of the A320 and has many common features with the latter and with the stretch version A321, particularly systems and equipment. This makes for many maintenance and operational advantages and hence, economy. The cockpit of the A319 will be identical to that of the A320 and A321. Crews too will need one blanket type qualification to fly any of the three types. At present, AIR INTER flies 33 A320s. The airline has also ordered seven A321s for delivery starting this summer plus 15 wide-body A330s, the first of which was delivered on 30 December and entered service on 17 January on the Paris-Marseille and Paris-Toulouse connections. By February 1995, AIR INTER will receive four more A330s. The A330 also shares a strong family resemblance with the single-aisle versions made by AIRBUS INDUSTRIE. AIR INTER's A319s will be fitted out for 142 single class passengers. To date, AIRBUS INDUSTRIE has booked 802 orders for its single-aisle line (A319/A320/A321).
