Swing discussed the national crisis with members of the Senate. The ambassador reaffirmed his support of the Governors Island agreement and the willingness of the U.S. Government to work toward the restoration of democracy in Haiti. Daly Valet reports: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] The meeting of the U.S. ambassador and the Office of the Senate of the Republic focused on the political crisis the country has experiencied since 30 September 1991. During this meeting, the U.S. diplomat reaffirmed the Clinton administration's support for the Governors Island agreement, an agreement which still remains -- willy-nilly -- the sole valid framework for resolution of the political crisis, according to the U.S. ambassador. Senate Vice President Serge Joseph, who participated in this meeting, says he is very satisfied with the fact that the U.S. ambassador gave formal guarantees that the Clinton administration will continue working toward the return of democracy to Haiti. [Joseph] The ambassador and political [word indistinct] who were with him, as well as we, the members of the Office, are satistified, satisfied [repeats] in the sense that, according to the ambassador, the Governors Island agreement is valid until something that can replace the agreement can be found. But he has formally declared that as long as there is nothing to replace the Governors Island agreement, his government will stick to the agreement. [Valet] During a news conference after the meeting with the U.S. ambassador, Senator Serge Joseph, just back from the United States, gave an explanation about the retirement letter President Aristide sent to General Cedras. Sen. Joseph explained that it was not a letter of dismissal but of retirement, as requested of the president by Gen. Cedras in a letter dated 14 October 1993. [passage omitted] A source close to President Aristide in the Haitian Embassy in Washington offered the same explanation as Sen. Joseph. In a telephone conversation, he told us that it was never a question of dismissing Gen. Cedras. According to our source, President Aristide was simply replying to Gen. Cedras, who had written him on 14 October to request early retirement. [end recording]
