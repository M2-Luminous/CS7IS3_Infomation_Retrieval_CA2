FR941012-2-00010 FR941012-2-00004 [A&hyph;100&hyph;002] Notice of Price Determination; Uranium from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan AGENCY: International Trade Administration, Import Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section IV.C.1. of the antidumping suspension agreements on uranium from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, the Department calculated an observed market price for uranium of $11.13/lb. On the basis of this price, the export quota for uranium pursuant to Section IV.A. of each of the agreements is zero. Exports pursuant to other provisions of the agreements are not affected by this price. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Melissa Skinner, Beth Chalecki, or Yury Beyzarov, Office of Agreements Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street & Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0159, (202) 482&hyph;2312, or (202) 482&hyph;2243 respectively. PRICE CALCULATION: Background Section IV.C.1. of each agreement specifies that the Department will issue the DOC observed market price on October 1, 1994, and use it to determine the quota applicable to imports from the various republics during the period October 1, 1994 to March 31, 1995. Calculation Summary Section IV.C.1. of each agreement specifies how the components of the market price are reached. In order to determine the spot market price, the Department utilized the monthly average of the Uranium Price Information System Spot Price Indicator (UPIS SPI) and the weekly average of the Uranium Exchange Spot Price (Ux Spot). In order to determine the long-term market price, the Department utilized the weighted average long-term price as determined by the Department on the basis of information provided by market participants and a simple average of the UPIS Base Price for the months in which there were new contracts reported. Our letters to market participants provided a contract summary sheet and directions requesting the submitter to report his/her best estimate of the future price of merchandise to be delivered in accordance with the contract delivery schedules (in U.S. dollars per pound U 3 O 8 equivalent). Using the information reported in the proprietary summary sheets, the Department calculated the present value of the prices reported for any future deliveries assuming an annual inflation rate of 2.78 percent, which was derived from a rolling average of the annual GNP Implicit Price Deflator index from the past four years. The Department used the base quantities reported on the summary sheet for the purpose of weight-averaging the prices of the long-term contracts submitted by market participants. We then calculated a simple average of the UPIS Base Price and the long-term price determined by the Department. Weighting The Department used the average spot and long-term volumes of U.S. utility and domestic supplier purchases, as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), to weight the spot and long-term components of the observed price. In this instance, we have used purchase data from the period 1989&hyph;1992, as in the previous determination. During this period, the spot market accounted for 31.39 percent of total purchases, and the long-term market for 68.61 percent. We were not able to include data from the 1993 EIA Uranium Industry Annual because it has been withheld due to its proprietary nature. Calculation Announcement The Department determined, using the methodology and information described above, that the observed market price is $11.13. This reflects an average spot market price of $9.33, weighted at 31.39 percent, and an average long-term contract price of $11.95, weighted at 68.61 percent. Since this price is below the $13.00/lb. minimum expressed in Appendix A of the agreements, there will be no quota under Section IV.A. of the agreements available to any signatory republic for the period October 1, 1994 to March 31, 1995. Comments Consistent with the Department's letters of interpretation dated February 22, 1993, we provided interested parties our preliminary price determination on September 12, 1994. We received no comments. Allowing for additional information received since September 12, we have determined that the observed market price for uranium is $11.13/lb. The Department invites parties to provide pricing information for use in the next price determination. Any such information should be provided for the record and should be submitted by March 5, 1995. Dated: October 4, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25081 Filed 10&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
