Kazarov; UDC 621.396.933:551.594] [Abstract] This paper presents observations of the development of storm activity in the European region of Russia using single-point passive thunderstorm radar. The device has an electric collapsible whip antenna and a magnetic loop antenna, amplifiers, digital recorders for atmospheric phenomena, a small computer, a CAMAC crate, color display, and printer. The range is 300-2000 km. RMS range error is 7-10%, angular error up to 2ï¿½. Phenomena are received in the 5-20 kHz range. Readings are taken 1-3 times per minite. Examples of the recording of sources of thunderstorm discharges are presented on a map of the territory under investigation. Activity can be tracked simultaneously over the entire European region of Russia. The results agree with meteorological data obtained at the same time. The studies experimentally demonstrated the ability to evaluate the current thunderstorm situation and the dynamics of storm development in a territory with a radius of up to 2000 km.
