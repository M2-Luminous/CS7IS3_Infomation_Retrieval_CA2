Today, when -- as a result of military provocation by the Muslims in this region and in the wake of support for this provocation by NATO military air power -- the Serbs have stopped holding back and their tanks have entered Gorazde, the situation has changed abruptly not only in and around Gorazde but in the whole of the former Yugoslavia. It must first be observed that the UN plan for a so-called peaceful settlement in Yugoslavia is finished. The epithet "peaceful" is no longer appropriate to this plan (after the appointment of a specialist in airborne operations, the British General Rose, as commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in this region, and his being given the right to use NATO war planes against the Serbs), nor is the word "settlement," since after the Serbian civilian population was bombarded and a French reconnaissance plane was fired on by the Serbs, we are talking about the outbreak of hostilities between the Armed Forces of the Serbian Republic in Bosnia and NATO. In short, the past week's events in Bosnia have drawn a line under more than three years of attempts by the Western community to resolve the Yugoslav conflict by the methods of diktat (both diplomatic and military). Today, everything is starting practically from zero again. And in this zero situation only two possible scenarios can be perceived. Either NATO goes over to full-scale military operations against the Serbs. Or all methods of diktat are stopped and the West recognizes that the Serbs have an equal status as a party to an agreement and starts negotiations which can really lead to a peaceful settlement of the situation in the Balkans (and for this it will be necessary to repeal UN economic sanctions against the FRY). In either event, it must be recognized today that the United Nations, with its methods of peacefully settling the Yugoslavian crisis, has failed completely as a result of the arrogance of the Western community which decided that after the USSR's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the West could on its own and without Russia's involvement foist a new international order on the world, in which the whole of the rest of the world that is not included in the concept of the "Western community" will carry out the West's instructions.
