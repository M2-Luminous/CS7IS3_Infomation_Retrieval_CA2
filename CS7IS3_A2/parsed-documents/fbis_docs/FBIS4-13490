Killing is killing. Justifying it, as in the case of Shaykh Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi, is worse than the killing itself. The abhorrence of the crime is not lessened by a heated legal debate on diplomatic immunity and how to deal with the crimes committed by diplomats. It saddens the Lebanese that the Iraqi regime, after all the disasters brought about by its policy of internal oppression and its subjection to foreign humiliation, should insist on pursuing its opponents with silencer-equipped guns and bombs from diplomatic bags while allowing foreign inspection committees to raid their presidential palace, besiege the Defense Ministry, humiliate the Iraqi Army every minute, and dictate to the tyrant his pocket money and his movements on land, sea, and air. It is just as sad for Iraq and the Iraqis as it is for Lebanon and the Lebanese (and all Arabs). After all the oppression, coercion, humiliation, starvation, and mass killing of Iraqis at home, death squads are formed to pursue those who could not bear the humiliation of estrangement and went abroad! Has this great people been condemned to mass execution? It is futile to blame Saddam Husayn for what he is doing--yet again, against Lebanon. Surely, his mercy for Lebanon and the Lebanese is not greater than his mercy for Iraq and the Iraqis. What is shocking, however, is that there is no authority to take our complaints or grievances to in hopes that the oppressor will be deterred even morally. Perhaps this is one of the things that encourage him to carry on with his oppression. Hence, the responsibility of the Government of Lebanon to directly protect people living in this country, using its own resources. But this should not be used as an excuse for us not to succor political refugees, those fleeing the oppression of their rulers, or those who seek refuge among us to protect their families and, more importantly, to pursue their dream for change and their right to a homeland.
