FR940810-0-00020 FR940810-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Office of the Secretary 32 CFR Part 77 [DoD Instruction 1332.37] RIN 0790&hyph;AF70 Program to Encourage Public and Community Service Employment AGENCY: Department of Defense (DOD). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense (DoD) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of a proposed rule establishing guidelines for the registration of public and community service organizations and a listing of separating DoD personnel and their spouses to be maintained by the Department of Defense. The purpose of the public and community service organizational registry is to provide an avenue for public and community service organizations to recruit highly skilled and experienced separating DoD personnel and their spouses. The final rule encourages continuing public and community service for separating Military Service members, as well as to implement the temporary early retirement authority as established in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (hereinafter, ``the Act''). This registry will be maintained indefinitely to encourage separating Service members to enter into public and community service job vacancies, such as in education, conservation, environmental protection, law enforcement, and public health care after separation from active duty. This action provides the necessary guidelines to determine how separating Military Service members, DoD civilian personnel leaving the Government, and their spouses register for public and community service employment, which organizations qualify for registration, and procedures qualifying organizations must take to be placed on the registry. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective June 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lt. Col. David F. Witkowski, (703) 695&hyph;1636. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is being issued after publication of a proposed rule on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15673) in 32 CFR Part 77. There were no public comments to the proposed rule. This rule is established in order to describe the organizational responsibilities within DoD for the program to encourage public and community service employment and to state the general policy of DoD with respect to this program. It has been certified that this rule would not be a significant rule. The rule would: (a) Not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a section of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (b) Not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (c) Not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or, (d) Not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. (e) Not become subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because it is not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary effect on grantees administering the proposed rule will be a reduction in administrative costs and other burdens resulting from the simplification and clarification of certain policies and the elimination of policy differences among the federal agencies promulgating this final rule. (f) Impose a reporting requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3250). The Office of Management and Budget approved the reporting requirement and assigned control number 0704&hyph;0324. List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 77 Employment, Military personnel, civilian personnel.
