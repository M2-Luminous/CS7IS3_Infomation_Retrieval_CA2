President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has been talking for more than one hour with a delegation from the private sector, among whom are Peter Lamport and Victor Suarez. It appears the give and take on tax reform--seen by the government as salvation from the financial chaos in which it finds itself--still have a long way to go. In the Room of Mirrors more than 30 union leaders are waiting for the government's last proposal to end the two-and-a-half-month old bureaucratic strike. Via the president's private telephone line, the deputies are requesting a midnight meeting to discuss the implications of this afternoon's attack on Obdulio Chinchilla. The economic difficulties, the confrontation with the public, the new acts of violence, which have added to the air of xenophobia, and the murder of the Constitutional Court president all seem to indicate a slowly simmering plot and an urgent need for a state of emergency. The stew of the crisis is on the verge of boiling over now, and the president has his back against the wall. [Font] It appears someone is bent on forcing the suspension of guarantees. [De Leon] There are many theories on the origin of violence. One of these points to a group which wants to destabilize the government, create anarchy, and force me to decree a state of emergency. These sectors believe a suspension of guarantees would bring benefits, but they do not realize if this is decreed we would utilize the full extent of the law. Our security forces would be ready to operate efficiently. We are already prepared should this occur. [Font] If the government is prepared to take action in a state of emergency, does this mean the decision to implement this state of emergency is imminent? [De Leon] Every president can count on this resource. I do not rule it out. [Font] Why did you decide to postpone the measure? [De Leon] Because it has its disadvantages. Our security forces do not have enough training to act in these circumstances. Meanwhile, the state of emergency would interrupt the legislative election process. In addition, our image would suffer internationally. [Font] Could the UN Verification Commission, which was recently agreed upon with the guerrillas, carry out their duties with suspended guarantees? [De Leon] Probably not. It is possible the liberties granted to the Verification Commission in the agreement with the guerrillas, such as unrestricted access, would be restricted in this case. The subversives could use this as a pretext not to fulfill the agreement. [Font] You only mentioned specifically the guerrillas as one of the sectors that could be interested in putting you up against the wall concerning a state of emergency decree. Who are the others? [De Leon] The sectors that after 30 years of war still have not understood democracy is the best road for the nation. [Font] Are there members of those sectors in the Army? [De Leon] No, not there. Outside the Army it is possible, not inside. [Font] You have given a greater role to the Army than your predecessors in formulating your government policy. [De Leon] No. I have not given a greater role to the military than other governments. To which officers are you referring? [Font] It is said the center of power revolves around the Presidential Staff chief and the G-2 [military intelligence]. [De Leon] Many things are said. It is also said Finance Minister and Presidency Secretary Ana de Molina has all the power, or that Foreign Minister Martiza Ruiz is the superminister. Both are excellent government officials. This is the case of Colonel Otto Perez Molina. He is a leader within the Army, and, of course, he had power because he is near the president. [Font] Is that why he is establishing your government strategies? [De Leon] He does have some degree of participation in defining government policy, but it is limited to certain areas. So much is being said, but a president needs his team. [Font] Why did you appoint Colonel Mario Alfredo Merida, former military intelligence director, as the deputy government minister? [De Leon] I need him to coordinate the security forces. He is a brilliant and very capable officer, and the people are demanding security. [Font] Doesn't that mean the military is gaining greater influence within your government? [De Leon] The Army did not suggest the appointment, nor did they impose him upon me. I asked him to take a job in which he will he extremely useful to me. His experience and the kind of information he handles make him the best possible coordinator I could have for the security forces. Military cooperation is needed now. The Armed Forces and I agree on the need to demilitarize the public security system, but there must still be a transition period from one state to the other. [Font] First, you appointed a completely civilian security team. What made you change your mind? [De Leon] I realized we had made a mistake. We tried cutting off military participation in matters of public security completel but we were unable to do this. I realize this could be seen as regression, but I do not mind. I am sure I will lay the foundations for a professional civilian security force. I avc not given the military more participation than other governments have, as you charged. What I did do was consolidate the Army's institutionality. That, I did manage to do. I feel fully in control now. The current military leaders back the president, and they have a very clear picture about my government's objectives and their commitment to democracy. [Font] Most people believe, however, removing General Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso has also created division within the institution, between those who believed in him and those who follow you. [De Leon] No one questioned my decision to remove Gen. Quilo. One does not question an order in the Armed Forces; one obeys it. Quilo's outburst was an understandable reaction to his discharge. [Font] Many say you are a dubious and undecided president who has let things get out of hand. [De Leon] There are very few who say I am dubious and undecided. When I tour the countryside, even here in the city, people always tell me encouraging things in the street. If the polls say my popularity is slipping, we must remember no one has ever received a country in worse condition than I did. Furthermore, I have not exactly chosen the easy way of solving problems. [Font] You and your government have been criticized for being slow to react to the Constitutionality Court president's death, for example. [De Leon] It is unfair to say the government or the president was late in reacting to the death of Chief Justice Gonzalez. Barely minutes after the incident we put all our resources into motion to investigate the crime and protect his family. I went to the funeral, and almost all the cabinet members were there. [Font] The investigations do not seem to have produced any results. Will international experts be called in to resolve the case? [De Leon] I understand the desperation caused by an unresolved political crime, such as the Epaminonda Gonzalez case, but we do not plan to bring in international experts to conduct investigations. Violence is the country's most difficult problem I have had to face. Certain people have asked me to act stronghandedly, knowing this cannot be done. We must act in accordance with the law. Under current circumstances, with a judicial branch as the one we have and the kind of Congress we have had thus far, what do you expect me to do? I cannot promise I will stop violence, as first I would have to resolve the problems that cause it. After so many years of social injustice, I hope to lay down the foundations for future solutions. [Font] Are you concerned about rumors the U.S. Embassy has reinstated an old plan to evacuate U.S. citizens should there be more violent actions against them? [De Leon] There is a xenophobia in Guatemala that has even reached the U.S. Embassy. The media should help eradicate that xenophobia, which has become another method of destabilization. [Font] On another subject, at the current pace it seems by the end of your presidential term the economic crisis will be worse than now. [De Leon] No. We will straighten out public finances. We will achieve our goals in tax revenues and social investment. For the first time in many years, 28 percent of the budget will be invested in the country. We are working in the country's interior, although you may not see it. [Font] Why have you found it so difficult to implement tax reforms? [De Leon] Who says it has been difficult? Only a short while ago we started evaluating, together with the private sector, the tax reform options recommended by the economic cabinet. [Font] Don't you believe you are making too many concessions to the private sector? [De Leon] Of course not. If for any reason whatsoever I have taken my time in approving the tax reforms it is because I want to take the necessary precautions so as not to affect the people and to ensure those who can afford to pay more taxes. [Font] Will you be the president who sells off state property? [De Leon] I plan to be the president who breaks up monopolies whenever necessary, privatize whenever it is necessary, and sell off state property whenever it serves to benefit consumers and modernize the country. I do not plan to do it just to get rid of any debt but, rather, to reorganize the state. [Font] Are you willing to end monopolies and privatize in exchange for the private sector being willing to pay more taxes? [De Leon] There is no on-going negotiation between the private sector and the government leading to tax reform in exchange for privatization. Decisions related to ending monopolies and privatizing were already included in the government's agenda when I began my administration. If anyone has any doubts, they simply have to check out the documents we published at the time. This process is going to take place openly. [Font] Do you agree with the concept of fiscal crime? [De Leon] I do. I believe certain minimum penalties could ensure more efficiency in the process of tax collection. [Font] Concerning the rapprochement between the executive branch and Congress, can this be interpreted as a political understanding that eases the way to the approval of new laws? [De Leon] No. There is no other agreement between the government and the political parties except that which was signed before the bishops. [Font] Do you feel the people appreciate you? [De Leon] I feel misunderstood by a vast majority of the public. [Font] How do you want to be remembered? [De Leon] I want to be remembered as an honest president who combated corruption and achieved peace. [Font] What assets have you declared? [De Leon] Two homes, my office, my bank accounts, and my wife's Antigua farm and home. The house from which I escaped through the roof on 25 May was rented, but I am going back to live there. [Font] Do you consider yourself a daring president? [De Leon] Yes, but I have my own style. I do not go boasting about it like others. I play chess, and I venture to play on several boards at the same time. [Font] Do you consider yourself as daring in your private time? [De Leon] I can tell you that several days ago I was swimming in the turbulent waters of the Pacific. I like to climb mountains. Nevertheless, I would say in my private life I do not run so many risks. [Font] What dictatorial action tempts you? [De Leon] I would like to resolve the nation's violence. [Font] How did you react to problems as a child? [De Leon] I always faced them. My mother insists I never told lies. [Font] Invalidation of the preliminary hearing against you infers something else. [De Leon] It does not. Invalidation of the preliminary hearing against me is irrelevant. I was surprised by this action and not at all happy the deputies put me in the same boat as the others. Besides, the preliminary hearing against me is based on a ridiculous accusation of human rights violations, given the hike in electricity rates. [Font] Do you fear the coming months? [De Leon] Not at all, the coming months will be difficult but not insurmountable. I am sure, thanks to the measures we are taking, the force of order, the force of a government that is not weak, will be felt. [Font] With an electoral process on the doorsteps, it is easy to assume the violations will be heightened in the coming months. [De Leon] We are at the end of three decades of political and common violence. Following the signing of the agreement with the guerrillas two weeks ago we are very near to securing peace. The road we still have to cover is very thorny. To that, one must add violence, which an electoral process always generates. I am well aware of all of this, but I believe this will be the last breath of violence in Guatemala, but what can I do? The people approved the legislative elections in a referendum.
