De Leon Carpio said: In line with the situation Guatemala is facing, I will not commute the death penalty if it is applied against kidnappers. The appeal for commuting the death sentence is unfair in this case. Kidnapping is one of the most abhorrent crimes and it must not go unpunished. I am ready to present a draft bill to Congress to reform the Penal Code and the law. He added: We are preparing a draft bill that contributes to stopping the wave of kidnappings unleashed in Guatemala -- a bill that would prove to be a high risk element for those who commit this crime. Meanwhile, Jose Gutierrez, president of the Chamber of Industry of Guatemala, stated that the security issue has become a major concern of all Guatemalans, adding that slayings, kidnappings, and assaults have grown to frightful levels. "The destruction of the national infrastructure has surfaced once more; again we are living amid the chaos of insecurity and terrorism, which have harshly struck the Guatemalan family, the economy, and the contry's stability," the industrialist remarked. In his speech, the president of the Republic said the role of his government is focused on laying the foundations for changing our country through appropriate measures that will permit national development. De Leon Carpio stressed the need to share responsibilities, because the future of Guatemala is a duty of all citizens, government, businessmen, union members, cooperative members, and other sectors. The Great National Accord establishes the goal of achieving governability [gobernabilidad] without resorting to force. President de Leon invited the Chamber of Industry to form a delegation to accompany him to Mexico. In Mexico, De Leon will conduct economic talks designed to benefit industry and the population in the wake of NAFTA's going into force in January. Finally, the president explained that he will soon appoint a Guatemalan ammbassador to GATT, because this is of vital importance to the economic and productive development of the country. Industrialists Undertake Path of National Rescue Juan Jose Gutierrez affirmed: We industrialists view President de Leon as a capable and honest man with the sufficient determination and moral capacity to change the course the country is following. We are confident the president is ready to make the necessary decisions and implement the necessary measures, no matter how difficult they may be. Guatemalan industry supports De Leon and is at his side to begin the long path of national rescue -- a task we deem to be the responsibility of all Guatemalans. Gutierrez added: A country can achieve development through a process of industrialization. As Guatemalan businessmen, we clearly understand our role and commitment to Guatemala. Our sector is making long-term plans; it is carrying out large productive investments and capital investments. It generates a significant amount of jobs and has the most skilled workforce in the country. The industrialist added: We sometimes have criticized the government and listed our demands, but we also have made specific proposals to resolve the nation's problems. A macroeconomic policy is necessary to promote productive investments instead of speculative investments, as well as to generate healthy and sustained growth. This will permit us to make up the great amount of the time we have lost. Our economy is tainted and distorted by corruption, the large fiscal deficit, high interest rates, the foreign debt, the concentration of foreign currency, and the subsidizing of the exchange rate. According to Gutierrez, foreign trade requires special and responsible treatment. Trade policies have to be guided to go hand in hand with achieving the highest levels of productivity and competitiveness. As a country we must avoid being run over commercially due to nonreciprocity in our trade relations with other countries, Gutierrez stressed. The country's infrastructure network is very weak, especially in areas such as energy, telecommunications, roads, ports, and airports. These problems compete directly against the country's efficiency, productivity, and development possibilities. The solution, as we have said before, is to do away with the monopoly of these services and allow free competition to make them efficient and profitable, he said. The CIG president said that contraband has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks for national production. Without strong and effective actions against this crime, many industries and businesses have no hope of surviving in the market for much longer. The labor outlook is dismal due to the high rates of unemployment and underemployment, which can only be fought by creating conditions that restore confidence to investors and encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, he concluded. Effort and Commitment, Requirements To Be Guatemalan According to the Commitment 1994 video exhibited during the meeting between the president and the industrialists, "today more than ever, everyone's efforts and commitments are necessary, because if we are going to call ourselves Guatemalans, we must justify this." The documentary highlights the importance of improving Guatemalans' quality of life through an efficient program that directs public investments and expenditures toward the reduction of problems in education, health, and security. It suggests implementing a decentralized and regionalized education program and increasing construction of housing and latrines in poor villages in the area of health to define basic sanitation programs. The economic aspect is dealt with by the documentary in a detailed fashion, stating that Guatemala needs sustained, accelerated economic growth, which is achieved through fiscal, monetary, exchange, and credit policies that encourage real and productive investments, generating health and sustained employment. The documentary stresses the need to repay the public debt in advance in order to eliminate excess circulating currency. The authorities should privatize public utilities, improve tax collection, modernize customs services by decentralizing them in order to eliminate corruption, and rationalize public expenditures. Regarding exchange policies, the documentary says that foreign exchange concentration should be eliminated and that the market should be allowed to set the exchange rates. A foreign trade and long term investment policy must be defined to allow successful entry into the international market. To this avail, specific funds should be assigned within the government's budget which will permit the negotiation of free trade treaties. As for competitiveness, it is necessary to improve the infrastructure. At a Central American level we must promote a 0-percent tariff on raw materials and capital assets. In view of the demands to form trade blocs, it supports the idea of being competitive by guiding the technical training of workers toward greater productivity and efficiency, which means reorganization of the Intecap [Technical Institute for Training and Productivity] is necessary. It also states that breaking up the monopoly of services provided by the Guatemalan Social Security Institute is necessary.
