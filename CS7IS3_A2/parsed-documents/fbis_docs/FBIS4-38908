A bill of the parliamentary foreign affairs commission recommended that Estonia seek compromises with Russia in border, economic and humanitarian issues. Vello Saatpalu, the chairman of the foreign affairs commission and a member of the Social Democratic Party, suggested on behalf of the commission that an Estonian-Russian top level meeting be arranged with the help of mediators, if necessary, to resolve the problems concerning the border and the Tartu Peace Treaty. In his words, Estonia should also consider placing the Estonian-Russian border issue under a moratorium. Foreign Minister Juri Luik in his report assured that Estonia stands firm that Russian troops must be unconditionally withdrawn from Estonia by Aug. 31, 1994. Russia has so far refused to set the final pullout deadline and keeps linking it to the demand that more than 10,000 retired military be allowed to remain in Estonia. Luik maintained that the Russian military retirees' issue can be solved only in accordance with Estonian legislation. What makes finding a solution more difficult is that Russia hasn't presented a list of its military pensioners in Estonia, striving to solve the problem by the "pig-in-a-poke" method, the foreign minister noted. He said the Russian Embassy claims there are 10,500 Russian military pensioners in Estonia, while Tallinn has information their number amounts to 11,500. Commenting on the dismantling of the nuclear reactors in Paldiski, Luik said the operation lags behind the planned schedule. He said an international monitoring group of representatives from the Council of the Baltic Sea States and the United States was set up in May, and that the group insists on prompt removal of the nuclear fuel rods from Estonia. Luik said the linkage of nuclear reactor removal to other issues is internationally totally unacceptable. Touching on the Estonian-Russian border dispute, the foreign minister said the key issue is Russia's unwillingness to recognize the 1920 Tarty Peace Treaty. It is extremely regrettable that Russia didn't agree to discuss the issue in the context of the European Stability Pact, known as the Balladur Plan, Luik said. Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn noted that the situation in Russia is at present considerably more stable than over the last few years. In his words, the power in Russia is more or less centered in President Boris Yeltsin's hands and the Western states have less leverage in influencing Russia's decisions. The Estonian ambassador, however, predicted trouble for the autumn in Russia. He said the problems still on the agenda in Estonian-Russian relations should be resolved within the next two or three months. The legislature suspended the discussion of Estonian-Russian relations until September. Tiit Sinissaar, the chairman of the Pro Patria faction in parliament, said the faction moved to postpone the discussion because the purpose of the bill was putting Estonian-Russian relations on the parliament's agenda and now the discussion can be resumed after the summer recess. Endel Lippmaa, a member of the Assembly Party council, told reporters today that his party was against a provision of the bill stipulating that "solutions to problems of Estonian-Russian relations should be sought in compromises in border, economic and humanitarian issues." In Lippmaa's words, "it sounded as if Estonia were willing to make any concessions (to Russia)." Assembly Party members didn't support adoption of the bill.
