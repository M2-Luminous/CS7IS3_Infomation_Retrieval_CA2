FR940907-0-00031 FR940907-0-00015 Areas that are designated nonattainment, that are classified as moderate or above, and that were not previously required to adopt RACT rules for sources covered by the Group III CTGs, are required to adopt such rules under section 182(b)(2) of the amended Act. 5 Section 182(b)(2) requires that these areas adopt RACT rules for: (1) Each category of VOC sources in the area covered by a CTG document issued by the Administrator between the date of enactment of the 1990 Amendments and the date of attainment, by a date specified by the Administrator; (2) all VOC sources in the area covered by any CTG issued before the date of enactment; and (3) all other major stationary sources of VOCs that are located in the area, by November 15, 1992. The requirements of section 182(b)(2) are also referred to as ``catch-up'' requirements. For these areas, RACT rules for the Group III CTGs are due on November 15, 1992. 5 This requirement would apply to the remainder of the Detroit nonattainment area as well as the Grand Rapids (Kent and Ottawa Counties), and Muskegon (Muskegon County) areas which are all designated as nonattainment and classified as moderate. On April 28, 1989 MDNR submitted final regulations to satisfy outstanding commitments in its 1982 ozone SIP for southeast Michigan (Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties). The regulations submitted addressed RACT III categories for fugitive VOC leaks from synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industries (SOCMI) and natural gas plants, Rules 628 and 629, as well as non-CTG categories for paint and resin manufacturing and coating of auto, truck, and business machine parts. These are rules 630, 631, and 632, respectively. At the time MDNR submitted these rules, EPA only required adoption of rules for Ract III categories in extension areas. However, MDNR chose to expand the applicability of these rules to all of the counties listed in EPA's SIP-Call, which include the Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Muskegon areas. This submittal, therefore, addressed requirements of EPA's SIP-Call, section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act (for Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb Counties), and section 182(b)(2) of the Act (for Livingston, Monroe, St. Clair, Washtenaw, Kent, Ottawa, and Muskegon Counties). On December 9, 1993 EPA disapproved two of the five RACT III category rules (58 FR 40759). The rules disapproved were those that covered VOC leaks from synthetic organic chemical and polymer manufacturing plants (Rule 628) and natural gas processing plants (Rule 629). On June 12, 1993 MDNR submitted final regulations to satisfy the section 182(a)(2)(A) fix-up requirements of the Act. Included in these regulations were changes meant to address deficiencies listed in EPA's May 26, 1988 SIP call. Since MDNR chose to expand the coverage of these regulations to all of the 10 ozone nonattainment counties classified as moderate (Michigan has no ozone nonattainment classifications above moderate), this submittal also addressed requirements under section 182(b)(2). EPA found this submittal to be complete in a letter dated June 28, 1993 from Valdas Adamkus, EPA's Region 5 Administrator, to Roland Harmes, Director of MDNR. This letter stopped a sanctions process which was initiated on October 22, 1991 for failure to submit a SIP revision to fulfill the fix-up requirements. Under a cover letter dated November 15, 1993 MDNR submitted final regulations to satisfy the remaining deficiencies not addressed in the June 12, 1993 submittal, to correct deficiencies cited in the December 9, 1993 disapproval of Rules 628 and 629, and to satisfy the catch-up requirements of section 182(b)(2) of the Act. A letter dated April 18, 1994 from Valdas Adamkus to Roland Harmes found the November 15, 1993 submittal complete for the Detroit_Ann Arbor area and halted the sanctions process which was started on January 15, 1993 for a failure to submit these regulations. The clock for the Muskegon and Grand Rapids areas continued to run because of an outstanding item which was not submitted for the western portion of the State. A finding of completeness was made in a July 14, 1994 letter from Valdas Adamkus to Roland Harmes for the Grand Rapids and Muskegon areas. This finding was in response to the submittal of a non-CTG SIP submittal made for the western portion of the State and halted the last of the sanction clocks that were started on January 15, 1993 for the State of Michigan. This document proposes approval of the final regulations submitted by MDNR on June 12, 1993 and November 15, 1993 for incorporation into Michigan's ozone SIP. II. EPA's Evaluation and Proposed Action In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the Act and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the Act and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for this action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 3. Among these provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for existing major stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. Under the amended Act, Congress ratified EPA's use of CTG documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A).
