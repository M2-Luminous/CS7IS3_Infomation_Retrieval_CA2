The great leader President Kim Il-song said: "Smashing every form of challenge and obstructive manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries and defending our socialism and adding lustre to it are an honourable task which is raised before our party and people today." Owing to the imperialists' political and military pressure and economic blockade to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the bastion of socialism, an acute situation has been prevailed in Korea this year. The resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint nuclear war exercises by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique created a touch-and-go danger which may lead to a war anytime on the Korean peninsula. At that moment, Comrade Kim Chong-il, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, issued an order to the whole country, the entire people and all the army to enter a semi-war state from March 9 and aroused all the people and people's army in the noble struggle for defending Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses. When the imperialists and some officials of the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency under their baton unjustly tried to force a "special inspection" on the DPRK under the pretext of its fictitious "nuclear arms development," he saw to it that the DPRK declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to safeguard the dignity of the Republic and the security of its people with honor. Comrade Kim Chong-il who turns adversity into favorable circumstances and brings about only victory with superb strategy and penetration was elected chairman of the national defence commission of the DPRK at the fifth session of the ninth Supreme People's Assembly by the unanimous will of the Korean people and the People's Army soldiers. This year, singlehearted unity of the Korean people around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has been cemented remarkably. A military parade and a one million-strong mass demonstration were held and an evening performance "we won victory" took place in the capital city of Pyongyang on July 27, the 40th anniversary of the victory of the Korean people in the fatherland liberation war, in the presence of the two brilliant commanders, President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il. They were a grand national festival that powerfully demonstrated the might of the single hearted unity of the Korean people who had overcome rigorous trials and the advantages and vitality of Korean-style socialism. Voices of faith in the invincible socialism of Korean style as well as the immortal song of praise "no motherland without you" rang out of the eighth congress of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea, the national conference of war veterans, the meeting of commanding officers and political commissars of the Korean People's Army, the national meeting of frontrankers in beautiful communist traits and other meetings and functions held this year. All the voters cast their ballots for the candidates of deputies to the provincial (municipal) people's assemblies at the elections held on November 21, demonstrating again their deep trust in the people's power and the invincible might of the Korean people united in one mind around the party and the leader. Significant achievements have been registered in socialist economic construction, too. It was noted at the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea held on December 8 that the national industrial output increased 50 percent in the period of the third seven-year plan (1987-1993) under the grim situation which rapidly changed owing to the worldwide political fluctuation. The workers of the coal, power and metal industries, in hearty response to the New Year address of the great leader which defined those industries as the main points of socialist economic construction, have won big successes by increasing the production capacity and updating the production processes. Many light industrial factories have been built in different parts of the country and the existing ones modernized, with the result that a new turn has been effected in the production of consumer goods. Bumper harvests of rice, maize, potatoes and fruits were reported from highlands in the northern part of the country, not to speak of Yonbaek, Chaeryong, Yoldusamcholli and other plains in the west coastal areas. 30,000 flats were built in Pyongyang and many dwelling houses in Hamhung, Wonsan, Sinuiju, Chongjin and other local cities and in farm villages and coal and ore miners' settlements. This year, the tomb of Tangun in Kangdong County was unearthed to prove that Tangun was a real historical person and the Korean nation is a homogeneous nation with Pyongyang as its cradle and with a 5,000 years long history. This is another signal event that added shine to the history of the Korean nation.
