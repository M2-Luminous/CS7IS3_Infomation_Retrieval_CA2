FR940413-2-00065 FR940413-2-00034 [DA 94&hyph;305] Private Radio Bureau Seeks Comments on Daniel R. Goodman's, and Robert Chan's Requests for Rule Waivers To Extend the Construction and Loading Deadlines Applicable to Certain Conventional SMR Licenses April 6, 1994. Daniel R. Goodman, Court-appointed Receiver (Receiver) for Metropolitan Communications Corp., Nationwide Digital Data Corp., Columbia Communications Services Corp., and Stephens Sinclair Ltd., seeks waiver of the Commission's Rules on behalf of approximately 4000 conventional-SMR licensees (``Consumers'') that were allegedly defrauded by these Receivership companies. Dr. Robert Chan seeks similar relief for the five conventional SMR licenses he acquired via two of the Receivership companies. The Receiver requests waiver of 47 CFR 90.633 to extend the eight-month construction and operation deadline applicable to the licenses held by the Consumers. The Consumers obtained their licenses via the Receivership companies' offerings and sales of investments in SMR licenses, applications, and filing services. The Receiver pleads that, according to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) Complaint filed in U.S. District Court on January 11, 1994, the Receivership companies allegedly defrauded and mislead the Consumers as to the FCC's Rules. As a result, the Consumers obtained approximately 4000 conventional SMR licenses, which are now on the verge of cancelling automatically because the stations will not be constructed within eight months from the grant date, as required by ยง90.633. The Consumers paid $7000 for each license they obtained via the Receivership companies and, according to the Receiver, could lose an aggregate sum of approximately $28 million if these licenses cancel. If the Commission grants these licensees a new eight-month period to construct, operate, and load their stations, the Receiver plans to facilitate transactions whereby stations first would be constructed and managed by existing SMR operators and then assigned. Each individual licensee may decide whether to enter any transaction presented by the Receiver. Noting the FTC actions against the Receivership companies, Dr. Chan states that the Receivership companies he dealt with do not have the capability to construct stations in time for him to meet ยง90.633. Dr. Chan therefore requests a one-year extension for each of his five licenses, stating that he has now taken over all of the business and engineering activities for his stations in an attempt to facilitate construction and operation. The Receiver tendered a $105 filing fee; Dr. Chan did not tender a filing fee. By requesting public comments on the instant requests, we clarify that the Commission is not ruling on the adequacy of the filing fees tendered. The Private Radio Bureau solicits comments on all aspects of these two proposals. Comments should be filed on or before May 13, 1994. Reply comments should be filed on or before May 27, 1994.
