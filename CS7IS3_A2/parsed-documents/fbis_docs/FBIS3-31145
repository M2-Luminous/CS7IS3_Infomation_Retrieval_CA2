The vice-chairman of the party, Mr. Servet Pellumbi said that the country is going over a political crisis and presented the alternative of the Socialist Party for the ruling of the country. He presented once more the request of this party for premature elections in Autumn, this year. Although he admitted some of the economic achievements such as the creation of the legislation for the market economy, the creation of a new class of businessmen, stopping of inflation, Mr. Pellumbi accused the Democratic Party "for causing the tense political situation in the country, for non-allowance of different alternatives, and for violation of the human rights and freedoms," underlining the arrest of the leader of the Socialist Party, Mr. Fatos Nano. The Socialist Party, stressed the report held in conference, asked for the approval of the constitution and for the functioning of the round table of the parties. "The Socialist Party is for a unique national strategy and for a long-term plan in carrying out our national question," stressed the report. It asked the democratic state to give to the market social and human dimensions. The Socialist Party declared itself against the privatization of some strategic sectors of the economy, against the taxes assessed on the farmers this year as well as against the dispersion of the agricultural enterprises. Mr. Pellumbi appreciated the steps undertaken in order to pass the isolation of Albania and supported the development of the process of the international relations. He condemned the unprecedent violence of the Serbians in Bosnia and expressed his support for the Albanian brothers in Kosova, who are under the wild terror of Serbia. Mr. Pellumbi expressed also in favour of the Albania's participation in the initiative "Partnership For Peace" and in favour of the strengthening of the friendly relations with neighbours and other countries in Europe and world. A message of greetings sent by the chairman of the party, Mr. Fatos Nano, was read in the conference. Mr. Nano is in prison under the charge of abuse of duty and falsification of the official documents in 1991 when he was the premier of Albania.
