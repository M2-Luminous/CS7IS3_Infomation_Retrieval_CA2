He told Belgrade radio's "An Argument More" program that humanitarian questions, the reestablishing of telephone and traffic links, payment of pensions, and other similar questions would be the primary tasks for the bureaus in Zagreb and Belgrade. Knezevic said it was necessary to raise the relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia to a higher level, which would imply opening of consular missions. Commenting on the talks scheduled for tomorrow at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb between representatives of the republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia, Knezevic said it was very positive that the Serb side had agreed to the talks and was leaving with a clear aim to end combat activities as soon as possible. The head of the Yugoslav bureau in Zagreb believes that very important issues, such as the opening of traffic and telephone links between Croatia and Yugoslavia, were impossible to resolve without the consent of the republic of Serb Krajina, since they cross its territory. The solution for these problems, Knezevic stressed, can be found only in direct negotiations between Zagreb and Knin. A solution for Serb-Croat relations should be sought in the same context, he believes. Slobodan Jarcevic, the foreign minister of the republic of Serb Krajina, told the same program that at the talks tomorrow with Croatia in Zagreb, the Serb side would demand from the other side first of all to sign a peace agreement, but not to the detriment of the republic of Serb Krajina. A withdrawal of the Croatian army and police from the occupied Serb territories will be demanded, Jarcevic said. He recalled that the United Nations had guaranteed territorial delimitation between the two ethnic communities on this territory in 1991. "If the world then provided guarantees for the borders it should now preserve them," Jarcevic said. Asked if he feared the trip to Zagreb, Jarcevic said: "We do not fear travelling to any foreign country, not even to Croatia."
