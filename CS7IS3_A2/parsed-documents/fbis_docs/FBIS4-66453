To Install Exhaust Pipe to Reduce NO, HC for Export [.sub]x[/] 94FE0329J Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 Nov 93 p 13 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0329J Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Article with no byline] [Text] In 1995, Toyota Motor Corp. (Toyota) (president: Mr. Tatsuro Toyoda) will install a new, double-structured exhaust pipe on each and every export vehicle and nonexport vehicle made at Toyota's overseas plants in Europe and the United States in order to cope with the trend of stiffer exhaust gas regulations. The new exhaust pipe is said to be capable of removing hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NO[.sub]x[/]) from the exhaust more efficiently than before. Accordingly, Futaba Industries Co., Ltd. (Futaba; president: Mr. Masahiko Umemura), a muffler maker in the family of Toyota companies, and Sango Co., Ltd. (Sango) (Miyoshi-cho, Nishikamo-gun, Aichi Prefecture; president: Mr. Kozo Tsunekawa) are getting ready to produce the exhaust pipe. An exhaust pipe, previously of single-wall construction, is a pipe that connects the exhaust manifold and the catalytic converter. Toyota developed the double-wall exhaust pipe to improve thermal efficiency by minimizing heat radiation with an air layer between the inner and outer pipes and by reducing heat loss with the thinner inner pipe wall. Thus, the temperature of the catalyst can be raised faster immediately after the start of an engine, when more harmful substances are emitted, and the high temperature is maintained to increase the efficiency of removing HC and NO[.sub]x[/]. Environmental regulations concerning automobile exhaust are constantly becoming tighter in Europe and the United States; in particular, the exhaust gas regulations in the state of California, which are considered the most stringent in the world, will mandate the sale of low-emission vehicles around 1997. Thus, Toyota plans to start installing the new exhaust pipes to be manufactured by Futaba on the 1995 export car, ES300 (Japanese name: Windham). At the same time, Sango will license its production technology to (Arvin)-Sango Corp., the joint venture company in the United States, where the new exhaust pipes will be manufactured for installation on the new model, Avalon, to be produced at TMM, Toyota's U.S. plant in Kentucky. It is also planned that Futaba will license its technology to Walker Corp. (U.S.) for the production of the new exhaust pipes in the United States. In the fall of 1995, exhaust gas regulations for passenger cars will be tightened in Europe. Thus, the new exhaust pipe will be installed on the Carina (Japanese name: Corona), manufactured in the U.K., and on Japanese-made cars to be exported to Europe. Toyota is likely to expand the adoption of the new exhaust pipe to domestic cars to cope with a similar trend in Japan, after assessing the development in Europe and the United States.
