FR940819-0-00103 FR940819-0-00019 FAA Response The FAA agrees that the greatest costs will be incurred by air carriers that schedule flight attendants for the longest duty periods. However, the commenter does not appear to provide any information on the air carrier's ability to augment existing crews. The FAA points out that costs could be minimized by using crew argumentation as a means of compliance. In addition, time spent in deadhead transportation is not considered part of a duty period; therefore, an operator is not required to provide a rest period for flight attendants following time spent in deadhead transportation. Overall Costs ATA stated that the FAA has understated costs considerably. This commenter stated that the annual cost of complying with the proposed regulation would be at least $8.0 million. This cost would include programming expenses, additional personnel costs, costs associated with extended layovers, and costs associated with reserve scheduling (assuming that carrier reserve scheduling practices are not modified). Assuming a discount rate of 7.0 percent and an inflation rate of 3.0 percent, the 15-year present value cost for the association's members would be approximately $88.9 million. FAA Response The survey of ATA members indicates that the annual cost would be at least $8.0 million. ATA stated that added annual personnel costs for air carrier operators would be $4.0 million, additional meal/hotel expenses would be $1.5 million, and additional reserve staffing would be $2.5 million. Finally, ATA stated that carriers can expect to incur a one-time expense of between $2.0 million and $3.0 million for computer system program modifications. After contracting ATA twice after the comment period closed to obtain clarifying information, the FAA concluded that their estimate could not be used in its entirety because information such as the number of affected carriers, wage rates, additional employees needed, or hours worked was not provided. In addition, ATA did not provide information on the cost of augmenting the existing crew. The FAA permits longer duty periods with the use of augmented crews. FAA data indicates that many flights are staffed with more than the minimum flight attendant crew complement; therefore, little or no additional cost would be incurred to meet the crew argumentation requirements. ATA also stated that the 15-year present value cost for its members would be $88.9 million. This estimate assumed a discount rate of 7.0 percent and an inflation rate of 3.0 percent. The basis for the commenter's estimate of the annual cost ($8.0 million) was not detailed enough for the FAA to use it or the 15-year estimate derived from it. The FAA has nevertheless attempted to develop an industry cost estimate by recalculating the ATA estimate to exclude the ATA inflation factor and by accounting for the fact that ATA members only represent a portion of the industry that would be affected. As shown in the Regulatory Evaluation, that figure would be $78.8 million. However, the original information provided could not be fully substantiated, which suggests that the ATA estimate may not be representative of the total industry.
