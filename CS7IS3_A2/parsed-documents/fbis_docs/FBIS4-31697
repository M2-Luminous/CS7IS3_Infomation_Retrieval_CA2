[Klaus] I really do not have that feeling. The government policy statement is a document created by 19 government members -- some of whom did not know each other before -- in the span of several hours. In the span of four years of the existence of this government, a number of ideas are being finalized, completed, pushed from the left to the right, up and down. On one hand, I take the document seriously, but on the other, I do not believe that each of its conjunctions or prepositions has a constant weight. It is possible to say in this global evaluation that the government program is being fulfilled. [Martinkova] The proposal of the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] Executive Council regarding districts as the fundamental pillars of self-administration has surprised not only the coalition partners, but also many ODS representatives. What made the Executive Council present a proposal about which they could anticipate that it would run up against such resistance? [Klaus] First, I would like to say that this is not a new opinion. We voted on the proposal in the Executive Council six months ago and it won slightly less than 50 percent of supporters at that time. Now it has acquired a substantial support of three-quarters of the Executive Council's members. The ODS is a party that constantly bases its policy on the citizen. It fears all institutions that are established over the citizen, be it on small or large territory. That is why we try to minimize such institutions. If there is something we are unable to do at present, then it is to suppress completely all Parkinson's sprouts of bureaucracy that are running wild in our country. That is one of the things that I am tremendously worried about. We are building on the fact that the citizen is the basic and absolute value. All the institutions over him are derived from the citizen, and must be established according to their purpose, efficiency, and also according to whether people want them or not. In that sense, it seems to us that the minimal intervention in the existing regional arrangement would be to utilize the districts that have existed for 35 years and have, due to that fact, certain authenticity, no matter how much people disliked them when they were established in 1960. Adding an elected component to the district bodies could be the least painful and most inexpensive way in the process of forming the regions. That is simply it. [Martinkova] Serious considerations have appeared recently as to whether the death penalty should be reinstated. Did you give it a thought? [Klaus] I personally do not believe it is necessary. Being a politician, however, it is my task to think about matters that I have no desire to ponder. I try to react sensitively to public opinion. I have noticed in that respect a noticeable shift in public opinion. I am a bit surprised by it; nevertheless, I respect it. In the first post-November years, the standard humanitarian reaction to the death penalty question was the answer that the death penalty was an extreme solution, which man should not adopt. People pointed to errors and mistakes, etc. That opinion met with unequivocal response and applause in the first post-November years. I have noticed that it has changed over the past six months. My unchanging arguments do not have unequivocal support any longer. There are an increasing number of voices in favor of the death penalty. I pay great attention to the situation, but it is the only reaction to this problem I can describe at the moment.
