In his weekly radio address, Clinton said the government will encourage weapons frisks in gang-infested public housing to prevent crime if tenants agree. "We'll encourage more weapons frisks of suspicious persons, and we'll ask associations to put clauses in their leases allowing searches when crime conditions make it necessary," he said. He said residents will be empowered to organize tenant patrols to ride elevators and to look after the public spaces in high-rise public housing units. Clinton also announced a federal allocation of some 30 million dollars to crack down on the growing crime wave in public housing, to help residents to "take back their homes." He said the government will provide more programs such as midnight basketball leagues "to help our young people say no to gangs and guns and drugs."
