As we learned from the FRY Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this is a reciprocal measure of the Yugoslav side, which comes in response to the recent cancellation by the Slovak Government of the bilateral treaty on the abolition of visas. The decision by the government in Bratislava, made about 20 days ago, did not specify when the new visa regime would be introduced. However, it transpires from information we obtained at the FRY Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Yugoslavs who travel to Slovakia after 17 May will have to furnish their travel documents with a Slovak visa. The explanation granted to the PRAVDA correspondent at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Belgrade states that the Slovak Government's decision "is an expression of its assessment and needs, the causes and motives of which we do not wish to analyze. However, for objective reasons, this act of the Slovak side definitely does not contribute to the bilateral wish to further expand relations between the two countries' citizens." [passage omitted]
