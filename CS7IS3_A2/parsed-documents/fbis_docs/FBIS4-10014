"But we will not go there with a tape measure to complain about the size of the offices or to choose secretaries," diplomat Sergio Danese, 39, warned. Danese will be responsible for contacts with the press. According to him, integration with former Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's team is so complete that it has even been established that Ambassadors Julio Cesar Gomes dos Santos, adviser, and Synesio Sampaio Goes, chief of staff, will continue at the Finance Ministry for an indefinite period of transition time. Sergio Amaral -- Rubens Ricupero refers to Second Echelon Minister Sergio Silva do Amaral, 49, as "my alter ego." A mountain bike addict, Amaral practices this sport near his summer home at Pirenopolis (Goias State), 170 km from Brasilia. Sao Paulo-born Amaral will be promoted to ambassador before the end of the year. He was a Planning Secretariat adviser while Deputy Delfim Netto (Progressive Renewal Party-Sao Paulo) was finance minister and a foreign debt negotiator during Mailson da Nobrega's days at the head of the Finance Ministry. He has a PhD in political sciences from the Sorbonne. He advised Rubens Ricupero while the latter was in Geneva negotiating with GATT and while Ricupero was ambassador in Washington. Currently, he is executive secretary at the Environment Ministry. He will implement the economic program together with the economic team. Marcos Galvao -- Marcos Bezerra Abbot Galvao, 35, defines himself as a New York Potiguar [indigenous group from Rio Grande do Norte]. He is an ambassador's son, is making fast progress in his diplomatic career, and is appreciated by his colleagues. Galvao used to draft former President Fernando Collor's speeches, and is Ricupero's only adviser not born in Sao Paulo. Galvao was a student in Ricupero's first class; he was the top student in his course at the Rio Branco diplomatic school. He acted as his professor's adviser from 1980-82, but only met him again at the Environment Ministry. He will be in charge of writing Ricupero's speeches. Estanislau Amaral -- Business Administrator Jose Estanislau do Amaral Souza Neto graduated from Getulio Vargas Foundation and was top student at the Rio Branco diplomatic school. He left Itamaraty for one year to help his father-in-law manage a Sao Paulo group working in the field of sugar and fuel alcohol. Of the five advisers he knows most about economics, after Sergio Amaral. While in Brasilia he also became an expert in human rights. He will help write Ricupero's speeches and advise him on political matters. Sergio Danese -- Ricupero's future public relations officer is a writer. Sergio Franca Danese, 39, has a masters degree in Ibero-American literature from the University of Mexico. He is the author of "The True Story of the Dodo Bird," a bestseller among Ricupero's advisers in its second edition from the Brasiliense publishing firm. He was also a top student at the Rio Branco diplomatic school. Danese has worked with Ricupero for longer than any of the other advisers: from 1981-87. In addition to literature, Danese likes to operate airplanes, although he does not have a pilot's license. Debora Barenboim -- Debora Vainer Barenboim, 34, lived in Paris between the ages of 18 to 29, and only returned to Brazil to study at the Rio Branco Institute. During the diplomatic course she met Danese, to whom she has been married for 14 years. She is a pianist, has worked in the Foreign Ministry's economic area, and served at two diplomatic posts abroad with Danese. She will be one of Ricupero's spokespersons before Congress. [Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese publishes on 4 April a 200-word unattributed article on page 16 noting that Sergio Amaral "will be the Finance Ministry's chief of staff."]
