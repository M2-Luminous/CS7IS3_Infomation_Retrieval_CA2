One of the additions, which has been tentatively named the "Economic Cooperation and Environment Bureau," will handle talks with developing countries. The "Economic Organizations Bureau" will take up multilateral negotiations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), World Trade Organization (WTO), Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and U.N. Development Program (UNDP). The current International Trade Bureau will be responsible for bilateral trade negotiations with added functions in aviation and maritime talks, officials said. The changes will be proposed to President Kim Yong-sam in the ministry's New Year report Jan. 21. The ministry is considering hiring Koreans with foreign citizenship for the new bureaus to promote South Korean participation in multilateral trade organizations, according to the officials. This plan calls for hiring 50 to 100 people of Korean ancestry with degrees in economics and professional backgrounds in related fields. They will be placed at the foreign and other ministries.
