FBIS4-4679 "dreas065__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan New Communications Technology Development Planned New Communications Technology Development Planned OW0404163894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0404163894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] NEC Corporation, Hitachi Ltd., and Fujitsu Ltd. are to begin developing technology for next-generation information networks, which can send data to distant areas at superhigh-speed, in cooperation with an auxiliary organization, which falls under the jurisdiction of both the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT]. They recently inaugurated a research and development company to develop combined technology for computers and communications and to build up by fiscal 1998 an information transmitting system needed for establishing the basis of future information communications. It is expected that Japan will promote a program to establish large-scale information networks similar to the "information superhighway" planned in the United States. Thus, their collaboration will set a concrete example of cooperation between the private sector and the government for the program. The newly established company is named "Superhigh-Speed Network and Computer Technology Research Institute" [SNCTRI]. The company, whose head office is in Minato-ku, Tokyo, is capitalized at 30 million yen, 70 percent of which has been invested by Japan Key Technology Center. The center, which is an auxiliary organization under the jurisdiction of both MITI and the MPT, is to give financial support to electronic communications and machine industries. NEC, Hitachi, and Fujitsu have invested 10 percent each. NEC Managing Director Seijiro Yokoyama serves as the president of the new company. The SNCTRI, which has been given five years to develop new technology, will increase its capital to 3.5 billion yen by fiscal 1998, the final year for the development. Currently, a distributed processing system that uses personal computers and work stations to send data is popular in computer communications. However, the system has a problem--the greater the distance between two communicating spots, the slower the data transmission. The SNCTRI is to develop combined technology for computers and communications networks that makes it possible to send data to distant areas at a superhigh-speed. It will also establish protocol (communications procedures) and develop technology for real time image transmission to make it possible to send multimedia data composed of images, voice, and text at a high speed. In fiscal 1998, it plans to develop technology for transmitting 2.4 gigabytes (1 gigabyte is 10 million bits) of data per second.
