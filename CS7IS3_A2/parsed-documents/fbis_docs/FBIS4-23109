FBIS TRENDS-15JUN94-CUBA Havana Cracks Down on Flagrant Black Marketeers Havana Cracks Down on Flagrant Black Marketeers SUMMARY In an apparent attempt to keep petty theft at state enterprises from mushrooming into large scale criminal activity, the Castro regime has launched a crackdown on high-living profiteers who are selling large quantities of stolen state merchandise on the black market. At the same time, Havana has hinted also concerned that these newly affluent black marketeers could emerge as an economic elite that would pose a political danger to the regime. END SUMMARY The "nationwide" crackdown on "illegal enrichment"--authorized in the recently-enacted "decree-law number 149"--involves raids against suspected black market profiteers and permanent confiscation of "goods and [monetary] assets" subsequently determined by the state to have been obtained directly or indirectly through "theft, speculation, embezzlement, [or] black market activities" (Radio Rebelde Network, 5 May). Havana does not appear to be targeting the average Cuban who buys and sells on the black market out of necessity, but rather individuals whose involvement in the black market has led to ostentatious affluence. Thus, while Radio Rebelde on 6 June noted that the "main goal" of the crackdown is "not" to make each citizen "prove the legitimate origins" of goods in his possession, it defined the goal the next day as rooting out those individuals "who enjoy a lifestyle that exceeds their [usual] income." Media reporting on raids carried out thus far reinforce this message. For example, the target of one raid was a workshop "manager" whose official salary was 167 pesos a month, but who had four boats and a truck in his possession. Another raid was directed at a "citizen" possessing four trucks, two cars, a rice mill, a welding workshop, six houses and over 35,000 pesos in cash (Radio Rebelde, 7 June). (See Note 1) (Note 1) As of 6 June, security forces had conducted raids against 222 presumed profiteers found in possession of "180 cars, 83 motorbikes, 48 trucks, 24 tractors, 108 houses and over 3.5 million pesos" (Radio Rebelde, 6 June). Radio Rebelde on 27 May also reported the seizure of a total of 500 farm animals from a group of 28 Havana residents. Setting the Stage Havana's campaign against profiteers follows frequent media discussion in recent months of Cuba's longtime problem with theft of state supplies which from all appearances has become more serious as black market activity has expanded. (See Box 1) Indicating that virtually all Cubans now rely on the black market to some degree to meet their needs for food, journalists on the Radio Rebelde's 23 March "Straight-Talk" program noted that, if "the truth be told," Cubans "frequently have no choice but to access" the black market because "as everyone knows, the official market does not meet all the basic needs of the Cuban family nowadays." (See Box 2) The journalists stressed that the population should "clearly understand that merchandise circulating in the underground economy" comes largely from "theft" from "state companies or stores." A subsequent "Straight Talk" program emphasized that the long-accepted concept of "missing inventory"--which traditionally condoned theft for personal use or to "solve [inventory] problems for a buddy at another enterprise"--is now "fostering criminal activity" (Radio Rebelde, 6 April). As a case in point, Radio Progreso on 25 April said that "corrupt" warehouse inspectors and others in management positions steal from the state now for "the sole purpose of enriching themselves" on the black market. Political Threat Havana's repression of affluent black marketeers also provides the regime with an opportunity to take action against an incipient economic elite as a potential rival of the Communist Party of Cuba. In fact, the Cuban media have hinted that the Castro regime sees a political threat in the profiteers' independent power base. For example, the "Straight Talk" program on 5 May reported that "macetas"--the pejorative term used by the regime to describe Cubans who get rich buying and selling stolen state merchandise--set themselves apart from socialist society, not only by enjoying a "lavish lifestyle," but also by building a network of "collaborators" and using personal "bodyguards" (Radio Rebelde). The 11 May "Straight Talk" program concluded that these profiteers--who "live differently and think differently" from others in socialist society--are "almost becoming a social class" with its own distinct ideology. Outlook By cracking down on flagrant profiteering on the black market, Havana is evidently hoping that it will be able to rein in forces that the regime itself set loose when it implemented liberalizing measures last year. Having permitted limited market-oriented measures in the cause of economic survival, the regime must now also guard against the demoralizing effects of those who flaunt their success in using the market conditions to gain affluence at the state's expense. Given the regime's diminished capacity to maintain the traditional communist economy, a high-publicity campaign against flagrant profiteers is probably the best available means of keeping illegal activities in check. At the same time, the regime's oft-stated intention to make economic changes in a gradual and carefully controlled way suggests that Havana is not unprepared for unforeseen problems. Speaking on Havana's economic agenda--including the campaign against profiteers--at last month's National Assembly meeting, Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez reiterated the regime's intention to proceed with due care, declaring that new measures will be implemented as a "gradual process" that will require "adjustments or changes" along the way (Tele Rebelde, 1 May). (BOX 1) The Expanding Black Market Havana's efforts to stem the flow of state merchandise to the black market notwithstanding, other policies promoted by the regime seem to have fostered black market activity. In particular, two market-oriented measures implemented last year to ease shortages of basic consumer goods and services seem to have created new opportunities for black marketeers: -- The legalization of self-employment in the service sector- -which amounted to an endorsement of underground economic activity--has apparently made it easier for Cubans to camouflage the sale of state merchandise on the black market where goods fetch a higher price than they would in the state's price- controlled stores. Given that the regime apparently never specified where self-employed workers could obtain supplies- -beyond suggesting that they "use leftover materials" (Radio Rebelde, 15 October 1993)--many now seem to rely on theft from the state. One radio reporter noted that in Havana "unscrupulous" people charging "astronomical prices" for stolen foodstuffs manage "to mix" in with authorized street peddlers selling "homemade" goods (Radio Rebelde, 7 January 1994). Likewise, Radio Rebelde reported on 5 May that local officials- -meeting with several Politburo members--reached the conclusion that legally self-employed "craftsmen" were using fuel and other raw materials "of dubious [i.e., state] origin." -- The lifting of restrictions against holding dollars, which has presumably led to an increase in disbursements from abroad, has undoubtedly promoted activity on the dollar-based black market. Remarks made by Cuban President Fidel Castro last December at the National Assembly session certainly suggest that this is the case. According to Castro, "all the money [i.e., dollars] coming into the country today . . . becomes a source for the black market" (Havana TV, 30 December 1993). (BOX 2) Return of the Farmers Free Markets? Cuba's private farmers--who, according to a 31 May report from the official Mexican news service NOTIMEX, supply 35 percent of Cuba's produce--may be unofficially reinventing the farmers' free markets which Castro closed down in 1986 on the grounds that they promoted excessive profitmaking. Recent media reporting suggests that private farmers are all but disregarding their obligation to sell a set quota of produce to the state in favor of more lucrative arrangements on the illicit private markets. Havana Radio Reloj on 31 May reported that Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan "demanded that farmers fulfill their food delivery commitments," noting that this year some farmers "have not delivered a single quintal of farm products" to the state. Suggesting that farmers are forsaking the low fixed prices that the state pays in exchange for higher private market prices, the labor union paper Trabajadores charged that some farmers are "trying to get rich" (Mexico City NOTIMEX, 31 May).
