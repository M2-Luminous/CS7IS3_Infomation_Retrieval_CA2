FR940722-1-00006 FR940722-1-00004 There are approximately 282 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 175 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. The currently required inspections take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the current inspection requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $77,000, or $440 per airplane, per inspection. The proposed modification would take approximately 12 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost between $3,730 and $6,730 per airplane, depending upon the airplane model. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be between $4,390 and $7,390 per airplane. The proposed post-modification inspections would take approximately 12 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed post-modification inspection requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $115,500, or $660 per airplane, per inspection. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the current or proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;8052 (56 FR 50650, October 8, 1991), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows:
