It is necessary now to adopt federal laws registering the new political reality in Russia, first deputy speaker of the State Duma Mikhail Mityukov said on Wednesday. He presented to deputies of the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly the plan for Duma's legislative work. Mikhail Mityukov noted the need of consolidating legislatively real parliamentarism that is forming in the country. It is based on clear separation of power and interaction of all branches of power. In this connection it is planned to draw up laws that will create a legal base for the State Duma of the future convocations. The first deputy speaker of the duma said that the plan includes federal constitutional laws, among them the laws on the referendum, on the government of the Russian Federation, on the judiciary reform in Russia and on the powers, the procedure of forming and the activity of the constitutional court of the Russian Federation. Mityukov described the present civic code as outdated. He said the part of the civic code containing its general principles has already been drafted and will be submitted to the State Duma. He said the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly is to adopt new code on taxes, as well as the criminal code, the criminal proceedings code, the labour and land codes, as well as the code on the family and marriage. The Duma is also to adopt laws on political parties and trade unions. A great number of laws related to the economic sphere are also to be adopted, Mityukov said. Much attention is given to legislative acts whose adoption will make it possible to realise complex problems of federalism in Russia, Mityukov believes. Mityukov also stressed the need of adopting legislative acts in the area of international politics and foreign economic activity, including the law on international afgreements. The first deputy chairman of the State Duma believes that the plan of legislative work stretched far beyond the term of the present Duma, so it is necessary to adress priorities. Mityukov said the adoption of new laws will promote the policy of reform. In this connection he noted that many draft laws being drawn up by the former Supreme Soviet were obviously populist and therefore inflationary, and that their implementation led to the worsening of the economic situation.
