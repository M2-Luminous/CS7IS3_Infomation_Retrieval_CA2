Lamarre Germain, spokesman for the Haitian group, said they voluntarily left after reaching a number of agreements, which he did not describe, with UNHCR representative Juan Manuel Castro Magluff. The agreements, according to Germain, include the acknowledgement that some of his fellow Haitians are political refugees, but he did not disclose how many of them would receive that status. Germain also said Castro Magluff arranged for all of the Haitians to be lodged at a hotel in the high altitude area of the Dominican capital and that, in addition, each of them were given 500 pesos, the equivalent of $40. Germain said the group will remain at the hotel under UN care until each person's situation is individually examined. Eleven of the 101 Haitians who occupied the UNHCR headquarters were hospitalized and treated for tuberculosis and diabetes, among other diseases. The Haitians, 40 men, 20 women, and 32 children, occupied the UNHCR headquarters to gain political refugee status in the Dominican Republic.
