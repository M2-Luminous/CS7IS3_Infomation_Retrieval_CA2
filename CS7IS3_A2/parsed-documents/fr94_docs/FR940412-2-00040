FR940412-2-00040 FR940412-2-00026 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of an altered system of records; deletion of existing systems of records. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Education publishes this notice of an altered system of records that consolidates ten existing systems of records maintained under the student financial assistance programs authorized by title IV, the Higher Education Act, 1965, amended, (HEA). The notice is also expanded to cover the new Federal Direct Student Loan programs authorized under title IV, HEA. The programs involved in this consolidation include the Federal Direct Student Loan, Federal Insured Student Loan, Federal Family Education Loan, and Federal Perkins Loan programs. This system will also maintain records under the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant and Federal Pell Grant programs that are necessary in the collection of overpayments. Because this system is being expanded to cover one new program, the Department seeks comments on all of the routine uses contained in this notice. The name and number of the single consolidated system of records is the Title IV Program File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0024). DATES: Comments on the proposed routine uses for this system of records must be submitted by May 12, 1994. The Department filed a report of the altered system of records with the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on April 6, 1994. This system of records will become effective after a 40-day period for OMB review of the system expires on May 16, 1994, unless OMB gives specific notice within the 40 days that the system is not approved for implementation or requests additional time for its review. The Department will publish any changes to the routine uses that are required as a result of the comments. ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed routine uses should be addressed to the Privacy Act Officer, Information Resource Management Service, Information Management and Compliance Division, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., room 5624, GSA Regional Office Building 3, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;4651. All comments submitted in response to this notice will be available for public inspection, during and after the comment period in Room 5624, GSA Regional Office Building 3, 7th & D Streets, SW., between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Education consolidates into a single system of records ten existing systems that are currently maintained regarding information authorized to be collected under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (title IV, HEA), as amended. In addition, the system is expanded to include the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, authorized to be collected under Part D of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. Currently, ten separate systems of records notices notify the public about the existence of data collected under title IV, HEA. The consolidation of these systems of records will enable the Department to improve the efficiency of data maintenance by eliminating the administrative burden and duplication associated with the use of separate systems. The programs involved in this consolidation include the Federal Direct Student Loan Program; the Federal Family Education Loan (formerly Guaranteed Student Loan) Program, which includes the: Federal Stafford Loan, Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS, and Federal Consolidation Loan Programs; the Federal Insured Student Loan (FISL) Program; and the Federal Perkins Loan Program (formerly the National Direct Student Loan Program). This system will also maintain records regarding individuals participating in the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program and Federal Pell Grant Program that are necessary for the collection of overpayments. This Federal Register notice deletes the names and system numbers of ten existing systems of records and consolidates those files into a single system of records known as ``Title IV Program File'' 18&hyph;40&hyph;0024. The ten systems to be deleted are: •Defaulted Guaranteed Loans Submitted to the Department of Justice (18&hyph;40&hyph;0023). •Guaranteed Loan Program_Loan Application File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0024). •NDSL Student Loan Files (18&hyph;40&hyph;0025). •Guaranteed Loan Program_Paid Claims File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0026). •Guaranteed Loan Program_Claims and Collections Master File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0027). •Guaranteed Loan Program_Collection Letters (18&hyph;40&hyph;0028). •Guaranteed Loan Program_Inactive Loan Control Master File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0029). •Guaranteed Loan Program_Loan Control Master File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0030).
