FR941222-0-00088 FR941222-0-00013 Paragraph (c) requires that the NPS strictly adhere to the regulations at 40 CFR part 244, Solid Waste Management Guidelines for Beverage Containers. While some units may not be aware of the requirements at 40 CFR part 244 for deposit systems on Federal facilities, nonetheless the requirements are longstanding. Note that the regulations require (not simply ``recommend'') that Federal facilities maintain deposit and return systems on containers in which ``carbonated beverages'' are sold. Such containers may be plastic, glass, aluminum or steel. Parks, such as Grand Canyon National Park, that have voluntary recycling programs are not exempt from final §6.8(c). Mandatory deposit and return systems are not replaced by voluntary recycling efforts. Rather these two approaches complement each other. As part of its environmental leadership responsibilities, the NPS seeks to address the solid waste issue with several tools, including mandatory deposit and return systems for carbonated beverage containers sold by facilities on Federal lands in units of the National Park System. Individual units that propose not to implement 40 CFR part 244 shall maintain deposit and return systems while a fully-documented request for non-implementation is being considered. The final rule inserts a new subsection (d) at §6.8 to address Executive Order 12873, Federal Acquisition, Recycling and Waste Prevention. That order mandates that all Federal agencies ``shall incorporate waste prevention and recycling in the agency's daily operations and work.'' This requirement governs not only the NPS but also NPS concessionaires, commercial use licensees and contractors. Section 6.9␣Permits The final rule requires that a person proposing to continue, or begin operating a solid waste disposal site within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System must possess a permit issued under this part. The regulations exempt only two classes of persons operating solid waste disposal sites from this permit requirement. They are persons who reside or farm within a park under §6.2(c) and existing mineral operators described by §6.7(c). Residents under §6.2(c) do not require a permit and the mineral operator's permit consists of an NPS-approved plan of operations or Federal lease terms. Also note that §6.2(c)(3) and §6.7(e) exclude some substances from the ambit of these regulations under certain conditions. This section also governs the issuing of a permit for the operation of a solid waste disposal site and outlines the contents of such permits. Section 6.9(b) requires that the Regional Director comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other pertinent laws and executive orders before issuing a permit. The Regional Director may find that a proposal meets the conditions under which the NPS may approve a new, or continued operation of an existing, site. If a proposal meets the conditions, the Regional Director shall then determine, through preparation of an environmental assessment, whether the Service's approval constitutes a major Federal agency action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. When the Regional Director finds such an effect, the NPS will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposal. Section 6.9(d) makes clear that the issuance of a Special Use Permit is the method by which the Regional Director approves a request and environmental report, and provides that the authority to issue a permit resides with the Regional Director. Paragraph (e) sets forth the minimum requirements a permit may prescribe for operating a solid waste disposal site. The requirements are aimed at reducing the potential adverse effects attributable to the operation of such sites on the property of the United States. Section 6.10␣Financial Assurance This section prescribes the procedures for financial assurance from a solid waste disposal site operator in a unit of the National Park System. The regulations at 40 CFR part 258 require that an operator of a solid waste disposal site for household and certain other commercial and industrial solid wastes (not including hazardous wastes) must provide an estimate of costs related to closure and post-closure care responsibilities of the site, and establish sufficient financial assurance to meet those responsibilities. The NPS sees no need to require added financial assurance, in the form of cash or surety bond guaranteeing payment or performance, where the operator has provided such a bond under regulations at 40 CFR 258.74(b). Nor will the NPS require financial assurance from an owner or operator of a site that is a State entity whose debts and liabilities are the debts and liabilities of a State. There is also an exception that may apply to mineral operators under §6.7(c). The NPS will require financial assurance when issuing a permit for a new, or continued operation of an existing, solid waste disposal site if the operator has not posted a bond under 40 CFR 258.74(b).
