The two national leaders will be expected to sign a number of documents. In Friday's interview with INTERFAX, chief Sergey Zotov of the Russian delegation to the negotiations with Latvia said that in Moscow Ulmanis would be expected to sign the whole package of military agreements (a basic agreement on the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Latvia, an agreement on the 5.5-year lease of the Skrunda radar station, an agreement on the social protection of the withdrawing Russian servicemen, and an agreement on the social protection of the retired Russian servicemen and their families). According to Zotov, the Russian and Latvian Government delegations closed around of negotiations in Jurmala, Thursday [28 April]. On Latvian request they drew up an additional protocol to the agreement on the social protection of the retired Russian servicemen and their families. The protocol provided for the creation of special funds, endowments and organizations for the solution of problems that would arise in the course of the servicemen's voluntary repatriation. Foreign sources, too, would be allowed to finance the repatriation. The protocol eliminated what remained of the Latvian objections to the whole package of bilateral agreements. So, Zotov said, the road was clear for Ulmanis' visit to Moscow.
