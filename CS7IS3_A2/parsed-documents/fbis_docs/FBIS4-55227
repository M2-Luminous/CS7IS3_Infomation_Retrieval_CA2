The topic of our conversation is the MSZP's policy in connection with the Hungarians living beyond our borders. In the opinion of your party, how important is the issue of Hungarians beyond the borders? [Tabajdi] I think that what is laid down in our program is clear for every political force in Hungary: Dealing with the Hungarians beyond the borders has to be one of the central elements of Hungarian politics at all times and in all circumstances. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Leading politicians in the MSZP have made some statements recently that could be misinterpreted. Let me ask you outright: Is the situation of Hungarian minorities a condition of good relations with neighboring countries? [Tabajdi] I think that in the past weeks, in the heat of the election campaign, a lot of ambiguous statements were made. However, for me, the statement adopted by the Socialist Party's congress at the end of February is the guiding line. This laid down the three elements of Hungarian foreign policy, which are in coordinated relations with each other. These are: Integration with Western Europe, relations with the neighbors, and the treatment of Hungarians living beyond the borders. We have elaborated in detail in this document our party's minority policy, stating that these three elements are of equal importance. Thus, there is no return to the Kadar era of mocking silence. [passage omitted] However, we not only disagree with the politics of that time but also with the past four years' government politics. This means that without discarding or sacrificing the issue of Hungarians beyond the border on the altar of bilateral relations, much more should have been done in the past four years for bilateral relations. Let me bring a concrete example, a practical one, for we are very practical; at the moment, Hungary has no valid agreement on investment protection and preventing double taxation with any of her neighbors. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] [passage omitted] What do you consider more important, the conclusion of basic treaties with our neighbors or settling the situation of Hungarians living beyond the borders? [Tabajdi] The two are inseparable. [passage omitted] These basic treaties have to answer two vital questions that are the problems of the region; one of them is the question of the borders. [passage omitted] On the other hand, there is a wish on behalf of Hungary -- since we have a fait accompli produced by the tragic history of the 20th century -- that the Hungarians beyond our border should, within the given conditions, be given the rights of autonomy by which they can preserve their identity. If a basic treaty does not settle these two unsolved issues, it is worthless. I would like to add, and this is also included in our program, that in the question of basic treaties, coordination has to be carried out with the would-be opposition prior to signing. Prior to ratification, the democratic institutions of the Hungarians beyond the border also have to be involved. [Correspondent] [passage omitted] How do you evaluate the statement of [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn that there is no need for the office dealing with the affairs of Hungarians beyond the borders? [Tabajdi] [passage omitted] It is debatable how this office should be run, however, it is absolutely necessary. [passage omitted] So, regarding Hungarians beyond the borders, the new government, shortly after assuming power, has to lay down the basic principles, just as the Antall government did very correctly in 1992. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What does the MSZP intend to do with Duna TV? [Tabajdi] I wrote an article in NEPSZABADSAG on 11 April that a turnabout was needed in Hungarian minority policy. One of the sentences in this article was that despite all the organizational imperfections and personal monopolizing, Duna TV filled a gap of decades. [passage omitted] Obviously, Duna TV has to be maintained. We think that it has to be maintained by the budget. [passage omitted]
