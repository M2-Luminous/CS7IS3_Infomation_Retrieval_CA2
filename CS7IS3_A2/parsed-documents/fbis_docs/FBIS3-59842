Many people exclude the possibility of any reaction on the part of Salim al-Bid who was elected by the Presidential Council members for the post of vice president despite the fact that he did not come to Parliament in order to take the constitutional oath. Al-Bid is still demanding the implementation of the 18 points which he considers basic conditions before any reconciliatory steps toward the General People's Congress [GPC] are taken. Al-Bid, who accused Salih of building a state of tax collection and military, faced wide criticism by politicians and the opposition press, accusing him of being secessionist and helping to implement a foreign plan, and exploiting differences in order to redivide Yemen. However, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in his speech before Parliament after taking the constitutional oath strongly warned his deputy that "we must draw up red lines which we should not allow ourselves to cross whatever the circumstances may be." Yet the Yemeni crisis is still bogged down despite the strong public optimism regarding President 'Al 'Abdallah Salih's recent initiative. The deadlock in the crisis was demonstrated in the message al-Bid sent to Parliament, declining to attend the swearing ceremony because of his personal stand toward President Salih and YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] relations with the GPC party. But al-Bid did not reject the new position and left the door open for his return to the capital, Sanaa. When the election battle died down in April some people thought that Yemen has passed the first test of democracy following the election of the first popular and legitimate Parliament through elections in which several parties were involved, not just one or two parties. It was believed that the differences between the president and the vice president concerned the latter's demands for several guarantees for the YSP while in power, or that power is to be shared according to the role and status of each party in the field. But 'Ali al-Bid's going into seclusion in Aden recently exposed all those differences, thereby demonstrating that the situation in Yemen is close to collapsing. For the first time, al-Bid openly said that the conflict is about salvaging what used to be called the South and restoring the positive advantages it enjoyed, until the negative effects of what used to be known as the North began spreading southward. Some politicians in Yemen see the vice president's recent stand as based on the outcome of the legislative elections in which the YSP scored a sweeping victory in the southern provinces, which led to the creation of a strong bastion for the socialists who have begun raising issues of the South and setting its priorities, both in the Presidential Council and the Parliament. The situation further aggravated when the speeches of the president in Sanaa and the vice president in Aden developed into political polemics, with each one accusing the other of plundering the state coffers, misappropriating public funds, and each holding the other responsible for the state the country is in. This escalation aroused the fear that the unitary state might come to an end. Some opposition papers expressed the fear that the differences might lead to the restoration of the border entry points which existed previously and culminated with the unification of north and south. With these serious proposals being openly talked about by leaders of both parties, the voices advocating secession have become louder. They point to several factors that can be used as justifications to go back to secession. These are: - The existence of two different currencies in circulation; the dinar, which was the principal currency in the South, and the rial in the North (the dinar is worth $26). - Failure to take practical steps to merge the armed forces and the security forces, thus two armies now profess loyalty to the previous parties, the YSP and the GPC. - The existence of two airlines, Alyamda in Aden and al-Yamaniyah in Sanaa. - The publication of two official newspapers, AL-THAWRAH in Sanaa and 14 OCTOBER in Aden. - The existence of two television and radio channels in Sanaa and Aden. - The failure to standardize school curricula and the general educational system. - The feeling among citizens of the South in particular that unity has worsened their poverty. Over and above that, political frictions between the GCP and YSP during the transitional period preceding the elections have affected a wide sector of the inhabitants of the southern provinces. Cash liquidity in banks disappeared and for several months employees received no pay. Also, the project to establish a free zone in Aden when it was proclaimed the economic and commercial capital of the country was not implemented. Despite the gains Yemeni unity achieved and the feeling among Yemeni citizens of greater freedom following the termination of the two totalitarian regimes, lifting restrictions on citizens' travel, and the existence of freedom in all its forms--these achievements are no longer a daily demand because hardships caused by the security and economic situation, particularly among the southern citizens, overshadowed everything else. The consensus of views among observers is that Yemen is living very critical moments due to increasing distrust between the YSP and GPC leadership. Al-Bid clearly referred to this situation when he said in an interview with a local paper that "if we do not understand the meaning of the establishment of the unitary state, its mechanism, and its major democratic and contemporary project, then we are afraid that the entity of this state will break into several entities."
