Is the unending need to obtain authorization from the governorate for any meeting the reason why the political class is shrinking to nothing more than the parties' administrative staffs? The regime is granting itself a grace period that everyone is refusing to give it, and the government is remaining quiet while Algerian society is being shaken by a deafening silence. Does that sound bite, addressed by Youcef Khatib to the leadership of the FLN [National Liberation Front] with the assertion that it is afraid of the terrorists, apply to the entire political class? We do not wish to make that class out to be more diabolical than it is, but the question is unavoidable when one notes the disappearance of all party activity at the rank-and-file level--in those parties that even have a rank and file. Party offices in the country's interior remain hopelessly closed, and in the eyes of the citizens, the only political debate is the bloody confrontation between the security forces and armed groups. Some parties use the argument that it is difficult to obtain authorization from the governorate and are calling for an end to the state of emergency, thus minimizing the seriousness of the security situation, while paradoxically deploring the absence of the state. The state, besieged on all sides, makes a pretense of being present through its police forces, its DEC [expansion not given] agents who do what they can with what they are given when they do not get shot like rabbits, and officials who do not lose sight of the fact that they are first and foremost servants of that state. But the state is also a very quiet government in the face of the almost exclusive presence in the field of terrorists who exchange civilities with speculators who have never lost their money or their sense of direction. The armed groups have not granted the new government a grace period, but it seems to be taking one anyway. Zeroual has not yet met with his former colleagues for a Council of Ministers meeting, and government activity is shrinking steadily away. The president of the state (certainly an incorrect translation of chief of state, but we are still the only republic where "chief of state" is not the same as "president of the republic") reportedly arrives at his office early to work on the dossiers, but it cannot be said that those dossiers are completely unfamiliar to him, so why does he give the impression of being mute in response to the new upsurge of feelings of insecurity among Algerians? Is it because he is completely absorbed in reorganizing the office of the president's staff? Or is it the problem of providing this government with a base of popular support? If so, this is the time to reoccupy the terrain that seems to have been abandoned by the political parties as well and reconquer areas that have been left for too long in the hands of populism and demagoguery. Because except for the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], which still holds those citadels through certain mosques that have evaded control by the "nidhara," and the FFS [Socialist Forces Front], which maintains a quite active internal political life by regularly sponsoring debates between its Executive Committee and its rank and file, the rest of the political class is active more through press communiques or interviews than through political activity in the field. The strength of the FLN, for example, lies less in its mobilization capability than in the means at its disposal for paralyzing important sectors of the economy with the aid of men who have survived in the major decisionmaking centers despite the earthquakes of the past. The Islamists in HAMAS [National Society for Guidance and Reform] and al-Nahdah are continuing to fish for members among the FIS rank and file even though they, too, are not active in the field. The fact that Nahnah and Djaballah agree today in calling for a shortening of the transitional period, something on which they reached agreement during the successive phases of dialogue, is more a matter of strategy than of tactics--in other words, they will always agree even though they follow different paths (and voices). The RCD [Rally for Culture and Democracy], traumatized by the assassination of its national secretary, Rachid Tighziri, has sunk into painful silence. Added to its bereavement are the intrigues surrounding the claims to represent culture and identity that have the MCB [Berber Cultural Movement] as their focus. That has the disadvantage of unnecessarily stirring up a rank and file whose understanding of the political nuances between two groups claiming the same acronym is diminishing steadily. Ettahaddi [offshoot of the Socialist Vanguard Party] is still the first to express its stand on current events, but it appears that the fierce attacks on that party's members by the armed groups have caused it to return to near-underground status, thus preventing it from engaging in open political activity. As for the other parties, their credibility with the media--because it cannot decently be said that they have credibility with the public--is in proportion to the charisma of their individual leaders. Meanwhile, the citizen, faced with the government's silence and the absence of the parties, will have to contend with speculators using the only weapon at his disposal: refusal to buy. As for his willingness to mobilize against terrorism, that is a subject for a separate debate.
