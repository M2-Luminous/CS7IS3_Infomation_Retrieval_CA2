FBIS3-51775 "drlat016_r_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-016 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 Peru _o_ Notes From Media; Opinion Polls on Fujimori, Country's Future 94P20218A 94P20218A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] Poll on Fujimori, Government Policy A November poll shows the Peruvian Government as a whole enjoying a 54-percent approval rate, while President Fujimori's performance gets a 67-percent approval rate. (The poll was taken a few weeks after the 31 October referendum on the new Constitution, a referendum which was widely interpreted as a vote for or against Fujimori. The Constitution barely passed, receiving a 52-percent approval rate.) The November figures represent a 13-percent drop for the government but only a 3-percent drop for the president from the preceding month's Apoyo poll. The report of the poll of metropolitan Lima residents, aged 18 or above, of "all socio-economic levels," as published in the 29 November issue of the Apoyo-owned weekly SEMANA ECONOMICA, did not indicate the number of respondents, date, or margin of error. A full 76 percent of those interviewed approve of the government's anti-terrorism policy (an insignificant drop of 1 percent from Apoyo's October poll, according to the published figures). Approval of the privatization program was also unchanged since October, registering an insignificant drop from 57 to 56 percent. The government's economic policy suffered a decline in popularity, with only 42 percent (down 5 percent from October) voicing approval. Along with the slight drop in approval ratings for President Fujimori and the more marked drop for the Peruvian Government, approval for the political opposition was essentially unchanged from November (slightly increasing from 29 to 31). Terrorism, Unemployment as National Problems In a poll published in the November 1993 issue of the Apoyo-owned monthly PERU ECONOMICO interviewees identified terrorism, unemployment, and "food" [alimentacion] as the major national concerns, in descending order. The poll was conducted by Apoyo between 8 and 11 October 1993 with 500 residents of metropolitan Lima spanning the socio-economic strata. Some 41 percent of those interviewed chose terrorism as the most important national problem, no significant change from the same period in 1992, but lower than in the years 1988-1991. PERU ECONOMICO notes that unemployment, second among national concerns with 36 percent, was of higher concern to the top socio-economic group (43 percent) than to those of moderate means and the poor. In the poorest group, unemployment and terrorism were given equal weight as major national problems. The third most pressing national problem, identified by 27 percent of the interviewees, was the general category of "food." This concern has fluctuated widely in the last two years, affecting 7 percent more respondents in 1992, but 9 percent fewer the previous year. Of other problems perceived as national, drug trafficking was mentioned by almost twice as many respondents in October (19 percent) as had done so in April (10 percent). Drug abuse concerned 19 percent of respondents, with the poor much more likely to express concern (24 percent) than the wealthy (5 percent). On the other hand, worries about inflation sharply declined from 62 percent in 1990, to 31 in 1991, 24 in 1992, and a mere 14 percent in October 1993. It now ranks ninth in the Apoyo poll among the nation's major problems. Other identified national problems were poverty (23 percent), "inadequate education" (16 percent), cost of living (16 percent), and human rights violations (14 percent). Expectations Rising An Apoyo poll published in the December issue of PERU ECONOMICO indicates more widespread optimism about Peru's future. Asked whether the country was going in the right or wrong direction, 65 percent of the respondents said it was going in the right direction, an increase of 9 percent since a similar poll in July 1992. Just 22 percent said in the wrong direction, a drop of 4 percent, while 13 percent were undecided. Similarly, 53 percent said the country is "progressing," a sharp increase from just 5 percent in August 1990, while only 11 percent declared it to be "declining," down from 54 percent in the same period. While 32 percent described the country as "stagnating," this marked a decline from 53 percent in June 1991 and 42 percent in March 1993. Fifty-three percent said Peru would be a better place to live in 20 years (compared to 40 percent in 1991). Forty-one percent said they had positive expectations for their personal lives over the next year (compared to 17 percent in June 1990), and 44 percent had positive expectations for the country over the same period (compared with 39 percent in September 1990, but only 16 percent in June 1991, a month after the Shining Path's "armed sitdown" day, accompanied by many assassinations and other attacks, as well as the temporary takeover of a number of radio stations).
