That is Finance Minister Boris Fedorov's New Year's Prediction"] [Text] The present financial policy is provoking a harsh reaction from the opposition. That means that a consistent financial policy has been achieved. Prices over the past year rose by a factor of nine (they rose by a factor of 26 in 1992), and in December the rate of price rises was for the first time just 12 percent. These results could have been much better had it not been for the compromises on the budget, the promises of new appropriations not backed up by sources of finance, the artificial raising of purchase prices for grain, and our continuous struggle with the Supreme Soviet, the Central Bank, and sector lobbies in the government. The lowering of inflation means easing the problem of the shortage of circulating capital and the depreciation of savings and investments. That is why the slump in production last year was not as great as the opposition predicted. However, 900 percent inflation is still disastrously high and it is simply ridiculous to say that we have an unduly harsh policy or shock therapy here. Only incompetent or dishonest people can argue this way. It is typical that in all sectors without exception the average wage in 1993 rose faster than inflation. Back at the beginning of the year we were criticized for the excessively low and unrealistic ruble exchange rate. But from June through the end of the year the rate only fell from 1,100 rubles [R] to the dollar to R1,250 to $1; in other words, by just 10 percent as against an approximately fourfold rise in prices. Our prices are rapidly approaching the world level, which marks the end of the era of prosperity for inefficient production units whose survival was made possible by the vast price discrepancy. Now there are many who dislike the strengthening of the ruble even though this is a direct method of combating the export of our national wealth at knockdown prices. The time has come to ask many prestigious directors of giant enterprises and captains of agriculture: What is your labor productivity like, why should we support you if your goods are selling at world prices while you pay people kopeks? I consider it a violation of human rights when I am forced to buy a commodity at a price higher than the world price and furthermore when it does not come up to scratch. In 1993 we managed to stop the flow of money, subsidies, and credits to CIS countries despite the fierce resistance of the Central Bank and a number of members of the government. In 1993, despite the opposition of the Central Bank and various sector lobbies, we managed to substantially raise interest rates and reduce various types of benefits which always go to the least strong and efficient and are then wasted. What effect did this have? In the first place the savings of the population and enterprises are now far better protected against inflation. Second, the voracious demand for free credits from the "black holes" in the Russian economy has been greatly restricted. It is no secret that behind the fine slogans of support for this sphere or that, what happens is that state resources are frankly plundered. I do not know who will be at the helm of Russia's financial policy in 1994 -- that is up to the president and the premier to decide -- but I believe that it is necessary to demand absolutely concrete steps and commitments from those who lay claim to power. I would consider the following to be the minimum program for 1994: - - the population's savings: Interest rates higher than the rate of inflation must be ensured so that savings really do grow and people are able to accumulate money for long-term purchases. Until that happens there will be no investments or industrial development. At the same time it is necessary to pay reasonable compensation for losses in savings resulting from the deregulation of January 1992, but this must be done using noninflationary sources; - the population's real incomes must rise by at least 20-30 percent, and the dollar equivalent of the average monthly wage must rise from $100 to $250: It is necessary to introduce tax regulators to reduce the discrepancy in earnings between the richest and the poorest; - inflation must be reduced in the very near future to less than 5 percent a month, which is equivalent to 80 percent annually. That will make it possible to reduce the general level of interest rates, stimulate investments, and encourage enterprises to plan their activity; - as the budget deficit falls to 5 percent of GDP or less and is financed by market loans it will be possible to reduce the tax burden on commodity producers; - if events develop favorably the foreign exchange rate of the ruble in 1994 will not fall below R2,000-2,500 to the dollar, which will make our exports more substantial, will facilitate imports, and will make enterprises think about competitiveness, productivity, and quality. At the same time all the remaining restrictions on exports should be completely lifted. Those are the most basic financial policy demands in 1994. Will those responsible be bold enough to make these commitments and then answer for them to the people? I have studied the opposition's demands and programs closely and I have come to the conclusion that in the financial sphere no one is offering anything fundamentally new apart from a sharp increase in expenditure (social needs, investments, and so forth). I wholeheartedly support such expenditure. However, no one is saying anything serious about where the money for this expenditure is to come from. That means just one thing -- a further increase in the budget deficit and consequently a further rise in inflation. And inflation, let me repeat for the hundredth time, hits real people, enterprises, and the whole state in the pocket. On the eve of the new year, 1994, I shall try to predict what will happen if there is a change of course. A change of policy and the rejection of the more than moderate course pursued by us in 1993 (and accordingly the rejection of the people identified with that policy because a policy is always pursued by specific people) will mean the "Ukrainianization" of our economy: - - prices rising annually by a factor of 20; - an exchange rate in the region of R10,000 to the dollar (the rate could be fixed, so that would be the "black market" rate); - a further decline in labor productivity; - a fall in the population's real money incomes by at least one-eighth (in 1993 the rise was 10 percent); the average wage would fall to the dollar equivalent of $50 a month; - savings and investments would contract in real terms; - the dollarization of the economy would intensify again; - certain prices would be fixed and there would be an attempt to confiscate money, particularly foreign currency, held in banks; - there would be another shortage of many types of goods, the stores would be empty, and emigration would increase. I think that instead of the enormous market around the Kiev station in Moscow, where Ukrainians, hunting for rubles which have become a genuine foreign currency, are to be found selling masses of goods, there would be a similar market in Kiev where you might find Russians trading, hunting for "karbovantsy." I do not rule out the possibility that our miners would go to Kazakhstan to earn their living, just as Ukrainians now come to Rostov to work for half pay. Perhaps our delegation would then go to Tashkent to ask for credits and Russian enterprises would try to keep their money salted away in Belarusian banks. The only possible consolation for our opponents would the growth of production by 3-5 percent by increasing the production of tanks and missiles. Admittedly, I do not think that this will be a source of much new year's joy for Russia's citizens as we approach 1994. I do not believe people who change their views, who pursue one line today and are ready to pursue a different one tomorrow. I have no faith in the leaders of enterprises who forget about labor productivity and production efficiency and know only one way to resolve their problems -- by asking the president or the premier for money. All that we have is the interests of the state and our citizens, and they are demanding that rigorous financial order be instilled in the country and that the reforms be continued, reforms whose sole aim is the improvement of our life. At most 10 percent of the people in the old parliament supported the reforms; now that figure is at least 30 percent. That is not so bad for a beginning. The only way to stop things coming to a standstill is to firmly accelerate the reforms and move closer to a normal life worthy of the citizens of a great country. Slowing down the reforms is the road to ruin, the continuation of the time of troubles, and the betrayal of Russia's national interests. Enough of the deception and disappointment. Enough of the promises. Enough of the people who cling onto their jobs despite being totally incapable of anything constructive. Enough of the attempts to cross the hedgehog with the grass snake -- as is well known, all you get is barbed wire. The elections were a warning to us. Pray God that Russia does not turn back from the true path again, especially as the most difficult steps have already been taken and we have the strength to go on.
