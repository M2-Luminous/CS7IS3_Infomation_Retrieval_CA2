The election result is sad and there is no reason to extenuate it, Kinkel said on Monday [14 March] in talks of FDP leadership bodies in Bonn. Nevertheless, he sees no reason "to repent in sackcloth and ashes." One must now roll up one's sleeves and look ahead and fight for better results. Kinkel said that he was anything but pessimistic and was certain that better results would follow. According to Kinkel, the FDP's poor result also had something to do with the "dilemma" into which the FDP has been forced in the coalition in Bonn. On the one hand, it wants to complete the full term of the coalition in an orderly way, while on the other, it also wants to prove its independence. Moreover, the governing parties, especially those in Bonn, are currently blamed for all things negative. Asked whether support for the nursing-care insurance contributed to the FDP losses, Kinkel said that it was he, in particular, who wanted the nursing-care insurance. One must not put off such an important issue merely out of consideration for election results. Only if one keeps to one's course in difficult days and situations can one prove that "one has got some backbone." In Lower Saxony, the FDP lost 1.6 percentage points, only achieving 4.4 percent, and is no longer represented in the Landtag. FDP Honorary Chairman Lambsdorff rejected blaming Chairman Kinkel for the defeat. Kinkel is a generally respected, good foreign minister, and a greatly liked and confident personality for the FDP. Kinkel's deputy, Irmgard Schwaetzer, said that although she was sad, the result was not a disaster. Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of the FDP Bundestag group, said that it was not obvious what the FDP's function should have been in Lower Saxony.
