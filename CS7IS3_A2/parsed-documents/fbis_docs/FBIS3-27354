It is even more important for state security organs to remain sober-minded, to have a clear understanding of the situation, to be mindful of possible danger in times of peace, to heighten our vigilance, to enhance their sense of urgency and responsibility, to always give prominence to efforts to maintain political and social stability, to strengthen the role of democratic dictatorship, and to actively prevent and crack down on various kinds of unlawful practices and criminal activities that jeopardize state security." These were the demands made by Chai Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and executive vice governor, at a provincial conference on state security work held in Hangzhou on 26 January. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, Chai Songyue highly praised the efforts made by the state security organs at all levels in the province to safeguard state security and social stability in the past year, and their contributions to promoting the economic development of Zhejiang Province. He said: On the whole, the current international situation is extremely favorable to us; however, we must clearly discern that the world is still not peaceful, because the underlying struggles between espionage and counterespionage, infiltration and counterintelligence, and attempts to steal secret information and efforts to combat such attempts have become increasingly complex and acute. Therefore, the more we carry out reform and the opening policy, and the more we accelerate economic development, the more we must beef up state security work. State security work is a strategic undertaking that has a bearing on the safety and well-being and on the survival or collapse of a country. It occupies a highly important place and plays a vital role in the political and social lives of a country. The provincial party committee and government have attached great importance to state security work. From now on, we still have to vigorously enhance our leadership over state security work and give our leaders greater support and help in their bid to eliminate worries and surmount difficulties. Party committees and governments at all levels must earnestly implement the instructions and guidelines of the CPC Central Committee, as well as the provincial party committee, with a great sense of political responsibility and a serious attitude, and must give practical help and support to state security organs. Various departments and units must also actively support and coordinate with state security organs while carrying out various tasks. At the same time, he pointed out: The work on the secret front is of a special nature, and this special nature calls for steadfast party spirit, a firm political stand, strict discipline, high professionalism, absolute loyalty, great skill and expertise among comrades on this front. He urged state security organs at all levels throughout the province to step up efforts to improve themselves and improve the combat effectiveness of their contingents, to train cadres and policemen to establish a concept to serve the people wholeheartedly, a concept of hard struggle and selfless dedication; to promote the spirit of "prudence and independence" [fayang shendu jingshen -- 4099 2254 1957 3747 4737 4377], to be good at resisting various types of degenerate thinking and at resisting the decadence and temptations of the seamy side of things, and to actively dedicate themselves to state security undertakings. Si Daxiao, member of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial Political Science and Law Commission, was present at the meeting. The meeting relayed the guidelines of the national state security conference. Zhu Ziru, director of the provincial state security department, presented a work report, and leaders at various levels under the provincial state security system attended the meeting.
