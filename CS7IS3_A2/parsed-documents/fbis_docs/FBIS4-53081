Sixty-three percent said bureaucrats put the interests of firms, industries and their own ministries and agencies before those of people, while only 14 percent said that bureaucrats are thinking about the interests of people. Regarding policy decisions, 56 percent said bureaucrats have more power than the ruling political parties. When asked how they feel about the bureaucrat-led decision-making system, however, 45 percent said people should not have any say in the matter, while 44 percent responded the system is unavoidable. More than 70 percent said they have a bad image of bureaucrats, and 28 percent of those respondents said they are not flexible, and 22 percent said they have a strong desire for promotion.
