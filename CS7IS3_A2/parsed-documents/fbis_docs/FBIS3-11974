According to Figueres' Foreign Minister-designate Fernando Naranjo, one of his main tasks will be to improve the deteriorated relations. "We have viewed with concern a deterioration of relations with the United States. This country is definitely our main economic partner and has been our political ally for many decades," Naranjo highlighted in an interview with LA REPUBLICA, in which he explained the main goals of his tenure. The future foreign minister said in a decisive manner: "We do not like the cooling of diplomatic relations between the two nations, and we deem it necessary that we will be able to talk with the United States as friends and to overcome any differences. This will permit us to have a close and respectful relationship." Since last year, a series of differences have cooled relations with the United States. However, according to experts, the situation started when the administration of President Calderon Fournier endorsed former U.S. President George Bush in the election won by Democrat Bill Clinton. Moment of Tension Tensions soared in February of last year, when the United States threatened to block a package of credits from the Inter-American Development Bank because of delays in settling land expropriation payments for U.S. citizens, particularly those related to the Santa Elena Farm. Additionally, in July 1993, the U.S. Commerce Department ruled it would process a suit filed against the Costa Rican Government over alleged labor rights violations. The litigation was suspended because of a visit to Washington, D.C., by Presidency Minister Rolando Lacle, during which he pledged to fulfill a series of demands presented by the powerful AFL-CIO. This year, the threat of economic reprisals continues because of the legal dispute involving cellular telephones and the Millicom Corp., as well as the resumption of the lawsuit by national unions over alleged noncompliance with proposed legislation. Anticipating a scenario that could turn critical for the national economy, Naranjo stressed: "We are going to work with different ministries. If there is a labor problem, the Foreign Ministry will work with the Labor Ministry. If there is a commercial problem, we will work with the Foreign Trade Ministry. Also, we will analyze any problem concerning intellectual property rights with the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of the Presidency." Naranjo added: "We are not trying to replace other ministries, but these coordination efforts must be led by the Foreign Ministry." The strategy to be implemented with the United States will be one of improving political ties, because "people settle their differences by talking to each other. If one speaks and makes proposals, there will be an understanding, while if no discussion is held and one's arguments are not explained, there will be disagreement and relations between the nations will tend to deteriorate," Naranjo asserted. Naranjo said that along with improved relations with the North Americans, he will promote a national dialogue on the impact of Costa Rica's possible integration into NAFTA. He said: "We have to think seriously about whether or not we should join the trade agreement, because it would mean seriously reforming the environment, labor laws, and the property system." He added: "I have the impression that some people are nonchalantly recommending we join NAFTA without thinking about the cost of doing this. This is why I think there should be a national consultation. Only after we have discussed this matter with every sector can we engage in suitable negotiations." Naranjo said he personally believes it will be good for the country to join NAFTA because it would offer guarantees to investors and open new markets. "The question is when and how this should be done," the economist said. Naranjo said the next government will make "great efforts" to strengthen its economic and commercial ties with Central America but will remain opposed to a political union. He said: "In the face of the challenges ahead, a small country such as Costa Rica can do very little by itself. We believe that there is strength in unity and that we must push to secure regional agreements on important issues, such as the marketing of bananas and coffee, as well as trade relations with Europe and NAFTA." The idea is, he said, "to consolidate Central American positions" on these issues by way of trade talks being held with other Latin American countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela. Regarding the rejection of political integration on the isthmus, Naranjo said it should not be sought until there is a national agreement on it, something that does not exist now. According to experts, Central American resentment toward Costa Rica derives from the current government's decision to separately initiate international efforts toward agreements, such as a trade pact with Mexico and the United States. At the past summit of Central American presidents in Guatemala City, it was decided, as a conciliatory measure, that those nations participating in regional integration efforts must inform the other countries in the region whenever they initiate trade talks with countries outside the region. The future Costa Rican administration will seek the formation of a bloc to discuss financial and economic issues of interest to 30 million Central Americans.
