Everyone must view this issue with enlightenment, responsibility, and awareness. The enemy seeks to kindle sedition and cause confusion. Our response should not in any way jeopardize security. In his monthly address in the army magazine, General Lahhud noted that temporary difficulties will not prevent the army from performing their duty to preserve national security and defend the south. Referring to the latest Israeli operation in al-Biqa', which resulted in the abduction of the resistance official, he said it was designed, among other things, to strike at our national morale and to create an atmosphere of fear and doubt. He said: What must be said is that we are still in conflict with the Israeli enemy because of their continued occupation of part of the south. As a result of the occupation, the enemy is suffering from continuous attacks despite their considerable resources. The enemy expand the scope of their aggression to boost their morale and to undermine our morale. We must prevent the enemy from achieving their goal by plugging the gaps created by their aggression. He said: What is more important is that, as military personnel, we know that the army was vigilant from the first moment of the Israeli operation and tried to do its duty in coordination with the Syrian Arab forces. Patrols were operating in the area where the Israeli forces landed and tried to assess the situation before intervening. But several military considerations, such as the difficult terrain and routes and the failure to define the target fast enough, prevented the army from foiling the operation. [passage omitted]
