He said unemployment in the federal capital and in Buenos Aires Province "has increased to about 12 percent." Cassia said: "Social unrest will grow daily if quick solutions are not found," adding: "Prevention is always better than cure." The trade union leader said the unemployment rate growth "is worrisome," adding: "If we compare our unemployment rate with other parts of the world, maybe it has not grown that much, but it is very indicative for Argentina." In remarks to a Buenos Aires radio station from Geneva, where he is participating in the International Labor Organization (ILO) Annual Assembly, Cassia stressed this morning that "there are unfair wages" in Argentina. Cassia pointed out: "We have provinces whose budgets are poorly allocated and whose three branches of government are paying fair salaries. But the workers are not asking for better wages; they just want to get paid." Cassia added: "Provinces like Chaco, Salta, and Catamarca have not paid their workers for four to six months." The oil workers union leader said: "The world's unemployment problem causes poverty, neglect, and specially social outcasts." He added: "This problem involves all liberal economies." He said that, since listening to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's speech this morning, "this issue is being taken very seriously." During his speech to the ILO General Assembly yesterday, Cassia said the CGT rejects any attempt "to regulate the free collective bargaining system in our country." He indicated: "We are willing to agree and not to dissent, but this does not include undue acceptances or complicity with interests contrary to our interests." Cassia added that economic changes in Argentina "must be implemented based on the existence of investment policies, with real participation of the workers in transformation processes, employment policies, and environmental protection." The trade union leader stressed: "We accept changes that will improve the Argentine economy, taking into account the social and labor situation through everyone's effort and equally shared burdens. We reject changes that seek to reduce the trade union presence as an balancing factor or seek to cause arbitrary and unfair deterioration of work standards."
