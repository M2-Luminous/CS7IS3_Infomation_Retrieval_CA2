Their speeches were marked by agreement regarding Europe. Cavaco Silva advocated a plural Europe respecting the various cultures. [Cavaco Silva] "We need a strong, ambitious Europe, able to act. But it will also have to show solidarity and cohesion. In order to maintain its dynamism, the European project cannot run the risk of distancing itself from public opinion. Europe has been built on and has become richer through recognition and respect for the different national identities and traditions. It is a formula that has served us well in the past and that no doubt will do so in the future." [Announcer] The prime minister of Luxembourg agreed with Cavaco Silva. Jacques Santer advocated a Europe without small and large. [Santer, in French with superimposed Portuguese translation] "It is as much in Portugal's interest as in Luxembourg's to prevent an institutional detour between the large, small, or medium-sized member states. The equality of all countries, be it regarding the composition of the European Commission, be it the rotating presidency of the Council or the right to vote, is as fundamental to us as it is to Portugal."
