The concentration of Serbian forces around Gorazde -- from the territory of the "FRY" alone, 60 tanks and 80 trucks packed with soldiers came over to Bosnia-Herzegovina -- was, unfortunately, just a drop in the ocean considering the scope of last week's Serbian military operations in the area of Brcko, Orasje, and Usora, and, especially surprising (after so many months of cease-fire), on the Mostar-Stolac front lines. The main brunt of their assault is to be expected in the area of Orasje and [Bosanski] Samac, where the Serbs are constantly applying pressure to expand the corridor (which in its present state cannot guarantee unobstructed passage and connections between "the Serbian lands" to their liking). Eighty tanks that have recently been stationed in Bijeljina (brought from Valjevo and Zajecar) and the presence of a great number of commandos from Nis, provide enough "guarantee" of the seriousness of Serbian intent and inevitability of a new battle for [Bosanska] Posavina. Furthermore, the Serbs even have the nerve to threaten towns on the left bank of the Sava -- Slavonski Brod and Zupanja -- trying to provoke new conflicts in Croatia as well. That the Serbs do not consider this war over, although they control two-thirds of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, is evident from the concentration of forces of the Eastern Herzegovinian Corps (some of whose units are also fighting in Gorazde) and additional units of "volunteers" and the regular Yugoslav Army in the Neretva valley, around Stolac and Mostar. Thus, long since stated Serbian desires to gain access to the sea and to the left bank of the Neretva are again in focus. Daily provocations along the demarcation lines, which sometimes grow into serious attacks, support this thesis. Those attacks became the daily practice after the signing of the Washington Agreement and they have recently escalated, causing panic among Muslims on the left bank of the Neretva. Naturally, the units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats are prepared to fight back and repel the possible Serbian offensive, that is, to defend Mostar and Stolac, if the Serbs threaten the territory under their control, but the Muslim side should be aware of this and change some of its views regarding the Washington Agreement (General Arif Pasalic in Mostar is one of the biggest obstacles to the normalization of relations) if it really wants to form the federation, which, among other things, would also have a joint defense against Serbian aggression.
