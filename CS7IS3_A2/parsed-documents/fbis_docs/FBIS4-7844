We are publishing his somewhat abridged and edited contribution. In April 1992, NARODNA ARMIJA informed its readers that "because of the successful conduct of war operations," 13 colonels had received special promotions to the rank of general, that 519 active military officers had received special promotions to higher ranks, and that 2,040 members of the Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] had been decorated for wartime services, 226 of them posthumously. Most of them, certainly, were honorable people, competent officers and heroic soldiers (although many of them did not know the goals of the war, nor could they understand, at least in the beginning, that the war that they were waging was not actually "their" war). Unfortunately, there were also those others.... The explanation of Colonel Ratko Mladic's special promotion said, among other things, that he was being granted the rank of general "for exceptional conduct and action in carrying out combat missions of particular importance for the armed forces and the country's defense, as well as for successful command and leadership, initiative, and personal bravery." At that time Ratko Mladic was chief of staff of the JNA's Knin Corps. What that "exceptional conduct and action in carrying out combat missions" looked like in practice is best illustrated by a detail from a book by Misha Glenny, a prominent BBC correspondent for Eastern Europe, The Fall of Yugoslavia, published in London in 1992. ``After he showed a weapon that he had personally captured from the defeated Croatian and Slovene fighters, General Mladic, who obviously enjoyed the attention of his listeners, giggled while he prepared to play us a recording of a recent telephone conversation between him and the head of the Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the nearby port of Split, one of the most militant HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] bases. Although they had not expected each other in the places they were in, it turned out almost immediately that they were old acquaintances: `Is that you, Mladic?' `Yes, old enemy, what do you want?' `My three guys disappeared somewhere near here... so I would like to know what happened to them.' `I think they are all dead.' `One of their parents is here in connection with it. Then I can tell them for certain that they are no longer alive?' `Yes, certainly, I give you my word. By the way, how is your family?' `Well, not bad, thanks. And yours?' `Fine, we are doing well.' `I am quite glad to hear it. By the way, since we are already in touch, we have about 20 bodies of your people here near the front; we killed them. We put them in a mass grave, and now they are stinking to high heaven. Could you perhaps come to collect them, because they are becoming really unbearable....'" "The friendship between the opposing merchants of death on a large scale was one of the most horrible phenomena that I observed during the war," Glenny commented. Who actually is General Mladic? Tito's Apprentice Ratko is a war orphan. He was born in the village of Bozinovici, near Kalinovik, in March 1943. He does not remember his father, but feels clearly, and today stresses emphatically, that he died a heroic death in 1945, attacking the village in Herzegovina in which the Croatian fascist leader Ante Pavelic was born. Mladic began his military career in an unusual way--by apprenticeship. As a 15-year-old, he left village life and headed for Serbia, for Zemun, where he graduated from a defense industry school, and then (when it was possible) enrolled in the ground forces' military academy. The military career of Second Lieutenant Ratko Mladic began in 1965. He was a platoon commander in Skopje, a battalion commander in Kumanovo, a brigade commander in Stip, the Pristina Corps commander's assistant for logistics, chief of staff of the Knin Corps, and then its commander. In all of those duties Mladic displayed impeccable loyalty to the communist regime, its commander in chief Josip Broz, and Yugoslavism, and he always successfully met high standards of moral and political suitability, which made possible for him an exceptionally rapid rise through the ladder of the military hierarchy. At that time Mladic did not talk about any sort of "Serbdom," about "Serbian military traditions," the "Serbian national interest," or a "unified Serbian state." He was clever and morally adept enough to know what he should say at what time. When he had completed all his military work in Croatia, on orders from the JNA military leadership he was transferred to Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order to fight on his native soil as a born Bosnian (since Yugoslavia "did not participate in the war" in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina), and in order to "liberate" it heroically, as an already proven fighter without fear or fault. The fact that it is claimed now and then, especially abroad, that while fighting in Croatia Ratko Mladic "remembered the past, his deceased father and his unhappy childhood, and let loose his inborn sadism" can but does not have to be accepted. The same thing could also apply to the claims that for everything that happened "in Gospic and Zadar, as well as other areas in which his units fought, Mladic is one of those most responsible for the war crimes that happened on the territory of Croatia." With respect to the war in Croatia, however, it remains an indisputable fact that the former Yugoslavia's Secretariat for National Defense, responding in writing to a report by the international organization Helsinki Watch on violations of the rules of humanitarian law by the JNA (whose general Ratko Mladic was), admitted that such violations had occurred, and "that those violations in this conflict were committed by individual members of the JNA or members of other armed units under the JNA's responsibility...." The response then states that proceedings had been initiated before military courts against several dozen military personnel "who had committed robberies," "crimes against the civilian population," "rapes of women of Croatian nationality," and so forth. The above-mentioned response by the Federal Secretariat for National Defense to Helsinki Watch also contains other admissions of violations by the JNA of the rules of humanitarian law. Thus, among other things, it is emphasized that a multitude of camps were formed for the "reception" of prisoners, that those camps were also located "outside of Serbia... in Knin, Bileca, Stara Gradiska," that "one cannot deny that (in those camps) there were cases of excessive behavior and attempted physical abuse of the prisoners," and that "several individuals who performed guard duties were replaced" for that reason (!). The military leadership also admitted that "the report states quite correctly that during the armed conflict in Croatia many religious and health care facilities suffered (churches, hospitals, and so forth)," and that the same situation as with Vukovar also existed "in many other places (Zadar, Sibenik, Vinkovci, and so forth)." Can Ratko Mladic, like many other conceited warlords in this war, really believe that he will succeed in evading his undoubted responsibility for the crimes of members of the army that he led throughout the war in Croatia and which he headed? In response to a question from NIN's reporter (on 12 February 1993), however, about whether he was upset by the fact that the Americans, Croats, and Muslims had declared him a war criminal, Mladic said: "I would be concerned if a list were published in France or the United States of the war criminals who committed crimes near Dien Bien Phu, in Vietnam, in Cambodia, and in other places." Such careless reasoning is simply striking, when he virtually equates his actions in the war in Bosnia and Croatia with the crimes that were committed so many years ago by professional killers in Vietnam and Cambodia! "The Burning of Sarajevo" It was only when he arrived in Bosnia as a JNA lieutenant general that Mladic liberated all his destructive energy and let loose his warlike passions. Everything contributed to that behavior of his. Two magnates, Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman--the inviolate "gods of war" in this region of ours--had already (according to many reliable claims) reached an agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. A third magnate, Alija Izetbegovic, balancing between the international community, primarily the Americans, and Islamic fanatics, and often courting Tudjman as well, decided that he would not allow them to do anything like that. The Serbian side found an executor for its destructive business in a God-given figure for something like that--Ratko Mladic. During the initial period of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbs were superior in heavy artillery. Mladic's army was the only one that had (truly respectable) heavy artillery. Naturally, the militant general could not help but make maximum use of that chance. Everywhere around Sarajevo, he deployed dozens of large-caliber steel barrels (76, 105, 122, 130, and 155 millimeters, 128-millimeter Plamen and Oganj multiple rocket launchers, and 60, 81, 82, and 120-millimeter mortars), and, in accordance with the plan of vengeance whose ideological creators sat in Belgrade and in Pale, he began the long-awaited war feast. Actually, Mladic knew quite well that no one, objectively, was in a position at that time to offer him any serious resistance, and so he roared where it was actually necessary, and also where there was no military or any other justification at all for anything like that. The cost of destroying Sarajevo was no longer important at all. What was important was to "teach a lesson" to Alija and his followers. That is why Sarajevo was destroyed, burnt, and demolished for months, and its people were butchered and killed. In moments of rage, and even instinctive hatred of the enemy, the air force was also summoned "to help." And the enemy? To the extent to which he was capable of doing anything serious at that time, he did not turn the other cheek. Muslims, Serbs, and Croats suffered equally from Mladic's artillerymen and their shells. In the beginning, admittedly, the JNA used its transport aircraft to save citizens of Sarajevo, primarily those of Serbian nationality and the family members of active military personnel. Close to 100,000 Serbs, however, were left in their homes in Sarajevo to attempt, sharing the fate of their fellow citizens of other nationalities, to await the end of the war. Mladic's artillerymen were thus also the killers of their own people. Together with their general, they also earned awards, decorations, and promotions on the basis of Serbs' wartime suffering. If he ever does answer for the war crimes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, however, the most serious accusation against Mladic, of course, will be because of Sarajevo. According to the testimony of an officer responsible for organizing communications in Pale, Mladic taped many of his most unpopular measures in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thus, often carried away by the rage and brutality characteristic of him, he invented the previously unknown commands to artillery units: "Burn," "roast." "Idiotic Statements" Mladic's behavior almost infallibly leads to the conclusion that he is a person who, when the military situation requires, can be both a cynic and a sadist. Here is one example: "Even one life lost in this insane war is a lot. The losses on our side were not high.... I do not know about the casualties on their side, but I think that they were massive.... They would have been even higher if we had not spared them!" After the failure of British Lord David Owen, cochairman of the Conference on Yugoslavia, to persuade the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs in the Bosanka villa in Belgrade to accept the Vance-Owen maps (on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina into 10 provinces), General Mladic, in response to a reporter's comment that Owen had left the meeting quite angry, said "with a characteristic sly expression on his face," "Not at all, he was a refined and mild person, who cannot get angry. It must be that this Belgrade sun got in his eyes, and so it seems to you that he is angry." And in response to a reporter's question about what was the biggest obstacle to peace, Mladic said: "The biggest obstacle to peace is war!" The law always lay in a mace for Ratko Mladic. He knew how to draw it even when political decisions were involved. As the already "glorified" commander of the Knin Corps and a person who had learned not to listen to anyone, as soon as he arrived in Bosnia, in Pale, he demanded "that the political leadership of the Bosnian Serbs immediately and unconditionally put itself under his control and not adopt any political decisions without the permission of (his) military command" (!). Somewhat later, when the Americans and the EC, because of the more frequent shelling of Sarajevo, requested permission from the UN Security Council for carrying out airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs' artillery positions, Mladic threatened nothing more or less than "bombing London and Washington"! General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of the Serbian army in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, took his militant commander under his protection. Milovanovic said that General Mladic was not thinking of a conventional bombing of the capitals of the United States and Great Britain, but was instead talking about bombing "from within." Serbian "kamikazes" had already been "installed" in the above-mentioned areas and were only awaiting instructions from Pale, the general concluded! Because of his generals' "idiotic and irresponsible" statements, as he called them, Karadzic suffered a great deal of unpleasantness. On 17 May 1993 he was forced to refute Mladic publicly. He said that the general "reacted emotionally when he stated that he would bomb London and Washington, and that he was not authorized for anything like that." After the successfully conducted operation Lukavac-93 (Mladic would say of it, "it encompassed the area from Gorazde to Ivan-Selo; its goal was to link Herzegovina with the other areas of the republic of Srpska and territorially link up the Serbian people from Kupa and Korana to Timok!"), the general triumphed again. In July 1993 he sent the Muslims an arrogant message: "They should not dream that anyone else will protect them. They will protect themselves if they abandon their weapons! If they give them up, they can live in the territories that we leave them. Even that is a lot for them.... It is up to Alija and those who advise him to think about what they will do. I have left Sarajevo for last!" In all of his statements, in any case, almost every inch of Bosnia-Herzegovina is originally Serbian! In February 1994 he would also utter this judgment regarding Srebrenica: "It has been a big Islamic and Turkish stronghold since their arrival in this region.... That settlement was erected on Serbian land, and so by the rule of inheritance (!), it does not belong to them (the Muslims), even though they were the majority population there.... If it had not been for the interference of the international community, they would have paid the price for everything that they have done to the Serbian people until now.... The Srebrenica Turks committed the biggest crimes against the Serbian people in the suppression of the rebellion against the Turkish governor!" Or: "We had very strong clashes for the village of Osmace," Mladic recalled on the same occasion. "It was a large Muslim village in which no Serb had ever set foot until we liberated it." Mladic was able to say of the Serbian, Croatian, and Muslim mothers who protested against his hatred, sadism, and wartime madness and those of all the others, as well as of the organizers of antiwar demonstrations: "During that time (from 1991 to 1993--author's note) a terrible destructive movement developed... attempting to embody some sort of love movements, mothers' movements... They were allegedly some sort of conscience of the Serbian people.... They are well-rehearsed quasipolitical animals" (!). Warlord Stepa's Cap Generals, whose political outlooks as a rule are very limited, who rely in every matter primarily upon military force and power, often try to interfere in politics and to have the main say in it. Such people usually hang up their epaulets very soon. Political history is full of such examples, but the freshest ones are precisely those which have to do with the fates of some of the generals in the UN forces on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Will Ratko Mladic also suffer that fate? Radovan Karadzic, we would say, did not completely succeed in curbing Mladic from publicly stating his own views on the war in Bosnia and talking about its cases very frequently. Two statements which are, to put it mildly, unusual, are associated with his first (and probably last) official visit to Geneva: "During my visit to Geneva," Mladic said, "I watched various West European TV channels. They have a very controlled system. In the first part of their news broadcasts, they give everything that is wonderful in their country.... And poverty in the West is even worse, but they do not show it. The West has realized that the human brain has limited capacity and so it moulds it like well-mixed dough." The general's second statement has to do with his "concern" about the fate of the world: "During my visit to Geneva, in the negotiations, I noticed (!) great concern among ordinary people over what is happening in our country. People are frightened.... The war which happened to us can easily spread to them, especially if there were some sort of foreign military intervention in our region." Finally, let us also say this. General Mladic was also able to offer these "international guarantees" to the head of an internationally recognized state (more or less), Alija Izetbegovic: "What I guarantee (you) is the same thing as when the Almighty gives you a guarantee." At one time, when politicians on both sides of the Drina, and also many outside this area, assessed that at the given moment it was advisable--politically, diplomatically, and militarily--to accept the Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia, because any subsequent solution could be both worse and more painful for the Serbs in Bosnia and Yugoslavia, General Mladic was asked (as we have learned from the well-documented book by Dragoslav Rancic, Dobric Cosic, a President Without Power) to be among the first to speak in the Republic of Srpska Assembly, and to use his prestige to influence the militant delegates to accept the plan. In contrast, those who know claim, "during his 45-minute speech he advanced the `crowning arguments' and definitively destroyed all doubts in connection with the fate of the peace plan." Mladic, they say, personally prevented Republic of Srpska Assembly deputies from going to Belgrade and participating in the work of the "all-Serbian parliament" at which a decision was being made on the same issue. The extent of Mladic's hotheadedness and willfulness, but also of his insufficient ability in maters in which the mind prevails, is very illustratively confirmed by these few sentences from Cosic: "...The military leadership of the Bosnian Serbs also bears the responsibility for Herzegovina. They did not give the people of Herzegovina everything that we sent them. Mladic even wanted a counteroffensive, which would make the situation in Herzegovina worse...." Asked what influence he had over Karadzic and Mladic, Cosic answered, "Modest, insignificant. Many of my efforts have failed so far. We were able to reduce some disasters. No war has ever been rationally conducted, however, including this one. Peace is a vital interest for us. The longer the war, the more dishonorable the compromise." How visionary these words of Cosic's were, which were uttered almost a year ago, is best confirmed by today's events (February 1994). Mladic, however, wanted war then, as always before. And he has had it! For how long? In mid-August 1993, the well-known English reporter Robert Fox published a lead article in the London Daily Telegraph about the 30 most dangerous "warlords." "Some of them," Fox said, "see themselves as saviors of their nations, others are common gangsters, and yet others are sadistic opportunists...." As many as 16 well-known international correspondents were involved in the compilation of Fox's list of "warlords," which also included five of "ours." One of the places also belonged to General Mladic: "Ratko Mladic: based in Pale; territory 65-70 percent of Bosnia; forces 70,000-100,000 men, plus tanks, artillery, and aircraft.... The person who decides on war and peace in Bosnia. A tactical genius, but according to officers who have negotiated with him, also a madman. One representative of the UN describes him as a sadist, a psychopath, and an extremely dangerous individual...." At one time Vuk Draskovic asked, "Do we really want the world to understand us through such politicians and such conduct of the war? I will not admit that Serbs are the ones who put Warlord Stepa's cap on their heads and then think that they also have Warlord Stepa's head under the cap, babbling from TV screens, `We do not take prisoners, we kill them all!'" Although I do not care for Mr. Draskovic, I must admit that there is nothing to add to this.
