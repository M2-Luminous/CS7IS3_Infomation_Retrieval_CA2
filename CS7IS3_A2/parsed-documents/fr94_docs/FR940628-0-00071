FR940628-0-00071 FR940628-0-00019 Section 195.106␣Internal design pressure. Section 195.106(a) prescribes the formula for calculating the design pressure of steel pipe. In addition, §195.106(b) regulates the pipe yield strength used in the design pressure formula. When the specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) of pipe is unknown, §195.106(b) requires that yield strength be derived from tensile tests on random samples of pipe. Based on a comparable gas pipeline safety standard (49 CFR 192.107(b)(2)), RSPA proposed to amend §195.106(b) to allow operators to use 24,000 psi as yield strength if pipe of unknown SMYS is not tensile tested. Editing changes to §195.106(b) were also proposed. The 10 THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment of §195.106(b) supported it (5 did not vote). In addition, RSPA received comments from four operators and one pipeline-related association. The association and three of the operators agreed with the proposal. One of these operators suggested further editing, part of which RSPA has included in the final rule. One operator was concerned that the proposed rule could unjustifiably reduce the MOP of its pipelines. The operator said its pipelines are made of Grade B pipe (yield strength at least 35,000 psi) or better. However, some pipelines may contain pipe for which documentation of yield strength or tensile testing does not exist. For such pipe, without new tensile testing, yield strength would have to be assumed to be 24,000 psi. The operator suggested that RSPA allow operators to use appropriate evidence besides tensile tests to demonstrate the yield strength of pipe. In response to this comment, we note, first, that the proposed amendment to §195.106(b) would not affect the design pressure of existing pipelines unless they are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed (see §195.100). Second, §195.106(b) currently requires operators to use as yield strength either SMYS or a value based on tensile testing. So the operator's apparent difficulty in verifying yield strength is a problem of compliance with the current rule. Third, the proposed rule would relax the burden of tensile testing only when MOP does not exceed the level that corresponds to a yield strength of 24,000 psi. When a higher MOP is desired, operators must use the tensile testing option. Finally, RSPA is not aware of any acceptable evidence of the yield strength of pipe of unknown SMYS apart from appropriate tensile testing. Thus, the amendments to §195.106(b), as discussed above, are adopted. Section 195.204␣Inspection-general. The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the proposed change to make the language gender neutral and, except for a minor correction, no objections were received from commenters. The proposed change is adopted as corrected. Section 195.228␣Welds; standards of acceptability. One of the comments we received on proposed amendments to nondestructive testing requirements under §195.234(e) (discussed infra) concerned the standards for acceptance of weld flaws (§195.228(b)). A pipeline-related association asked us to incorporate by reference the alternative acceptance standards for girth welds that are in the Appendix to American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 1104 (17th edition). For weld acceptability, §195.228(b) now references the standards in Section 6 of API Standard 1104. In a notice of proposed rulemaking involving our review of the gas pipeline safety standards in 49 CFR part 192 (Docket PS&hyph;124; 57 FR 39572; August 31, 1992), RSPA proposed to allow gas operators to apply the API appendix in addition to section 6 criteria. Although that proposal was based on a petition by API to incorporate the appendix by reference in both parts 192 and 195, we overlooked the request to include such a proposal in the present rulemaking. In the part 192 rulemaking, RSPA's gas pipeline safety advisory committee voted to support the proposed amendment. Also, all but one of the public comments were in favor of allowing use of the Appendix of API Standard 1104. The dissenting commenter was concerned that industry inspection personnel may not be qualified to apply the appendix. However, this commenter may not have recognized that under §§192.243(b) and (c), operators must ensure that nondestructive testing is performed in accordance with written procedures by persons who have been properly trained and qualified. Sections 195.234(b) and (c) provide similar requirements for nondestructive testing of welds on hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. RSPA believes these requirements are adequate to assure proper application of the appendix. The Appendix of API Standard 1104 applies equally to girth welds in gas and liquid pipelines. This amendment is not mandatory, rather it provides pipeline operators an optional operating procedure. In view of the prior opportunity for public comment on use of the appendix for gas pipelines, the favorable response by public commenters and RSPA's advisory committee, and the fact that use of the appendix would not be mandatory, we believe that a further opportunity for public comment is unnecessary to allow use of the appendix under §195.228(b). We feel this amendment is a logical outgrowth of the Notice and furthers our efforts to make parts 192 and 195 consistent wherever possible. This amendment will not have a substantial impact on the regulated community.
