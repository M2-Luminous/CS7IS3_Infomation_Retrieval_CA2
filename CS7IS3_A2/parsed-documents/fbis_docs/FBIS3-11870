Fernando Botero, Samper's campaign manager, believes Pastrana offered the vice presidency to several Liberals in what he called a "cunning electoral maneuver," but none of them were willing to side with him. Meanwhile, Humberto de la Calle Lombana, Liberal vice presidential candidate, said Ramirez is a young and intelligent man, but an absolutely beatable candidate. Samper's official position on the Pastrana-Ramirez slate was outlined on 19 March -- the same day the Conservative ticket was announced -- through a statement issued by Samper's campaign manager. According to the Liberals, the choice of Ramirez should generate three reactions from the public. First, Pastrana's decision "signifies his own explicit acknowledgment of the huge failure of the supraparty strategy he announced with much hoopla the day he was nominated." The statement added: "Second, Colombians must be fully aware that, by law, Ramirez is unqualified to be a vice presidential candidate or, under the very remote chance of a Conservative victory in the 8 May elections, to occupy the vice presidency or the presidency of the Republic. Without belittling Ramirez's personal and professional qualifications, it is more than obvious that he was until yesterday a government minister, and this obviously makes him ineligible to run for the vice presidency." The Samperist viewpoint contends that Colombians now have two alternatives which radically oppose one another. One alternative is the Liberal ticket which, according to Samper, "represents a serious and experienced team that is deeply committed to the people and social capitalism." The other one is "the inexperienced Conservative Pastrana-Ramirez ticket, which exemplifies fruitless, uncontrolled capitalism in the current electoral process." Its conclusion is that "all of this proves that Pastrana is unable [biche] to assume the serious responsibilities demanded by the Colombian presidency." Ernesto Samper's campaign also asserts that the difficulties Andres Pastrana encountered when trying to find a running mate convey a lack of leadership and reduce his chances of winning. It notes that Pastrana offered the nomination to "many Conservative [as published] members," but was unable to get a positive answer. Another source said: "The truth is that Pastrana offered this candidacy to many prominent Liberals, but none would commit to this cunning electoral maneuver of hiding a wolf -- a Conservative candidacy -- in the sheep's clothes of a Liberal vice president." In the eyes of Samper's team, this is the last nail in what it calls "the coffin of supraparty sophism that Conservatives tried to use to deceive public opinion, which today is completely aware of the foundations of the Samper and Pastrana candidacies."
