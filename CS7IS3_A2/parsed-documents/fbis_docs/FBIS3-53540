[passage omitted] On Geneva talks held between the Syrian and U.S. Presidents yesterday, 'UKAZ, which is also published in Jeddah, said the meeting had earned a great importance in the view of the fact that Syrian and the U.S. could play a crucial role in realization of comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East. The Arab stand is based on the international legitimacy and the resolutions issued by the organization of the United Nations as well as on the principle of land in return of peace, said the paper. The daily criticized the endeavors of Israel to obtain Arab recognition and establishment of diplomatic and economic relations with the Arab countries before its withdrawal from the Arab territories. The U.S. in its capacity as the sole big power in the world and the sponsor of the peace process in the Middle East is expected to put pressure on Israel until it withdraws from the Arab territories and recognizes the legitimate Arab rights. On the same topic Jeddah-based AL-MADINAH said the summit conference of Geneva would enable Washington to activate its role as a mediator. The daily underscored the importance of U.S. political pressure on Israel so as to pave the way for the settlement of the Arab- Israel dispute. For its part Riyadh-based AL-JAZIRAH hoped that al-Asad-Clinton talks would pave the way for a real peace in the Middle East. The Arabs believe that the U.S. is the most qualified country to play an effective and decisive role in the peace process, said the paper. It is hoped that President al-Asad has successfully conveyed to Clinton the Arab demands for realization of peace, added the daily. Ad Dammam-based AL-YA'UM deplored the Israeli maneuvers to escape the implementation of the international resolutions. Through its maneuvers Israel is trying to obtain further Arab concessions, said the daily. It has become very clear that Israel will never positively respond to the peace efforts without effective pressure from a country like the U.S., it added. [passage omitted]
