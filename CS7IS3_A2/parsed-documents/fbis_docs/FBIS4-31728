The Moslems were especially aggressive on the eastern sector of the Teslic front, where they are threatening Serb positions by constant artillery barrage and small arms fire. Serb units are forced to return equally strong fire in order to protect their positions and defend their lives, the statement said. Moslems also stepped up small arms and mortar attacks on the Doboj front, especially under cover of the night. After the Serb side returned fire, the Moslems stopped attacking. Strong movements by the Moslems' motorized vehicles have been registered on this front, around Doboj. The Moslems are believed to be bringing in reinforcements from Tesanj and amassing these troops near Serb defense positions southwest of Doboj. Moslems also attacked Serb positions and villages with small arms fire on the northeastern slopes of Mt. Ozren in northern Bosnia, and on the left bank of the River Spreca. Serb units did not return fire.
