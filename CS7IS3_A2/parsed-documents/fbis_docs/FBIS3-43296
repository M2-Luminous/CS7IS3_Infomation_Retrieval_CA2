This follows a request to the government from the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] to deploy security forces in four areas of northern Natal to defend lives and property against the deteriorating security situation in the area. In his response, Law and Order spokesperson Craig Kotze is quoted on as stating that the TEC has no powers to order the government to deploy security forces in Natal and that such deployment would amount to an invasion. Kotze's reaction is based on narrow petty political interests that seek to curry favours with the National Party political allies. Coming in the wake of today's media reports that over 38 people were killed in Natal in violence related incidents over the New Year weekend, his statement is both insensitive to the plight of victims of violence and arrogant to the extreme. The ANC [African National Congress] is shocked that despite police reports that the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] had launched a campaign to drive ANC members from some areas and more violence was likely in the run-up to elections. It will be unfortunate if the perception is to deepen that the government has allowed the violence in Natal to escalate because it views black lives as cheap. As far as the ANC is concerned, all self governing territories are bound by the provisions of the TEC act. In this context we expect these provisions to apply to all self-governing territories without fear or favour. The primary duty of maintaining law and order in all areas of the country, including self-governing territories lies primarily with the South African security forces. In terms of the Self-governing Territories Constitution Act 21 of 1971 the homeland governments have no right to interfere with the "powers, entry into and presence of the South African security forces in the maintenance of public peace and order and the preservation of internal security in and the safety of the area concerned and the Republic". The act further places the onus for the maintenance of order, peace and internal security in such areas (self-governing territories) on the South African Police (SAP). Clearly the government has a moral and legal obligation arising from the self-governing territories act to bring peace and stability to Natal. It is ironic that the government which over the past years found it possible to detain, maim, and murder anti-apartheid activists residing in such areas should today find it politically inexpedient to bring about peace and stability in the same areas. We ask: What interests does the National Party government have in the escalation of violence particularly in the run-up to elections in Natal? The ANC and the public will hold the South African Government accountable for the escalation of violence as a result of the IFP plans to drive out members of the ANC from certain areas of Natal.
