This is an invitation to all medical organizations representing physicians to submit nominees for membership on the Council. Current members whose terms expire in 1995 will be considered for reappointment. Final selection from among qualified candidates for each vacancy will be determined by the expertise required to meet specific agency needs and in a manner to ensure appropriate balance of membership. From these nominations, the Secretary will appoint the members of the Council. Each nomination must state that the nominee has expressed a willingness to serve as a Council member and has provided a short resume or description of the nominee's experience. To permit evaluation of possible sources of conflict of interest, potential candidates will be asked to provide detailed information concerning financial holdings, consultant positions, research grants, and contracts.
