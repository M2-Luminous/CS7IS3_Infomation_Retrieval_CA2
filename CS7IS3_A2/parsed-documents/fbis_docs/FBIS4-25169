Introducing intellectual resources to promote development is China's strategic policy." Ma Junru, director of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs, said this in a recent interview with ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE. Reportedly, last year, some 50,000 foreign experts were invited to work in China. At the same time, China also dispatched some 30,000 technical and managerial personnel abroad to receive training. Such "two-way personnel exchanges" across the national boundaries produced great effects. Conceptual Revolution Last November, on his return from a training course in Germany, a district magistrate in Beijing Municipality discussed with his subordinates the issue of establishing an institution to manage state-owned assets. Thanks to his efforts, the institution was set up quickly and began to function effectively. However, two months before that, the district magistrate did not have any interest in this matter and he put an `X' on the report submitted by his subordinates on the establishment of the state assets management institution. The district magistrate and tens of thousands of decisionmaking officials in China are gradually becoming experts from laymen in the rising tide of the market economy, gradually becoming enthusiastic advocators and performers instead of onlookers. The conceptual revolution, which is going on quietly, has greatly benefited from the enhanced insight of the decisionmaking managers and administrators who received training abroad in recent years. Ma Junru told this story with deep feelings. The State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs, which also takes charge of these affairs, has boldly advanced the work of dispatching managerial personnel abroad to receive training in recent years. According to the traditional practice, only factory directors and business company managers can be sent abroad to receive training and policymaking officials at the higher levels would have no such opportunities. If they could make any foreign inspection tours, they would just be able to scratch the surface rather than learn something profound. Beginning in 1992, the convention in this field was broken and policymaking administrators could also step out of the country in the capacity of students to study the advanced management skills in foreign countries. Ma Junru said: Policymaking cadres and senior managerial personnel are urgently required to have a good knowledge of the market economy. In the practice of building the socialist market economy, China should not do everything from the very beginning; instead, it should take over the existing successful and advanced methods and skills developed by other people. Thus, China can avoid undergoing many twists and turns, can lower the costs, and can quicken the pace of reform. Last year, when more and more people had a strong interest in futures, the State Economic and Trade Commission organized a number of responsible officials to take a training course about futures at Illinois University in the United States and practiced in Chicago's large futures market. As a result, the trainees acquired a much deeper understanding of the U.S. futures market and also had some new ideas about China's futures market. Then, they submitted a report about the development of the futures market to the central authorities and the report aroused the close attention of the central leaders. Considerable Results Ma Junru, 59, was engaged in microelectronics research for a long time. In the past he has been successively director of the Basic Research and High Technology Department of the State Science and Technology Commission and responsible person of the Technological Section of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He took up his current post in August 1991. His work experience brought about a rigorous work style. In order to explain the urgency of introducing intellectual resources in China, he cited a string of figures and used "eating a meal" as a figure of speech. Several years ago, the State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs invited Japanese rice expert Masaichi Hara to spread the advanced rice cultivation techniques in China. As a result, good harvests of rice were reaped in large areas of northeast China. The advanced techniques were then further spread to Hebei, Xinjiang, and Gansu. Director Ma said: "We have 480 million mu of paddy fields. If the advanced techniques are adopted for all these fields, great results will be achieved" Therefore, the old Japanese expert was given a letter of commendation signed by Premier Li Peng. When visiting China, the Japanese Emperor also received him at the Diaoyutai National Guest House. In the field of manufacturing industry, Shanghai's Dazhong- Santana succeeded in producing the cars wholly in China by adopting imported technology; Beijing Piano Plant recovered from the recession and sold its highly popular products at home and abroad; Shenyang Beer also won an award by freeing itself from its predicament; and Changsha Air Blowers succeeded in exporting its products to overseas markets. All such successes were inseparable from the wisdom and hard work of foreign experts. Long-Term Strategy "Taking in and sending out" is not China's creation, still less is it a stop-gap measure only for the time being, said Ma Junru. In the world, such countries and regions as Japan, Singapore, the ROK, and even China's Taiwan and Hong Kong have all adopted similar measures. This played a great role in the economic take-off and recovery of these countries and regions. In general, they gained greater benefits than the developed countries did. As for the import and export of intellectual resources, some less developed Third World countries are often "exporters." For example, some 100,000 university graduates and well-educated professionals from China are now working in the United States; but only several thousand American experts come and work in China every year. Therefore, China has to make unremitting efforts over a long time in order to import intellectual resources. According to Director Ma, at present, the foreign experts invited by China are mainly engaged in educational and technical work, or are working with some large projects and foreign-funded enterprises. They are making greater contributions to China's reform, opening, and economic development. The authorities concerned are considering the plan for introducing intellectual resources on a larger scale during the Ninth Five-Year Plan so that the work in this aspect will better serve the adoption of the state's major reform measures, the transformation of management mechanisms in large and medium-sized enterprises, the decisions on launching major projects, and the improvement of the management of township and town enterprises.
