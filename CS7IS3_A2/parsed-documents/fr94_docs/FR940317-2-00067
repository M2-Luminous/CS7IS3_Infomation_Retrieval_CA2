FR940317-2-00067 FR940317-2-00043 Health Resources and Services Administration Final Strategic Directions for Cooperative Agreements for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Regional Education and Training Centers Program for Fiscal Year 1994 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), announces the final strategic directions to continue the development of the AIDS Regional Education and Training Centers (AETCs) program for one year. This program is authorized under Section 776(a), (previously section 788A), title VII of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Eligibility and Purpose Awards are made to accredited public and nonprofit private entities and schools and academic health science centers in meeting the costs of projects_ 1. To train the faculty of schools and graduate departments or programs of, medicine, nursing, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, public health, mental health practice (clinical psychology, clinical social work and marriage and family therapy), and allied health, to teach health professions students to provide for the health care needs of individuals with HIV disease; 2.

To develop and disseminate curricula and resource materials relating to the care and treatment of individuals with such disease and the prevention of the disease among individuals who are at risk of contracting the disease. Project Requirements The following project requirements, which were published in the Federal Register in FY 1989, after public comment dated September 8, 1989, 54 FR 37378, will be continued in FY 1994. The project requirements are designed to direct Federal resources where the greatest needs exist. Each project must define a geographic region and identify the types of providers to be targeted for training within that region. Thus, the focus in FY 1994 will continue to be on clinical education of primary care providers in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areas. Consistent with this emphasis is the requirement that a minimum of two-thirds of the Federal funds provided must be expended to provide education to primary care providers (i.e., physicians, nurses, dentists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and dental hygienists). In addition, at least 50 percent of project funds must be expended for training activities in high AIDS incidence Metropolitan Statistical Areas identified prior to the competitive awards of high AIDS incidence MSAs identified for funding through the ``Ryan White'' CARE ACT program. Each ETC must provide or perform the following: •Clinical training of primary care physicians, nurses, dentists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and dental hygienists; •Training of other health professionals such as mental health care providers and case managers; •An updated needs-assessment of the education and training needs of the primary care providers within the proposed service area which is linked to the allocation of Federal funds; •Training in risk assessment, prevention, early intervention, and treatment; •Development of primary/tertiary care linkages and networking; •Outreach to minorities, including involvement of minority providers, minority professional organizations, and minority health care delivery systems; •Linkages to ``Ryan White'' CARE ACT, titles I, II, III, and IV funded health services programs and the Hemophilia and Pediatric/Family HIV Health Care Demonstration Programs; •Linkage to PHS funded migrant (Sec. 329(a)(1)) and community health (Sec. 330(a)) centers, health care for the homeless programs (Sec. 340) State and local health agencies and health care facilities involved in providing care for HIV infected individuals; •Linkage with substance abuse programs; •Collaboration with health professions organizations in the proposed region; •Networking with other community agencies to concentrate on filling the gaps in training; •Dissemination of state-of-the-art information and educational materials in concert with other PHS agencies, using mechanisms such as hotlines; •Program assessment and data collection on program and trainees which can be used for regional and national evaluative purposes; and •Plan for future non-Federal funding of project.
