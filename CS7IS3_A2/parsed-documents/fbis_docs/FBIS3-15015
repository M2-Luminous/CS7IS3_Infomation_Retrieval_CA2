The information says: The Georgian parliament must make a significant decision today on whether or not Georgia should join the CIS. The significance of this step is stipulated by the choice that our state is faced with today. Today each one of us must decide, as our conscience and intelligence prompts us, whether to follow the path of emotions, illusions and -- proceeding from this -- dashed hopes, or to make a serious analysis of reality and take a pragmatic attitude to our everyday issues. The break-up of the Soviet empire on the one hand created 15 independent states, but on the other hand, it created a new danger both for the development and existence of these countries and for the whole world. If events further developed according to this scenario, they would end with a complete catastrophe. This is what stimulated the search for the ways out of the grave situation and in my mind, the creation of the CIS was the result of this search. In the beginning the CIS was not a structure that could effectively resolve the issues of Georgia and other countries, but, in the meantime, in the process of its self-determination, a whole range of significant issues were being worked out and mechanisms for comprehensive cooperation established. Georgia did participate in the work of different organizations of the CIS, but this was chiefly in the status of an observer, which limited our influence on the process of adopting a decision, and our national interests were not fully observed. During this period, Georgia tried to regulate relations with other former Soviet republics. A fairly strong legislative basis for bilateral political and economic relations was being dynamically created. However, in the new circumstances and against the background of the processes of regional integration, this did not prove to be enough. The development of the processes within the CIS has once again proved the truth that securing political, military, and economic interests can only be carried out effectively if a bilateral cooperation is replaced by the mechanisms of comprehensive cooperation. The CIS may not represent a definite guarantee for security, but it is one of the factors for legally securing our territorial integrity and the inviolability of our borders. The regulations of the CIS also envisage the creation of mechanisms for the member-states' collective security, eradicating conflicts, and peacefully resolving disputes. The realization of the CIS regulations will help restore broken economic links and develop them on a completely new basis which is a necessary prerequisite for the reforms for transition to a market economy. Thus, becoming a member of the CIS will help our country to establish its place in the network of international and regional relations, to become a part of the mechanisms of comprehensive cooperation, and to use agreements on collective security and economic cooperation for reinforcing with law the country's territorial integrity, influencing the development of regional processes, and creating prerequisites for overcoming the economic crisis. By becoming a CIS member, our country is proving its aspiration for civilized development of international relations and is getting additional means for improving the country's social and economic situation; it is becoming a fully-fledged member of the CIS with all relevant rights and, of course, responsibilities. The CIS is in its initial stage of formation. The process of its formation is developing in quite a conflicting manner. Issues are seldom resolved without hot debates. Discussions are often uncompromising and severe. Will the West react negatively to Georgia's joining the CIS? There are different points of view on this issue in Georgia's political circles. I have the following point of view: Many inter-governmental structures have been created since World War II. Most of them proved viable and many countries poorer than Georgia have found their way out from the crisis and poverty. The CIS must share this experience; there will be then less ground for doubts and we can show everybody what we can do. The fact that we have already signed comprehensive agreements on friendship, cooperation, good-neighborliness, and mutual assistance with most of the CIS states gives us the hope that on the basis of work with natural allies we will be able to set up the CIS as a civilized and integrated union, and Georgia can make its honorable contribution in this respct. I am sure that our active participation in the CIS will assist in overcoming the current crisis, promoting stabilization, and halting the decline in the population's standard of living.
