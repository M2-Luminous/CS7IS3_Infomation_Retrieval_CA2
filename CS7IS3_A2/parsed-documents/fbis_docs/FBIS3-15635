The LDLP faction has an absolute majority in the Lithuanian parliament - 72 seats out of 140. On Monday [7 March], the faction began a series of closed meetings to analyze its own activities, as well as the work of the government and the opposition. The faction also intends to hold elections of its chairman. Although the meetings are closed, the leftist TIESA newspaper reported several details from a speech made by Justinas Karosas, the faction's current chairman. Karosas reportedly said that although the LDLP is a social democratic party in a post communist country, it must also fulfil non-social democratic tasks because such is the reality. The return to power is both an aim and a means for the opposition, he said. In Karosas' opinion, the opposition is weak and must be stimulated to make its activities more constructive. Discussing the faction's relations with the government, Karosas said they are difficult because the government does not always want to be controlled by the faction.
