FR940826-2-00139 FR940826-2-00071 [Release No. 34&hyph;34563; File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;94&hyph;15] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Corporate Governance Issues August 19, 1994. On June 23, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend certain provisions of its Constitution relating to corporate governance issues. On June 30, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to narrow the scope of the original filing. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley & Lardner, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated June 29, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). The proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34379 (July 14, 1994), 59 FR 37110 (July 20, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. The CHX's Board of Governors (``Board'') is responsible for managing the business of the Exchange and is vested with all the powers necessary for the government of the Exchange, the regulation of the business conduct of members and member organizations and the promotion of the welfare, objects and purposes of the Exchange. 4 Currently, the Board consists of twenty-four elected Governors, plus the Vice Chairman of the Board and the President of the Exchange. 5 Of the twenty-four Governors, sixteen must be members, general partners of member firms or officers of member corporations (``member Governors''); and eight must be unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker-dealer in securities (``non-member Governors''). 6 The CHX Constitution also requires that nine of the sixteen member Governors be from the Chicago area, at least three of whom must be active on the floor of the Exchange, and that seven member Governors be from outside the Chicago area. 7 4 See Article III, Sec. 1 of the CHX Constitution. 5 See Article III, Sec. 2 of the CHX Constitution. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Board from among the elected Governors. Id. Since 1992, the Chairman has served in a non-management capacity and has been primarily responsible for Board oversight of management performance. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31633 (December 22, 1992), 57 FR 62402 (December 30, 1992) (File Nos. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;92&hyph;12 and SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;92&hyph;13). The Vice Chairman of the Board is elected by the membership and must be active on the floor of the Exchange. See Art. III, Sec. 2 of the CHX Constitution. The Vice Chairman has the power, subject to Board approval, to appoint individuals to serve on certain Exchange committees. See Art. VI, Sec. 3 of the CHX Constitution. Finally, the President of the Exchange is appointed by the Board to serve at its pleasure. The President is the chief executive officer of the Exchange and cannot be a member or affiliated with a member organization during his or her incumbency. See Art. VI, Sec. 4 of the CHX Constitution. 6 See Article III, Sec. 2 of the CHX Constitution. For purposes of Board elections, the twenty-four Governors are divided into three classes, as follows: there are five member Governors and three non-member Governors in Classes I and III; there are six member Governors and two non-member Governors in Class II. Id. 7 See Article IV, Sec. 4(b)(i) of the CHX Constitution. The CHX proposes to amend its Constitution to achieve a governance structure under which the Exchange and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') and the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC''), 8 will be able to operate as a single, coherently run business. 9 In effect, the proposed rule change will enable the same individuals to serve on the Boards of the Exchange, MCC and MSTC. 8 For discussion of corresponding amendments to the By-Laws of MCC and MSTC, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34427 (July 21, 1994), 59 FR 38653 (July 29, 1993) (File Nos. SR&hyph;MCC&hyph;94&hyph;07 and SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;94&hyph;09) (``MCC/MSTC Proposal''). 9 The CHX has indicated, however, that the Exchange and its subsidiaries will continue to be separate legal entities. Telephone conversation between David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley & Lardner, and Beth A. Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on August 10, 1994. Under the proposed amendments to the CHX Constitution, five Governors will be added to the Exchange's Board, for a total of twenty-nine elected Governors plus the Vice Chairman and the President. 10 The proposed rule change also will create a new category of Governor to represent MCC and MSTC participants in the governance process. 11 Thus, upon approval and implementation of these proposals, the Board will include one additional non-member Governor and four Governors who are general partners or officers of a participant of MCC or MSTC (``participant Governors''). 12 10 The proposed rule change will not affect the powers of the CHX Board, see supra note 4 and accompanying text, or the method of selection and duties of the Exchange's senior officers. See supra note 5. 11 The Exchange has proposed conforming changes to other Constitutional provisions in order to reflect the creation of the new participant Governor category. See, e.g., Article IV, Sec. 5 (``Limitation on Service'') and Sec. 7 (``Nominations by Members''). 12 The five new Governors will be divided among the three classes, see supra note 6, as follows: there will be one participant Governor in Classes I and II, and two participant Governors in Class III; the additional non-member Governor will be placed in Class II.
