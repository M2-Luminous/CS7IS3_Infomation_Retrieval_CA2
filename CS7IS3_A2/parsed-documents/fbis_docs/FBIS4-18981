But behind the scenes, many delegations seem more likely to be scowling at each other. The uncertain mood reflects deep strains in a world trade system torn between conflicting impulses. One set is propelling economies towards steadily greater interdependence; but another threatens to drive them further apart. The cause of closer integration has been powerfully advanced by last December's Uruguay Round agreement, which ministers will sign next Friday. The most ambitious trade liberalisation deal in history, it is expected by some forecasters to enrich the world by about $3OO billion annually. Due to take effect next year, the round promises to step up the onslaught on economic frontiers which are already crumbling under the impact of technological innovation, freer capital mobility and instantaneous information flows. However, achieving these gains is likely to prove far from painless. The fiercer global competition grows, and the broader its impact, the tougher the industrial adjustments it requires. As a consequence, many governments face mounting domestic pressure to protect threatened interests. One symptom is this week's mass protests against the round in India. Still more serious is the threat of a lurch towards more aggressive unilateral policies and managed trade, which would strike at the basic principles of the GATT system. Its persistence has been underlined by the Clinton Administration's recently renewed pressure on Japan to open its market further or face possible U.S. trade sanctions. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the GATT, has condemned the trend as misguided and dangerous. "A new outbreak of bilateral trade tensions is putting the achievements of the Uruguay Round to the test even before they are fully operational," he said last month. Against this background, it is remarkable that a deal has been concluded at all. The more so since recession and stubbornly high unemployment in many industrialised countries make trade concessions harder to sell at home. As well as cutting tariffs, the round aims progressively to free trade in services -- a fifth of total world trade -- agriculture, textiles and government procurement. Though concrete liberalisation in some of these sectors has yet to be agreed, all have for the first time been brought firmly within the framework of GATT rules and disciplines. The round has also given birth to a new institution, the World Trade Organisation [WTO]. Due to take over from the GATT next year, the WTO will have greater authority to adjudicate international disputes and is intended as a permanent forum for trade negotiations. However, the power of any club to enforce rules is no stronger than its members' willingness to respect them. In future, attitudes seem likely to be influenced not only by swings in the economic cycle, but by a steadily accelerating shift in the world's economic centre of gravity to the south and east. Since the Uruguay Round was launched in 1986, a wave of liberalisation has swept across much of the developing world. It has paid off in faster growth and soaring exports, particularly of manufactured goods. As the table shows, gains in Asia have been particularly striking. The most potent element in the ascendancy of the emerging nations is the explosive growth of China which, on recent trends, could become the world's largest economy early next century. China's weight in international policy will be felt well before then if it succeeds in its plans to join the WTO this year. It is far from clear that the older industrialised powers which have long dominated world trade policy have yet come to terms with the implications of these developments. As they confront them, international frictions could intensify. One risk is of a retreat into protectionism. In several richer countries, job losses and declining industrial performance are already blamed on "unfair" competition from emerging economies with lower costs. Social and political issues may prove another source of divisions, to judge by the recent row over U.S. attempts to place labour conditions on the WTO agenda. The move has been attacked as a protectionist ploy by developing countries, some of which openly scorn Western notions of democratic values and human rights. However, the fault lines do not only run from north to south. Relations between the world's biggest trading powers are also strained most obviously by continuing bilateral tensions between Washington and Tokyo. Dealings between the U.S. and the European Union are marred by bickering over specific issues and by more general mutual suspicion. This has so far thwarted a common interest in working together to try to reduce Japan's trade surplus. Brussels remains deeply nervous about Washington's motives, while the U.S. decries the EU as cowardly and hypocritical. Underlying this mistrust are growing uncertainties about the direction of both powers' future policy. The biggest centre is in the United States, where the Clinton Administration has embraced a neo-mercantilist approach giving priority to government-backed promotion of exports and selected industrial sectors. "U.S. attitudes are undergoing a sea-change," says an international trade policy expert. One recent manifestation was the administration's decisive role in the $6 billion sale of Boeing airliners to Saudi Arabia. Another was its retreat from earlier demands that the Uruguay Round restrict government subsidies because it wanted the freedom to support U.S. high-tech industries. The export drive has added impetus to attempts to prise open foreign markets. As impatience for quick results grows, U.S. officials are increasingly disposed to view unilateral measures as preferable to the often slow and unwieldy mechanisms of the GATT. To its supporters the approach is a robustly practical defence of national interest. To its critics, who include many other GATT members, it amounts to bully-boy tactics which threaten to replace multilateral trade rules with the law of the jungle. Across the Atlantic, the balance is more delicately poised. Fears of a "Fortress Europe" have proved overdone. Yet France's readiness last year to take the Uruguay Round to the brink over farm trade underlines the fragility of the EU consensus. That it has remained intact and broadly liberal is due partly to the influence of Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner. But his successors may not be as committed to upholding free trade. If the United States drifted further towards unilateralism, the task might prove impossible. It is, however, by no means certain that will happen. Optimists point out that the Clinton Administration, while talking tough, has shrunk from pushing bilateral disagreements to the point of crisis. Furthermore, the Uruguay Round will meet U.S. criticisms of GATT disputes procedures by speeding them up. It will also curb use of unilateral weapons, such as U.S. section Super-301 trade sanctions, though Washington claims it will still have the right to invoke Super 301 in certain conditions. But probably the strongest safeguard of the integrity of the multilateral trade system lies in the changed attitudes of emerging economies. Once suspicious of GATT as a tool of Western capitalist exploitation, many now see it as a guarantee of their national interests. "At the start of the Uruguay Round, countries such as Brazil were still focusing heavily on a defensive third world agenda," says a Western diplomat in Geneva. "By the end, they were much more eager to press ahead with liberalisation of trade." As well as keeping markets open for their exports, GATT disciplines provide their governments with useful leverage to push through politically controversial reforms at home. The fact that these countries are also among the world's fastest-growing markets should, at least, give pause for thought to industrialised powers wavering in their commitment to multilateral trade policies. That, however, seems unlikely to prevent further stresses and strains between GATT's members. On recent evidence, the road from Marrakesh will prove no less tortuous than the one leading up to it.
