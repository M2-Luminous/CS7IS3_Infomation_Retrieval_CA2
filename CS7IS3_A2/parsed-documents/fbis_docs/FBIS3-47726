The Commerce source said that since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks Japan has favoured an organisation to counter what it sees as Washington's increased bargaining power. The ASEAN Secretariat was assigned last October to sound out whether other countries outside ASEAN would support the establishment of EAEC. But discussions with officials in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea have revealed neither strong support nor outright rejection of the proposal. [passage omitted] "EAEC is in the middle between ASEAN and APEC but it is still doubtful how members would benefit from EAEC as some already have a strong organisation in ASEAN, so why not expand ASEAN to cover other countries?" asked the Commerce source. He said he thought that the visit of a Malaysian delegation led by International Trade and Industry Minister Dato' Seri Rafidah Aziz to Thailand and other ASEAN countries this week was meant to lobby for the establishment of EAEC. [passage omitted] But he said there was no guarantee that EAEC would strengthen the region's bargaining power -- that would depend on the direction APEC takes. If APEC evolves into a bona fide trade bloc, EAEC would become irrelevant since all its prospective members would prefer to cooperate under the APEC umbrella. EAEC would have better prospects if it included non-APEC members such as the Indochinese countries, the source predicted.
