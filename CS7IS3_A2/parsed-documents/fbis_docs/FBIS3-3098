The two-day seminar was jointly sponsored by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund (IECDF) and Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research. Participants included officials from the IECDF, Foreign Ministry, World Bank and foreign envoys. The foreign guests came from the United States, France, Japan and Latin American countries. Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said at the opening ceremony that the Republic of China [ROC] is dedicated to helping friendly foreign nations establish small and medium enterprises. Chiang added that foreign aid is a mutually beneficial program which develops foreign friendship as well as boosts bilateral economic links. Taiwan received foreign aid from the United States and Japan during 1970's, and now the two countries are Taiwan's major import sources, Chiang said. Therefore, Taiwan's current economic aid to the Southeast Asian countries will eventually benefit Taiwan itself, Chiang said. Chiang also said he hopes the foreign aid fund, currently set at NT [New Taiwan] $10.5 billion (US$396 million), can be increased to NT$30 billion (US$1.13 billion). Since the government set up the IECDF in 1988 as an organization in charge of the ROC's economic assistance to friendly developing countries, a total of 17 loans worth over US$247 million have been approved. In addition, the fund has given out technical assistance worth some US$11.8 million.
