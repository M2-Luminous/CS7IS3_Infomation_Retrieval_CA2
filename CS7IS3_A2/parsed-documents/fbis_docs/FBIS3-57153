These documents include an appeal from Kronid Lyubarskiy, the well known defender of human rights and first deputy chief editor of NOVOYE VREMYA, to General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik, which we publish today. I notify you that citizen Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, born 1946, has committed a crime under Article 71 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code: "Propaganda of War." As is well known, the text of the article states: "Propaganda of war, in whatever form it may be conducted, is punishable by imprisonment for a term of between three and eight years." The circumstances of the case are as follows. The "Pisatel" limited-liability company and the "Bukvitsa" publishing cooperative produced a book by citizen V.V. Zhirinovskiy entitled "The Last Dash to the South" in a print run of 75,000 copies. The book was signed to press 28 September 1993 and printed at Moscow Printing Plant No 13 (30 Denisovskiy Street, 107005 Moscow) as order No 456. In the book the author propagandizes the unleashing of aggressive war against Russia's neighbors Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. It is this, it transpires from the text, that is reflected in the very title of the book. In particular, the book says: "I have already begun to develop my own geopolitical concept. I don't want to give it my name, the Zhirinovskiy formula, say, but the last 'dash' to the south and an outlet for Russia to the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea are really the task of saving the Russian nation" (page 63). "The idea emerged of the last `dash' -- last because it will probably be the last repartition of the world and it must be carried out in a state of shock therapy, suddenly, swiftly, and effectively" (page 64). "The last `dash' to the south. I dream of Russian soldiers washing their boots in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and switching to summer uniform forever. Lightweight boots, lightweight trousers, short-sleeved open-necked shirts with no tie, lightweight caps. And a small modern Russian assault rifle produced by the Izhevsk plant. These assault rifles are much better than UZI's. So any platoon of Russian soldiers can impose order anywhere" (page 66). "...we will make this last `dash' to the south. We badly need it, it is medicine that we must take. Medicine is not always sweet. Some people in Kabul, Tehran, and Ankara may not like this. But millions of people will feel better as a result" (page 67). "Our Army will perform this task. This will be a method of ensuring the survival of the nation as a whole, it will be the basis for the renaissance of the Russian Army. New armed forces can be reborn only as a result of a combat operation. The Army cannot grow stronger in military commissariats and barracks. It needs a goal, a task" (page 70). "The pros of carrying out this operation considerably outweigh the cons which may naturally be perceived. And the Russian Army also needs this so that our guys can flex their muscle, tired as they are of `hazing,' instead of sitting around in barracks, in the depths of Russia, waiting for the end of their term of service, not knowing where the enemy is, who the adversary is, or what they need to prepare themselves morally and physically for. This would be a cleansing for us all" (page 75). "May Russia successfully accomplish its last 'dash' to the south. I see Russian soldiers preparing for this last southern campaign. I see Russian commanders at the headquarters of Russian divisions and armies tracing the itineraries for the movement of troop formations and the destinations of the itineraries. I see aircraft at airbases in southern districts of Russia. I see submarines surfacing off the shores of the Indian Ocean and landing ships approaching shores along which Russian Army soldiers are already marching, infantry fighting vehicles are driving, and huge masses of tanks are moving. (The italics are V. Zhirinovskiy's.) At long last Russia completes its last military campaign" (pages 142-143). It is perfectly obvious that the above remarks constitute every indication of a full-blown crime under Article 71 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code. There are grounds for believing that this is not the only criminal episode on the part of V. Zhirinovskiy. Practically all the mass media reported V. Zhirinovskiy's statements regarding the possibility of delivering nuclear strikes against Japan and Germany and his threats to "give them a new Hiroshima" and a "new Chernobyl." V. Zhirinovskiy made these statements orally, so they are not documented. However, it should not be difficult to find journalists who witnessed these episodes and to check whether these criminal episodes did indeed take place and, if so, in what circumstances. On the basis of the above I ask you to open a criminal case against citizen Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy under Article 71 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code. The crime envisaged by this article ranks among particularly dangerous state crimes. Consequently V. Zhirinovskiy's actions affect the vital interests of all citizens, myself included, since they jeopardize everyone's personal safety. The election of V. Zhirinovskiy as a State Duma deputy, which, incidentally, took place after he committed the crime, cannot serve as grounds for refusing to open a criminal case. As is well known, this question has already been the subject of judicial consideration at the trial on the SCSE [State Committee for the State of Emergency] case in relation to defendants A.I. Lukyanov and V.A. Starodubtsev. At the court sitting 5 January 1994 the presiding judge, A.T. Ukolov, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Supreme Court Military Collegium, explaining his refusal to terminate the criminal case regarding Lukyanov, cited Article 98 of the Russian Federation Constitution. According to this article, the immunity of Federal Assembly deputies is not universal but limited and consists merely in the fact that deputies "cannot be detained, arrested, or searched unless detained at the scene of a crime, nor can they be subjected to a body search except as provided by federal law in order to guarantee other people's safety." The fact that deputies enjoy immunity does not preclude the opening of a criminal case and the carrying out of preliminary and judicial investigations regarding a deputy. The General Prosecutor's Office did not protest this decision by the Russian Federation Supreme Court Military Collegium and therefore showed solidarity with it. Since the criminal prosecution of State Duma Deputy A.I. Lukyanov and Federation Council Member V.A. Starodubtsev has not been stopped, then, in accordance with the principle of citizens' equality before the law (Article 19 of the Russian Federation Constitution), nothing can be a barrier to the criminal prosecution of State Duma Deputy V. Zhirinovskiy. If the question of arresting V. Zhirinovskiy arises in the future, the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office can ask the State Duma to strip Deputy V. Zhirinovskiy of his immunity under Article 98 of the Russian Federation Constitution. I do not know V.V. Zhirinovskiy's place of residence, but it can easily be established via the staff of the Russian Federation State Duma. I await your reply within the legally prescribed deadline. Respectfully [Signed] K. Lyubarskiy
