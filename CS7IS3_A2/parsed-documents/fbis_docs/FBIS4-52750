FBIS4-52750 "dreas093_a_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Ministers: Need for Deregulation Ministers: Need for Deregulation OW1305104994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1030 GMT 13 May 94 OW1305104994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and select cabinet ministers on Friday agreed on the need to come up with powerful measures by the end of June to promote deregulation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. At a ministerial meeting on government regulation plans, Hata said drawing up effective deregulatory measures is a mission of his administration, the top government spokesman told a news conference. The premier and the ministers also concurred on the need for each cabinet minister to take the lead on relaxing economically restrictive government regulations in the face of resistance from government ministries and agencies, Kumagai said. Friday's meeting drew Hata, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Management and Coordination Agency Chief Koshiro Ishida, Economic Planning Agency Head Yoshio Terasawa and Kumagai. Kumagai said the cabinet will convene a second ministerial get-together on deregulation possibly next week by inviting heads of ministries and agencies holding control over a number of regulations. The government has vowed to come up with full-scale deregulatory measures by the end of June as part of efforts to spur domestic demand and hence the nation's appetite for imports. The cabinet meeting came at a time when the government's administrative reform headquarters is striving to seek specific deregulation measures at its three working groups. Earlier Friday, a business leader urged Hata to relax various government regulations on real estate trading and telecommunications-related industries. Isao Nakauchi, vice chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), called on Hata at the premier's official residence and made the pitch. Nakauchi told reporters he informed Hata of his dissatisfaction with the government's working groups on deregulation, saying their talks have been dominated by bureaucrats and that opinions of the private sector have not been well reflected. Hata reportedly told Nakauchi, who is also chairman and president of Daiei Inc., a major supermarket chain, that he hopes to promote deregulation through the initiatives of his cabinet rather than the bureaucracy. In the morning, Keidanren submitted to Kumagai a letter urging the government to promote deregulation. Kumagai told his news conference that the working groups will bear sufficient fruit in their efforts to seek effective measures to ease regulations. "We must work to comply with requests from both at home and abroad, or what you might call real demands," the chief cabinet secretary said.
