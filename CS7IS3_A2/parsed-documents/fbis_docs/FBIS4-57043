Presidential spokesman Fernando Costa stated that the action coordinated by the Army is designed to stop the abuses being committed during the 52-day strike by PF policemen. President Itamar Franco stated that the Army's occupation will not end until PF policemen return to work. He said the government is only seeking to guarantee basic services, such as the issuance of passports and the guarding of airports and border areas. Franco said the government will not permit acts of disrespect against citizens, and emphasized that everything is being done in accordance with the Constitution. He said: [Begin Franco recording] I can tell you that this is a government that upholds dialogue, a democratic government that only called out the Armed Forces to preserve order. It is unacceptable for them to have used fireworks and to have prevented the PF director from entering the building. Those who are willing to strike may do so, but they have to do it in an orderly fashion, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws. All the executive branch has done is to enforce the Constitution and the laws, and it will continue to do so. [end recording] Franco made it clear that this is not an act of intervention, but an action taken by the government to guarantee the people's right to travel freely. He does not believe the government will lose face as a result of its decision to intervene in the PF. He said: [Begin Franco recording] I believe the government will not lose face for taking side with the people, whose right to travel freely is being curtailed. Thus I believe the government is, in this case, defending the people. [end recording] The decision to intervene in the PF was made last night during a meeting held by Franco with the military ministers, the justice minister, the federal administration minister, and the PF director. Costa reported that the operation began in Brasilia at 0140, and that President Franco was kept abreast of developments by General Fernando Cardoso, chief of the military household.
