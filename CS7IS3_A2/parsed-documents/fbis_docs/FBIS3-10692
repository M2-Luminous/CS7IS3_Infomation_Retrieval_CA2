It wants to face the future with clarity and without fear; society wants job and income security; security for its savings and investments; society wants security in its daily life and wants certainty in the institutional order, in politics, in the exercise of its rights, and in the work of the authorities. Society demands recognition of its maturity and capacity to cooperate and assume public responsibilities. It wants to actively participate in national progress but also demands greater responsibility from the parties, from which they expect democratic consensus, definite commitments, and reasoned proposals. Society demands from the authorities honesty, social sensibility, efficiency, and strict observance of the law. Society is willing to take on the challenges of change. It knows it must reform to move ahead. It values the efforts made, but it demands to go further. Society is aware that the bases have been laid down for a better future, but demands greater well-being, justice, and increased opportunities. In the face of these demands for certainty, responsibility, and change, the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] makes the following commitments; Mexico's Democratic Transformation Mexico's democratic transformation is our answer to the challenge to build an institutional and political order that gives the nation certainty. It is our answer to the demands for an open and responsible authority. It is the government's responsibility to guarantee security, order, and the framework of stability that democracy requires. It is up to the parties to work to build a proper and legitimate representation of social needs. It is up to society to encourage tolerance, legality, and openness in electoral processes. The effective exercise of his or her political rights through responsible participation is up to each citizen. Democratic transformation is an overall process that extends to all spheres of social life, and particularly to the electoral processes. Our pledge is to specifically encourage open electoral processes and seek a confident vote through institutional and civilized competition with other political options. In order to consolidate democratic transformation the PRI assumes that it is necessary to: -- Have full respect for public and private freedom. -- Favor the free expression of ideas. -- Encourage social well-being. -- Establish clear and fair rules for electoral processes. -- Motivate a culture for legality, dialogue, and the recognition of plurality. -- Encourage broad citizen participation. Guarantee Mexico's Sovereignty and Interests in the World Mexico is a sovereign State whose independence, unity, and integrity has been the work of generations. Our commitment is to strengthen the nation's sovereignty in the changing conditions of this century's end. There cannot be, nor should there be a separation between domestic and foreign policy. In the domestic sphere, sovereignty is upheld by the full exercise of political liberties, the keeping of the law, in the democratic exercise, and in a vigorous economy that should be the source of well-being and social justice. Internationally, fidelity to our principle of people's self- determination; no intervention; the peaceful solution of controversies; the prohibition of the use of threats or force in international relations; the states' equality before the law; international cooperation for development; and the struggle for peace and for international security have won us the respect and acknowledgement of the world community. To strengthen the nation's sovereignty the PRI makes a commitment to: -- Recognize that the nation's highest values and its first responsibility lie in the acknowledgement of sovereignty. -- Maintain the nation's direct control over the energetic resources and the state's control over the strategic areas pointed out in the Constitution. -- Act in strict compliance with our constitutional principles on foreign policy. -- Encourage international cooperation under shared opportunities and responsibilities. -- Sponsor our culture to reinforce the nation's identity and unity. Strengthen a Stable Economy In the process of economic change and trade opening, the state cannot leave aside its responsibilities, the state must maintain a framework of macroeconomic stability and guarantee opportunities for creativity's free development and social initiative. The state must also promote savings and investment; foster productivity; broaden regional infrastructure; support the modernization of micro, small, and medium businesses; promote job training; watch over the strict compliance of work regulations; and generate favorable conditions for salary betterment. The challenge in economic and social matters is to increase well-being, income, and the quality of life for all Mexicans. It is necessary to generate more and better jobs, increase the true salaries, and undertake an active social policy oriented particularly toward the groups that require greater support so they may be incorporated into the benefits of growth. We should be responsible with what we have already achieved in the economy, preserve it, and construct a new horizon of possibilities, without losing sight of the social objective that gives significance to all productive activity. Our commitment is of a responsible economic policy that is at the service of mankind, particularly to the less favored individuals and groups. For the development of a strong economy, the PRI promises: -- To guide the economy with a clear sense of responsibility to face the needs of the present and future generations. -- To promote stable economic growth that can lead to social welfare. -- To fight poverty and backwardness. -- To promote the creation of more and better jobs. -- To increase productivity and the income level of the population. -- To support the efforts of companies and guarantee fair competition. Balanced Regional Development The Mexican nation is made up of multiple regions with their own productive characteristics and traditions. The strength of the nation is the strength of its regions. To take full advantage of the potential of our regions is a fundamental condition for our economic growth and social welfare. There is no reason to justify the difference in opportunities between the rural and urban areas and among the various regions of the country. Utility services, education, health, and job opportunities must be distributed throughout the entire national territory. True regional development also requires a rational and careful exploitation of our natural resources. Each region, each community, each corner of our country is a unique expression of opportunities, culture, talent, and natural resources. The wealth of our national development lies in the natural, cultural, and social heritage of our regions. We promise to close the gap that separates our rural reality from urban life, preserving the natural conditions for the development of future generations. To promote regional development, the PRI promises: -- To support a balanced development that can integrate the various regions of the country with the national and international markets. -- To expand the communication and transportation infrastructure. -- To carry out actions aimed at improving the quality of life in urban areas. -- To expand economic development opportunities and improve social welfare levels in rural areas. -- To take advantage of the natural resources of each region in a rational and well-balanced manner. Social Reform Our party's basic aspiration is to improve the quality of life of those who face the greatest deprivation and limitation. The economic progress of the last few years places us in a favorable position to begin an extensive and profound social reform. Our main investment must be in the people so that each citizen can fully develop his own abilities. All Mexicans deserve to live in dignity, to enjoy the hope of improvement and the true opportunity to develop as an individual. Not only does poverty affect those who suffer it, but it weakens and harms the nation. Our commitment is to engage in a head-on struggle against poverty, in order to be able to fill the needs and provide basic services for the poverty stricken communities, and expand the government's protection and social development network to the whole population. The Indian communities will receive all our support and respect. Their shortages will receive special attention from our social reform. We join their struggle to improve their production opportunities, to increase social well-being, and ensure respect for their rights. We are also convinced that the Indians must participate more decisively in the direction of their communities and in the development of policies for solving their problems and attaining their goals. The struggle against poverty is the government's single most important social responsibility. Furthermore, this task must bring the people and the volunteer and self-improvement social organizations together, so they can participate and become a part of the grand joint alliance in search of unbiased prosperity. Our commitment is to a social reform program that can improve the quality of life of those who face the greatest deprivation and limitation, and guarantee opportunities for well-being and progress for all. To aid in the development of this social reform plan, the PRI hereby makes the following commitments: -- To fight poverty and promote progress for those who have less. -- To actively develop policies that offer support for the Indian, with direct participation from the Indian communities themselves. -- To struggle for equal job, education, housing, and well-being opportunities for all social groups alike. -- To expand and improve health, nutrition, housing, and social security programs. -- To promote social support programs for groups with specific needs, according to gender, age, or personal condition. -- To summon the most wide-spread citizen participation in social development programs. Education for Development and Competition In view of the economic modernization process and growing international competition, we embrace the obligation to expand and improve our education system. Qualified education, available to everyone, is essential in order for changes to be the foundation of additional economic development and social well-being. Education must be the channel leading to full development and the creativity of all Mexicans. It must disseminate our values and assert our history as well as confer a sense of permanence and national pride. It must also be the point of contact between our society and humanist tradition, universal culture, scientific vision of the world, and technological developments. We are committed to a nationalist and federalized type education; an education with quality, sufficient resources, a teaching profession endowed with decent living conditions and permanent training programs. Our commitment is to unquestionably promote and encourage scientific and technological development as well as training programs which must be linked to the productive sector. Our commitment is to an education system that will open the doors to social mobility, justice, economic progress, and national fortitude. In order to achieve an education system that will propitiate development, the PRI is determined to: -- Support a nationalist and federalized education. -- Promote quality education that is made available to all Mexicans. -- Encourage work related training programs. -- Link scientific investigation and technological development to all productive sectors. A New Equilibrium in the Republic's Life Mexican society's new economic and political configuration requires an institutional system capable of proclaiming social initiatives, individual rights, and public actions. Today, more than ever, there is need for public institutions that will acknowledge the average citizen's potential, as well as society's energy. The republic's new equilibrium demands government reforms. We are in need of a government system that is in touch with civilian society, capable of providing effective answers through a public administration that is modern, professional, and respectful of justice. The Republic's new equilibrium demands self-respect in political life through the strengthening of a Legislative Branch that will be effective in truly representing social positions and contribute to promoting social benefits. It also demands that the institutions responsible for handing out justice will be able to consolidate a framework of trust and confidence in the legal system and the public authorities. We are in need of a more expeditious justice system, one committed to defending the individual's rights. In order to accomplish this new equilibrium in the Republic's everyday life, the PRI is committed to: -- Proposing government reforms that will consolidate a public administration system that is more modern, expeditious, professional, and respectful of justice. -- Acknowledging the political capability of every institution and every municipality as well as increase their respective fiscal resources which will lead to modernizing federalism. -- Strengthening the Legislative Branch and guaranteeing an expeditious justice system available to all Mexicans. -- Improving public safety within a framework of respect for the individual's rights. Today, just as during other moments of our history, the PRI is adopting commitments that society demands by presenting concrete political proposals. Through Luis Donaldo Colosio, our candidate for the presidency of the republic, through our candidates for deputies and senators, we are going to confront the current challenges with responsibility. Today, the PRI once again can rely on the people's support in order to continue building a future of certainty and better opportunities for our children. We reiterate: Our only commitment is to Mexico.
