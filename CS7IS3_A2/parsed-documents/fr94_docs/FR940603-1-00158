FR940603-1-00158 FR940603-1-00009 d. A statement that all required easements and rights-of-way have been obtained from the owners of the properties across which the Section is to be constructed (including tenants who may reasonably be expected to object to such construction). e. A statement that all necessary staking has been completed. f. A statement that all necessary funds for prompt payment for the construction of the Section will be available. g. Specific instruction as to location and extent of work to be performed on energized lines, if any. The Contractor will not be required to dig holes, set poles, install anchors, install underground conduit, perform any plowing for the installation of underground cable, or dig trenches if there are more than six (6) inches of frost in the ground nor to perform any construction on such days when in the judgment of the Owner snow, rain, or wind or the results of snow, rain, or frost make it impracticable to perform any operations of construction; provided further that the contractor will not perform any plowing for the installation of underground cable on public roads or highways if there are more than two (2) inches of frost in the ground. To the extent of the time lost due to the conditions described herein and approved in writing by the Owner, the time of completion set out above will be extended. The time for completion shall be extended for a period of any reasonable delay (other than a delay resulting from the failure of the Contractor to secure sufficient labor) which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor including acts of God, fires, floods, inability to obtain materials, direction of the Owner to cease construction as herein provided, and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible: Provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Contractor unless within ten (10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Contractor for such an extension of time the Contractor shall have made a written request therefor in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes, except acts or omissions of the Owner, shall result in any liability on the part of the Owner. Section 2_Changes in Plans, Specifications and Drawings. The Owner may, from time to time during the progress of the construction of the Project, make such changes in, additions to, or subtractions from the Plans, Specifications, and Construction Drawings as conditions may warrant: Provided, however, that if the cost to the Contractor shall be materially increased by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Contractor for the reasonable cost thereof in accordance with a construction contract amendment signed by the Owner and the Contractor, but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Contractor shall have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition. Section 3_Supervision and Inspection. a. The Contractor shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent (hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where construction is being carried on. The Contractor shall also employ, in connection with the construction of the Project, capable, experienced, and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given to the Superintendent by the Owner shall be binding upon the Contractor. b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Contractor if in the judgment of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right to require the Contractor to increase the number of his employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner; but the failure of the Owner to give any such directions shall not relieve the Contractor of his obligations to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal. c. The manner of performance of the work, and all equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection, tests, and approval of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right to inspect all payrolls and other data and records of the Contractor relevant to the work. The Contractor will provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests. The Contractor shall have an authorized agent accompany the inspector when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. d. In the event that the Owner shall determine that the construction contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Contractor, if requested by the Owner, to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent, and location of such defects. Section 4_Defective Workmanship. The acceptance of any workmanship by the Owner shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such workmanship shall be found to be defective after installation, and any such workmanship found defective before final acceptance of the work or within one (1) year after completion shall be remedied or replaced, as the case may be, by and at the expense of the Contractor. In the event of failure by the Contractor so to do, the Owner may remedy such defective workmanship and in such event the Contractor shall pay to the Owner the cost and expense thereof. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any defective workmanship, in respect of the Project, of which the Contractor shall have had notice, shall not have been remedied or replaced, as the case may be. Section 5_Materials. At or prior to the commencement of construction of each Section, the Owner shall make available to the Contractor all materials for such Section which the Owner has on hand, and from time to time as such additional deliveries of materials, if any, are received by the Owner, the Owner shall make such materials available to the Contractor: Provided, however, that the Contractor or his authorized representative will give to the Owner a receipt in such form as the Owner shall approve for all materials furnished by the Owner to the Contractor. The Contractor will return to the Owner or reuse in the construction of other assembly units all materials removed from the lines under Section H_Conversion Assembly Units and Section I_Removal Assembly Units. Upon completion of each Section of the Project the Contractor will return to the Owner all materials, including usable materials as well as scrap, furnished by the Owner in excess of those required for the construction of the Section as determined from the Final Inventory approved by the Owner. The Contractor will reimburse the Owner at the current invoice cost to the Owner for loss and for breakage through Contractor's negligence of materials furnished by the Owner to the Contractor and for materials removed from the lines by the Contractor. Section 6_Term of Contract. It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Contract, the Contractor will not be required to commence any construction after the expiration of 1 year following acceptance of this Proposal by the Owner.
