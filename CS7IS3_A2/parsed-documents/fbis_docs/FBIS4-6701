McKinnon, concurrently minister of foreign affairs and trade, who arrived in Japan on Tuesday for a three-day stay, voiced the support in a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, the officials said. He told Hata that New Zealand thinks it important for Japan to become a permanent member of the Security Council because Japan's international role is increasing not only in the economic sphere but also in the political field, they said. Hata was quoted as replying that Japan wants to actively contribute to the international community. Also in the 75-minute meeting at the Foreign Ministry, McKinnon said New Zealand, which currently chairs the Security Council, wants to cooperate with the international community to prevent North Korea from becoming a country with nuclear weapons, according to the officials. Hata told McKinnon it is important for the world to unite to urge North Korea not to change its position on the nuclear problem [as received], the officials said. McKinnon also said New Zealand is placing importance on Asia and has hammered out an "Asia 2000" plan to promote its ties with the region. Hata and McKinnon agreed that the upcoming Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional forum should seek boosting the openness of military power in the region to promote stability and security in Asia, the officials said. Touching on the just-signed Uruguay Round trade pact, they agreed on the importance of settling disputes on a multilateral basis, not by taking unilateral steps, the officials said. On the bilateral front, McKinnon expressed New Zealand's opposition to whaling, while Hata pointed out cultural differences, the officials said.
