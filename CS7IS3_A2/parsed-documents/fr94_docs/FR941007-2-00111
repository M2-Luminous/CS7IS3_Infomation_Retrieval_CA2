FR941007-2-00111 FR941007-2-00066 General Information The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a plan from certain other provisions of ERISA and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not expressly apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of ERISA. Section 404 requires, in part, that a fiduciary discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA. This exemption does not affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that a plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries. (2) The exemption will not extend to transactions prohibited under section 406(b)(3) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(1)(F) of the Code. (3) In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and based upon the entire record, the Department finds that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of plans and of their participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of such plans. (4) The exemption is supplemental to, and not in derogation of other provisions of ERISA and the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction. (5) The exemption is applicable to a transaction only if the conditions specified in the class exemption are satisfied. Exemption Accordingly, the following exemption is granted under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). Effective as of October 7, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through (D), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of ERISA and the taxes imposed by sections 4975(a) and 4975(b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to a transaction or activity which is authorized, prior to the occurrence of such transaction or activity, by a settlement agreement resulting from an investigation of an employee benefit plan conducted by the Department under the authority of section 504(a) of ERISA, provided that: (A) The nature of such transaction or activity is specifically described in writing, by the terms of such settlement agreement. (B) The Department of Labor is a party to the settlement agreement. (C) A party who will be engaging in the transaction or activity has provided written notice to the affected participants and beneficiaries in a manner that is reasonably calculated to result in the receipt of such notice at least 30 days prior to entry into the settlement agreement. (D) A copy of the notice and the method of distribution is approved in advance by the area or district office of the Department which negotiated the settlement. (E) The notice includes an objective description of the transaction or activity, the approximate date on which the transaction will occur, the address of the area or district office of the Department which negotiated the settlement agreement, and a statement apprising participants and beneficiaries of their right to forward their comments to such office. Signed at Washington, DC, this 30th day of September 1994. Alan D. Lebowitz, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Program Operations, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Department of Labor.
