Voropayev report over video; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] [Text] China's Heilongjiang Province, which is our country's main partner in the PRC, is threatening to switch its trade contacts with Russia to the dynamically developing states of Southeast Asia. The province's leadership made a statement on revising foreign economic priorities due to the new situation in the region. Simply put, our Chinese neighbors are very unhappy about the new Russian visa regulations and new customs dues. These measures significantly reduced the flow of goods across the border -- according to Chinese sources, the reduction reaches 45 percent. Official Beijing has already adopted retaliatory measures that limit the import of raw material and semifinished products from Russia, and Heilongjiang firms have been advised to look for new foreign sources of income. Only time will show how real these threats of our affronted neighbors are, but China is far from being our only partner in Asia to justify our creating some kind of special conditions for it. It is hardly worth to dramatize the reduction of goods exchange -- after all, the reverse side of the frantic trade relations with China has amounted to the noticeable complication of the situation in Far East border districts. The first stage of the `Foreigner' [inostranets] operation carried out in the Maritime Kray showed the necessity of tightening the monitoring of entry of Chinese, Vietnamese, and DPRK citizens. Many of them break visa regulations, forge documents, and try to stay in the Maritime Kray through fair means or foul. During the 10 days of purposeful inspection, about 1,000 foreign citizens who had broken Russia's laws were deported from the kray. However, the number of PRC tourists who have lost their way here amounts to thousands, and, therefore, operation `Foreigner' will not be limited to the first stage.
