In allusion to a group of persons who on 26 January entered the Belgian Embassy in Havana, he told PRENSA LATINA that [the authorities] will not allow this method to be adopted by those intent on leaving Cuba. The Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry spokesman explained that entering a diplomatic mission cannot be a privilege or safe conduct for emigration. In that regard, he said that Cuba has not changed its policy and remembered that there are emigration laws that allow any citizen to travel abroad, as long as he has received a visa and paid for the transportation. The spokesman said that the four men, two women, and one minor who are in the Belgian Embassy in this capital must leave the diplomatic mission voluntarily and return to their residence and undertake the normal steps to leave the country, even if they have a visa.
