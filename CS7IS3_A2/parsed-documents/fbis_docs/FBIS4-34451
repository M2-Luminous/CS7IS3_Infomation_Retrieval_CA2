The suspension is presumably due to Brazilian annoyance over Argentina's support for Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to preside over the GATT general directorate. The unexpected situation surprised the Economy Ministry, but the economic team decided not to comment until the situation clears up because there are still some conflicting reports on the issue. The abrupt cancellation of Cavallo's visit to Brasilia was understood as a reprisal because Argentina gave its support to Salinas de Gortari instead of supporting Brazilian Economy Minister Rubens Ricupero from Rio de Janeiro to preside over the GATT directorate. Argentina's support for the Mexican president was made public by President Carlos Menem during the Ibero-American summit this week. The Brazilian press today published the remarks of several diplomats saying that the Brazilian Government felt "disappointed" at Menem's position, taking into account that Argentina is Brazil's partner in Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and it knew Brazil had proposed Ricupero for the post. The diplomats also were annoyed because Brazil's seat was empty when Menem made the announcement. At the time, the Brazilian delegation was accompanying President Itamar Franco, who was mourning the sudden death of his nephew and private secretary. The Brazilian Foreign Ministry lowered the tone after the dust raised by the affair settled and justified the suspension of Cavallo's visit by saying it was due to an "incompatibility in the agenda."
