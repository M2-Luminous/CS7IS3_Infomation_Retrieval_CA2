This has been done, it is believed here, primarily to strengthen currency circulation in the Republic and increase the purchasing power of sum coupons during the transition to an official national currency. It is laid down that quotas for the export of goods (works, services) cannot be sold, transferred or reallocated to other corporate bodies. A ban has been imposed on the settlement of accounts for foreign economic transactions by Uzbekistan enterprises, organizations, and institutions with foreign partners, including CIS countries, through firms' accounts in foreign banks. They are only allowed to open currency accounts in authorized Uzbekistan banks if properly registered as participants in foreign economic activity. Each corporate body is entitled to open such an account in only one establishment of an authorized bank; except that, if the bank in question lacks the credit resources, credit can be obtained by agreement with another bank. All contracts concluded by enterprises with foreign partners, including partners in CIS countries, for the export of licensed goods, works, and services will be subject to registration at the local Foreign Economic Relations Ministry. The statute envisages the obligatory sale of currency earnings (including CIS countries' currencies) to the Republic Central Bank, with the simultaneous payment of the equivalent in sum coupons into the enterprise's clearing account at the current rate.
