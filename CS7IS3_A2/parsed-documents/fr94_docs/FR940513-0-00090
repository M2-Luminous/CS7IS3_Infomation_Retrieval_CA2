Discussion: Mr. Charles Nabit, a representative of the March of Dimes, submitted an application on November 23, 1993 to hold the Great Chesapeake Bay Swim Event on June 12, 1994. Approximately 600 swimmers will start from Sandy Point State Park and swim between the William P. Lane Jr. Memorial Twin Bridges to the Eastern Shore. This is the type of event contemplated by these regulations and the safety of the participants depends upon control of vessel traffic, therefore the regulations in 33 CFR 100.507 are implemented. During the swim itself, all vessel traffic will have to be stopped. However, vessel traffic will be permitted to transit the regulated area as the swim progresses. As a result, commercial traffic should not be severely disrupted. Dated: April 9, 1994. W. T. Leland, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard Commander, Fifth Coast Guard District.
