This is the doctrine currently advocated by a very large majority of the National Assembly's Defense Commission members in the 150-page report they have just written to present their choices before the government presents its own White Paper on Defense and military planning bill. This is the first such parliamentary initiative in the 30 years that the Assembly has been required to give its opinion on a military planning bill. RPR [Rally for the Republic] Ain representative and Commission President Jacques Boyon has denied charges that the commission views the report as a "counter white paper"; the document lists the issues on which the majority and the opposition are in agreement, those on which there is some agreement between them, and those on which they disagree. PS [Socialist Party] Ille-et-Vilaine representative and former Commission President Jean-Michel Boucheron speaks of a "French-style consensus" on defense, with the only differences relating to nuclear testing and possibly the potential benefits of an antimissile defense system. Commission members have more particularly focused on three basic issues: nuclear deterrence, the national service, and defense-related industries. 1. As for nuclear deterrence, the report states that "it is clear that while the current doctrine must be maintained, it needs to be adjusted to new realities. Our nuclear weapons must be designed bearing in mind a range of actions meant to defend our basic interests, and no longer our vital interests only. Deterrence can no longer be defined in `weak-to-strong' terms, but we will need capabilities for limited and highly accurate strikes. Such enlarged deterrence must prompt us to renew our nuclear weapon systems," which, according to a majority of commission members, presupposes resumed atomic testing even though "our current weapons are perfectly operational until 2005." The commission notes that a broad consensus has emerged in favor of two nuclear "components": strategic submarines and a nuclear missile carried by the Rafale [fighter-bomber] (without choosing among Matra's competing Apache missile and Aerospatiale's ASLP [long-range air-to-surface missile]). 2. Conscription: This is the commission's preferred option as opposed to that of an exclusively professional army. The report notes that "developing civilian forms of national service must entail very high requirements with regard to equality of implementation -- equality among such new forms as well as with the military service. In any event, the search for new civilian forms must remain compatible with national defense requirements, and the needs of the Defense Ministry must retain priority status." 3. Industry: Most commission members -- a few of whom are the elected representatives of regions which boast armament production concerns -- condemn the general planning commissioner's recent report which suggests that, since France cannot do everything on its own due to financial considerations, it should abandon some activity areas in order to concentrate on priority sectors. The report states that "clear differences have emerged as to the idea of focusing on some sectors of excellence and abandoning others, as apparently suggested in a recent planning report. A broad majority of commission members oppose this notion, deemed suicidal and unrealistic for our defense industry, and dangerous for our national independence. On the other hand, the commission acknowledges the need for European cooperation on a number of weapon types."
