ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Patent and Trademark Office (Office) is proposing to amend the rules of practice in patent cases to implement the changes related to patent term in title 35, United States Code, contained in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (S. 2467 and H.R. 5110), which was recently passed by Congress, and to simplify the rules. Among the changes that are contained in S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 are the conversion to a 20-year patent term measured from the date of filing an application in the U.S., and the introduction of provisional applications. The changes apply to utility and plant patents. They do not apply to design patents. S. 2467 was passed by the Senate on December 1, 1994, and the House passed H.R. 5110 on November 29, 1994. The President has indicated that he will sign the bills. Since a Public Law number is not available, the rule package refers to the Senate and House bill numbers for convenience. The amendments to title 35 relating to 20-year patent term and provisional applications will be effective on the date which is 6 months after the date of enactment. DATES: Written comments must be submitted on or before February 17, 1995. A public hearing will be held Thursday, February 16, 1995, at 9:30 a.m., in the Commissioner's Conference Room 912, Crystal Park 2, 2121 Crystal Drive, Arlington, Virginia. Requests to present oral testimony should be received on or before February 14, 1995.
