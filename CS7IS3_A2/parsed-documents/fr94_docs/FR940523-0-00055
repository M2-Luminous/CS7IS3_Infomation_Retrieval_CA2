FR940523-0-00055 FR940523-0-00014 B. Costs Eligible for Reimbursement Several commenters proposed changes to, or requested clarification of, the language in §765.11(a) of the proposed rule concerning reimbursable costs and the definition of ``costs of remedial action.'' The proposed rule defined such costs as those costs incurred by a licensee that were necessary to perform ``decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action.'' The phrase ``decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action'' is defined by section 1004(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;3(3)), as well as the proposed rule, as work ``necessary to comply with all applicable requirements of'' UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with requirements established by an Agreement State. Several commenters asked that the definition of ``costs of remedial action'' specifically include a list of cost categories that are eligible for reimbursement. Furthermore, some commenters suggested that this list should specifically include the cost of capital, cost of equipment, and interest that might have been earned over the period between the expenditure and reimbursement; administrative costs; and costs in implementing other environmental program requirements. In response to these comments, the Department has revised the definition of ``costs of remedial action'' to include those activities specified in the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference that accompanied the enactment of Title X which states: Funds made available under this program are intended to be provided for all costs that result from the disposition of by-product [sic] material at active processing sites (subject to the limitations of sec. 1001(b)), including groundwater remediation, treatment of contaminated soil, disposal of process wastes, removal actions, air pollution studies, mill and equipment decommissioning, site monitoring, administrative expenses, and additional expenditures required by related standards and regulations.'' (H.R. CONF. REP. NO. 102&hyph;1018, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 392 (1992)) Rather than further attempt to enumerate more precise activities and circumstances for which costs are reimbursable, the Department has determined that this issue should be resolved on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the statutory requirements. Section 1004(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;3(3)) limits reimbursement to costs for ``work performed .␣.␣. which is necessary to comply'' with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements. Therefore, whether work for which reimbursement is sought is necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements as required by section 1004(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;3(3)), will depend on specific circumstances that may vary from one site to the next. However, in the absence of specific statutory authority, the Department has determined that the carrying cost of past expenditures or other costs of capital or lost interest are not eligible for reimbursement. Costs incurred for activities required by other Federal and state regulatory authorities may only be considered reimbursable if the activity falls within the final rule's definition of ``decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action.'' For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency or a state regulatory authority may require a licensee to obtain a storm water discharge permit pursuant to the Clean Water Act before the licensee is able to conduct a remedial action. Therefore, a licensee may be able to demonstrate that the cost in obtaining and maintaining the a discharge permit is necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with Agreement State requirements. Administrative costs and other costs associated with cleanup or restoration of the site may be eligible for reimbursement provided that a licensee can demonstrate that the costs were necessary to comply with the requirements of UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable requirements of an Agreement State. Several commenters construed the proposed rule to limit costs of remedial action to activities required by an approved site reclamation plan. These commenters requested that the rule be clarified to provide for reimbursement of other activities required by other written authorization from NRC or an Agreement State. The final rule clarifies that costs for activities required by NRC or an Agreement State and established by a license condition or other authorization or directive may be eligible for reimbursement. The phrase ``or other written authorization'' is used throughout the final rule to specify that the activity may be authorized by the applicable regulatory authority by some mechanism other than an approved reclamation plan. Several commenters requested that the final rule specify that costs incurred prior to the enactment of UMTRCA are reimbursable. This request is consistent with section 1001(b)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(1)), which provides that the Secretary shall reimburse a licensee for costs of decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action which are attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States and incurred by the licensee not later than December 31, 2002. Furthermore, section 1004(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;3(3)) specifies that the term ``decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action'' means work performed that is necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, requirements established by an Agreement State. Therefore, the final rule states that pre-UMTRCA costs may be eligible for reimbursement if the licensee can demonstrate and obtain the Department's approval that the work was necessary to comply with UMTRCA. A licensee can make this demonstration by providing a written authorization from the NRC or an Agreement State which indicates that the work performed by the licensee prior to the enactment of UMTRCA was necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements. Some commenters objected to §765.11(a) of the proposed rule, concerning the requirement that reimbursable costs must be for activities ``contributing to final closure.'' These commenters were concerned that the applicable regulatory authority may revise an approved reclamation plan, license condition, or other directive for the remediation of the site. Under the proposed rule, a licensee's previously incurred costs of remedial action would not be reimbursable. The Department acknowledges this concern and has revised the final rule by deleting this requirement. In addition, commenters objected to §765.20 of the proposed rule which required licensees to certify that remedial action work was completed as required by a reclamation plan or other written authorization. These commenters were concerned that licensees might not be reimbursed prior to completion of remedial actions for individual tasks, as specified in an approved reclamation plan or other written authorization, upon the licensees completion of these tasks. The Department agrees with these commenters and notes that it is the Department's intent to reimburse these costs upon completion of the individual tasks instead of the entire remediation.
