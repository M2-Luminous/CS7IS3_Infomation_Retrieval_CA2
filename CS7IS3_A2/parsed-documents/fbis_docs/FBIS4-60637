Referring to the current situation in our country, the brother chairman expressed confidence that brothers and friends understand that what is going on is an internal affair that concerns Yemen, and that the ongoing war ignited by traitor al-Bid against the homeland and its unity is a war between the Yemeni people with their various segments, political forces, and national and social organizations on the one hand and a small clique that has rebelled against the legitimate authority and conspired against unity and the homeland on the other. He stressed that some news media allegations that what is going on is a war between the north and south are unfounded. He stressed that there are over 11 military brigades from southern and eastern governorates now fighting at the forefront of the forces of unity in defense of Constitutional legitimacy, valiantly confronting the rebellious, secessionist gang.
