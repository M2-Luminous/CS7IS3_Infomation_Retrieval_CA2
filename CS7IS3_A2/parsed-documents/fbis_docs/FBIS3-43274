The source, however, did not give the reasons for the shooting or the number of soldiers who took part in it. The incident occurred in Ganta, 60 km east of Gbarnga, which in turn lies 160 km northeast of Monrovia -- the headquarters for NPFL leader Charles Taylor. An informed source reported that the clashes were sparked by a group of men who were demanding "allowances" in anticipation of their future demobilization, as well as a "special bonus" for Christmas. The same source further disclosed that Mr. Taylor was planning on traveling to the scene but was dissuaded from doing so by his close advisers. Disarmament and demobilization of all armed Liberian factions could begin in mid-January.
