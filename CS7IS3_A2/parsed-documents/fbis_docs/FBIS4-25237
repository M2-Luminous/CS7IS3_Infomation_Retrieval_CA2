These federations have also extensively launched the activity of "encouraging women to pioneer new undertakings," and achieved remarkable results. According to initial figures, some 100,000 laid-off female workers in the province have thus far returned to their production posts with the help of women's federations, and these women once more have hope. Huang Qizao, vice president of the All-China Women's Federation, highly appraised the work of women's federations at all levels in the province. Liaoning is a major industrial province, employing 4.2 million female workers. While reform in employment, personnel, and income distribution systems continuously deepened, the competition resulted in 420,000 female workers losing their jobs for a variety of practical and historical reasons. Experiencing difficulties in making ends meet, some of these women lost their mental balance and become a hot social problem. Faced with this new contradiction, women's federations at all levels in the province marked the appropriate rehiring of laid-off female workers as the focal point of the activity to "encourage women to make contributions" in an effort to share the burdens of the state and resolve problems for the people. Professional training was strengthened among the laid-off female workers to enable them to master skills and regain jobs. Based on the reality that most laid-off female workers lack competitiveness, skills, and ability, women's federations at all levels have arranged for such women to study, change their concepts on choosing jobs, and enhance their sense of competition while utilizing women's organizations and fronts to launch diverse forms of training classes for such women, thus laying a foundation for their reemployment. According to initial figures, women's federations at all levels in the province as well as various female workers organizations have sponsored some 200 training classes on specialized skills, and some 900,000 women have attended these classes. Sources in various fields have been pooled together to provide more employment opportunities for the laid-off female workers. Women's federations at all levels in the province have fully exploited their advantages to coordinate trade unions, industrial and commercial departments, scientific and technological units, and individuals associations to help the laid-off female workers meet their pressing needs. Female workers organizations under trade unions of various levels have launched the activity of "serving as economic matchmakers" and helped enterprises work out plans for developing the tertiary industrial businesses that suit women. The women's federation in Fushun's Xinfu District has set foot in relevant units and enterprises on numerous occasions to seek jobs for 300 laid-off female workers. Economic entities and serve-the-people networks have been set up to help locate jobs for laid-off female workers. Women's federations at all levels in the province have vigorously initiated economic entities to place a large number of laid-off female workers. So far, the 2,900 economic entities initiated by women's federations at various levels have placed 30,000 laid-off female workers. The 46 enterprises subordinate to the Mulan Corporation initiated by the Shenyang City Women's Federation have provided jobs for nearly 2,000 laid-off women. The Shenyang City Women's Federation has stipulated that all economic entities and enterprises run by women's federations should locate jobs for a fixed number of laid-off female workers, and a new department has been set up to handle these affairs. In addition, women's federations in various districts and neighborhoods have run 16,000 serve-the-people networks, such as food and groceries centers, child-care centers, and snack corners, and some 50,000 laid-off female workers have been employed. Employment agencies have been set up to provide timely help for laid-off female workers. Women's federations at all levels in the province have set up a dozen women's employment agencies. By introducing such work opportunities as housekeeping, home teachers, and hourly employment as household servants, these employment agencies have found new jobs for over 1,000 laid-off female workers. After regaining employment, female workers who were once unemployed have become more skillful and more competitive, thus becoming effective forces in developing the economy. More than 20,000 laid-off female workers in Fushun city have found their new positions in the handicraft and knitting trades. Zhang Shiqin, a laid-off female worker of the Fushun Chemical Industrial Plant, initiated the Liaodong Synthetic Waterproof Materials Plant together with a veteran plant director. Within five years, this plant had paid 1 million yuan in tax to the state, and its products filled the gaps in Fushun's building materials trade. Additionally, this plant provided jobs for 200 laid-off female workers. On the "8 March Women's Day" this year, Zhang Shiqin was appraised as the "outstanding woman of the province in the reform period." On 11 May, the provincial women's federation held an on-the-spot meeting to exchange experiences in launching the activity of pioneering new undertakings and promoting stability and to further develop the work concerning the reemployment of laid-off female workers. Huang Qizao, vice president of the All-China Women's Federation and first secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, and Hua Fuzhou, secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, attended and gave speeches at the meeting to guide responsible persons of women's federations in Tianjin, Shanxi, Changchun, Harbin, and Chongqing. Wang Huaiyuan, Zhang Guoguang, Xu Wencai, and Chen Suzhi, leaders of Liaoning Province and Shenyang city, also attended and spoke at this meeting.
