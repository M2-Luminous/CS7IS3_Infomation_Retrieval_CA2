An official with the Liaoning Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau said that the reserves are home to 97 rare animals and several rare plants on the state's protection list including the red-crowned crane, bear, sable, Mongolian gazelle, sika, red deer and otter, as well as ginseng in the plant category. He said that in the reserves, specialized protection teams have been set up. Every year, the province allocates special funds to equip the team with fire prevention equipment and for scientific researches. Scientific personnel are also undertaking a series of investigations and research programs to survey the wildlife resources in the reserves. The Laotieshan Nature Reserve on snake island in the province was set up in 1979 and is now a major stop for migrating birds, including red-crowned cranes, swans and eagles, in northeast China. Since the reserve was set up, hundreds of thousands of birds have been saved from slaughter. In the northeast section of snake island, the number of pallas pit viper, the only kind of poisonous snake on the island, has reached about 17,000, an increase of 5 percent per year since the reserve was established.
