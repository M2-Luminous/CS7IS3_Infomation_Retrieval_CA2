In view of that, he has made additional concessions to UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. The head of state once again expressed his dissatisfaction with foreign interference in Angola's domestic affairs. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent, in French fading into Portuguese translation] Mr. President, you have just attended the 30th OAU summit. The Angolan issue was one of the points on the agenda. What is your opinion about the manner in which the Angolan issued was dealt with? [Dos Santos] The question of Angola was analyzed, first at Ministers Council level, and afterward by the summit. The Angolan delegation gave an exhaustive briefing about the prevailing situation in our country. Our country has been at war for 30 years, first against colonialism, then to cope with South African aggressions, and lately, after the elections, UNITA contested the election results by force of arms. So, we are in a state of civil war. We dealt with elements regarding the correlation of forces in the military field. We also briefed the summit about the ongoing Lusaka talks between the government and UNITA delegations. We have made important progress at the talks. The summit adopted a declaration on Angola, saluting the efforts that have been made by the government in view of its flexibility and sense of responsibility to bring peace to the country and create conditions for national reconciliation. We raised the question of foreign interference -- namely, military assistance that UNITA continues to receive from certain countries, from Zaire in particular. We have stated our willingness to discuss this issue at length with our brother from Zaire, His Excellency Marshal Mobutu. Preparations are under way for a meeting between the presidents of Angola and Zaire. This morning I spoke to him on the phone and reiterated our desire to talk with him [President Mobutu] as brothers and as a family to find a solution to the problem. [Correspondent] It is known that the Angolan Government and UNITA have been in negotiating in Lusaka. How has the situation developed in your country? [Dos Santos] As you know we have been at war since the elections because the Bicesse Accord signed in Portugal on 31 May had shortcomings in terms of monitoring and verification. As you know there was not a significant UN role because the number of observers that monitored the cease-fire was insufficient. But right now, after a year and a half of war we can say that the military situation has evolved in the government forces' favor. We have coped with the vacuum created by the demobilization of government forces. UNITA had hidden at least 20,000 men. It did not demobilize its army. At the onset that enabled UNITA to control about 70 percent of Angola. Nonetheless, people continue to abandon the zones occupied by UNITA guerrillas. Like I said, right now the situation is evolving in the government forces' favor. I can add that right now UNITA only controls 40 percent of the territory. That means that there is a continual and positive evolution. We ought to uphold the will of the people who elected the government and opted for democracy. Power is not attained through the force of arms as used to be said in the past. Now the ballot is the weapon people use to uphold their interests and aspirations. [end recording]
