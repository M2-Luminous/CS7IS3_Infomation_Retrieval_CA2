This week's program includes a six-minute section on the 14 February anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeyni's fatwa calling for Salman Rushdie's death for writing the book The Satanic Verses. After reviewing the reasons and results of the fatwa, the announcer states: "A coordinated endeavor by the Western media focuses on the revival of a current, a current which has been practically buried since the issuance of the fatwa. Now, from that defeated ploy, only a plaything is left which every now and then comes out of its hiding-place, for a few moments, to create propaganda fodder for the Western propaganda horns. "In any case the conspiracy of the insulting book, The Satanic Verses, was an insult against the beliefs and sanctities of more than one billion Muslims which can never be explained within the limits of freedom of thought and freedom of the pen. The least punishment for a mercenary who carried out that plot, is the irrevocable decree for his execution."
