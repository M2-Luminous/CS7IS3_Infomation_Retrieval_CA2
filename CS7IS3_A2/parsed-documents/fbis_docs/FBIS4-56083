They demonstrated on Djapic what they have been doing for a long time throughout Siroki Brijeg--violence. They are collecting taxes from businessmen, dealing in drugs and weapons, and stealing and reselling automobiles. Spokesman Ante Djapic and the rest of the leadership of the Croatian Rights Party [HSP], who were beaten up before the beginning of the HSP forum in Siroki Brijeg, according to witnesses' statements, still fared well. Specifically, just when the forum was supposed to start in a Siroki Brijeg hotel, from among about 100 curious people who had come to that party's meeting, which was expected to be like any other, a group of about 20 young men came out of the audience and assaulted the HSP members, almost beating them to death with tables, chairs, hammers, and sticks. When the uproar and the brawl began most of those present, seeing what was going on, simply fled from the hotel and did not appear in the city again throughout the entire evening. Nor did they appear even on later evenings after that event in the cafes and restaurants of Siroki Brijeg, which were otherwise open until late at night (after midnight) because of the pleasant weather; instead, patrons slowly begin to disperse as early as twilight. At 2200 the patrons can already be counted on one's fingers, and half an hour later there is no longer anyone either in the cafes or on the streets. Fear has seized Siroki Brijeg, but if you ask someone what really happened -- a lot of people see it happen -- you will get silence. The situation is reminiscent of the atmosphere that prevailed in Sicily before the Italian Government decided to settle accounts openly with the Mafia. It Started With Kraljevic The event in the Siroki Brijeg hotel also has its prehistory, however. It was drawn out for a long time in the media, but it started with the arrival of Djapic in Herzegovina after the murder of Blazo Kraljevic, a general in the HOS [Croatian Defense Forces], and another eight members of his escort. At that time it was officially announced that someone from Kraljevic's escort had been the first to open fire against special forces at a checkpoint in Krusevo, close to Mostar, and then all nine HOS members and one of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] special forces members died in the shooting. In the media, and several times in the Assembly, Djapic publicly (without names, admittedly) called upon the legal system of Herceg-Bosna, but also Croatia, to bring those who had committed the murder to justice. Furthermore, he constantly linked the murder of HSP leader Ante Paradzik (killed at a similar checkpoint in Sesvete) and the murder of Blazo Kraljevic and the eight HOS members, also saying that someone "powerful" in the Croatian Defense Ministry was behind it all. He threatened several times that he would publish the names of those who had committed the murder in Krusevo near Mostar. Since that threat mainly applied to Tuta Naletilic and the members of his battalion, Tuta, upon Djapic's arrival in Herzegovina, responded by threatening him not to appear in Siroki Brijeg, according to Djapic. Djapic did not pay attention, and his two forums in Grude and Tomislavgrad were relatively well-attended (Djapic's HSP does not enjoy a high reputation in Herzegovina, he believes) and peaceful, with only tense speakers, which is also usual for other parties. Djapic and his escort also appeared at the Siroki Brijeg hotel. Tuta apparently kept his promise, and so in just a few minutes his people, rushing out of the audience, created scenes that revolted those who witnessed them. They say that it was like detective movies. About 20 thugs simply began to beat the people sitting at the table with everything at hand (and the clubs that they brought with them), hitting all parts of their bodies, heads, legs, and backs. Those who fell immediately, bloodied, received a few more blows, and the rest screamed and called for help. No one came to their assistance, however, because it is known in Siroki Brijeg that anyone who opposes Tuta's group is risking his life. Minister Also Beaten Up On the morning of the next day, in front of the same hotel, Herceg-Bosna defense minister Vlado Soljic, himself a resident of Siroki Brijeg, was also beaten up. Some people say that he was struck quite accidentally, because he was passing close to the uproar, which had continued since the previous evening. This was all followed by a communique from the Herceg-Bosna Defense Ministry's Political Administration, which turned things around: Djapic and his companions were accused of wanting to start new conflicts between Croats and Muslims and prevent implementation of the Washington agreement. The kind of communique involved is sufficiently indicated by the fact that not a single Muslim has ever lived in Siroki Brijeg, either before this war or after World War II, so it is quite unclear how Djapic could have done anything like that. It is clear, however, to both Herceg-Bosna Defense Minister Soljic and the Political Administration and to the residents of Herzegovina, especially the residents of Siroki Brijeg, what is going on. The group that has gathered around an individual identified as a criminal by German authorities (Tuta Naletilic) has taken justice and the law into its own hands. It was not only the one that carried out the order to execute Blazo Kraljevic and his escort; the group also recently started a war between the Siroki Brijeg and Ljubuska municipalities by kidnapping from the police a soldier who had previously killed a member of Tuta's group in a mutual clash, destroying the Ljubuska, Citluk, and Mostar prison in the process, and, after torturing him in ways that are not appropriate to describe, blew him up with dynamite. Now they have demonstrated with Djapic what they have been doing for a long time now around Siroki Brijeg and other Herzegovina municipalities where they dare to go--violence. They collect taxes from private entrepreneurs, deal in drugs and weapons, and steal cars, change the documentation, and resell them. Everything good that this unit did in defending Croatian territory from the aggressor has been canceled out by these outbreaks of violence and lawlessness in Siroki Brijeg. Shame Because of Crime General Roso himself also faced elimination several times. His life is guarded by his battalion; otherwise the assassination attempts, such as the ones that occured when he decided that, with the new HVO structure, private armies would be destroyed, would be repeated. Roso disbanded Tuta's unit, but its remnants are still active--Djapic is right about that--probably under the protection of some "more powerful" individual in Zagreb. The story of Herzegovina lawlessness ends here, and the shame of people born in western Herzegovina because of what has happened begins. Until now it had never happened before, even in remote history, that Herzegovinians have been ashamed precisely because of such events and because of the authorities that are either tolerating or are impotent to eliminate those groups. The team that, by tolerating crime and gangs of thieves like that, has turned Herzegovina into a primitive province and has reduced people who previously earned an honest living to poverty or turned them to smuggling and fraud, is responsible for everything that is happening. As far as Djapic is concerned, his visit to Herzegovina is perhaps one more attempt at political provocation, which the HSP has been fostering so carefully since the beginning of the war in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the creation of parallel armies and violent terrorist incursions into the building on Starcevic Square in Zagreb to accusations to the international public that the Croatian authorities are allegedly threatening human rights. In that context the visit to Herzegovina also served Djapic for one more attack against the Croatian leadership. On the other hand, it is good that it happened to a political figure, because it will arouse the media and possibly force people from Herzegovina to put an end to those who, by encouraging lawlessness, are persistently weakening the defense of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is as if the same adviser simultaneously sent Djapic to Herzegovina and ordered Tuta's "ex-cons."
