MK Begin told Qol Yisra'el that the second clause in the letter does not follow from the first clause, and unless this is a mere stylistic defect, it is possible that a clause has been omitted. Foreign Minister Peres reacted to this charge by saying that no clause has been omitted and the entire letter was published verbatim. Mr. Peres added that the Likud people realize that the letter does not harm Jerusalem's status in any way whatsoever, therefore they pick at it and raise false charges.
