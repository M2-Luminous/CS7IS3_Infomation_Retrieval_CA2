He said that in the course of the battle he spotted the bodies of three terrorists through his binoculars, while another soldier reported that he had killed a terrorist on the first evening of the battle. Maj. Gen. Yatom added that the troops are operating carefully to avoid hitting local inhabitants and exposing IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers to unnecessary danger. He pointed out that antitank rockets were only fired at the building occupied by the terrorists. He further told our correspondent Moti Amir that the three soldiers who were lightly injured two days ago had been hit when a soldier accidentally dropped his machine gun. [A report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin on page A2 of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 24 March adds that Maj. Gen. Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of IDF troops in the West Bank, and Colonel Me'ir Kalifi, commander of the Hebron Brigade, were wounded in the operation yesterday. Mufaz, who commanded the operation, was injured "very lightly," while Kalifi sustained "light" injuries. Both of them were hit by shrapnel ricocheting from a door frame. The report goes on to say that a total of seven soldiers were lightly injured in the operation by bullets and shrapnel.] Gen. Yatom went on to say that none of the terrorists turned themselves in despite repeated pleas by Hebron notables.
