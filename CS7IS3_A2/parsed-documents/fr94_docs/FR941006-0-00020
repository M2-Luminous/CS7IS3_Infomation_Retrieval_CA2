FR941006-0-00020 FR941006-0-00005 Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 906 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;906&hyph;2FR] Oranges and Grapefruit Grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas; Revision of Special Purpose Exemption Provisions AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule revises the administrative rules and regulations in effect under the Texas citrus marketing order. The revision eliminates the provision which exempts fruit handled for home use from the order's grade, size, pack, container, inspection and assessment requirements. This rule will help prevent unauthorized shipments of uninspected citrus from being shipped out of the production area. Individuals will continue to be able to handle up to 400 pounds of citrus per day exempt from order requirements which should be sufficient for fruit purchased for home use. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 7, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 906 [7 CFR part 906] regulating the handling of oranges and grapefruit grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 15 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the order each season and approximately 750 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR §121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. Section 906.40 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container requirements for fresh shipments of Texas oranges and grapefruit. Whenever such requirements are in effect, oranges and grapefruit are required to be inspected and certified as meeting applicable standards in accordance with §906.45 of the order. The program is financed through handler assessments, established pursuant to §906.34. The order provides, in §906.42, that regulations issued under §§906.34, 906.40, and 906.45 may be modified, suspended or terminated to facilitate the handling of citrus fruit for certain purposes. Under this authority, §906.120 of the order's rules and regulations provides that oranges and grapefruit may be handled for relief, charity or home use exempt from order requirements. Handlers desiring to utilize this exemption are required to apply to the Texas Valley Citrus Committee (committee), the agency established to administer the order locally. In making an application, the handler is required to submit information such as the quantity of fruit to be handled under the exemption and its intended destination. Based on the information provided, the committee determines whether to approve the application and issue the handler a certificate of privilege. The committee met on May 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended revising paragraph (c)(1) of §906.120 by deleting ``home use'' from the provision which allows fruit to be handled exempt from regulation. Current regulations allow for an unlimited amount of fruit to be shipped for home use (not for resale) exempt from all marketing order requirements. The committee recommended this amendment to reduce the potential for abuse of the home use exemption. The committee has had difficulty in verifying the final disposition of exempted fruit. This final rule revises §906.120(c)(1) by deleting the phrase ``home use''. The committee expressed concern that bulk loads of uninspected fruit may enter fresh, commercial markets and prove detrimental to producer returns if the exemption is not removed. Other exemptions from order requirements remain unchanged. Under paragraph (a) of §906.120, individuals will continue to be able to handle up to 400 pounds of citrus per day exempt from order requirements. The committee believes that this minimum quantity exemption is sufficient to cover fruit purchased for home use and not for resale. Thus, it is not expected that this action will adversely impact those persons who purchase Texas oranges and grapefruit directly from handlers for their own use. A proposed rule concerning this revision was issued on July 21, 1994, and published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1994, [59 FR 38138]. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended August 26, 1994. No comments were received.
