FR940506-0-00036 FR940506-0-00012 KGPC states that EBB implementation and development costs should be recovered as fixed costs. Columbia Distribution and UDC/AGD, on the other hand, object to the Commission's statement that the fixed costs of the basic EBB package should be recovered through reservation charges. They assert the Commission's statement is at odds with its statement in the NOPR that it would be open to cost recovery methods that would spread costs across all those benefitting from the standards. Edison similarly contends that ``data aggregators'' (companies which are not shippers on pipelines, but which will be downloading data from multiple EBBs to provide electronic services) should pay their share of the costs for additional services provided at their request. All three contend the Commission should adopt a policy on cost recovery under which the costs would be equitably shared among all users of EBBs with the precise method of cost allocation determined in section 4 rate proceedings. UDC/AGD also request clarification of the criteria the Commission will use to determine which enhancements are not to be included in the basic EBB package. They state, for example, that some of the non-capacity release standards which the Working Groups are developing may not be of general benefit. KGPC suggests that any standards imposed by the Commission should be treated as part of the standard EBB service. Columbia Distribution and UDC/AGD further assert the Commission's statement on cost recovery could interfere with the development of alternative cost recovery approaches by the Working Groups, and UDC/AGD contend that if the Commission does not revisit this issue, it should, at least, refer the issue to the Working Groups for further consideration. In contrast, NGSA contends that the method of cost recovery is a policy issue outside the scope of this proceeding and that the Working Groups should not be asked to resolve this issue since they are set up to deal with technical issues. NGC requests clarification that all cost recovery related to EBBs will take place in full section 4 rate cases so that savings as well as costs can be taken into account. NGC further argues that variable costs should not be recovered through usage charges because a usage charge ignores the system-wide benefits of EBBs and other forms of electronic nominations. If the Commission does permit a separate charge for EBB use, NGC contends the Commission should not permit EDI users to be singled out for separate charges. NGC maintains that some in the industry have argued for a separate charge for EDI users because not all users find EDI suitable. NGC responds that some users find on-line EBBs equally unsuitable. As part of the Working Groups 1 & 2 report, position papers were filed reiterating the points made above. One group 46 contends the interminable debate over the cost issue is impeding the ability of the Working Groups to complete their work. 47 They urge the Commission to resolve this issue by stating that the cost issue should be left to section 4 proceedings, and not be considered by the Working Groups. 46 American Iron & Steel Institute, Amoco Production Company, Chevron U.S.A. Production Company, Conoco Inc., Enron Gas Services, Gaslantic Corporation, GPM Gas Corporation, Marathon Oil Company, Natural Gas Clearinghouse, Phillips Petroleum Company, Phillips Gas Marketing Company, Process Gas Consumers, Texaco Gas Marketing Inc., Vastar Gas Marketing, Inc., Virginia Power Company. 47 They assert some parties have held up consensus on further standardization until the group agrees to a cost allocation statement. Another group 48 supports an equitable sharing of costs by all EBB users. They assert that if firm capacity holders are required to pay all EBB costs through a reservation charge, the firm holders will be subsidizing other users of the system. They further assert that having to absorb all EBB costs will place firm users at a competitive disadvantage compared with brokers and marketers that can obtain the EBB services at no cost. This group asserts the Commission state that its policy is to equitably share costs, with the mechanics of the cost sharing approach to be developed in section 4 cases, in which the parties could consider a number of options, such as annual user fees or on-line usage charges. 48 Baltimore Gas & Electric Company, Brooklyn Union Gas Company, The Columbia Distribution Companies, Consolidated Edison of New York, New York State Electric & Gas Company, Southern California Gas Company, United Distribution Companies, Washington Gas Light Company, American Public Gas Association, Associated Gas Distributors, and New England Gas Distributor Group. The Commission will clarify its position on cost recovery. As provided in Order No. 636, the recovery of all EBB costs must take place in a full section 4 rate filing. 49 Parties are free in these proceedings to propose alternative methods of cost recovery. 49 Order No. 636, III FERC Stats. & Regs.
