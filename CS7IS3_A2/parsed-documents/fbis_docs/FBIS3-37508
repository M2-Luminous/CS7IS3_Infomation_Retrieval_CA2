Are Western Democrats Really Capable of Stooping to Crimes Against Humanity? French General Pierre Gallois Asks"] [Text] Paris, 16 Feb -- These days official France is somewhat reminiscent of a hypnotized person. Domestic policy has been put on the back burner. All thoughts and discussions in both the ruling right-wing parties and the opposition are associated with Bosnia, or to be precise the NATO ultimatum to the Serbs. It seems that everything revolves around this. This situation involuntarily prompts many people to reflect on the situation's preprogrammed nature. First of all, people here are pondering whether the NATO ultimatum is itself in France's national interests, and likewise Paris' entire policy in Bosnia and the way it forms a bloc against the Serbs exclusively with the Muslim side or more rarely with the Croatian side. Second, alarm is also being aroused by Washington's attempts to supplant the United Nations with the NATO bloc and with its help to mete out punishment to the world's peoples in the name of a "new world order." Third, every day there are more and more press items questioning the official version of the mortar attack on the market in Sarajevo. General Pierre M. Gallois, the eminent French strategist, shares his thoughts with PRAVDA readers: "NATO is now completely subordinate to the United States. The Atlantic alliance's military organization has become a most powerful instrument in establishing a `new world order.' It is meant to punish and does not take the trouble to find out exactly who is really guilty. "That was the case in June 1993, when the United States decided to 'punish' Iraq for 'attempting to assassinate President Bush.' B. Clinton sent cruise missiles to Baghdad even before the Iraqis' guilt had been proved. It was only later that the U.S. press admitted that there had been no attempt on Bush's life. But dozens of completely innocent people's lives had already been sacrificed to U.S. democracy. "Washington and NATO Secretary General Woerner, a German, have just issued an ultimatum to the Serbs in order to punish them for the bloody massacre in Sarajevo, of which they are accusing only the Serbs. Without even waiting for the results of an investigation by a special commission. "Something similar also occurred in Bosnia 27 May 1992, when the Serbs were accused of gunning down a peaceful bread line in Sarajevo. The Serbs were not guilty of this, but the investigating commission concealed the facts, including the fact that most of the people killed in this line were Serbs. "Nevertheless, at the time this incident served as grounds to impose economic sanctions, as a result of which thousands of peaceful Serbian inhabitants who were just as completely innocent as those killed in that bread line suffered. "What happened in the market in Markala is also strange in terms of both its presentation to the public and consequences. Just a single round from a mortar -- a rather inaccurate weapon -- could not, if fired from Serb positions, have hit a 40-by-30-meter [m] target the first time. Nobody could have seen a mortar shell in flight, as certain 'witnesses' claimed. Alas, all they could have seen was the result of the explosion, not the mortar shell itself. Finally, the haste with which Western powers hurried to adopt sanctions against the Serbs without even having convened a commission of investigation looks highly suspicious. It is no less suspicious than the adoption of sanctions after the events of 27 May 1992. The Serbs were not responsible for that crime, as was later proved. "What does this conspiracy mean? Surely Western governments did not deliberately hurry to make fools of themselves? Or is the German mark so strong and the desire for oil so overwhelming that because of this Western democracies are capable of stooping to crimes against humanity? In addition, they have started using unworthy methods of warfare: shooting at their own troops and accusing the enemy of this, so that it is condemned by the public for doing this." In his own way Admiral Jacques Lanxade, French Armed Forces chief of staff, supplements Gen. Gallois' analysis. Speaking at a seminar in Munich, he said that in Bosnia it is impermissible to adopt any one side in such a complex conflict. "I also do not believe," he said, "that we can declare war on any one of the sides." Disagreeing with "simple solutions," the admiral spoke out against, in particular, calls for a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo in favor of the Bosnian Muslims. He noted that most of the 18 French soldiers killed and 300 wounded in Bosnia have died at the hands of Muslims and not Serbs. But these facts are being carefully concealed, and the press practically kept quiet about Adm. Lanxade's speech; only L'HUMANITE risked quoting it. Material sent to PRAVDA's Paris office from Switzerland notes that, according to an analysis by certain military specialists, what was used at the market in Markala was not a mortar shell but a new type of antipersonnel ball-bearing mine developed at the "Slavko Rodic" Bosnian military plant in the city of Bugojno and taken into the Bosnian Muslim army's arsenal. This mine contains up to 5,000 steel balls 4-5 mm in diameter and has a casualty radius of 60-80 m. The nature of the effect on people and buildings confirms this. Especially as not a single mortar shell in the Yugoslav Army arsenal could have had this effect. Another curious detail: The market in Markala is mainly Serbian and Croatian; it is practically not visited by Muslims. Even on the newsreel it could be observed that those killed at the market were buried in a Christian cemetery with crosses and not in a Muslim cemetery. Hence the Swiss authors conclude that this was a repetition of the provocation against Serbs based on the method of 27 May 1992. There is a good Russian proverb: "Look before you leap." Russia, in the name of its historical friendship with Serbs and its common fate with them, must resolutely advise the world community to act according to this very principle in Bosnia. Before something irreparable happens in the Balkans. Before hundreds if not thousands of innocent people are killed. After all, the conflagration of a world war has erupted there twice already. A third must not be allowed.
