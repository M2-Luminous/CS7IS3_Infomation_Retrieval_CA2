Safeguarding stability is neither empty talk, nor ostentation, nor simple, passive handling of the contradictions and problems in social life. It is a valuable experience and a profound lesson we have learned from the smooth practice of reform and opening up to the outside world, as well as economic construction, over the past dozen years. It requires a clear understanding of the overall situation; a sense of mission and urgency in maintaining the good developmental trend in reform, opening up to the outside world, and economic construction; and the courage to blaze new trails and use down-to-earth methods to tackle the contradictions and problems cropping up in the course of progress. To safeguard social and political stability calls for genuine efforts. For leading cadres at various levels, first of all they must make earnest efforts to improve their style of work. First, it is necessary for them to plunge deep into practice in order to undertake investigations and studies, pay close attention to the implementation of the policies and measures for reform and development already adopted by the central authorities, combine general calls with concrete guidance, and discuss together with the masses concrete programs for reform and development, as well as measures for overcoming difficulties and developing the economy. An urgent topic at present is how to imbue state-owned enterprises -- especially those state-owned enterprises that are incurring losses -- with real vitality in the reform to change operational mechanisms and to establish a modern enterprise system. For governments at various levels, it is necessary for them to actively explore changing their functions, improving the management of state-owned assets, establishing a social security system, improving the market system, and reducing enterprise burdens, so as to continuously create a good environment and good conditions for enterprise reform. The steady development of agriculture is also of paramount importance. It is imperative for us to strictly carry out the party's principles and policies concerning the countryside, truly increase the peasants' comparative return on grain crop cultivation, provide serialized quality services, help resolve specific problems in production, raise the peasants' income, and render guidance to them so they can enter the market more smoothly. Second, in the spirit of being highly responsible for the people, we should always heed the cries of the masses, show concern for their hardships, safeguard their personal interests, and lead them in overcoming difficulties and solving problems, so as to spur on the development of various undertakings. To stabilize the market and keep prices down is a key issue in correctly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability; it is also an important task confronting governments at all levels. They have adopted a series of measures or countermeasures to hold excessively rapid price increases in check -- from controlling the scale of fixed-asset investment and ensuring food grain and staple food supplies, to launching general checks on prices, requiring clearly marked prices on goods for sale, and taking measures against staggering profits. These measures have reaped initial results. New efforts are needed in studying the problem of how to establish and improve the price regulation and control system under the conditions of a market economy. While making efforts to conduct the reform in depth, it is necessary to take into simultaneous consideration the interests of all sectors, in both urban and rural areas. In practical work, particular attention should be given to that part of the masses which is not yet well-off or which even faces considerable financial hardship. They should be given earnest help in overcoming financial hardship, and their basic needs should be guaranteed. At present, some places have adopted a compensation system that links basic old-age pensions with the cost of living index; others have established help-the-poor funds in urban areas to subsidize those families with low incomes and those who are extremely poor. Third, it is necessary to be good at observing the people's conditions; to pay attention to coordinating interest relations; to give correct guidance to and straighten out people's feelings; to resolve contradictions in a timely fashion; and to guide, protect, and give full scope to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. The overall advance of reform inevitably will lead to a more profound readjustment of all kinds of interests, and will give rise to many new situations, new problems, and new contradictions. This requires us to pay further attention to doing a good job in strengthening communication with all sectors; to be aware of the will and demands of the masses; to uphold a correct orientation in press coverage; to give necessary explanations so as to remove misgivings among the people; and to guide the masses to correctly understand the necessity, arduous nature, and complexity of the reform; have the overall situation of reform and development in mind, correctly understand the relationship between personal and collective interests, between partial and overall interests, and between short-term and long-term interests; and to plunge heart and soul into the reform. In addition, it is necessary to do painstaking work to solve contradictions among the people and to mobilize all positive factors to maintain a sound social mode and a sound atmosphere in public opinion. Fourth, it is necessary to adopt specific measures to tackle hot social issues for which the broad masses show great concern, be honest in performing our official duties, and work industriously for the people until good results have been achieved. Continuous efforts should be made to do a good job in the struggle against corruption and in promoting clean government. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Disciplinary Committee recently reiterated the "five requirements" for leaders at all levels to keep a clean government and be self-disciplined. These are rules of behavior that government leaders must follow. In terms of society as a whole, greater efforts should be made to strengthen discipline and halt unhealthy tendencies. Continuous efforts should be made to investigate cases that violate the law and discipline -- particularly the major and important ones -- and to punish and purge those corrupt elements that offend the law and discipline. Social mode has a direct bearing on social stability. It is necessary to further encourage healthy social trends, advocate the tradition of standing up for justice, and strive for a fundamental turn for the better in the social mode. It is necessary to explore new and comprehensive ways to maintain sound social order, and to improve and perfect the new mechanism of mass participation. In addition, severe punishments are needed in order to deal resolute blows to law-breakers and to create a stable and harmonious social environment for reform and development. With stability there will be prosperity, and with stability there will be a future. Overall social and political stability should be treasured, protected, and maintained by society as a whole.
