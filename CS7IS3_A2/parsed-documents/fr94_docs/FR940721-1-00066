FR940721-1-00066 FR940721-1-00014 (vii) Any borrower payment to a CLO operator for use of a qualified CLO must be paid outside of and before closing. A borrower must receive full disclosure of the amount of the fee before the CLO services are performed. In this proposed rule, the Department is establishing the minimum requirements that must be met by a qualified CLO system if payments by a borrower to the operator of the system are to enjoy an exemption from RESPA. The Department believes that these requirements are responsive to the many comments on CLOs, and that compliance with the requirements will assure that: CLO systems receiving the benefit of the exemption are operated fairly; these systems will not be used as disguised means of steering borrowers to particular lenders on a basis other than the quality of services provided; and lenders wishing to participate in qualified CLO systems will be permitted to do so on a fair and equitable basis. In addition, this proposed rule would continue and augment certain requirements for all providers of CLO services, whether or not the CLO is a qualified CLO. In all circumstances where a CLO is utilized, the CLO disclosure set forth in Appendix E must be provided to borrowers before the CLO services are performed. The existence of any controlled business arrangement involving the operator of a CLO and any participating lender must be disclosed to the borrower before the system is utilized. Similarly, lender payments to other settlement service providers for CLO services must continue to be disclosed on the Good Faith Estimate and on the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A, in accordance with the February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505) revision of the regulations, and the possibility of such payments must be noted on the CLO disclosure. (e) Questions and comments on this proposal. In formulating the final rule, the Department may modify the requirements for the exemption, based on comments from the public. The Department seeks public comment on all aspects of its proposal to limit the exemption for borrower payments to payments made for qualified CLOs, including: (i) Does the approach embodied in this proposal_establishing a safe harbor for borrower payments for qualified systems, continuing to scrutinize borrower payments for nonqualified systems under RESPA, and mandating certain disclosures for all systems_the best approach to encourage the use of technology to benefit consumers and, at the same time, protect consumers from unfair practices? Instead, should the Department provide that any payment for a CLO system that does not qualify for the safe harbor is presumed to violate RESPA? (Commenters who believe that there should be broader prohibitions should detail the legal and other justifications for this belief.) (ii) Would establishment of a parallel exemption for payments made by lenders to operators of qualified CLOs be in the best interest of consumers? If so, should the requirements for a lender payment CLO exemption be the same as the requirements for the borrower payment exemption? Those commenters who believe the requirements should be different should specify what differences they recommend. (iii) Are most CLO systems likely to be financed using borrower payments, lender payments, or a combination of both? Will any CLO system provide access to the system to lenders and borrowers free of charge? (iv) Are the benefits of having borrower payments exempt from RESPA scrutiny sufficient to encourage CLO operators to develop qualified CLOs? Will CLO operators prefer to be subject to the general test under RESPA that borrower payments must be in exchange for services actually performed or to meet the requirements for qualified CLOs? (v) Will the requirements for qualified CLOs in the proposal result in cost-effective CLOs offering meaningful services to consumers? (vi) Is the requirement for CLO disclosure to consumers in this proposal reasonable and does it serve the consumers' best interests?
