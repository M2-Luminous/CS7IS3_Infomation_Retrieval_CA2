RIA was told by the government's press service that debt for gas to neighboring Uzbekistan currently amounts to approximately 10 million U.S. dollars. The lion's share of that sum consists of the debts of the Republic's industrial sector due to its insolvency. The government and local administrations are also unable to subsidize gas consumption for the private sector. Kyrgyz authorities have been instructed to review gas charges with a view toward raising them, as a solution to a situation in which Uzbekistan may, at any moment, turn off the tap of natural gas supplies.
