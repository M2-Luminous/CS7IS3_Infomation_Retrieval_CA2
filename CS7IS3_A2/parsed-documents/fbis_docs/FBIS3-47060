The four-day subcabinet-level negotiations will begin in Tokyo on Tuesday under an agreement to work out a new framework for bilateral trade. The officials said Washington insists on a tough stand concerning auto and auto parts trade, pressing Japan to make further concessions to open its automobile market wider to imports. The negotiations will focus on a U.S. demand that Japan set a numerical target for imports of U.S.-built cars and parts, they said. In previous sessions of the talks, the United States proposed that the Japanese Government ask Japanese automakers to extend their programs for imports of U.S.-made auto parts beyond fiscal 1995 and that the Japanese and U.S. Governments work out rough measures setting the value of Japanese imports of finished cars and parts from the United States in the future. Sluggish automobile sales at home and overseas have made it difficult for the Japanese auto industry to compromise on the U.S. stance, the officials said. They said Washington will find it equally difficult to back down on its stand as automobile trade accounts for a large portion of its trade deficit with Japan. The officials said the negotiations may drag on toward a February 11 summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
