He noted that "social appropriations are now responsible for 70 per cent of the entire defence budget". According to the deputy minister, whole cities which mushroomed next to munitions factories, are maintained at the expense of the defence order. Kokoshin stressed that "the intention of the Finance Ministry to cut considerably the defence order this year may result in a collapse of key defence industries and will negatively tell on the fate of 15 million people". In Kokoshin's opinion, even the present defence order "is below the requirements of the Armed Forces". He underlined that the Defence Ministry is guided by the need to preserve the main high-tech industries. The deputy minister "had in mind industries manufacturing both military products and civil technologies. He pointed to the need for enlisting investments in the defence complex from the non-state sector. "We need major enterprises and industrial-financial groups. In future, many types of weapons can be financed with inner funds," he explained. Kokoshin also noted that cuts for defence "can negatively tell on the export of Russian weaponry". In his opinion, "the difficult position at our enterprises will undermine Russian export positions".
