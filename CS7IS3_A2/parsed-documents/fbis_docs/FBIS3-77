FBIS3-77 "cr00000018694001" 30 March 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-045--Russia ECONOMIC ISSUES NO 1: RUSSIA-BELARUS MONETARY UNION The central press has been publishing articles discussing the political, social and economic ramifications of a Russian-Belarusian monetary union. Economic experts, journalists and officials are debating the pros and cons of such a union in articles appearing in a variety of sources. No Consensus in Belarus Belarusian Radicals Call for a Strike KRASNAYA ZVEZDA published an article by Valeriy Kovalev entitled "An Ordinary Meeting Instead of a Strike Took Place in the Belarusian Capital." Kovalev reported that a group of deputies from the opposition Belarusian National Front issued a statement claiming that a Belarusian-Russian monetary union would cause "the destruction of the Belarusian economy and the Belarusian state." The deputies called on their countrymen to engage in a "national liberation struggle" and to participate in a demonstration demanding removal of Kebich's government, dissolution of the Supreme Soviet, and early presidential elections. However, only about 1,000 people attended the rally in Minsk's central square, which led Kovalev to observe that "hardly anyone will be successful in coming to power in Belarus under the banner of fervent Russophobia." (Moscow KRASNAYA ZVEZDA in Russian 16 Feb 94 p 3) Belarusian Deputy Favors Union Henadz Kazlow, coordinator of the "Belarus" faction in the Supreme Soviet, in an interview responded to a question about a monetary union, noting that despite attempts to "foil" the agreement he believed "in the pragmatism of practical politicians who drafted this agreement," and added that "an economic union is already being discussed quite seriously. There is no other way out." (Minsk ZVYAZDA in Belarusian 23 Feb 94 pp 1, 3) Some Belarusians and Russians Agree Belarusian and Russian Enterpreneurs Appeal for Union The business-oriented paper DELOVOY MIR carried on page 1 an "Appeal from the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and the Belorussian (Belarusian) Scientific-Industrial Association to the Governments of Russia and Belorussia." The appeal, signed by Russian Union chairman A.I. Volskiy and president of the Belorussian Association M.F. Lavrinovich, pointed out that the time is ripe for integrating the monetary systems of the two republics and noted that possible temporary expenses due to unifying the monetary systems are commensurably small in comparison with the benefits from regulating economic and cooperative ties, broadening the market and increasing incomes from the development of production." The two organizations called upon their respective governments to "take this decisive and necessary step" which would benefit both "the economic situation and the population's standard of living." (Moscow DELOVOY MIR in Russian 25 Feb 94 p 1) Economists Emphasize Benefits of a Monetary Union The same issue of DELOVOY MIR ran an article by two candidates of economic science, Vladimir Safronov of Moscow and Aleksandr Yarosh of Minsk. In their article, entitled "Russia and Belarus: There are no Losers," they provided a number of statistics to prove that negative influences on either state's economy would be negligible. A model developed by Belarusian and Russian economists showed that in the former USSR Belarus provided one-tenth of all interrepublic imports and delivered almost one-fourth of its products to the other republics. At the same time, its dependence on economic ties with other republics was among the highest. If a Belarus-Russia monetary union also includes unified economic relations with the other republics, according to the model, Russian national income would grow 1.9 percent and Belarusian 7.9 percent. "Thus," the economists stated, "the results of the calculations prove that negative consequences for both states are insignificant." They concluded that "unification of the monetary-credit systems of Russia and Belarus provide more positive than negative results. The course toward reintegrating Russia and Belarus and creating an economic union answers their long-range state interests." (Moscow DELOVOY MIR in Russian 25 Feb 94 p 4) Bones of Contention Only Premiers Can Resolve These Two Issues In an article entitled "Moscow-Minsk: Will the Ruble Zone Expand?," ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Shinkin reported the Belarusian leadership's recognition that "the economic stability of the republic is scarcely possible without Russia." He added that both former Supreme Council speakers Shushkevich and current leader of parliament Hryb "have advocated the unification of the monetary systems." Shinkin cited Chernomyrdin, who "considers that there are two questions which can be resolved only at the level of the premiers of the two states." Prices for energy and the exchange rate between Russian and Belarusian rubles were the two issues. Quoting a Russian Ministry of Economics staffer, Shinkin reported that the supporters of a monetary union were divided between those who favored "meeting Belarus' demands halfway" while the other group was "insisting essentially upon a single budget." (Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA in Russian 17 Feb 94 p 6) Belarusian Demands Continue to Increase On 26 February SEGODNYA published an article by Yelena Kolokoltseva entitled "Belorussia (Belarus) is Insisting on Cheap Gas from Russia." Despite an agreement on lowering the price for a tonne of gas from 80 to 55 dollars, Kolokoltseva cited a Russian official who said that "Belorussia's appetites keep on growing." Belarus's demands were strengthened "by threats to impose tariffs on the transit of Russian energy sources through Belorussian territory." Belarus's goal, Kolokoltseva stated, was "to receive cheap energy resources and guarantee the sale to Russia of products which cannot compete in Western markets." She concluded that it is only Russian Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko who "can explain to the Russian leadership the financial consequences for the Russian economy of the unification of the Belorussian and Russian monetary systems. The question is whether he wants to do so." (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 26 Feb 94 p 2) Areas of Disagreement A SEGODNYA commentary by Aleksandr Bekker, entitled "Belorussia (Belarus) is Getting Russian Rubles but Does Not Want to Give Up Sovereignty," cited Deputy Russian Finance Minster Andrey Kazmin who identified three basic areas of disagreement between Russia and Belarus: Budget functions during the transition period; the status of Belarus' National Bank, which would lose its right of money emission; and prices for energy. Bekker stated that "the course of negotiations in Moscow show that Belorussia is not in the mood to part with important attributes of national sovereignty--its own budget and national bank--and these aspects will probably be used by the Belorussian parliamentary opposition." He added that "it is indicative, that even without having agreed with Russia on the size of the current year's budget deficit, the Belorussian parliament (went ahead and) allotted R2.8 trillion to its farmers for the sowing." (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 1 Mar 94 p 2) Kebich Remains Optimistic A Valentin Zhdanko report on the 18 March closed meeting of the Belarusian parliament, entitled "Vyacheslav Kebich Does Not Abandon His Dream about Single Ruble Zone. Belarusian Prime Minister Bets on Russian Parliament," appeared in SEGODNYA. Zhdanko quoted Kebich's accusation that "Mr. Tulin, deputy Central Bank chairman, and Mr. Kazmin, deputy finance minister, and some others revised the documents, a procedure that has entirely distorted the original draft treaty that was to be signed." Minsk rejected as unacceptable demands that the "two countries' budgets be merged and that the Belarusian National Bank be stripped of its independence." According to Zhdanko, however, Kebich remained optimistic and he cited a telephone conversation between him and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin: "The Russian leaders have expressed their political will and unequivocal desire to sign the document about setting up a money union as early as this month." Zhdanko added that in the upcoming talks with Nikolay Gonchar, Russian Federation Council Financial Committee chairman, "any unification of the two countries' budgets or infringement on the BNB's rights will not even be mentioned..." (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 19 Mar 94 p 1) Disadvantages for Russia and Belarus In March NOVOYE VREMYA ran an article by Yelena Vishnevskaya entitled "How Russia and Belorussia (Belarus) Will Combine and Divide Money." Vishnevskaya cited some objections to a monetary union from Boris Fedorov, former Finance Minister and currently head of the Duma commission on monetary and credit policy. She quoted Fedorov's statement that "pseudointegrated constructions cannot be viable" and his opinion that "nowhere and never has there been nor can there be a unified currency and two emission banks." Vishnevskaya then went on to refute some of Fedorov's assertions, stating, among other things, that "the National Bank of Belorussia does not have the right of currency emission." However, she admitted that a monetary union might be disadvantageous for Russia, citing a one-trillion ruble price tag for settling Belorussia's debts to Russian energy suppliers. She concluded that "in the future the expenditures can be justified--in an inviolable union oil and gas extracting enterprises can be erected precisely on Belorussian territory while relying on raw materials from Russia. If Russia wants to change from a raw material appendage of the Western economy into an exporter of at least semi-finished products it must build plants on its own territory, but this is not cheaper than including Belorussia in the ruble monetary system." (Moscow NOVOYE VREMYA in Russian No 10, (signed to press 5 Mar 94) pp 12-13) Monetary Union May Cost Belarus Too Much IZVESTIYA correspondent Aleksandr Starikevich and economist Nikodim Dubalevich described what Belarus might lose from a monetary union in an article entitled "Unification of Monetary Systems is Dangerous for Belarus Too." The authors pointed out that those in favor of monetary unification foresee two basic benefits--lower prices for Russian raw materials, specifically energy, and lower prices for Belarusian products and thus greater sales in Russia. But, the authors said, "there is no economic or political substantiation for these two hopes." The problem arises in determining the exchange rate, where an exchange rate of one to one means in practice a revaluation of the Belarusian ruble in relation to the Russian ruble and, as a consequence, a sharp increase in the prices of Belarusian output....In addition, the unification of monetary systems means the loss of some state sovereignty." The authors claimed that "this step is based not on economic but on political considerations" and accused the Kebich government of being unable to work independently and using monetary union as "its only salvation...." (Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 11 Mar 94 p 2) Fedorov Says Russia Will Pay For Union Former Russian Finance Minister and current Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov expressed his opinion about a monetary union in an IZVESTIYA article entitled "Cart Before the Horse: Merging the Belarusian and Russian Monetary Systems." Fedorov called the merger of the two currencies a "mutant" which would be unlikely to survive for even a short while because "the compatibility necessary between the economic and political systems is lacking." He added that they, meaning the political leaders of both countries, "intend to carry out the merger at Russians' expense" because the terms demanded by the Belarusians "will ultimately cause inflation to rise." Fedorov believed that political reunification must come before economic unification. Any price that must be paid then "will be a conscious price paid for the reunification of fraternal peoples, which will ultimately also yield economic results."
