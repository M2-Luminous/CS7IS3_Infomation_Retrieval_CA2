Once again, the group demands the return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti and denounces the situation prevailing at the Senate of the Republic. Firmin Jean-Louis is the Senate president and cannot be dismissed arbitrarily, according to the group calling for a return to order at the Senate. [Begin unidentified spokesman recording, in Creole] We in the Fort-Saint-Clair Group feel very indignant at the national conference that the Committee of Actions for National Reconciliation wants to hold on 6 and 7 February. We are also opposed to all demonstrations scheduled for 4 February by the macoute sector that never works in the interest of the people in a country where human rights are not protected and where the criminals who staged the coup d'etat are using violence. This is why we in the Fort St. Clair group say first that the United States should stop stalling for time while speaking of the Governors Island and the New York pacts. We unreservedly support a demonstration to be held on 6 and 7 February by the masses and all worthy military so democracy can be established in Haiti with President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in power.
