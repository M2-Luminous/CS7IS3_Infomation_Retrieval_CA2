Recall that in August of last year 370 enterprises in the Maritime Region stopped work for a period of from 2 to 24 hours. They struck in literally all sectors of the economy. As is well-known, at that time a "landing force" of 80 ministers and their deputies together with the chairman of the government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, came immediately to the Far East. But now half a year has passed. Vladimir Pavlovich was in Moscow on business, and when I met him here, naturally I wanted to know if there had been any changes. [Chubay] There have been, but for the worse. Based on the results of the commission's work, the government adopted a decree. It is not a bad document; it envisions a solution to our basic problems: allocation of subsidies for the fuel and energy complex, lower rates for transport shipping, and customs charges are authorized to remain in the kray. But several months have already passed and the paper really has not taken effect. Moreover, we got a telegram from first vice premier Gaydar, who now is already former vice premier. He told us not to expect subsidies for bread, to take care of it ourselves. But may I ask you, what can we do ourselves now when both under the tsar and under Soviet power 50 percent of the food was imported into the Far East from other regions? We do not grow grain at all. An altogether different complex was established here: machine building and fish, defense, and other sectors of industry. And suddenly, right before winter comes this telegram. To get grain you need some time and money. Our most critical problem is transport. No matter what you are doing, everything has to be imported from somewhere. And the price of transport, despite the promises, has doubled again recently. In short, the situation is desperate. The electricity has been turned off at enterprises which did not pay their bills to Dalenergo [Far East Energy System]. But how can they pay when their partners have not paid them? It is an endless circle. Dalenergo owes 40 billion rubles [R] to coal and black oil suppliers. Among our neighbors, in Japan, and even in America the cost of electricity is the same throughout the country. There electricity prices and, incidentally, grain prices too are regulated by the state. But here the hydroelectric power plant collective of 200 people privatizes the enterprise and inflates prices at their own discretion. Several days ago the hot water supply to apartments was shut off. And the way they are heated the mercury column in the thermometer does not rise above 12 degrees. Is that really normal? People are forced to get small stoves ["burzhuyka's"], especially in settlements. [Kubarev] Vladimir Pavlovich, a few days ago there was a report in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA from the settlement of Bolshoy Kamen. The state incurred debts of R20 billion to the Zvezda defense plant. The workers have been without pay for 2 months. When I was there, they complained of the same troubles. But the chairman of the brigades council, Sergey Savitskiy, reassured the comrades: "The government knows about us now and will take steps." And the people believed the promises. [Chubay] Of course they believed them. That is not what is striking. How can officials of such high state rank give promises so easily and not fulfill them? [Kubarev] But are you really saying that the decree is not bad? And that apparently someone else altogether is to blame for it not working? [Chubay] No, I do not agree! Do you remember what I told you surprised us most at the meetings with the governmental commission? [Kubarev] Yes, I remember very well. And what I was told by many people, incidentally, in particular the chairman of the dock workers trade union of the Vladivostok Trade Port, V. Reksha: "We have sent 3,000 letters and telegrams to Moscow on the terrible situation in the kray. Not a word in response. And then suddenly members of the commission which visited us announce that they did not know anything about the crisis! Then just how are simple people supposed to get through to the authorities?" You do not have to dig back into your memory very far: highly placed officials' references to their lack of information are not so very rare. The thought comes to mind: isn't the reason that our lives are getting worse and worse that the powers-that-be do not know anything about it and simply do not want to know? [Chubay] That is just the trouble. Our Far East has been driven into a corner! It is no secret that we have quite a large number of military men and a large fleet. And everyone has to be fed, and we receive this telegram: do not expect grain. On a business trip to Moscow, I visited your stores here: eggs and meat are a bit cheaper but they do not leave the counters. People say, your (that is, our) pay is higher. Is that so? Miners who extract tungsten, lead, and tin under difficult conditions receive 50,000. Tell me, how does a miner live? Things are even worse for fishermen. The real disaster is fuel. Because of the lack of it, ships cannot go to sea and sometimes are not even able to return to port. I am ashamed to say that the fishermen go to the shores of South Korea for fuel and buy our very own fuel there, at three times the price, for hard currency. It is delivered there by Russian businessmen who buy it from the state for a song. What do we do, get people to strike again? So that we are again accused of playing politics? We do not want a strike, we want to work productively and restore the country. Alas, the Maritime Region has the highest mortality rate in Russia. Especially among old men, they are just mowed down, and we bury them... in plastic bags. [Kubarev] So there is no way out? [Chubay] Why, what do you mean? A new parliament has been elected and the government has been reformed. I think that we will find aid and support from them all the same. We are approaching the elections to local organs of representative power. Of the 28 seats in the kray duma, we figure to get at least one-third. We hope that our deputies will not be so hard-of-hearing as those fly-in hotshots.
