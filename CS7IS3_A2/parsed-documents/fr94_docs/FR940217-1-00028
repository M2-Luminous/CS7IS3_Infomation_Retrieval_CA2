FR940217-1-00028 FR940217-1-00005 V. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act 80 requires that the Commission, when proposing rules under the Exchange Act, consider the effects on competition of such rules, if any, and balance any anti-competitive impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission is of the view that the Rule will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 80 15 U.S.C. 78w(a) (1988). Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 81 the Commission previously prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``IRFA''), concerning the proposed rule. The IRFA indicated that the proposed rule may impose some additional costs on small broker-dealers, small investment advisers, and small investors. The Commission has prepared a revised IRFA that details the changes to the proposed rule found in the reproposed rule. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule has been structured in a manner that further minimizes the costs of the reproposed system and fulfills the requirements of the Market Reform Act and section 13(h) of the Exchange Act. A copy of the revised IRFA may be obtained from Cameron D. Smith, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, (202) 272&hyph;5418. 81 5 U.S.C. 604 (1988). VI.
