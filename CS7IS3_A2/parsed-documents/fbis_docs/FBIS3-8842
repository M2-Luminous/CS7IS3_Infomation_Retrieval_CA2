In the June 1992 elections Moravcik was elected an HZDS deputy to the House of the People of the Federal Assembly (parliament) and in July he was appointed federal foreign minister. He held the post until December 1992 when the Czechoslovak Federation ceased to exist. In 1993 he became a legislative adviser to Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar. He was appointed Slovak foreign minister on March 19, 1993, to replace Milan Knazko (then HZDS) who was fired after long-term disputes with Meciar. [passage omitted] Moravcik made clear his opinion that a political structure compatible with the political structure common in Western Europe should be created in Slovakia. He warned that the HZDS did not have a partner in the West and said this was "a certain handicap." He also claimed he sympathized with the social democratic orientation.
