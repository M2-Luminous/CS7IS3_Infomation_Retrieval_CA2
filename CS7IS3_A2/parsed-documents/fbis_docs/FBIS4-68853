The 112 vacant places after the runoff election are a clear sign of the imperfect nature of the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine." The law is supposed to reflect the needs of real life. In the given case, the nature of the law, detached from contemporary realities, became the reason for the delays in the elections. Moreover, it is noteworthy that a rule which was not previously a feature of the electoral law of Ukraine got in the way of the elections having a normal result. This rule was article 46 of the Law, by which the establishment of the results of the election in the runoff election is carried out in the order established by article 43 of the same law, which in its turn provides that, "a candidate for deputy is considered elected, that gets in the election more than half of the votes of the voters who took part in the elections, but not less than 25 percent of the number of voters on the list of voters of the given district." This rule, with its contents, is intended to eliminate situations in which the opinion of an insignificant number of voters leads accidently to the election, as people's deputy, of a person who had been able to get a relative majority, through the scattering of votes over a large number of registered candidates for deputy. As for the runoff elections, this rule works in exactly the opposite direction. The views of a certain percentage of voters, who do not share the convictions of any candidate, lead to the situation in which none of the candidates for deputy gets the necessary number of votes. Unfortunately, this happened in many districts. So, despite the fundamental idea of democratic elections, according to which the results of elections are supposed to reflect the will of the real majority of voters, the rule of article 46 of the Law of Ukraine "On the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine," led to the directly opposite outcome: the results of the elections were actually decided by an absolute minority of voters, that was also a relative minority with respect to those who supported both candidates. In this way, the principle was violated which is included in paragraph three of article one of the law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine"--"The basic principles and bases of the elections of People's Deputies of Ukraine," according to which "the elections are carried out in 450 single mandate electoral districts on the basis of an absolute majority." The special rule of paragraph two of article 46 of the Law does not ensure that the principle in article one of the same law will be achieved. But according to one of the axiomatic bases of the general theory of the state and law, with respect to the interrelationships of the juridical force of the rules of law of different types, the rules-principles have a greater weight than special rules, when the latter contradict the former. Moreover, this result contradicts the basis established by paragraph three of article two of the Law, according to which, "any direct or indirect limitations concerning the electoral rights of the citizens of Ukraine which depend on their political convictions ... not provided by this Law, are forbidden." (Since in fact, if both candidates that get to the runoff election belong to the right wing (or the reverse), then the participation in the elections of 4-5 percent of the voters with other convictions would have to lead (and actually led) to the candidates being deprived of the subjective right to be elected, provided by article two of the Law, as something that is not restricted by political convictions.) Here there is a contradiction between the rule-principle and the special rule. Such conclusions are harmful in themselves. But let us try to foresee a further turn of events: clearly, two rounds of voting have indicated a more or less exact "distribution of forces" in the electoral districts. There is no basis to expect any sort of "explosion" of activity by the voters at the start of the summer as well, when the runoff elections are supposed to take place. Under these conditions, the runoffs this time will also not provide really elected deputies, or what is more probable, generally will not take place. However, a large amount of money will be vainly spent carrying them out, which could be directed to social assistance for the population. What is the legal way out of this situation? I think that it is worth turning to the corresponding rule of the Law of the Ukrainian SSR, "On the Elections of the People's Deputies of the Ukrainian SSR" (article 54), according to which, in cases of runoff elections, the candidate for people's deputy is considered to be elected, who received in the runoff election the greatest number of votes of the voters who took part in the election. The introduction of corresponding changes to the rules of article 46 of the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine," would be justified for many reasons. Analyzing the situation which developed after the elections of 27 March and 10 April, I turned to the transcripts of the session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine at which the text of article 46 of this Law was discussed and confirmed. All who spoke proposed to introduce a rule to the Law, which would not only simplify the elections, but would make it possible to eliminate runoff elections. But as became known after 10 April, the established goal of simplifying the elections was placed, by the deputies themselves, in unrealistic frameworks. Here it is also necessary to emphasize that the corresponding role of article 43 (to which article 46 refers) does not reflect, in actuality, the position of the deputies. In the course of the discussion of this article, there were two pressing and disputed points: the number of people who had to come to the elections, and a numerically adequate threshold of votes, for the candidates to be elected. In the first, the point of view won concerning the need for a minimal number of persons on the list of voters, that is equal to 50 plus one. As for the second, actually the objections do not come with respect to the adequacy of 25 percent of the number of persons on the list of voters, for the election of a candidate; the objections come only with respect to the principle of an absolute majority of votes, and in place a relative majority was proposed, to make the process of the elections easier. In the voting, the question was put in such a way that there could not be any sort of majority of votes. This is the transcript of session 32, 18 November 1993 (Bulletin no. 32, p. 18). Presiding: "All this is clear. Let us find a compromise. This compromise will lead to elections having taken place only when 50 percent of the voters on the list come. But for there to be fewer runoff elections, a rule of 25 percent from the general list has to be introduced. This rule will decrease the number of runoff elections, and will indicate the victor in the voting more quickly. Right? Can all come together on such a position? "Vorobyov speaks correctly--a relative majority, but not less than 25 percent of the voters on the lists. "So, I ask you to vote for article 46 with the corrections we have made. To point three--the participation of 50 percent of the number of voters, and in point four--as in the version of the commission, that is--not less than 25 percent of the number of voters on the lists. "I ask you to vote for this version." In this way, the deputies actually while passing the law were supposed to think that they were voting for conditions of election, in which for the election of a deputy, it was enough for him to get the votes of 25 percent of the number of voters, on the list, without any sort of numeric limitations. And the number 50 plus one applied to the condition for indication of elections as being effective. So the text of the rule in article 43, and, correspondingly, of article 46, which refers back to the former, clearly does not correspond to the will of the deputies. Perhaps we have before us a typical technical mistake in combination with misunderstanding. There is all the more reason to correct it, at least concerning runoff elections, in order to complete in a constructive way the process of forming the parliament. As concerns the runoff elections themselves, the above mentioned "noble goals" of creating conditions for an effective parliament require, for bringing them into being, quite different concrete steps. Will making the changes being discussed to the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies" have any signficant negative aspects? I do not think so. Usually, as a general rule, a law ought to be stable. But this principle exists first of all to ensure that the rules, by which laws are implemented, are not changed with insufficient grounds in the direction of limiting those laws (or total abolition). From this, it is considered unacceptable in the theory of the state and of law, to change or implement rules of reverse effect, which lay down obligations, establish limitations on laws, or prohibitions, and so on. But in this case, it concerns the direct opposite: for a change of rules in the direction of expanding the legal bases for implementing laws and for implementing the opposing force to these changes, that expand the boundaries for gaining the right to be elected. This concerns procedures. As for the legal content of the proposed changes, they, unquestionably, would correspond to the general goal of democratic elections--to form a parliament by democratic means; and to the rules-principles given above, of the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine." Moreover, the social purposefulness of the corresponding changes is apparent; it makes it possible to form an outstanding parliament, and saves money and effort which otherwise would have to be spent on carrying out runoff elections without results. The introduction of such changes would correspond by content not only with the previous experience of our state, but of democratic foreign states. In France from 1958 to 1985, there was a majoritarian system, so that for someone to be elected a member of parliament, a candiate in the first round had to get a complete majority of votes, but in the second it was enough to get a relative majority. So I think it is worthwhile to make changes to article 46 of the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine," with paragraph two in its final version: "The candidate for deputy will be considered elected, that got during the runoff election the majority of votes of the voters that took part in the voting for another candidate," and to expand the effect of these changes to legal relations which arose before they were accepted.
