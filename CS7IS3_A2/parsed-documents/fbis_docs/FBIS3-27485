Kandinsky] [Text] Professor Li of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences wasn't impressed when a Communist Party newspaper invited him to write an article on the "socialist market economy" in late 1992. "Those people have gone on preaching about their kind of socialism for the last three years," he said. "Who knew what they really wanted?" Li didn't write anything for it, but he continued to publish articles about his market theories in other media. "Publications on the lower levels of the official hierarchy have a better reputation," he said. "Intellectuals of my generation no longer have any hope of working with this regime." But the newspaper kept asking him, most recently late last year, shortly after the party's central committee held its annual plenary session which adopted a decision to embrace more economic reforms. "I finally agreed, thinking this time it might be different," he said. "But once again, I was being stupid." The editor of the newspaper called Li not long after the article had been submitted. "I'm sorry, but we can't use your piece," he said. "Why?" Li asked. The editor explained: "Didn't you recently write an article for a Hong Kong newspaper? According to the responsible authorities, you did and that article raised some problematic points." And so, the professor's article was killed. "Every time the government fails, it is because it has refused to listen to its best critics," Li said. China's best-trained economists, including those in the government think-tanks, are predicting the regime's single minded pursuit of high growth will have disastrous consequences, according to Li. But Chinese leaders have yet to mend their relations with the intellectuals, which were rent asunder after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. The party's "policy on intellectuals" is still one of deep distrust. Soon after Tiananmen, the regime convened a series of meetings to "sum up the experience" of how the party had won that "historical victory." The central issue was explaining the spread of "bourgeois liberalism" which had almost toppled the communist regime. Their conclusion: It was still necessary to continue the class struggle in the Stalinist and Maoist sense. Class analysis, not economic development, should remain the "lifeline of the party". The class enemy, the party ideologues declared, was the middle class represented by troublemakers among the intellectuals. Their theory, according to Li, is that intellectuals know how much more their counterparts in the West are paid. Their resentment has corrupted them into refusing to work for the party and attacking the proletarian state. "Examine the speeches and articles by people like Deng Liqun--the party's leading hardline ideologue--or Wang Renzhi, who was director of the party's propaganda department after the 1989 crackdown," said Li. "From their speeches, you can see clearly that the middle class is the enemy and intellectuals are its representatives." There were open clashes between party bosses and intellectuals at the meetings to sum up the lessons of 1989, he said. At one session, he recalled, Wu Jinglian--one of China's leading economists--challenged the party speaker by saying that no government could hold itself up without support from intellectuals, nor could society become stable without a large, middle income population. "Of course, they rejected this kind of criticism," he said. "They don't believe that a middle class is necessary to sustain stability. They think because they have the Army their guns and tanks will be enough for them to rule China forever." Since the mid-1980s, economists have been strenuously advocating many of the reform ideas which the regime is now tentatively considering. The proposal for a genuinely independent central bank, for instance, was rejected by the Premier, Li Peng, many times. At one State Council meeting in 1991, Li became furious when banking reform was mentioned. "The People's Bank [China's nominal central bank] is nearly the last bit of power that I have left," Li yelled at the proponent. "If you want to rob me of this too, why don't you just proclaim yourself premier?" It may not be coincidental that the new banking reforms were only approved while Li was on sick leave after a heart attack last year. "I no longer care whether they use my ideas or not," a professor at Beijing University said. "These are the same ideas we put forward back in the mid-1980s and which they condemned as "bourgeois liberalism"--if they don't use my ideas, they themselves will pay the price." Relations between the regime and intellectuals were different, he said, from the time "when we were enthusiastic about the reform and optimistic about its success. Now, it is more like a business relationship: You place an order, and I'll deliver the goods--if I feel like it." There were several thousand Chinese graduate students with economics majors in Western countries. But the regime had never listened to their opinions, he said. "This is a terrible waste of human resources at a time when China is faced by all sorts of dangers." As one cultural critic said: "China fall apart. But if it reaches that point, it will be because of the regime's policy blunders. The worst mistake is to label those whose help is most needed as the enemy."
