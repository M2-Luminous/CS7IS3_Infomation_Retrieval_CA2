Addressing the concluding session this evening in New Delhi, the party president, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, said this is necessary for adopting Gandhian philosophy in the present context and to overcome the problem of social costs associated with this industry. He called upon the developed countries to join hands with developing nations in this campaign and said such programs should be innovative and time bound. Making a dig at the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] for its demand that India should go nuclear, Mr. Rao reiterated that the country would keep its options open. The decision will be based on disarmament trends in the world. We cannot play with weapons of mass destruction, he observed. Mr. Rao said there can be no question of one upmanship in this matter. He charged some political parties with misleading the people over the issue. Mr. Narasimha Rao underlined the need for strengthening the party's setup at the village level in a time bound manner. The Congress-I president said that the practice of giving party tickets to the relatives of leaders should be stopped as it has created resentment among the rank and file.
