Spokesmen for the pro-Sandinist parliamentary alliance have said that the draft of the constitutional reform consists of approximately 150 articles, and that in fact amounts to a new constitution, even though they shamelessly call it a partial reform. The FSLN and its allies do not want the people to exercise their fundamental right to express their true opinion of the change in the constitutional order, or to elect delegates to a constitutional convention to draft the new basic law of the Republic. What we have here, without a doubt, is a pact between leaders who pay a lot of lip service to the people and democracy, but who ostensibly serve only their personal and group interests. Moreover, by drafting a new constitution disguised as a partial reform, carried out without consulting the electorate and without constituent authority, the FSLN and its associates will make formal changes to ensure that little or no real change occurs. In other words, they will take away power from an executive branch that is subject to influence, and give it to a legislative branch that is controlled by the Sandinists. And they will expand the government coalition, now called a "governability compact," simply putting old wine in new bottles. It is clear that neither partial constitutional reform nor the drafting of a new constitution would automatically resolve the deep, pervasive crisis that has gripped Nicaragua. There is a profound and substantial difference between the two, however: Partial reform crafted by a National Assembly controlled by the FSLN will inevitably be oriented toward protecting the Sandinists' substantial interests, which means leaving the principal causes of the crisis untouched. In contrast, a Constitutional Convention elected by the people would give us a new constitution that would be the ideal legal and political instrument to eradicate totalitarianism, restructure the branches of government, and create a true system of law, justice, and liberty, which is what the country needs to rise up from the prostration in which the pro-Sandinists have placed it and where they intend to keep it with their constitutional reform.
