"Russia's proposal for an eight-party conference is part of the efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue. We note the intentions behind it," a Foreign Ministry official said in a commentary. "In solving the North Korean nuclear problem, efforts at the U.N. Security Council are important at this moment. The issue of an eight-party conference requires careful consideration by the United States, Japan and other involved nations," he said. Russia's proposal invites participation by South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia along with the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Seoul's reaction apparently reflects its reluctance to place Korean issues on the international table, although it seeks global coordination on the nuclear dispute. It has also chosen to rely on the South Korean-U.S. alliance at the moment instead of a multilateral arrangement. Ministry officials said they were notified in advance of Moscow's proposal on Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, the officials welcomed Moscow's commitment to support the Security Council resolution on North Korea.
