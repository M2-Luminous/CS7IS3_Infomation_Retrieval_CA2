Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos also said that the government has received no official statement and that its information is limited to press reports. Venizelos repeated that the Greek Government wants a quick solution to the issue, but that this is a hope, a goal; it does not mean things are close to agreement. The only development in the issue of Skopje, Venizelos said, is the Thursday [12 May] meeting in New York between Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry director general, and UN mediator Cyrus Vance. The Greek Government, Venizelos stressed, is not satisfied with the proposal for a mutual guarantee of borders. The spokesman concluded by saying that Skopje knows the conditions laid down by the Greek Government. They are international legal regulations that Skopje must respect.
