At 1815 on the same day, the Central Military Commission ordered the Beijing Military Region and the Beijing Garrison to take precautions; Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, hurried to the Central Military Commission Office to call a meeting and wait for a report on the incident. The communications center of the General Staff and Logistics Departments, located in Beijing's Nanyuan, is responsible for carrying out regular contacts with the headquarters of the major military regions throughout the country, group armies, and all of the arms and services, as well as military bases. In emergencies, this center issues orders and instructions. Here, the General Staff Department has 92 special communications lines and the General Logistics Department has more than 70 special communications lines. These communications lines link directly to the headquarters of major military regions and the arms and services, as well as military bases. The military power supply system is solely responsible for supplying electricity to the communications center and is governed by rules and regulations, with weekly checks and maintenance provided as well as a general check at the beginning of each month and during holidays. It is said that equipment for the center was imported from northern Europe in 1990 and is the most advanced in the world. Six Military Personnel Sent to Military Court for Dereliction of Duty The first outage occurred at 1755 on 8 February, just before a shift change, during which more than 20 communications lines went down in the fourth zone, which includes the Shenyang Military Region, the Lanzhou Military Region, the group armies stationed in North China, the North Sea Fleet, all the Air Force bases in North China, and the No. 801 missile base under the 2d Artillery Corps. Communications returned to normal at 1820. When the outage occurred, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wannian, Chi Haotian, and Fu Quanyou hurried to Nanyuan, where they ordered an investigation. Liu Huaqing, who was on an inspection tour of Fujian, also sent an emergency telegram to find out about the situation and was at one point ready to return to Beijing to handle the matter. It was verified that the accident occurred in this way: Four of the six personnel in charge of the communications with the fourth zone went out to buy wine when it was almost time for shift change, with only two staying at their post. In violation of discipline, the two turned off some of the equipment, left the room, and locked it. When the four returned, they could not open the door and communications were down for 20 minutes. After the accident, the six military personnel (including a major, who was the group leader) were sent to a military court for questioning. It is said that if convicted of this dereliction of duty, the main offender could be sentenced to death or at least 15 years' imprisonment. The Communications Center Went Down Twice A communications outage occurred again at the center on 19 February, which lasted for almost eight minutes. This was caused by a fire in the office of the communications center's duty officer. At about 2200, the duty officer and a security guard were drinking wine in the office and were soon drunk. Their lighted cigarettes set some newspapers ablaze and a fire broke out. Fortunately, a patrolling guard saw it and sounded the alarm. Some soldiers stationed in the center put out the fire and gave the order to turn off the equipment. They also reported the incident to the General Staff Department and the Central Military Commission. Subsequently, Zhang Wannian and Li Jijun went to the scene for an inspection. The duty officer and the security guard were arrested immediately. All Communications Personnel of the General Staff and Logistics Departments Were Transferred After these two fires, all of the working personnel at the communications center of the General Staff and Logistics Departments were transferred in March and replaced by personnel from Air Force Headquarters and a department directly under the Central Military Commission. Subsequently, the Central Military Commission gave the following orders: These two communications outages should be explained internally as routine equipment checks; no meetings will be held, nor circulars issued. Now, high-level CPC leaders are facing many knotty problems and have taken a high degree of precautions. If these "accidents," which are neither too big nor too small, happen again, their already taut nerves will become even more keyed up.
