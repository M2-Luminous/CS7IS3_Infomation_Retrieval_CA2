At a press conference here, Hosokawa said he would like to take enough time to consider whether it could be possible to incorporate objective criteria into a package of measures to cut Japan's 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. Washington has been pressuring Tokyo to whittle down the lopsided trade surplus by setting up objective criteria, such as numerical targets to gauge foreign access to the Japanese market. Japan, however, is opposed to the idea, saying it would lead to managed trade. The bilateral "framework" talks in Washington in February broke down due to differences over the matter. As for domestic politics, Hosokawa said he wants to promote his plan to establish a study group within the coalition, saying it is important for coalition partners to fine-tune common ideas to fight elections. Hosokawa's plan to form a study group involving all seven coalition parties is believed to be a preliminary stage before establishing a new party to fight off the leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party in the next general election. The coming election is likely to be held under a new system mixing single-seat constituencies and proportional representation.
