Issues connected with "the intensification of trade in agricultural and food products between our countries and the repayment of Polish debts in the Czech Republic" were among the subjects of the talks, Andrzej Smietanko, the Polish minister of agriculture, told journalists after the meeting. The Polish debt in the Czech Republic amounts to approximately $57 million. At the meeting, it was agreed that we would be repaying it by investing in areas on the Czech side of the border. Construction of border crossings and ecology projects, mainly sewage-treatment plants, are envisaged. The Polish minister reported on work on agreements on cooperation in the field of veterinary medicine and plant protection, as well as an agreement on cooperation between the Polish and Czech agriculture ministries. [passage omitted] Lux gave an assurance that land belonging to Polish farmers but lying on the Czech side of the border and land belonging to Czech farmers but lying on the Polish side would not become a subject of tension between the governments. "We will not allow any border changes," Lux said. "Irrespective of which citizen owns land in Poland or the Czech Republic, he will be subject to the law of the country where his land is," he added. Lux expressed the hope that the law on subsidies of certain groups of goods that had been adopted by the Sejm "would not lead to any restrictions in trade between our two countries."
