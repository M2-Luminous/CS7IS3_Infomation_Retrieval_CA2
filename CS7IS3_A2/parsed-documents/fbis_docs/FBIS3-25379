Ngonhamo, who was speaking to Mozambican journalists in Nampula yesterday, accused Lelio Goncalves, former commander of Unomoz forces, of having been an office general. [Begin Ngonhamo recording] This simply means that in all the 12 months he has been in Mozambique, he was an office general. He did not know, administer or control his soldiers. He does not know what the Unomoz soldiers in Mozambique did. First of all, the Unomoz soldiers are involved in a generalized sexual corruption with minors and this is a crime against humanity. Mr. Lelio Goncalves was never able to halt this situation. The Unomoz soldiers are using helicopters in their corrupt actions, they take girls wearing only bikinis by helicopter to the beach in Ponta do Ouro and Inde in Cabo Delgado and other beaches in Mozambique. The Unomoz soldiers even abuse the code of roads of our country, they frequently run over Mozambican citizens. The United Nations directorate in Mozambique has nothing to do with the Mozambican population. So, my words are valid for the Mozambican people who are tired of war, but for a Unomoz soldier who is here today and tomorrow leaves for his country, this does not mean anything, whether Mozambicans die or face difficulties, it does not matter for them. [end recording] Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo went as far as to accuse a Russian Major (Lopes), who is part of the Unomoz, of being an infiltrator, working for the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo], and of inciting war to maintain the weapons business. [Begin Ngonhamo recording] For instance, during the investigation of the Nihia issue regarding area number two, when soldiers were found in the area, a Russian Major came along who is part of the Unomoz, named (Lopes). When they were drafting a document to confirm the existence of soldiers in the area number two, he said the government might be right because it presented area number two as an assembly area. Our officials told them that this is not possible because Frelimo has 29 assembly areas and area two has not been mentioned as one of the 29 areas. If Frelimo has 30 assembly areas, why is area number two a secret? It has not been mentioned by the government in its assembly area lists. There is no doubt that this is intended to create confusion, this is a Russian officer in the Unomoz who does not want to see Frelimo condemned for its mistakes. My assessment of the situation is: I believe a number of soldiers infiltrated Unomoz and want the war to resume in Mozambique to facilitate the weapons business with Frelimo, and such is the case of this Russian officer. This is a dangerous situation. How can this UN officer maintain peace in this way, since he is encouraging people to violate the peace process so that the war resumes in the country. [end recording]
