FR940429-0-00009 FR940429-0-00005 Assessment This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26,1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rulemaking to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Since this rule applies only to recreational vessels, the Coast Guard has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rulemaking reduces the collection-of-information requirements approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). The subpart number is 33 CFR 1.30 and the corresponding OMB approval number is OMB Control Number 2115&hyph;0588. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 1 Administrative practice and procedure, Authority delegations (Government agencies), Freedom of information, Penalties, Fees. For the reasons set out in the preamble the interim rule published on February 17, 1993 (58 FR 8884) amending 33 CFR Part 1 is confirmed as final with the following change: PART 1_[AMENDED] Subpart 1.30_[Amended] 1.
