Idalberto, we would like you to explain the progress report process and its results in the municipality you represent. [Acuna] Well, the progress report meetings began in mid-May in our municipality. We had scheduled 308 meetings, but I believe the most significant thing is not the number of meetings or the fact that a program was carried out, which I can readily say has been carried out according to schedule. I believe the most interesting thing in this progress report process is the people's participation. They have always participated but, based on the guidance received from the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] in connection with deputies, ANPP province delegates, administrative officials, chiefs of distribution centers, officials in the service, gastronomy, and trade sectors, everyone who is part of the great ANPP system actively participated. [Bel Heredia] Idalberto, referring to the main proposals and the main topics analyzed at the meetings that were held in the different districts and groups, what areas did they mainly deal with? [Acuna] The same ones that are definitely more important nowadays -- electricity, gas, aqueducts. There is something I want to clarify, however. They have dealt with issues that were already discussed in other assemblies; for example, products missing from warehouses. This was not a significant issue, and we think we have yet to receive a report on this. That is definitely an achievement and we have made sure that people get their supplies, to prevent the type of problems that previously occurred. We have received some proposals concerning the gastronomy sector, mainly dealing with the distribution of hamburgers, pizzas, and other products. We have reviewed innumerable formulas to see which ones are definitely more acceptable. [Bel Heredia] Idalberto, if you had to make an assessment of the process that is about to conclude, what would you say about Centro Habana? [Acuna] We think it has been a superior progress report process. It has been superior because we have even ascertained the support given to the measures recently implemented in the country. In fact, it not only deals with the measures that have already been implemented; it also involves all the work carried out in each district, which is confirmed by the documents sent to the ANPP. They prove that the support has been absolute.
