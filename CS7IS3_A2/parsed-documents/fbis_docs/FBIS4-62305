FBIS4-62305 "drsov094_m_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Tajikistan Alimov Says Leadership Wants Peaceful Solution to `Strife' Alimov Says Leadership Wants Peaceful Solution to `Strife' LD1305172894 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1630 GMT 13 May 94 LD1305172894 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] "Rumors that the Tajik leadership is disinterested in finding a peaceful solution to the internal political strife and wants to increase Russian military presence to crush the opposition are groundless," Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov told INTERFAX. He said that Dushanbe had "sufficient good will to continue the dialog." Alimov believes that the "current state of the internal dialog gives inspires a cautious optimism." He said the main thing was that the "negotiations process has been launched and the parties involved have agreed to further peace talks." "We want to elevate the talks to a constructive plane and put an end to confrontation," Alimov stressed. He said the next round of talks between the Tajik and opposition leaders might even take place in Dushanbe in the first 10 days of June. UN representatives, he added, would decide on the final date and venue. IF Note: The UN secretary general's special representative for Tajikistan Ramires Piriz-Bollon is currently in Teheran, from where he will travel to Islamabad and then Dushanbe on 25-27 May. He will be accompanied to the Tajik capital by the UN deputy general secretary for political affairs, Marek Goulding. The date and venue of the next round of Tajik internal talks is for those officials to decide. Meanwhile, the Tajik Islamic Renaissance Movement issued a statement a few days ago on its readiness to consider a draft cease-fire agreement for the Tajik-Afghan border and observe its terms, if signed. The people behind the document recall that the opposition delegation at the peace talks in Moscow in April had proposed a cease-fire draft but that "the other side refused even to discuss its contents, demonstrating the Dushanbe regime's destructive position." IF Note: A joint communique on the talks between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Tajik leader Emomali Rahmonov contained support for the Tajik leadership's stance regarding the continuation of dialog with the aim of building a democratic Tajikistan. For that, firm commitment to the mutual cessation of hostilities, measures to restore and fortify mutual trust and the unhindered and safe return of refugees and forced migrants to the Republic were needed, the communique stated. The statement mentioned that the Tajik opposition posed no threat to Tajikistan itself, Russia or other CIS states. "We are citizens of Tajikistan finding ourselves temporarily outside the Republic's frontiers and want to return to our homeland and live in our own homes," it read. "Those forces which would obstruct the peaceful settlement of the conflict pose the real threat to the security of Tajikistan and other countries," the statement's authors said. The document also pointed out that the opposition was looking for a political way to end the conflict: "We have no objection to the presence of CIS Collective Peace-Keeping forces in Tajikistan to protect the country from inroads from outside." IF Note: In their communique, Yeltsin and Rahmonov highlighted the stabilizing role of the CIS forces in Tajikistan. "The joint efforts to provide reliable protection and defense for the southern borders, especially the Tajik-Afghan section, meet the interests of all CIS countries," the communique read. "Our campaign is not directed against any state and in no way does it threaten the security interests of Russia or any other CIS country. This is a conflict between the Tajik opposition and a close circle of individuals who forced us to leave our homeland," the Islamic Renaissance Movement's statement stressed.
