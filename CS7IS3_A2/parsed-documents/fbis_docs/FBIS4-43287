It has to pay $1.66 billion for foreign debts and 261.5 trillion Turkish lira [TL] for internal debts from June to September 1994. The treasury is expected to pay $510 million for Turkey's foreign debts in June. That will be the highest installment from June to September. August will be the most critical month in the repayment of Turkey's internal debts. The treasury will pay TL134 trillion for internal debts and TL18 trillion for salaries in that month. Internal Debts According to the treasury's plans on the flow of currency, TL40 trillion will be paid for internal debts and 18 trillion for salaries in June, 40.5 trillion will be paid for internal debts and 18 trillion for salaries in July, 134 trillion will be paid for internal debts and 18 trillion for salaries in August, and 47 trillion will be paid for internal debts and 18 trillion for salaries in September. Plans were made to allocate TL74 trillion for capital and interest payments in August. However, issuing TL40 trillion worth of bonds at an interest rate of 50 percent and the 20 trillion interest on the bonds have increased that amount to TL134 trillion. Treasury officials have said that additional borrowing will be unavoidable for the repayment of Turkey's internal debts in August.

It will pay $510 million in June, $320 million in July, $400 million in August, and $430 million in September.
