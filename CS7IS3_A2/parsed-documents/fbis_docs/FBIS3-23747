They Do, but..." [Text] Foreign investors' interest in Russian gold is obvious. Gold is mined in the Urals, the Far East, a number of regions in Western and Eastern Siberia, on Kamchatka and in Chukotka. A total of 146 tonnes of gold were mined in 1992, which means that the Russian Federation accounts for approximately 10 percent of world gold production. Russia's known gold deposits total approximately 12,000 tonnes. According to a state program for the development of the Russian Federation's mineral and raw materials infrastructure and its geological service in the 1993-95 period and up to the year 2000, a program now under discussion by the government, Russia is currently supplied with enough known reserves of placer gold to last 12 years and enough ore gold to last 30 years. In 1990 the Glavalmazzoloto [Main Administration for the Diamond and Gold Industry] Institute did a large-scale study that made it possible to project the volume of gold production in Russia and contained a model of the world precious metals market through the 2005-2010 period. The Russian gold mining industry's problems are inadequate equipment and a lack of funding to prospect for new gold deposits. The Russian Federation's admission to the World Monetary Fund and declassification of information about Russia's gold have given foreign companies a real chance to participate in gold mining. Representatives of various companies in Canada, the United States, Australia, France and South Africa have already visited virtually every Russian gold field and familiarized themselves with their mining and refining equipment and technology and with their labor organization. In principle, the leadership of the Russian Almazzoloto Corporation Joint-Stock Company and the Russian Prospecting Cooperatives Union are in favor of attracting foreign investment and participation by foreign companies both in the development of new gold fields and in the modernization of existing ones. In their opinion Russia already has all the necessary laws and legal statutes for that kind of cooperation. It is interesting to note that their positions differ on the issue of foreign investment. For instance, whereas Almazzoloto vice-president Ivan Alekseyev is in favor of having foreign companies involved both in the development of new fields and the modernization of existing ones, Viktor Tarakanovskiy, chairman of the Prospecting Cooperatives Union council, favors foreign participation, but only through the extension of loans, not establishment of joint ventures. We should note that Russian authorities are of the opinion that the best gold deposits should not be turned over to foreign companies for development. They should be developed solely by the Russian state and our country's own private capital. Prospectors' cooperatives have gone on record as saying that they themselves can increase gold production if the government will lower taxes, grant them the necessary licenses, give them the chance to carry on normal geological survey work and allow them to purchase leased property. Foreign capital can only be used to develop ore gold reserves, which are not that numerous in Russia. Foreign investors are not likely to be interested in small placer deposits (with reserves of one tonne of gold or more). In addition, Russian ore gold deposits are difficult to work: they contain heavy concentrations of arsenic, mercury and antimony. The leaders of Russia's gold mining industry feel that current Russian gold mining equipment is comparable to its best Western counterparts. What Russia needs now is a completely new, high-efficiency technology, which the West does not yet have. Currently open to international tender (though other terms are possible) are a number of new gold fields in the Russian Federation, including Pokrovskoye (Amur Oblast), Khakandzha (Khabarovsk Kray), Mayskoye (Magadan Oblast) and Ametistovoye (Kamchatka Oblast). A tender involving foreign participation has also been made to develop a deposit at Kubaka (Magadan Oblast). Foreign investors are not limited to a 30-percent share in net profits when engaged in gold mining. Authoritative structures dealing with gold mining in Russia have refuted published reports of any such restrictions, stressing that foreign partners can definitely count on a greater share than that. Much will depend on what any such cooperation would offer the gold mining industry and Russia as a whole. As for foreign investors' concerns over the political situation in Russia, every business involves a certain element of risk. But one should bear in mind that no matter what the initial conditions, the winner among foreign investors will be the one who is the first, disregarding the risk, to become established in Russian gold mining. However, when making the leap into Russian gold mining one should also consider the negative experience of the Australian corporation Star Technology Systems, which was interested in developing the Sukhoy Log field in Irkutsk Oblast, the largest gold deposit in Russia and one of the largest in the world. Both publicly and privately leaders of the Almazzoloto Russian Corporation Joint-Stock Company have levelled harsh criticism at that first attempt at large-scale attraction of foreign investment in Russian gold mining. The problem was that the Star corporation established the Lenzoloto-Star Joint Venture through a contract with the oblast state property committee, which did not possess the proper authority or authorization to do so. By doing so the Australian company was granted the right to develop not only previously surveyed deposits, but also any that might be discovered at Sukhoy Log in the future. Furthermore, it was agreed that gold prospectors' cooperatives would operate solely on the basis of agreements with the Lenzoloto-Star Joint Venture (thus far no licenses have been issued to prospectors). Plus, as was later revealed, the Star corporation did not have the necessary status or reputation in the gold mining industry or the requisite financial resources, nor did it have anything new to offer Russia's gold mining industry. Russian gold mining industry circles have accused the Australian corporation of bribing certain members of the local administration in Irkutsk Oblast. The press has latched onto the scandal. All these factors have delayed development of gold ore deposits at Sukhoy Log by more than a year. Foreign investors interested in mining gold in Russia should draw the following conclusion from the failure of Australia's Star corporation: matters involving access to the development of new gold fields cannot be resolved solely with the aid of regional governmental bodies. One must comply with all the formalities established by federal law in order to obtain a mining license. This "cavalry charge" by an Australian corporation expecting to gain mining rights solely through the support of certain local governmental bodies ended in failure. Russian gold mining industry circles regard that approach as ill-advised adventurism. In conclusion it should be noted that gold mining in Russia is at present a low-profit industry. Largely responsible for this is "barbaric" (the term used by gold industry representatives) taxation, which takes 80 or even 90 percent (in Yakutia) of profits. Yegor Gaydar said at a recent meeting with the heads of Almazzoloto and the Russian Prospecting Cooperatives Union that he deems it inappropriate to mine "gold that costs more than gold." In such cases, Gaydar stressed, it would be more advantageous for Russia to buy gold on the world market than to mine it at home. However, an infusion of Western capital combined with terms favorable to both sides could significantly improve the profitability of the Russian gold mining industry.
