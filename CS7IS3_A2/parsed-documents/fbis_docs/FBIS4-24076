Speaking in Durban he said that at present South Africa had no special advantage over Asian countries and that it would have to adopt a clearer strategy to attract foreign investors. Referring to trade, Mr. Sezaki said a likely upturn in the Japanese economy by the end of the year will result in increased imports from South Africa. He also disclosed that Japan was examining ways of increasing aid to South Africa and said an economic cooperation mission would visit the country next week for talks with the government on the Reconstruction and Development Program.
