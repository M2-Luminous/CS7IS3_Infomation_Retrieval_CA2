FBIS3-56286 "drsov010_a_94032" FBIS-SOV-94-010 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Jan 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Joint Statements Issued, Declaration Signed `Text' of Moscow Declaration LD1401121694 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1146 GMT 14 Jan 94 LD1401121694 Moscow ITAR-TASS Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Text of the Russian-U.S. Moscow Declaration"] [Text] [no dateline as received] The President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and the President of the United States, William J. Clinton, having met together in Moscow from January 12- 15, 1994, reaffirmed the fundamental importance of Russian-U.S. cooperation based upon the Charter of Russian-American Partnership and Friendship, the Vancouver Declaration, and existing treaties and agreements. They noted with satisfaction that the relationship between Russia and the United States has entered a new stage of mature strategic partnership based on equality, mutual advantage, and recognition of each other's national interests. From this perspective, they reviewed the full range of bilateral and international issues. The two presidents had an extensive discussion of security issues, including arms reduction and non-proliferation regimes. They agreed upon the need to strengthen those regimes and to create, together with other interested states, a new mechanism to enhance transparency and responsibility in the transfer of conventional arms and sensitive dual use technologies. They also strongly supported completion of negotiations on a comprehensive test ban at the earliest possible time. The two presidents reiterated their support for a cutoff of production of fissile materials for weapons and considered new measures to strengthen strategic stability. Based on ongoing discussions of strategic disengagement measures between the Ministries of Defense of the two countries, the presidents announced that they would direct the detargeting of strategic nuclear missiles under their respective commands so that by not later than May 30, 1994 those missiles will not be targeted. Thus, for the first time in nearly half a century -- virtually since the dawn of the nuclear age -- Russia and United States will not operate nuclear forces, day-to-day, in a manner that presumes they are adversaries. Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton expressed satisfaction with the accelerating development of a wide range of economic, scientific and technological relationships between Russia and the United States. They also reaffirmed their strong support for the rapid growth of bilateral trade and investment as a special priority. In their view, the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission has become a dynamic and effective mechanism for coordination and expansion of Russian-U.S. cooperation. A key expression of this relationship is the Russian-U.S. joint cooperation in space, especially their partnership, with other interested parties, in the construction of a space station. The two presidents reaffirmed their readiness to move forward on the path of openness and mutual trust in Russian-U.S. relations and to create favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of political, commercial, humanitarian and people-to-people contacts between the two countries. In this connection, a mutual interest in enlarging consular presence on each other's territory was expressed. In particular, the American side intends to open a consulate general in Yekaterinburg in February 1994. With the approval by the U.S. Congress of NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] and the successful completion of the Uruguay round of global trade negotiations, President Yeltsin and President Clinton welcomed the accelerating progress toward creation of an open and prosperous world economy and trading system. President Yeltsin informed President Clinton of recent steps among the member-states of the Commonwealth of Independent States towards increased economic coordination and cooperation. The two presidents agreed that such initiatives, pursued in an open and voluntary manner consistent with GATT rules and procedures, should be conducive to the rapid inclusion of all the participating states into the global economy. In this context, President Yeltsin and President Clinton exchanged views on the economic strategies of their respective governments. President Yeltsin described the economic situation in Russia. He affirmed the irreversibility of Russia's transition to a market economy and his intention to further promote reforms and to address social needs associated with this transition. President Clinton stressed his strong support for Russian reform and suggested that social issues could be a new and promising area for cooperation. President Yeltsin and President Clinton noted with satisfaction that the end of the Cold War has brought continuous progress toward overcoming the division of the European continent and opened the way for broad cooperation among European states on a new agenda of urgent tasks, with priority being given to preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and protection of human rights and the rights of national and other minorities. In this connection, the two presidents welcomed the decisions of the CSCE foreign ministers' meeting in Rome, which they consider to be an important step in making the CSCE a key mechanism of international cooperation in Europe. Proceeding from the conviction that new divisions of Europe must be avoided, President Yeltsin and President Clinton agreed upon the need to create a new European security order that is inclusive, non-discriminatory and focused on practical political and security cooperation. The two presidents agreed that the concept of the Partnership for Peace adopted at the Brussels meeting of the NATO member states is an important element of an emerging new European security architecture. President Yeltsin informed President Clinton of Russia's intention to participate actively in the partnership for peace and to conclude substantive agreements opening the way for broad and intensive cooperation between Russia and NATO as a partner. Taking into account Russia's international role, President Clinton welcomed the prospect of Russia's active participation in the Partnership for Peace. The two presidents condemned aggressive nationalism, violations of human rights, and religious intolerance of any kind, including anti-Semitism. They expressed serious concern about the existence and potential for intensification of conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in a number of the new independent states of the former Soviet Union. President Yeltsin apprised President Clinton of the peacekeeping efforts undertaken by Russia on the territory of the former USSR. The two presidents are determined to intensify the coordination of their efforts, within the framework of the United Nations and the CSCE, to promote rapid and peaceful resolution of conflicts on conditions that correspond to generally accepted standards of international law, including respect for the independence, sovereignty, and existing borders of the new independent states of the former Soviet Union. The two presidents reaffirmed the support of Russia and the United States for the United Nations. They will act with other countries to strengthen the potential of the UN to support and establish peace and to prevent conflicts. The two sides will work out practical activities among themselves and other countries to improve preparation for participation in UN peacekeeping operations. In connection with the upcoming 50th anniversary of the UN, Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin consider it important to convene at the appropriate time a meeting of the heads of state and government of the members of the UN Security Council for a review of the work established for the UN at the January 1992 Security Council summit and an examination of tasks for the future. President Yeltsin and President Clinton are convinced that the United States and Russia will continue to consolidate their partnership and together promote global stability, peace, and prosperity.
