At the culmination of this six-year period is a country overrun by uncertainty, in an infrastructure of customs corruption, interwoven in a vicious circle that includes merchants, businessmen, and authorities who protect it -- a system that has remained untouched, surviving the ups and downs of international trade as confirmed by the fact that in only one of the sections of corruption rampant in Ciudad Juarez, approximately $800 million a year in illegal goods are imported from duty-free stores in EL Paso. Customs corruption is so extensive that it is possible to illegally import whole containers loaded with beans, poultry, lard, lubricating oil, new or old tires, potatoes, used clothes, furniture, used vehicles, tools, toys, textiles, household appliances, computer equipment, spare parts, or any other item that can result in profits, which in turn extends from the lowest to the highest officials within the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat. It has been pointed out that the uncontrolled import of illegal goods originating from the United States is a blatant example of covert impunity. It is also been said that this impunity is being encouraged by Finance Secretariat officials despite numerous complaints to this effect filed by private sources. However, this is only a sample of the lucrative business that extends from Reynosa all the way up to Tijuana and includes the 18 Mexican border customs posts which, far from defending the extensive border, merely proceed to get rich during the "year of Hidalgo." According to a study entitled "Mexico-USA, the Border of Poverty," this activity paves the way for scandalous tax evasion involving millions, thus blocking the country's development. The study reveals that during 1993, according to preliminary estimates, the illegal importation of U.S., European, and Asian-made goods originating from the United States, all on the fringe of legal import activities between both countries, could have totaled nearly $20 billion. This amount fosters the large market dominated by an underground economy controlled by a contraband mafia headed by well-known businessmen and corrupt politicians who have leased the border to the detriment of the country's tax revenues and even its development. It has been possible to establish that outside the El Paso duty-free stores, near Ciudad Juarez's international Reforma Bridge, vans bearing Chihuahua, Texas, and New Mexico license plates transport an alarming quantity of goods to Mexico on a daily basis. These vehicles are loaded to capacity, and the Ciudad Juarez customs authorities normally accept bribes ranging between $3,000 and $5,000 per vehicle. Approximately 50 vans pass through this international bridge daily. It is a well-known fact that Mexican citizens returning from the United States through this point are allowed by the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat to import $50 per person duty-free. Nonetheless, vehicles transporting contraband tend to smuggle amounts sometimes totaling up to $100,000 per vehicle. Considering the cost of some goods imported legally such as Rolex watches, costing somewhere between $2,000 and $10,000, or other expensive products independent of the large volume of jewelry, perfumes, wines, and liquors, this adds up to enormous sums of money." [quotation mark as published] This does not even take into account that the Reforma Bridge lacks import facilities, and therefore, they have no reason to cross this bridge. The analysis by the Mexican-U.S. Center for Border Studies reveals that several mafias control contraband of various types with profit margins of up to 70 percent as is the case with liquor, expensive watches like Rolexes, and other products purchased at duty-free shops brought from the United States under preferential tariffs. The former is the case of the English whiskey Johnny Walker, Spanish brandies, and sophisticated French liquors. It adds that border transactions of this type make their profits mainly from catering to a select Mexican clientele that buys the goods wholesale to resell them to a special group. The study emphasizes that luxury watches from England, Switzerland, and other European countries, like the famous Rolex, are purchased according to the taste of select Mexican buyers, who obtain the merchandise through the contraband kings with the respective profits. The same process applies to expensive French perfumes, which can only be found in Mexican shops at exorbitant prices, and to a huge amount of jewels. However, the study reveals that computers and electric appliances represent a larger volume compared to the over $42 million a year earned from the consumption of cigarettes from the United States and other European countries. Regarding the expensive liquors that yield profit margins of over 70 percent, it is estimated that some $150 million worth of wines and liquors of the most prestigious worldwide brands -- bought at the so-called duty free shops in El Paso, Texas -- cross this border. This is a common occurrence, to a smaller or a greater extent, at other points along the U.S.-Mexican border that also cater to the finest demands of Mexican consumers in a specialized manner. Some 200 or 300 vans known as "venaditas" pay customs officials some $60,000 daily, and each vehicle pays between $200 and $300 to introduce merchandise illegally into Mexico. Sources for this information are public complaints, in addition to thorough journalistic investigation that graphically shows vans filled with food products, motor oil, and other products that are being taken to a warehouse in Ciudad Juarez. These products are mainly picked up by the Economy Cash and Carry company, which belongs to Mike Dipp, a wealthy businessman, and his associates. Current investigations reveal that the customs office in Ciudad Juarez is one of the leading ones nationwide in allowing the entry of condoned contraband, and that customs official Carlos Aguilar is certainly aware that the goods ["pollas"] are picked up daily from the three international bridges on the border between Ciudad Juarez and Texas. Of the three bridges, the San Geronimo Bridge -- which borders New Mexico -- is the most widely used because it has little surveillance and customs officials are not at risk of being seen by occasional local tourists. Finally, the study points to customs administrators in Ciudad Juarez, Carlos Aguilar and Luis Manuel Terrazas -- who is currently the customs administrator in Nuevo Laredo -- as officials who have established a chain from Ciudad Juarez to the border to ensure their absolute control of the contraband stemming from Texas, the leading exporting state in the United States. Texas exported $23 million in 1993. This situation has created a network of nepotism within customs personnel on both sides of the border and resulted in the blatant enrichment of their families since they assumed their posts since Carlos Aguilar and Luis Manuel Terrazas have formed a monopoly [un enroque de puestos].
