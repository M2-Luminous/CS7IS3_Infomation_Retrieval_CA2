This follows reports that the election candidate list of General Constand Viljoen's newly-founded Freedom Front would be submitted on Wednesday. Several CP MP's names are expected to be on the list, widely seen as precipitating a split in CP ranks. Dr Hartzenberg said in terms of the party's constitution, any CP member who became a member of another political party and making himself available as candidate in the elections automatically excluded himself from CP membership. This conduct would be in conflict with a unanimous decision by the CP executive that the polls would be boycotted, he said. Termination of membership would automatically result in these members losing access to CP facilities and assets, he added.
