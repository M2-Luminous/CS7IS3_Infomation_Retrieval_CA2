During the session, the Council of Ministers was briefed by Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' on current developments in both the Arab and international arenas. The foreign minister clarified the nature and aims of the pressures being put on Syria in order to harm its pan-Arab and national decision, stressing that Syria firmly adheres to its positions and trends to achieve a just and comprehensive peace and that it will not relinquish any national or pan-Arab rights. In this context, the foreign minister also explained that the aim of the Israelis is to force the peace process from its course and its true goals and to push it onto a thorny and deadlocked road. He also asserted that the continued Israeli intransigence is aimed at weakening current international efforts to push the peace process forward, ignoring the resolutions of international legitimacy, and blocking the peace process. The foreign minister then reviewed the results of the meetings that were held in Damascus to promote Syria's cooperation with the Russian Federation, the PRC, and India. He also touched on the positive results of the meeting of the nonaligned foreign ministers in Cairo, stressing the importance of the movement's role in protecting the interests of the nonaligned countries in the absence of democratic relations in the international arena.
