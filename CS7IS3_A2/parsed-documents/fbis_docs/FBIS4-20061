Health care for pay, private schools, and more jobs (but for lower wages): This is the formula that the government will use in an attempt to save Italy, amid a thousand uncertainties. Ladies and gentlemen, here is the first government of the Right, at your service. After 50 years of a centrism that oscillated from slightly on the right to way over on the left, the 27 March elections signaled the triumph of laissez-faire capitalism, postfascism, Berlusconiism (as a life style), and Legaism. Moreover, it is this mixture--which the Knight of Arcore [Berlusconi] is attempting (with no little difficulty) to compound--that will govern the fifth greatest industrial power in the world during the coming years and profoundly alter even the nation's constitutional principles. It is impossible to know where all this will lead. L'EUROPEO has attempted to ascertain the specific sectors in which the new Italian Right will take its initial steps in the process of governing. Ten Questions 1. The Right, which openly advocates free-market capitalism, must necessarily make an in-depth investigation of the welfare state. What measures might the government take initially with respect to health care and pensions, for example? Following an election campaign during which the victorious coalition warned voters of the dangers of "Occhetto-style statism," Silvio Berlusconi and his partners (friends? comrades?) will be expected to provide immediate proof of their allegiance to the free-market system. According to the official programs, health care and pensions are already targets of the government of the Right. In the health care sector, the famous government-provided health care "bonus" [preceding word in English]--which each citizen could spend as he or she saw fit, either in hospitals or for a private insurance policy--has become mere fiction. In terms of pensions, the policy is to favor supplementary annuities and to raise the age of eligibility. "The transition will be difficult, exhausting, and long," says economist Carlo Scognamiglio, who Berlusconi would like to have in his administration. There are other reasons for this absence of haste. The constituency of the Right includes many seniors, pensioners, and low-income public employees (one probable member of the cabinet, National Alliance Deputy Publio Fiori, based his career as an Andreotti partisan of long standing precisely on these categories of the electorate). Moreover, any abrupt cuts in social spending on the eve of the June European elections--which the Right expects will serve to confirm its approval rating--could be counterproductive. "They will do nothing in the short term," predicts Emanuele Macaluso, leader [preceding word in English] of the most moderate wing of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. "The government coalition will now consolidate its power by placing its people in key positions in order to secure control and establish new rules of the game. Then the dance will begin." 2. Could a government of the Right reopen the education controversy by providing de facto support for private schools? The "good education" issue is also on the agenda. Parents will be able to decide whether to send their children to public schools or to private schools (meaning in effect Catholic schools, inasmuch as the overwhelming majority of private schools are staffed by nuns and priests). Moreover, Berlusconi attaches great importance to the support of the bishops and for months conducted an all-out campaign to obtain it. He is now beginning to harvest the fruits of that campaign, which range from the enthusiastic statements of Cardinal Silvio Oddi to the partial placet of CIVILTA CATTOLICA, the Jesuits' magazine. As an item on the agenda, this issue will accordingly soon affect the equilibrium of the coalition and likewise Silvio Berlusconi's good relations with the ecclesiastical hierarchy (the Church has never liked pure laissez-faire capitalism). It is an obstacle that will not be easy to surmount, however. The fact is that the Northern League actually envisions more radical solutions, as for example schools owned by the teachers themselves, who would operate them on a free-market basis ("It's crazy," Labor Minister Gino Giugni, an inflexible supporter of the public schools, exclaims. "How could teachers turn themselves overnight into stockholders and managers?" [preceding word in English]. For its part, the National Alliance remains committed to an educational system operated by the state. "In my opinion, public education is preferable," says Domenico Fisichella, Gianfranco Fini's institutional theorist and candidate for the cabinet post (Public Education) that at one time was held by Benedetto Croce. 3. The Right has promised "lower taxes for everyone," but how can it keep this promise and simultaneously reform public finances? "Simple," explains National Alliance Deputy Maurizio Gasparri. "The Laffer curve--which I could discuss at length--shows that by lowering taxes you increase state revenues. My butcher put it even more simply. In 1992," he said, "the state asked me for 12 million lire, and in 1993 for 19 million. I didn't have it, and I didn't pay a single lira. If they come for me, I'll be the needle in the haystack.'" So this is the theory: Reduce taxes, and you will have fewer tax evaders and a rehabilitated treasury. Here too, however, it appears that no one is in a hurry to keep a promise. Speaking on the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], General Luigi Ramponi of the National Alliance--who formerly headed SISMI [Intelligence and Military Security Service]--and Scognamiglio found themselves in agreement. "Bad news on the fiscal front," the rector of Luiss University said. "The deficit is soaring, and taxes can be reduced only if government spending is reduced and economic recovery takes place." How so? Wasn't tax reduction supposed to be the engine of recovery? "With an average tax burden of 41 percent," Ramponi said, "we are within the European parameters, together with France and Great Britain. Less than that...." What is he saying? Isn't this the same argument that Luigi Spaventa, the Ciampi administration's budget minister, used to make? "I believe that the government of the Right will sooner or later strike a surprise blow such as, for example, the imposition of a substantial withholding tax on bank deposits, passbook savings accounts, and checking accounts," Giorgio Benvenuto, the former secretary general at the Ministry of Finance, is willing to wager. "It will be a telling blow, one designed to meet the financial requirements of the state." Antonio Martino, the principal economist of Forza Italia, denies the possibility of any such blow, however. He insists that the government will issue its decrees within the first 50 days after taking office, and that the initial objective will be to convert 4 to 5 trillion lire of direct taxes into indirect taxes. 4. Expanded markets, more consumption, and more publicity: these supply the oxygen that Berlusconi's business interests breathe. But how will he be able to keep inflation under control? "Berlusconi will take inflation to 10 percent," Giorgio Benvenuto predicts. Lower taxes mean that families will have more money; more money in circulation means increased demand for consumer goods, which in turn means rising prices and therefore inflation. The plans of the future Berlusconi administration, however, do make allowance for a rise of several percentage points in the rate of inflation. "That would in no way be the end of the world," Maurizio Gasparri continues. "Inflation is low today not because it is controlled but because there is a recession." On the other hand, Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson and Roberto Artoni, professor at Milan's Bocconi University, foresee absolute catastrophe. "There is the danger that Italy's economy will be run in the Peronist manner," Samuelson warns, while Artoni points out that "inflationary policies work to the advantage of all debtors, public and private." Inasmuch as Italy has a national debt of 2 quadrillion lire and will be governed by an entrepreneur (Berlusconi) who is himself up to his ears in debt.... Whether these doubts are valid or not, an inflation that is under control and a public debt that is once again managed rationally are conditions that Italy must fulfill in order to remain within the European sphere following the Maastricht treaty. 5. "One million jobs in two years." Is the Italian business community ready--as Berlusconi maintains--to hire young people, and under what conditions would it be able to do so? "Let them try to fulfill their promise of 1 million jobs in two years," Labor Minister Gino Giugni comments sarcastically. "If they are lucky and the GDP increases to 3 percent, they will barely be able to come up with 400,000 jobs." The confidence manifested by Berlusconi's people is based on the creation of a simplified and flexible labor market involving tax relief for firms that hire young people; the possibility of easier dismissals; term contracts; and lower entry-level wages for entrants to the labor market (whose counterparts in France, incidentally, formed the mobs of young people who in recent weeks took to the streets in that country). In his comment, Communist Renewal Secretary Fausto Bertinotti gives full rein to his skepticism. "Berlusconi and the other groups of the Right are proposing things that already exist," he says. "Apprenticeships have been in existence since 1955, and labor training contracts for the past several years, but there are still 3 million unemployed. Spain has every version of these laws but continues to have an unemployment problem." Moreover, if a businessman--in response to all these incentives--decides to hire additional employees only to dismiss them three months later and then perhaps repeat the three-month hiring and firing cycle at some later date, does this represent a genuine increase in employment or merely marginal adjustments in the unemployment rate? Berlusconi's principal adviser, Giuliani Urbani, was assigned the task of defending the proposal. "Before we set this goal," he said, "we polled thousands of businessmen to determine their availability." 6. Berlusconi's own business interests are one of the obstacles facing his administration. For example, what credibility will he have when--as a government official--he appoints the heads of the big banks to which he himself is in debt? On this point--which is one of the most important of all--Silvio Berlusconi has offered no convincing arguments other than his personal assurances that he will conduct himself honorably. The Italian people do not actually appear to be very concerned about this matter before the vote [for prime minister] is taken; but it is clear that as prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi will frequently find himself in an embarrassing position whenever his government has to sponsor legislation in many specific fields--such as telecommunications, antitrust [preceding word in English], and construction--or obtain greater financial disclosure by the companies that own soccer teams. Here are two examples. The government appoints the heads of the big national banks, and Berlusconi is in debt to half of the Italian banking system. How dispassionately will he be able to make decisions? And the fact that he is part owner of a TV station in Germany (Telefuenf) and one in Spain (Telecinco) creates an embarrassing situation whereby the Italian prime minister will be in a position to influence the communications media of foreign countries. This is not viewed with favor in international circles. "Only a mediocre person would allow himself to be influenced by his personal interests," says Giuseppe Tatarella, leader of the National Alliance deputies, "and you can say anything about Berlusconi except that he is a mediocrity." "Under this electoral system," National Alliance Deputy Gasparri adds, "if you misbehave, the voters will send you packing at the next election. That is your insurance policy." 7. In the euphoria of victory, tensions among allies are attenuated. But when controversial matters are at issue--such as reductions in force in the public sector and federalism--what will happen within the ranks of the majority? On the day following the elections, all observers doubted that the Right would be able to form a coalition government, and yet Berlusconi appeared certain to get Gianfranco Fini and Umberto Bossi to reach an accord immediately. Not for nothing is he a supersalesman of special deals ("three for the price of two"), inasmuch as he even succeeded in palming off the National Alliance on the voters of the north who had chosen Forza Italia and the League, and in selling Bossi to the voters of the south who were planning to vote for Berlusconi and Fini. Although the euphoria surrounding the sensational electoral victory made it possible to overcome many obstacles, it did not dispel the tensions within the coalition. Despite everything, Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Fini continue tirelessly to snipe at each other. "The coalition government will be formed, and it will be accompanied by an accord with respect to programs," Tatarella says. It can be assumed that an accord will be reached. None of the partners [preceding word in English] can afford to cause the operation to fail: not Berlusconi, after spending many billions of lire to form a new party and become prime minister and after committing himself totally to this endeavor; not Fini, who is seeing his comrades return to the government after 50 years (someone pointed out sadly that the most recent fascist to have passed through Chigi Palace [office of the prime minister]--the former foreign minister of the Mussolini regime, Galeazzo Ciano--ended up being shot, exactly 50 years ago, by his father-in-law in Verona); and not Bossi either, who--if he gets out of line--will be judged responsible (in the eyes of his colleagues and his constituents) for wasting the opportunity to govern. All three have the need to govern. 8. What will become of the kickback scandal and the independence of the judiciary? Is a whitewash--disguised as a "political solution"--really in the offing? These are hard times for the judges. One cannot forget that only a few weeks ago the probable new prime minister vehemently denounced Gherardo Colombo--one of the leading jurists in the Clean Hands pool [preceding word in English] in Milan--and that Tiziana Parenti (Berlusconi's choice for the post of justice minister) has attacked her colleagues with rancor and venom. So far there has been no talk of a whitewash for the bribetakers. "I do not believe they [the coalition government] will do anything that would be so unpopular," says PDS Senator Massimo Brutti. "We must wait and see, however, whether they will really help the magistrates conduct all the trials with dispatch, for that means money, personnel, funds, and courtrooms--and the will to do what is necessary." The other burning question relates to the independence of the judiciary. For example, the Right wants to "separate" the prosecutors from the judges who have the task of rendering verdicts. "This is one step away from subordination to the government's office of public prosecutor," says the former secretary of the National Association of Magistrates, Senator Raffaele Bertoni, a progressive. "Even fascism regarded this option as too risky," he adds. But the new majority is determined to press forward on its chosen course. "The two professions must be separated," is the battle cry of Tiziana Parenti, who takes aim at a loftier target, the Higher Council of the Magistracy. "Let's reorganize the Council," Parenti says. "We've had our fill of politicized judiciaries." This brings us, in fact, to the second point that disturbs the Left, namely the system for electing the Higher Council of the Magistracy. If the government majority is as strong and compact as predicted, it is already able--even without reorganization--to select all of the 10 "secular" members of the Council. In particular, this means that the government is indirectly in a position to exert a decisive influence on the selection of the heads of the most important judicial offices. "The biggest unknown quantity is Berlusconi. The MSI [Italian Social Movement]-National Alliance and the Northern League have consistently endorsed the work of the judges, but Berlusconi has in fact never done so." [quotation marks as published] 9. For the first time in decades, the Interior Ministry--the heart of the state--will be in the hands of the Right. Should we fear that the police, the intelligence services, and the prefects will be used against the opposition? "This is a hypothesis that I do not even want to take into consideration," PDS Senator Brutti says, "because we do not put intentions on trial. We shall find out along the way." "Nothing that is part of the state--including secret services and security forces--may be placed at the service of anyone in particular," Deputy Massimo D'Alema, leader of the PDS deputies, notes. "Governments come and go, but the guarantees remain." The Rifondazione Comunista people disagree. "The Christian Democrats in the Palazzo Viminale [Interior Ministry] have worked against opposition groups in the past, and such an eventuality would therefore be nothing new," they say. "We do in fact anticipate a climate of greater repression of the most elementary rights." The PDS people are cautious and the neocommunists of Rifondazione are prepared for the worst, but the words of the leading candidate for interior minister--the League's Roberto Maroni--are reassuring. "The people who do have something to fear," he says, "are those who during these past years have been involved in cover-ups. If I go to the Viminale, I will open all the closet doors and drag out all the skeletons: Piazza Fontana, the Italicus massacre, the Bologna railway station, and Ustica. We shall have the last laugh." We shall see. Naturally, the closets that Maroni would like to open also contain the skeletons of the intelligence services. Umberto Bossi has never concealed his conviction that the intelligence services have conducted operations against the League that involved the use of unscrupulous tactics. No matter who from the League becomes interior minister, however, overall control of the intelligence services will always be vested in the prime minister: that is to say, in Silvio Berlusconi. 10. In the past, the opposition has even been able to negotiate the choices of the majority. Now that there is genuine bipolarity, how will the government deal with an intransigent opposition? "We need a genuine opposition," National Alliance Deputy Giuseppe Tatarella says, "but I hope it will not be hard-line and intransigent. The opposition should monitor the work of the majority and contest it, but without any prejudices." In Great Britain, for example, the Labor Party never conceded anything to the Conservatives, but during the Falklands War it definitely did not resort to any obstructionism. The 27 March elections produced a phenomenon that was remarkably in the Anglo-Saxon style. Deputies of the majority glorified the role of the opposition, and members of the opposition said: "We do not want so much as one committee chairmanship in Parliament. They won; let them have all the chairmanships." In all of this fair play [preceding two words in English], however, the guiding principle is that oversight should be the province of the opposition. "We want the chairmanships of the investigating committees and of the RAI oversight committee, the intelligence overrsight committee, and all organs that enable the minority to perform its functions," PDS Senator Massimo Brutti says. "I agree," the MSI's Tatarella replies. Although it has an ample majority in the Chamber of Deputies (but a tenuous one in the Senate), the nascent government will probably not renounce the ritual acts of seduction of the vanquished. In particular, the victorious coalition will assuredly try to win over the segment of the Popular Party (Rocco Buttiglione, Roberto Formigoni) that leans toward the right. And as we have already seen, the campaign of acquisition is also targeting Mario Segni's Pact organization. For example, the tax consultant Giulio Tremonti--a follower of the defeated leader [Segni] of the referendum--might also be coopted into the Berlusconi administration.
