As to the Thief, Male or Female, Cut Off His or Her Hands, a Punishment by Way of Example, From God, for Their Crime." (part of a Koranic verse)] [Text] Revolution Command Council Decree No. 59 of 4 June 1994 is a sound one. Theft cannot be deemed an ordinary crime when people are suffering under the circumstances of the embargo, where people labor endlessly to make ends meet and ensure themselves a decent livelihood. Under such circumstances, when one loses some of his material possessions, his budget is monstrously undermined. This decree is directly connected with the principle of imposing the rule of law. I previously wrote an article, hoping that the decree we had to revoke prior to the onset of the 30-state aggression due to Western pressure over the issue of human rights would be rehabilitated. This decree gave men the right to kill their sisters, wives, etc., if they commit adultery, or any other crimes of passion. The basic reasons for cutting off thieves' hands are also found in the injunction that calls for killing adulteresses. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. "The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication, flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by God, if ye believe in God and the Last Day." [Part of a Koranic verse] This decree concerning adultery reflected our age-old Iraqi family traditions, which make us as Iraqis stand out among our brethren in the remaining Arab states. In my opinion, the important thing is to see the competent agencies stringently implement the decree pertaining to thieves. This is necessary if that decree is to achieve its purposes and sublime objectives. This is because the failure to do so will cause immense damage and harm. In the past, a decree providing for the execution of brothel madams was issued. This decree was one of the greatest and most profound ones, although it is hard to use the superlative case in such situations. Nonetheless, I would like to address the following question to the competent agencies: How many brothel madams have been executed so far? We, as journalists and informed people, have not heard that any single brothel madam has been executed, although there are many of them around.
