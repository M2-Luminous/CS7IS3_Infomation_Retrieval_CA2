The CFA franc was devalued by 50 percent after a summit meeting in Dakar on January 11 following pressure from the International Monetary Fund. The move led to wide-spread panic immediately after it came into effect in several of the 14 member states of the Franc Zone. But Ivory Coast Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan said Monday that the 13 heads of state present for the meeting "trusted in the operation." "They believe it is an opportunity to emerge from crisis and to reach a level of economic growth." The meeting also addressed the consequences of the devaluation, especially rising prices and the problem of debt, calling for France to provide more aid. French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in a brief statement at the airport here said the meeting had ended on a "note of realism and optimism." He added the devaluation was not the end but a beginning. After the January summit, France promised to put forward proposals to alleviate the debts still owed by the member countries. The mini-summit was held following the funeral of the Ivorian president Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who was given a sumptuous send-off Monday.
