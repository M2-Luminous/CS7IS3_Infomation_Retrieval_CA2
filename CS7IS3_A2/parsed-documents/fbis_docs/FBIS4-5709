Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong is to lead the meeting that will most likely confirm the general principle of helping escaped loggers settle either in Russia or in South Korea. Over 100 North Koreans at the logging camps want to come to South Korea but the Seoul government has been extremely careful not to agitate Pyongyang. Officials said the initial goal will be to safely settle them in Russia by having them recognized as refugees by the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR). Friday's meeting will discuss these measures along with action necessary in settling some of the North Korean loggers in South Korea, such as job training, the officials said.
