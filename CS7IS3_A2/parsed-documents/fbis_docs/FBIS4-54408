Presidents of seven central European countries -- Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia -- met in Litomysl on April 15-16. Havel describes the phenomenon of Central Europe as the first of the political signs given by the meeting. "The fact of the summit itself, as well as the opinions expressed by the attending presidents made it clear that the phenomenon of Central Europe was still living and the participants in the summit claimed to belong to Central Europe," Havel writes. "The Central European phenomenon is far from being a subject of cultural historians' studies, since it is a phenomenon of our life experience...," he states. Central Europe evidently exists as a region with its own identity, interlinked through similar historical, cultural and social traditions, and it again plays a considerable role from the geopolitical point of view, as it did many times in history. It seems like it is again being decided on where it (Central Europe) will belong and what role it will play," Havel writes. The summit also indicated what the views of the countries involved concerning Central Europe's position in a broader context were: "None of them wishes the emergence of a new buffer zone, an apparently neutral area between the West and the East (such zones usually become the first battle-fields in case of a confrontation), or a bridge linking somebody to somebody else (bridges are often places of battle and subjects of fighting as well)," Havel writes. He also stresses that no Central European country wants to find itself in "Russia's sphere of influence", and have any "specific relations" towards Russia, mainly in the defence sphere. "Nobody, of course, defines themselves in contrast to Russia or wants to isolate Russia; on the contrary, everybody wants relations with this country to be the best imaginable -- relations based on equality, on Russia's respecting its partners' belonging where they want to belong," Havel states. "We view Central Europe as the integral part of Europe which is rather inexactly called Western Europe or the West," he continues. "It is extremely important that Litomysl has sent out this joint Central European 'signal' now, when tones indicating -- though in a very diplomatic, veiled manner -- Russia's certain specific claim and interest concerning the area of its former satellites, are emerging in Russian foreign policy," Havel stresses. Another signal "sent out" by the Litomysl meeting: All countries involved respect each other and are able to communicate not only at bilateral level but also jointly. "Even various specific neighbour controversies cannot prevent them from reflecting their essential interest both in good mutual neighbour relations and the existence of joint interests," Havel writes, adding that this is "considerable" with the Central European region whose ethnic structure is so complicated and which was so many times in the past politically divided and internally antagonised. Moreover, discussion based on equality between representatives of five postcommunist countries, one influential member of the European Union (EU) and NATO, and one EU potential member indicates a certain historical shift: It is no longer a meeting of only postcommunist countries aimed to discuss tactics against the West, ...but a meeting which does not accent the communist past of some participants and the democratic past of the others, "a meeting of countries claiming to adhere to a specific historical and cultural region and to the same basic political values," Havel states. The summit also made it clear that neither our "application to Western Europe meant our application to a sort of German sphere of influence, nor Germany's interest in stability, security and the development of its Eastern neighbours meant a latent building of a sphere of the German interest in power," Havel emphasises. At the meeting, German President Richard von Weizsacker "strived almost anxiously" to make it clear that in intensively supporting the integration of its eastern neighbours into European structures, Germany wanted to contribute to the common interest, to support the interest of its eastern neighbours, the EU and NATO -- simply the interests of the whole of Europe, not to pursue power interests of its own, Havel writes. "Briefly: Germany neither is nor wants to be a patron of Central Europe, nor somebody separating us from the liberal West, but on the contrary, the one to link us with the West most markedly of all," Havel stresses. The summit has also indicated which values ranked among those linking us to the West, such as democracy, market economy, law- abiding state, and mainly the civic principle in the building of the state, the civic society. The civic orientation is the only one to "lead us forever out of the darkness of nationalist thick- headedness, which is the source of endless human suffering. Our application to Europe is therefore an application to the coexistence of nations, nationalities and ethnic groups on the principle of equality. "Maybe it could be said that the quicker the pace of Central Europeans on this path would be, the quicker the idea of tolerance and solidarity would spread further to the south and east of Europe," Havel writes. Good personal relations and real friendship between politicians are more important in politics than they seem to be when observed from outside, he writes, adding that the "human dimension of politics" characteristic of the Litomysl talks, was of priceless benefit to all the attending countries. It seems the Litomysl summit will not be the last meeting of this sort, as presidents of the seven involved countries would meet regularly. No emergence of a new international pact can be expected. "But if this becomes a certain tradition, it will undoubtedly be another instrument for the creation of a good atmosphere in Europe," Havel concludes.
