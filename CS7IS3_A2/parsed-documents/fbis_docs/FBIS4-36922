Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati in his meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn informed him of the pardon. Szimkus had been condemned to death by a court after his trial. German Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had previously appealed for the Szimkus' release. A diplomatic source said after the appeal, related authorities reviewed the case in light of the principled and realistic stances of the Bonn government vis-a-vis Iran, and Szimkus was eventually pardoned. His pardon is expected to open a new chapter in Tehran-Bonn relations despite the impediments made by the U.S. and Britain.
