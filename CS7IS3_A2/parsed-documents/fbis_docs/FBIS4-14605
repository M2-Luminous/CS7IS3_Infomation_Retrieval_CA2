It should also vigorously develop ties with countries of the Asia-Pacific region, specificaly with Japan, Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Committee on Information Policy and Communications in the State Duma of the Federal Assembly, said in an exclusive interview to ITAR-TASS on Thursday [31 March]. He arrived in Tokyo at the invitation of the Japanese Parliament. Poltoranin said priority in this area should be given to contacts at regional level rather than to the development of interstate ties where there is more bureaucratism and inertia. The initiative of local government bodies should be encouraged for which they should be given more rights and greater freedom, Poltoranin said. He said there is a need for caution in the approach to this process so as not to upset the balance between federal structures and local authorities and not to set in motion centrifugal forces. Poltoranin told ITAR-TASS that he is to meet Japanese Premier Morihiro Hosokawa and other Japanese leaders during his visit. "I am going to tell the head of the cabinet that it is time for Japan to recover form slumber so as not to lag behind other states, competitors, that now begin to do business with Russia," Poltoranin said. To attract foreign partners, the Russian Parliament embarked on drafting a solid legal basis guaraneeing protection for foreign investment. A number of draft laws will be completed in April or May.
