The approximately 60-year-old host gingerly picked up a plastic covered sheet of paper that has made the owner very happy in the past week. The document carries the headline "Authorization." The authorized German translation beneath reads: "I herewith confirm that Mr. Svetoslav Stoilov is my first adviser on economic and entrepreneurial issues." The document, dated 28 December 1993, carries the scrawly signature "Vladimir Zhirinovskiy." If one of the two gentlemen had not caused considerable stir throughout Europe in the past two weeks with his strange ideas, one might simply dismiss the verbal outcome of this friendship between Stoilov and Zhirinovskiy as the mere twaddle of two odd birds. Yet the Bulgarian-born Svetoslav Stoilov, who has been living in Vienna with an Austrian passport for 30 years and whose gold-colored calling card identifies him as a "consultant," has unconditionally offered his services to a man who is probably the most dangerous politician on the continent -- Vladimir "Adolfovich" Zhirinovskiy, who as head of the right-wing extremist "Liberal Democratic Party of Russia" (LDP), was the surprise winner of the Russian parliamentary elections and who will in the future lead the second strongest group of 70 parliamentarians after Yeltsin's reformers. He arrived on a spectacular "private visit" to Austria on 22 December. The Program During his four-day visit, Zhirinovskiy skillfully dealt all sides radical nationalist verbal blows. The program of his visit and the real purpose was determined exactly before he arrived. His trip was based on solid entrepreneurial motives. When the trained lawyer arrived on the evening of 22 December in a Lauda Air plane from Munich (where he met with head of the right-wing extremist "German People's Union," Gerhard Frey) at Vienna's Schwechat Airport, the "Antiterrorism Task Force," the elite Interior Ministry troop, was alerted. Half a dozen officials did not leave the Russian's side from then on. After landing in Klagenfurt, the police officers saw a bizarre succession of events in the days that followed. While the journalists, who had arrived from all over Europe, concentrated on Zhirinovskiy and his Carinthian host, timber merchant Edwin Neuwirth from Reichenfels, the advisers of the Russian politician arranged numerous business meetings. Large limousines with all kinds of license plates arrived at the "Rainsberg" hotel. "We received businessmen from Austria, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia here," the 67-year-old Edwin Neuwirth boasted. Neuwirth, an ethnic German from Transylvania, who volunteered for the Waffen-SS when he was 16 and who has been living in the Lavanttal Valley since 1953, attracted the reporters' attention with solid Nazi slogans. "I do not know of any gas chambers in Germany," he stated in an interview with Austrian radio. As a result, the public prosecutor in Klagenfurt initiated investigations because of the suspicion of the violation of the law banning Nazi activities. "I just think in national terms. Zhirinovskiy is as national and liberal as Joerg Haider," Neuwirth complained. In the meantime, the "advisers" of Neuwirth's visitor Zhirinovskiy devoted themselves intensively to the businessmen who had arrived. A police official, who was disguised as a skier wearing a black bobble hat, took numerous pictures. The state police and officials from the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), who arrived especially because of the Zhirinovskiy visit, are now hectically evaluating these pictures. Ivanovic's Oweka One of the entrepreneurs was Petar Ivanovic. The 57-year-old businessman from Serbia has been living in Austria since 1968 and is carrying on trade with the East as the manager of the Oweka trading company, located at 31 Praterstrasse in Vienna. He primarily sells petrochemical products. In his best year -- in 1990 -- the turnover of the company involved 700 million schillings. An "Oweca Petrol AG" in the small town of Glarus in the Swiss canton of the same name is registered as the parent company of the Vienna Oweka firm in the trade register. Strangely enough, there is neither a postal address nor a telephone number for this company in Glarus. It is still unknown what Ivanovic and his aides Mirko Milic and Goran Miletic discussed specifically with Zhirinovskiy's clan in Carinthia. Nobody in Ivanovic's office answered the phone up to the editorial deadline. However, there are signs suggesting that Ivanovic has financial problems, and that he is urgently looking for new business partners. In reply to a credit inquiry, the "Credit Protection Association of 1870" wrote: "The enterprise has a poor credit standing." The forwarding agency Technokontrol, another of Ivanovic's enterprises, filed a petition for bankruptcy as recently as in December. A third company is not exactly thriving, either: The Indiptrading Handels GmbB company, which Ivanovic operates in Montenegro with partners from Titograd and whose deals are violating the UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. An investigator believes Ivanovic came to Carinthia for the following reasons: "There are hints that one of Zhirinovskiy's financial advisers is establishing cover companies in Western Europe and is looking for partners so he can fully participate in oil trade." The name of this man is Alexej Wedenkin, and he procures cash for the extremist from Moscow. "Mr. Wedenkin has established 10 enterprises in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland," Zhirinovskiy's host Neuwirth pointed out. Wedenkin boasted: "We have millions of dollars." A certain Dimitriy Klinkov is also commuting between Klagenfurt and Moscow. Klinkov, 23, uses the title of "trade director" of the IBC GmbH company. The IBC registered in Klagenfurt belongs to Josef Hambrusch and is carrying out trade with the East. Asked about his links with Zhirinovskiy, Hambrusch replied: "No comment. We do not want to see our names in the newspapers." The Klagenfurt businessman confirmed, however, that he knew two other visitors who had come to Carinthia: Werner Girke and Werner Neumann from Berlin. The two men are responsible for discreet trust transactions about which they did not want to talk. Their Berlin Fiduciary Management and Organization GmbH company (TVO) is considered a center of Zhirinovskiy's West German investments. "Chief Executive" Girke only stated: "We deal with property management. But we do not grant any interviews." Zhirinovskiy's most interesting interlocutor had to make the longest journey: The Russian Anton Nenakov, 26, from Amsterdam, where he is the head of the Global Money Management Trust enterprise. At present, he is allegedly trying to obtain a permit to establish an investment bank, and he provided funds for Zhirinovskiy's election campaign in December. From Belgium, a man arrived in Carinthia whose name is, in all likelihood, Luc L. (the full name is known to the editors). He is 65, and has for decades been operating a successful enterprise in Antwerp that sells all kinds of weapons. L's specialty is supplying rebel organizations in Black Africa with military equipment. Zhirinovskiy is pleading for massive investments in the ailing Russian defense industry. After all, envoys of Fikret Abdic, the Muslim feudal entrepreneur and head of the Agrokomerz concern which was involved in a scandal in Bihac in western Bosnia, wanted to persuade Zhirinovskiy to pay a short visit to his country. Zhirinovskiy, however, refused because of the concerns of his security advisers. Stoilov's Show When the Russian and his entourage left Vienna on 25 December aboard a Balkan Air aircraft for Sofia, the show of Zhirinovskiy's Vienna adviser Svetoslav Stoilov began. Zhirinovskiy took up the invitation of the Bulgarian living in Austria who was born in the Bulgarian part of Macedonia. They visited Stoilov's home town of Sandanski. "We went to Thessaloniki in Greece without a visa, and Vladimir swam in the Aegean Sea," Stoilov stated enthusiastically. Bent over the book "Alexander the Great and his Time," the ardent advocate of a Macedonian nation stressed: "Zhirinovskiy said I would be the better Bulgarian president. I told him: `Vladimir, you cannot simply give me all that.'" The eclat was perfect. President Zhelev ordered the expulsion of the Russian because he babbled about "Thrace's reunification." The long-planned visit to Berlin did not come about either. This time, the Berlin enterprise TVO and Messrs. Girke and Neumann were supposed to act as hosts. They had invited Zhirinovskiy. Yet the government in Bonn denied him a visa. As a result, Zhirinovskiy railed against Germany after this return to Moscow and threatened, among other things, to start a "third world war." "I will take care of things in the future," Svetoslav Stoilov stated at his Vienna office, trying to calm things down. "I will write most of his speeches, and I will exert a moderating influence. We are talking on the telephone every day." Consultant Stoilov, who claims to have initiated a number of prestigious projects for renowned Austrian companies trading with the East, referring to the career opportunities of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, "whom I met accidentally at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow five years ago," stated: "In four or five months at the latest, he will have ousted Yeltsin and will be president. And I will advocate an independent state for all Macedonians from Greece, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. A roundtable should decide as soon as possible on the return to Germany of the territories occupied by Poland." Once he had warmed up, the fanatic Stoilov explained with a flaming red face how his adopted country Austria should profit from his activities as an adviser: "South Tirol must be returned to Austria as soon as possible."
