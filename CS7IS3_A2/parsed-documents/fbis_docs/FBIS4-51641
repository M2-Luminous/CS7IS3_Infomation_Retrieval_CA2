FBIS4-51641 "dreas084_a_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 1 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan U.S. Postpones Trade Discrimination Decision U.S. Postpones Trade Discrimination Decision OW0105054594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0432 GMT 1 May 94 OW0105054594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Washington, May 1 KYODO -- The United States has postponed until June 30 its decision on whether Japan is discriminating against U.S. businesses in government procurement of telecommunication and medical equipment, the chief U.S. Trade negotiator said Saturday [30 April]. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's office was to submit by Saturday to Congress its report that would specify the countries it sees as discriminatory against U.S. firms in government procurement. The action is based on Title VII of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. The countries specified in the report could be subject to trade sanctions by the Clinton administration. The Japanese Government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has vowed to put together market-opening measures by the end of June. But, Japan may be included in a list of such countries if Washington remains unconvinced of the Japanese measures which are aimed primarily at rectifying Japan's external trade imbalances by boosting domestic demand. The postponement of a decision apparently stems from the judgment that it is inadvisable to take a get-tough policy toward Tokyo amid the uncertain political outlook in Japan. The new coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Hosokawa's successor, inaugurated last Thursday, is widely viewed as fragile due to the departure of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ]. Kantor said, however, that his office will "review the situation in 60 days on the basis of Japanese actions in the interim." He also noted that "in deciding whether to identify Japan under Title VII in 60 days, we will assess the seriousness of any official Japanese response to the points that were discussed" at his meeting with then Japanese Foreign Minister Hata in Marrakech, Morocco, on April 15. Kantor also announced the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative places Japan and five other trading partners on the "priority watch list" under the trade act's special 301 Provision concerning the protection of intellectual property rights. The listed countries are subject to a statutory review over the next year. Meanwhile, Kantor said his office has put off until June 30 a decision on whether to name China, Argentina and India "priority foreign countries" which deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property. If a solution has not been reached by June 30, these countries will be named priority foreign countries, and investigations of their practices will immediately be initiated under Section 301 of the trade act. U.S. concerns over protection of intellectual property rights in China have been prompted by massive pirating of compact discs in that country. Kantor indicated in a teleconference with U.S. journalists that the U.S. Administration does not want bilateral trade problems with China to become confused with the question of whether to extend China's most favored nation (MFN) trade status. President Bill Clinton must decide whether to renew the status by June 3.
