This procurement-price adjustment merely incorporates the state-set tobacco-production support charge into the procurement price and, premised on overall price levels remaining essentially unchanged and based on the principle of price based on quality, appropriately adjusts the price differences among grades (See attachments 1 and 2). Perfume tobacco is adjusted in price from the average per 50 kg of 222.11 yuan (not including the production-support charge) to 245.18 yuan (incorporating the production-support charge into the procurement price), for an increase of 10.39 percent; and white-rib tobacco is adjusted in price from the average per 50 kg of 114.38 yuan (not including the production-support charge) to 132.43 yuan (with the production-support charge being incorporated into the procurement price), for an increase of 15.78 percent. 2. The State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau will issue a separate circular on the benchmark prices for perfume and white-rib tobacco allocation. 3. These perfume and white-rib tobacco procurement prices will take effect the day on which this document is issued, with Farm Price Document No 166 (1990) issued by the former State Pricing Bureau and the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau being annuled at the same time.
