FBIS4-30137 "dreas122__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-122-A Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Deregulation of Telecommunications Sector Studied Deregulation of Telecommunications Sector Studied OW2306141494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 Jun 94 Evening Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2306141494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Unattributed article] [Text] Koshiro Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination Agency and Katsuyuki Hikasa, minister of the posts and telecommunications, are set to meet on 22 June to make a final decision on a draft package of deregulatory measures that have been studied by the Information and Telecommunications Panel under the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters [headed by Prime Minister Hata] of the government. The draft package of deregulatory measures calls for lifting the ban on the connection of exclusive business telephone circuits to urban public telephone circuits managed by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), in both international and domestic telephone services and for reducing the inspection of radio stations run by domestic telephone companies from once every year at present to once every five years. The draft package of deregulatory measures also calls for relaxing the current regulation on the output of local radio stations. In this way, the draft package of deregulatory measures, if put into effect, would provide noteworthy convenience for domestic telephone subscribers and also have a noteworthy effect on value-added network (VAN) companies and foreign telephone companies. The backbone of the draft package of deregulatory measures in the information and telecommunications sector is to: 1) lift the ban on the connection of the exclusive business telephone circuits to the urban public telephone circuits; 2) to bring efficiency to the use of radiowaves; and 3) to regulate charges imposed by telecommunications companies and curb the issuance of service licenses. Foreign VAN companies have strongly asked that Japan lift its ban on the connection of exclusive business telephone circuits to urban public telephone circuits. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] has already announced its decision to lift the ban on the connection at home. As a result of lifting the ban, the NTT has suffered a nearly 40 percent fall in long-distance telephone charges and a sharp decline in the number of its subscribers. Fearing their adverse effect on the NTT's management, MPT has taken relief measures, including allowing the NTT to impose additional charges. MPT plans to take measures to prevent drastic changes from occurring in the international telecommunications sector, and the ban on the connection of exclusive business telephone circuits to the urban public telephone circuits will be lifted next year. The number of deregulatory measures on the use of radiowaves is more than 10, the largest amount. The issuance of individual licenses for radiowaves used by transmit stations for mobile telephones (portable and car telephones) will be abolished and a "comprehensive frequency designation system" will be introduced whereby the use of all usable frequencies are approved. The current inspection period of large-scale telecommunications and radio stations will be extended and they will be inspected only once every five years. In the broadcasting sector, the current regulation on the output of community broadcasting stations, which are also called mini-FM stations, will be relaxed. Their output has been regulated uniformly to one watt, and the regulation has been criticized as incompatible with the situation in local communities. MPT plans to relax the regulation in terms of not causing jamming after surveying the number of enterprises or individuals hoping to open the community broadcasting stations and potential demand for the community broadcasting stations. MPT plans to relax the regulation in early 1995. In addition, measures will be taken to evenly distribute frequencies to local communities. As part of the effort to support multimedia, the principle of excluding concentration on the mass media in the broadcasting sector will be eased. The current exceptional scope for regulations on charges imposed and services provided by telecommunications companies that do not require approvals from MPT will be expanded. The relaxation of "the demand and supply adjustment clause," that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Keidanren [the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan] have strongly demanded, will be deferred until later. The ministry and the Keidanren have strongly demanded its relaxation, claiming that the clause is a basic regulation on participation in and withdrawal from the telecommunications business in Japan. As a result, the current situation, wherein MPT approves participation in the telecommunications business only when it concludes that the participation does not adversary affect the management of other existing telecommunications companies, will continue. MPT will continue to study ways to revamp the current tender system for the use of radiowaves, and the revamping of the system is not included in the draft package of deregulatory measures.
