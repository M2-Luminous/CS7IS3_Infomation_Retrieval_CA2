The engineer's presents--and oh, what Christmas presents!--will be the task of solving several problems that he surely never thought would come up. First of all, the results of the 31 October referendum, which were a real surprise. The government was expecting a result of more than 65 percent, which would enable it to guarantee the future reelection of President Fujimori and finish out the cycle begun on 5 April. In other words, to legitimize and legalize the Fujimori regime itself in a single act. That has not been possible. The new constitution is practically stillborn. In this context, the weakness of the new constitution as a legal basis for Fujimorism is a fact of life. Secondly, what was going to be the political basis of Fujimorism, an indisputable electoral-legal majority, is also in doubt. The near stalemate and the triumph of the "no" vote in more than a dozen departments have shattered the dream of an overwhelming, undeniable political majority that would be loyal to the president personally. Moreover, there is the uncertainty of foreign and national investors in the face of the election results and the political scandals that will certainly come to light in connection with the handling of the debt papers. These developments have a variety of consequences. The most important one is the beginning of the presidential campaign for 1995, which shows how fragile President Fujimori's future prospects are. Some sectors are already seeking to build a Fujimorism without Fujimori. Meanwhile, others (such as Daniel Estrada, Ricardo Belmont, and Luis Caceres) are practically in full swing in their presidential campaigns. The other major consequence is that the opposition and other social sectors have managed to open up new opportunities and place themselves in an expectant situation. This fact is so obvious that even the extraparliamentary opposition, sidelined until very recently, has managed to raise its head, as evidenced by Belaunde's presence at a rally held not too long ago in the city of Iquitos. Evidently, President Fujimori's legitimacy and the legality of the political regime inaugurated on 5 April are now being called into question. One indication of this weakness, for example, is the way the La Cantuta case has been unfolding. Another manifestation is the president's appeal for a national accord. It shows a desire to bring order to a political situation that got out of the government's control on 31 October. The goal is to shift the government's political position with respect to public opinion, which wants consensus and is sick of confrontations,[.sup]1[/] and at the same time to head off the avalanche of constitutional amendments that the opposition and other social sectors are proposing. La Cantuta: A Political Test The people who committed the atrocity of La Cantuta certainly never imagined that their actions would unleash a political scandal or give rise to an investigation, much less that the incident would become one of the most disturbing developments for this government. The same group had probably been involved in other actions that were never investigated. One of them, in fact, the disappearance of almost an entire family in Huacho, is quite similar to the La Cantuta case. Nevertheless, the La Cantuta affair, bravely revealed by the magazine SI, has placed the government on the horns of a dilemma: Either it knuckles under to pressure from the military not to allow a serious investigation of this atrocity, punishing only those who directly participated in the operation, or it decides to face the issue head-on, jeopardizing the so-called military hierarchy and the Armed Forces' perception of Fujimori as their leader. It should be noted that after the accusations made by Congressman Henry Pease in April of last year, the military, without even consulting the president, decided to take the tanks out into the streets. Furthermore, the problem of La Cantuta has ceased to be simply a matter of human rights violations; it has also become a kind of political test that will measure institutional and group responses and relationships that are important to this government. Several institutions are involved in La Cantuta. The first one is the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) itself, which, having changed its earlier position in view of the overwhelming evidence, has now demanded that the matter be handled by civilian courts rather than military ones. Another institution involved is the judiciary, which will have to determine soon, when the prosecutor decides to file charges, whether the La Cantuta affair is a matter of common or military jurisdiction. The military courts' objections to prosecutors' questioning the military personnel allegedly involved in this multiple crime, and their refusal to turn over information to the CCD on the grounds that the matter is outside its jurisdiction, show just how far the stonewallers can go. The Armed Forces themselves are involved as an institution, and to be perfectly honest, the political survival of the Army's top echelon is at stake, in view of the accusations by General Robles from his asylum in Argentina that they were accomplices in this criminal incident. There is something more, as well. The solution to the La Cantuta case will also serve to assess the relationship between President Fujimori's government and that of the United States. It is well known that the Clinton administration, ambiguities aside, is anxious for this case to be resolved on the best possible terms as a first step toward changing the command structure of the Armed Forces. And finally, the relationship between President Fujimori and the military hierarchy, one of the pillars of the regime inaugurated on 5 April, is at stake. President Fujimori's recent confirmation of the commanders-in-chief of the various branches of the military, including the police, and the scandalous exclusion of Parliament from the process of promoting the highest-ranking officers[.sup]2[/] show not only that he has already made one decision--to protect the senior military commanders--but also that there is some instability in the relationship between the military leadership and the president that could result in a coup d'etat or in a change of personnel in that leadership. For this reason, as we have stated, the La Cantuta case is a true political test. At risk is the autonomy of the aforementioned institutions, as well as the ability of the key players to exert pressure. There is, then, a direct relationship between the institutions' independence and the political power they theoretically wield. The latter is important, given that one of the variables for measuring the authoritarianism of a regime is precisely the degree of autonomy--and therefore power--exercised by these institutions. If the judiciary decides to stay out of the La Cantuta case or to defer to the military courts, we can conclude, once again, that this institution is not autonomous and, therefore, that either it is a mere appendage of the government or it has no power. The same can be said of the CCD. This would confirm the notion that the objectives of the self-coup of 5 April were not to reform the judiciary or the political system. Rather, these objectives can be found in the logic of the neoliberal economic model, the antisubversion strategy itself, and the role of the military, as shown in the documents published by the magazine OIGA.[.sup]3[/] For this reason, the danger of this kind of political development, and of La Cantuta, is that they reveal the real intensions of power, and therefore, they always end up imposing a "zero sum" logic in which the gains of the victorious are based on the total losses of the defeated. To put it another way, if the triumph of Fujimori and the military hierarchy in the La Cantuta affair is based on the unconditional defeat of the opposition and greater political control over the institutions of the regime, it entails greater involvement by the military in the government, since it is the military that has actually won the game. Consequently, now the groundwork has really been laid for a transition toward a civilian-military government that could, in the short term, as more incidents such as La Cantuta are revealed,[.sup]4[/] turn into a military government. That is why, if the results of 31 October represent a severe blow to the future of President Fujimori and his government, La Cantuta reveals a president walking into a blind alley. Mr. Fujimori has ended up entangled in his own alliances. The question is whether he is trapped for good, in which case he could become an irrelevancy, depending on how things unfold, or whether he will decide to put on a military uniform. The tragedy in all this is that it would not be the uniform of Francisco Bolognesi or Miguel Grau, but that of Martin Rivas or Nicolas de Bari Hermoza. This uniform could quickly take on a black hue. There is, however, another option: changing the military leadership. Footnotes 1. The surveys conducted by the agency IMASEN immediately after 31 October yielded the following results: About 80 percent thought the Constitution should be amended before being promulgated; 73 percent thought there should be a political accord between the government and the opposition. It should be mentioned that the IMASEN survey was conducted in Lima, one of the government's most important political bastions. 2. Actually, rather than assuage the Army's fears about La Cantuta, the promotions have caused greater consternation. For example, as some news media, including the magazine SI, have pointed out, no one from the artillery, to which Gen. Valdivia belongs, has been promoted to major general. 3. We are referring to the documents published by that magazine several months ago. According to the magazine, the documents, of military origin, mention a political plan to govern this country for at least 15 years, through either a civilian government or a military regime. 4. As we finished writing this article, Channel 9, ATV, reported the disappearance of nine people in Chimbote in May of last year. The operation followed a pattern quite similar to that of La Cantuta. There was an attack in the area, and a few days later nine people suspected of being Shining Path members disappeared. This time the accusations have focused on the Navy, so it is not just the Army that is involved in this kind of action, but another branch of the military as well.
