"There is shelling around us, and there has been continuous intensive fighting throughout the night," UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said. "The battle area has spread over various parts of Kigali." Tanzanian Foreign Minister Joseph Rwegasira announced in Dar es Salaam that Rwanda's interim government had signed a document calling for a ceasefire starting Saturday. He said the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front did not sign, but had promised to observe the ceasefire. Rebel officials were not immediately available to comment. Kabia told AFP by telephone from Kigali that fighting had also been reported around the northwestern town of Ruhengeri, where relief officials said mainly Tutsi rebel guerrillas were besieging Hutu-led government forces. Clashes also erupted elsewhere in the country and spread in the corpse-littered and blood-splattered capital. Shells fell near the Mille Collines Hotel in central Kigali, where about 300 Tutsi civilians have been holed up for weeks under UN protection. Government soldiers and militiamen have prevented UN forces from evacuating them. The rebel headquarters at the former parliament building was "very heavily shelled and received two direct hits" Thursday, Kabia said. Casualty figures were unknown.
