Of the initial 92 percent, membership has dropped to the present 36 percent. Only 22 percent of the work force employed in private companies are trade union members, said Jaroslav Strait, chairman of the Trade Unions Association of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. He said that the current trend in the development of the trade union movement is worrying. What is disappearing is not only trade unions but also ordinary human solidarity, Strait said, adding that the pressure the state exerts on the social and economic rights of the people has strongly intensified and that ever tougher standards are asked for. Strait said that all of this is happening with the help of the Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions. He branded this organization as a government-run trade union.
