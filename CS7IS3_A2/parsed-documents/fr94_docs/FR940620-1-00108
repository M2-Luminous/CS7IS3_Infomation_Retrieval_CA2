FR940620-1-00108 FR940620-1-00012 28 CFR 35.151 would be replaced by §§35.151&hyph;35.155 of the proposed regulation. At present, §35.151 provides that those buildings that are constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Current §35.151(c) establishes two standards for accessible new construction and alteration. Under paragraph (c), design, construction, or alteration of facilities in conformance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) or with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG) is deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those facilities (except that, if ADAAG is chosen, the elevator exemption does not apply). ADAAG was initially developed by the Access Board as a guideline for accessibility to buildings and facilities that are subject to title III. It was adopted by the Department as the standard for places of public accommodation and commercial facilities under title III of the ADA and was published as Appendix A to the Department's regulation implementing title III, 28 CFR part 36, and amended on January 18, 1994, 59 FR 2674. This rule removes that appendix and adds the Access Board's revised guidelines as Appendix A to 28 CFR part 37. The proposed rule would revise 28 CFR 35.151 and add four new sections, 28 CFR 35.152&hyph;35.155, which follow the format of parallel provisions in the Department's title III regulation at 28 CFR part 36, subpart D. Section 35.150␣Existing Facilities The proposed rule would amend §35.150(a)(2), which provides that, in ensuring access to programs in existing facilities, a public entity is not required to take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic significance of an historic property. The proposed amendment to §35.150(a)(2) would incorporate the procedures set out in section 4.1.7 of the ADA Standards for determining whether a physical alteration would threaten or destroy the historic significance of an historic property. The proposed rule would also amend §35.150(b)(1) to make clear that the path of travel requirements of §35.153 do not apply to measures taken solely to comply with program accessibility requirements. This amendment is consistent with §36.304(d)(1) of the title III regulation, which states that ``[t]he path of travel requirements of §36.403 shall not apply to measures taken solely to comply with the barrier removal requirements of this section.'' Section 35.151␣New Construction Section 35.151, as revised, would require that newly constructed facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Paragraph 35.151(b)(2) of the proposed rule incorporates the ADA's ``structural impracticability'' exception for new construction. Under that exception, in new construction, full compliance with the requirements of the ADA Standards is not required where a public entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. However, full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features. The statute dictates that regulations promulgated under title II of the ADA ``shall be consistent with [the other titles of] this Act'' as well as with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;336, §204(b). Furthermore, the legislative history of the ADA indicates that ``the forms of discrimination prohibited by [title II are] identical to those set out in the applicable provisions of titles I and III.'' H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 84 (1990). Thus the structural impracticability exception for public accommodations and commercial facilities contained in the Department of Justice title III regulations at 28 CFR 36.401(c) has been incorporated in §35.151 and is included in the ADA Standards at §4.1.1(5)(a). Other revisions to this rule and to the ADA Standards that render this rule and the ADA Standards consistent with title III, which are discussed below, are based on this same statutory mandate and legislative history.
