That way, everyone will consume according to his means...this will put an end to smuggling across the border and to waste," said Mr. Mustapha Makraoui, acting commerce minister, in a press conference held yesterday at Government House. The acting commerce minister met yesterday with journalists to say, first of all, that if there are food shortages, it is not because the state has failed to import enough. The minister also challenged government officials to improve the output of a "totally foundering" national distribution system that engenders only penury and speculation. Typically, Mr. Makraoui first bombarded journalists with statistics. Imports for last year were valued at $9 billion, including $2.5 billion for food products. Some $700 million went for importing hard and soft wheat, corn, rice, and barley, $520 million for semolina flour, and $54 million for dehydrated vegetables. Authorizations for imports by ENAPEL [expansion not given] (milk, coffee, sugar, tea, etc.) came to nearly $1 billion. The commerce minister admitted, however, that these programs were not all fully implemented, for several reasons. For example, foreign banks were cautious, preferring to wait until they knew whether Algeria would negotiate with the IMF in late 1993. Algeria is also having difficulties acquiring hard wheat and semolina on world markets, difficulties that Mr. Makraoui ascribes to the decline in world production of hard wheat. Not until January did the European countries agree to make available 300,000 tons of hard wheat and an equal amount of semolina.
