Addressing the third meeting of the First Council of the Chinese mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], Wang Zhaoguo said: Relations across the Taiwan Strait made major advances last year. The publication of the white paper on the Taiwan Issue and China's reunification, which comprehensively and systematically expounds China's principled stand and policies on the Taiwan issue, has had both an immediate and far-reaching impact on the development of relations across the strait and on China's reunification. After the attempt by the Taiwan authorities to participate in the United Nations was thwarted at the 48th UN General Assembly, some people in Taiwan began to publicly advocate the so-called two Chinas as a phase. This merits our close attention and vigilance. Speaking of the working-level talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Wang Zhaoguo said: The characteristics of the working-level talks between the ARATS and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] have become somewhat different from those of the past. This is reflected mainly in the fact that the SEF tried to use the handling of administrative matters to create so-called independent sovereignty and complete judicial jurisdiction, thereby achieving the goal of making the mainland and Taiwan two equal political entities. Wang Zhaoguo stressed: In light of this, we must uphold the principle of one China and, based on the common understanding that the ARATS-SEF talks are nongovernment, economic, administrative, and functional in nature, avoid sensitive political issues to seek common ground while putting aside differences. We must make active efforts to advance the talks and to produce positive results on administrative matters. Wang Zhaoguo spoke highly of the ARATS's fruitful efforts in promoting cross-strait exchanges and developing relations between the two sides in the two years since its establishment. He said: During the last year, thanks to the joint efforts of all localities and departments and the people throughout the country, including the Taiwan people, economic and trade relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have developed more rapidly. Exchanges in personnel and in other areas have made new breakthroughs. The number of Taiwan businesses investing in the mainland has increased sharply. From January to November of last year, indirect trade between the two sides reached $12.1 billion. The two sides have forged closer economic interests. More than 1.5 million people visited the mainland from Taiwan last year. The number of people from Taiwan's higher hierarchy and public figures from all walks of life has increased 50 percent from the same period in 1992. More people from the mainland also visited Taiwan to carry out a wide range of exchanges. Facts show that exchanges in personnel and in other areas have a positive impact on the development of relations across the strait. Wang Zhaoguo called for consistent efforts to promote the establishment of direct postal, trade, and navigational ties between the two sides and to push for the exchanges between people on the mainland and Taiwan and exchanges and cooperation in every field in accordance with the policies of peaceful reunification and one country and two systems. He called for vigorous economic cooperation in particular to jointly revitalize China's national economy. He said: In line with the development of the situation, the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office will coordinate with the relevant State Council departments to authorize the ARATS to hold talks with Taiwan's SEF on economic matters, science and technology exchanges, and cooperation in the development of energy resources, while continuing their talks on administrative matters. He urged the ARATS and SEF to institutionalize meetings between their responsible persons and to further promote contact and cooperation with each other in accordance with the relevant agreements reached during the Wang-Gu talks. He also said that he hoped to see an early, successful materialization of the second meeting between Chairman Wang Daohan and Mr. Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen- fu] to advance the development of cross-strait relations.
