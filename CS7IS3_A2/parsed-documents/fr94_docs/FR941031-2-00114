FR941031-2-00114 FR941031-2-00081 Policy Regarding Revision of Selection Criteria for Discretionary Airport Improvement Program Grant Awards AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration; Department of Transportation. ACTION: Notice of policy. SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is revising the process used to evaluate applications for Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants awarded at the discretion at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. The new process represents an evolution of past practice. Airport safety and security projects will continue to be accorded the highest priority in AIP investments. They will be followed in order of priority by projects to preserve existing airport infrastructure; bring airports into compliance with standards (including noise mitigation); upgrade service; and increase airport system capacity. The changes described below are intended to assure uniform levels of airport system safety, quality, and performance for passengers, shippers, and aircraft operators throughout the Nation and to improve the effectiveness of AIP investments in meeting critical needs of the national airport system. Changes in the AIP grant award selection process are based on Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal Infrastructure Investments,'' and guidance provided in Congressional hearings regarding the use of national priority and economic analysis in evaluating Federal investment in airport infrastructure. Revised procedures involve: establishment of national airport investment objectives; consistent ranking of grant applications among FAA regions by type of project; use of national threshold Priority System scores for award consideration; and application of benefit-cost analysis to any project intended to preserve or enhance capacity for which the total value of requested discretionary capacity grants is expected to equal or exceed $10 million over the life of the project. All procedural changes are consistent with existing statutory requirements for program administration and will be incorporated into FAA Order 5100.38A, ``Airport Improvement Program (AIP) Handbook.'' Applications of the procedures will be described by the FAA each year in its ``Annual Report of Accomplishments Under the Airport Improvement Program.'' The new criteria described in this policy apply to all new projects to be considered for AIP grant awards in FY 1995 and subsequent years. On a case-by-case basis, the FAA may apply the new criteria to ongoing projects approved for AIP grant awards in prior years. In addition to improvements in the discretionary AIP grant award selection process described herein, the effectiveness of Federal AIP investments will also be reinforced by implementation of a new policy on the issuance of Letters of Intent (LOI's). The FAA recognizes that, as experience is gained by using these procedures, additional improvements may be needed in the criteria used to evaluate applications for discretionary AIP grants.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the FAA are charged with promoting and maintaining a national aviation system that operates safely and efficiently. The Federal Government pursues this objective in part by investing Federal funds, via AIP grants-in-aid, in modern airport facilities sufficient to handle current and future air traffic and by facilitating local investment in such facilities. The AIP was first authorized by the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (the AAIA). On July 5, 1994, the President signed Public Law 103&hyph;272, Codification of Certain U.S. Transportation Laws as Title 49, United States Code (the Codification), which now contains the statutory authority for the AIP (the AIAA was repealed by enactment of the Codification). The Codification provides guidance for the award of grants-in-aid by formula and by discretionary authority granted the Secretary. Section 47115 of the Codification authorizes the Secretary to make AIP discretionary funds available in a manner that the Secretary considers most appropriate for carrying out the purposes of chapter 471, subchapter 1, of the Codification (i.e., Airport Improvement). Section 47115(d) specifies that in selecting projects for discretionary grants to preserve and enhance capacity at airports, ``the Secretary shall consider_(1) The effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system capacity; (2) the project benefit and cost; and (3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or enhance airport capacity.'' The FAA implemented guidance for administering the AIP in its Order 5100.38A, ``Airport Improvement Program (AIP) Handbook'' (October 24, 1989). Order 5100.38A defines a structured local airport planning process from which projects are identified and entered into the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). The NPIAS is the national airport system plan (submitted to Congress on a biennial basis) that identifies potential public-use airport development projects in the United States which are eligible for AIP assistance. The FAA uses a ranking process, titled the Priority System, to award discretionary grants to sponsors of eligible NPIAS projects for which AIP monies are sought. The Priority System assigns numerical values to airport projects based on the type of project and the size and role of the airport. Grants-in-aid are awarded to high priority projects, subject to funding availability (established in annual obligation limitations and program authorizations) and consideration of sponsor financial commitment.
