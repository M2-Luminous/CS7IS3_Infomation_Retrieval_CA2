The clamor is coming mostly from the United States. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (North Korea's) suspected nuclear development is being discussed in relation to Japan's nuclear development also. In a recent issue of the U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine, Lee Kuan Yew, senior minister of Singapore, stated that "if Japan decided on nuclear armament, it would be impossible to overturn their decision. The United States cannot even stop North Korea's action." The end of last January, a British newspaper reported with heavy headlines the possibility of Japan developing nuclear weapons, as coming from a secret document of the British Defense Ministry. The report was highly questionable. However, the U.S. reacted immediately. Defense Secretary Perry testified in the Congress that "if Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan judged that North Korea was armed with nuclear weapons, it would be possible that they each would move to possess nuclear weapons." Senator Nunn, chairman of the Senate's military committee, also stated that "Japan possesses the ability and technology (to develop nuclear weapons), as well as plutonium." These statements accidentally proved what the United States is fearing the most, that is... North Korea's possession of nuclear bomb, East Asia becoming unstable, Japan's nuclear development becoming justified, Japan's becoming a militaristic giant. Why is Japan's nuclear armament so often discussed in the United States? One reason is because of the strategic necessity of the U.S. hardliners (hawks), so that they may justify the U.S. militaristic presence in Asia, with the excuse to keep an eye on Japan. The other reason is because the Japanese Government has not given a counterargument against it. There are four possible stages in nuclear armament. Stage 1 is to possess several atomic bombs. Stage 2 is to possess several hundred tactical nuclear bombs. Stage 3 is to be equipped with strategic nuclear weapons in addition to the first two. Stage 4 is to possess a nuclear strategy system equivalent to what the United States has. First, we will discuss stage 1. There remains a technical problem. However, suppose the problem were cleared. Where would we perform a test? Consider India's example. Although they did the test in the middle of a dessert, they were troubled with the residue of plutonium for a long time after that. It would not be possible to test domestically. Moreover, the international political reaction would be great. The United States would stop exporting uranium fuel and technology to Japan, and they would also demand the already exported uranium back. Japan would be forced to cut down energy demand (consumption), and the Japanese economy would result in great confusion. Trade restrictions by the United States and neighboring countries would be inevitable. However, just possessing several atomic bombs would not do much for defense of Japan, unless Japan were prepared to commit suicide. Stage 2 could be reached within 10 years, if unrealistic conditions, such as that Japan can borrow a place for testing from another country, and that uranium can be obtained abundantly, are met. However, this plan is fragile in terms of security, and would be the worst choice. Stage 3 may be achieved in 10 to 20 years, if public opinion concerning constitutional reform is unified, and if the people are prepared for a life of endurance. However, by then the military technology possessed by some countries, such as the United States, would be more advanced, and Japanese nuclear strategy would be out of date. Stage 4 is out of the question. Japan has influence in its own way, by sticking to being a non-nuclear power nation, while being a potential nuclear power nation. However, once it performs a nuclear test, Japan would become nothing more than the smallest and the weakest country among the nuclear powers. Japanese people fully recognize that showing leadership in nuclear disarmament as a nation, which has suffered from atomic bombing, is the very purpose of Japan. Our government should let the world know more aggressively that Japan's nuclear armament is out of the bounds of possibility realistically as well as ideally.
