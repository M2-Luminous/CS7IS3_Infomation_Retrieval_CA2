Baseline emissions shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(iii)(A) (1) and (2) of this section. (2) On and after January 1, 2000, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of any record showing that total VOC emissions from the facility exceeded 4.5 kg (10 lbs) during any one day by sending a copy of such record to the Administrator within 30 calendar days after the exceedance occurs.
