Truly God loves those who fight in his cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure. [Koranic verse] With deep faith that God supports the soldiers of right, the people, and the revolution and that he will grant them victory, the heroes in our valiant Armed Forces pursue their heroic and epic fighting in the battles of confrontation of all the forces of apostasy, rebellion, and secession led by the criminal and evil elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] command in the governorates of Lahij, Abyan, and Aden, scoring decisive victories in the performance of their tasks. As we affirmed in a previous statement the day before yesterday our valiant Armed Forces in the southwestern axis succeeded in completely destroying all the units of the (Labuza) Brigade camp and have proceeded from it toward the al-'Anad camp where our valiant forces succeeded yesterday morning in crossing the fortifications of its first defensive line. Our forces continue to bravely and firmly engage the other defensive fortifications of the camp, which is considered one of the most important military strongholds that the elements of apostasy and secession in the YSP command had [word indistinct]. It contains defensive fortifications contributed by the Soviet experts during the Communist rule, as well as huge weapons arsenals, and an air base that was administered before 22 May 1990 by the Socialist bloc. Following the unity, this place remained out of reach for the institutions of constitutional legitimacy. No one knew its secrets except the members of the rebellious, secessionist gang and those who are close to it. This gang was depending on this place to implement the most serious episode of its conspiracy to destroy and fragment the homeland. The final phase to restore this place to the Armed Forces and constitutional legitimacy is now under way, thanks to the heroes of the forces of unity and legitimacy. In the Lahij Governorate axis, units from our Armed Forces are now working to finish their combat missions in the face of the forces of the secessionist gang. The units are advancing to achieve their objectives. In the Abyan-Aden axis, our forces have also continued to defeat the secessionists hostile, desperate attacks advancing from the Aden garrison, forcing them to retreat. In the face of the treacherous air attacks on the units of our valiant Armed forces and on defenseless cities, the heroes of the Air Defenses courageously confronted them. They managed to shoot down a fighter aircraft in al-Rahidah region and another in the al-Dali' area. They also shot down a third aircraft in [name indistinct] in the Qa'tabah District. The aircraft of the forces of apostasy and secession concentrated their attacks on the city of Ta'izz and al-Rahidah. One of their odious shells hit al-Rahidah Hospital, killing several patients in the hospital. The Air Force aircraft in our valiant Armed Forces also conducted several offensive sorties against what was left of the camps and concentrations of the secessionist, rebellious forces in all axes of the fighting, achieving success in all their combat missions. They returned safely to base. The forces protecting unity and upholding constitutional legitimacy and democracy received a number of troops, including commanders, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers, who were misled by the secessionist elements. They joined the ranks of right and unity, and the trench of the state and its constitutional institutions, expressing their loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, and the unity and rejecting the orders of the separatist clique. They stressed their readiness to continue fighting along side their colleagues in the Armed Forces in defense of unity and the constitutional legitimacy in order to defeat the remaining dens of the mutinous secessionist clique. Large quantities of weapons, ammunition, combat equipment, and vehicles were seized. Information also clarified that the rebel separatist forces are forcing citizens, including young people, to join their ranks after all their threats and calls to the citizens to respond to the illegitimate general mobilization decision issued by the deposed Haytham Qasim Salih. This is taking place while the morale and the feelings of confidence in victory are increasing within the ranks of the units fighting in support of the unity and constitutional legitimacy and in defense of democracy. The citizens' hopes in all governorates are increasing in that those who wanted to disturb the people's life, fragment their unity and bargain with their fate and existence in the service of their own sick whims and illegitimate ambitions, which are hostile to the people and the homeland and to all the principles and values, will inevitably be doomed. O you who believe, if you will help the cause of Allah, He will help you, and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verse] Issued by the Defense Ministry.
