A single deputy was elected and named in each of 37 out of 40 districts. The fact that seven candidates from the Russia's Choice bloc were elected, defeating the Patriots of Russia bloc which conducted a very vigorous preelection propaganda campaign, became something of a sensation. The new public association Region also met with failure: Only two out of 21 candidates were elected; the renaissance of the Kama area--the development and execution of a long-term program for socioeconomic renewal of Perm Oblast--was proclaimed to be its main objective. If you read attentively the list of 37 elected deputies, you will understand that in the course of this election the vote was in favor of individual fellow citizens rather than parties: Almost all are the supreme officials of administrations, enterprises, banks, and hospitals; they are people who are known in the oblast. There are many representatives of the local executive authorities among them: Vladimir Fil heads the administration of Perm, Nikolay Poluyanov--Permyakia; Mikhail Bystryantsev is chairman of the Perm Oblast Soviet. More deputies than ever, nine, were elected from among bankers and entrepreneurs. They include Vladimir Khlebnikov, president of the Perm Commodity and Stock Exchange, Yuriy Trutnev, general director of the Eks-Limited industrial and financial group, and Grigoriy Barshevskiy, president of BiS-Credit Bank. The director corps, agrarians, and representatives of humanitarian professions--physicians and teachers--are widely represented. The second round of voting will be held in 12 weeks in the districts in which elections were not validly held. The amount of 2 billion rubles was spent for the elections, three-quarters of which was allocated from the federal budget, and the remainder--from the local budget.
