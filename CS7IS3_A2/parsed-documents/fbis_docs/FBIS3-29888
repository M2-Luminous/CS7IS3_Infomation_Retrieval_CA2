A Defense Ministry material showed on Monday that the 1993 exports compare with mere 25 million dollars in weapons exports in the previous year. Exports of weapons had been very sluggish from the close of the 1970s before they turned brisk last year thanks to heavy shipment to some Southeast Asian countries, according to the material.
