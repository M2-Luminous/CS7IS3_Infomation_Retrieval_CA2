This has been confirmed by the latest figures from the State Statistics Committee. As of 1 April 1994 the total debt of industrial enterprises, construction businesses, transport and agriculture amounted to 93 trillion rubles. According to the estimates of the economics institute for the problems of the transition period, the budget deficit for the first quarter has already reached 11 percent of the Gross National Product. Let me remind you that in its draft budget for 1994, the government undertook not to exceed the 10 percent mark for its deficit. There are still budgetary debts to a number of industries. This in turn leads to non-payments on the part of the enterprises, not only to each other and to banks, but to the budget as well.
