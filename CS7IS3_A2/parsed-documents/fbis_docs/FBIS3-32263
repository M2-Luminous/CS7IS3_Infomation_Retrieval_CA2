The categories that make up the CPI basket are shown in the following table, [table not reproduced] where it is clear that the greatest increases occurred in health care (2.5 percent), clothing (2.2 percent), education, reading, and entertainment (1.7 percent), personal care (1.3 percent), and transportation (1.1 percent). Given the different weights attributed to each category, however, it can be seen in the contribution column that the categories of food, clothing, housing and home upkeep, health care, and education, reading, and entertainment were the ones that exerted the greatest influence on the growth of the CPI this month, with figures of 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1, respectively [as published]. They account for 90 percent of the total variation. The sum of the contributions by category is not necessarily equal to the total, because they are approximations. The goods and services that had the greatest impact on the variation in the CPI are listed below: [list not reproduced] The products and services named in the above chart represent a net contribution of 0.5, and together they account for 50 percent of the total variation in the CPI.
