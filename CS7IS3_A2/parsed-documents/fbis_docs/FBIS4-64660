They decided that Polish and German Air-Forces should offer help to the other side in special situations and inform the other side of the intended operations in the border-line areas. Poland and Germany will also propose to Sweden and Denmark joint manouevres in the Baltic Sea. "My talks are linked to Poland's approaching to Western defence structures," Gen. Gotowala said. Poland also aims to coordinate its charity actions with German and international operations as it sometines happens that Polish planes with humanitarian aid must wait for their turn to come to unload the cargo. Closer cooperation with German Air-Forces may help to include Poland in the international system of charity operations. After the talks, General Gotowala visited air-bases in the north of Germany.
