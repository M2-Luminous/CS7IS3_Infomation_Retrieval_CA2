He told Interfax that the meeting of chief negotiators that ended in Riga Wednesday was "productive." That meeting was delayed until Latvia apologized for the incident of January 10 when Latvian territorial troops blocked numerous buildings belonging to the Russian Army in the Latvian capital and held two Russian generals handcuffed for hours before releasing them by order of Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis. In the words of Zotov, the provocation against the Russian troops on the day when the Russian delegation stayed in Riga unexpectedly facilitated the Russo-Latvian talks. He said that a broad understanding was reached on the legal status of the Russian radar station in the village of Skrunda and an agreement on the deadline for its closure seems possible. The Russian delegation which had insisted on keeping the station under Russian control for six years agreed to reduce that time to five years. The Latvian authorities had wanted the station dismantled in three years. Zotov added that Latvian Prime Minister Birkavs had also noted the success of the talks when the two men met on January 12. Birkavs said then that the Latvian government would do its best to prevent activities that could have a negative impact on the bilateral relations and obstruct the talks between Russia and Latvia. The two men agreed that efforts must be redoubled to draft the agreements and create a legal basis for normal development of the Russo-Latvian relations.
