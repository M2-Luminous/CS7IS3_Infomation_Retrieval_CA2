Female students ran to escape arrest, but they were caught by police and beaten. As the women began sobbing and crying, the situation became like hell. In the evening, about 1,000 students were taken to Insein prison. It was March 17, 1988, the beginning of what has become known as the democracy uprising in Burma. Quickly, Rangoon became a ghosttown: Martial law was imposed, as shooting, street demonstrations and fighting between riot police and civilians continued. On March 18, about 70 people suffocated to death in a prison van. In the evening, thousands of people were rounded up and thrown into jail yet another hell. Children, mostly Muslims, as well as many other civilians were beaten to death in prison. "Fear in Burma is increasing," said a foreign journalist who was lucky enough to get a visa to Burma recently. Some observers and diplomats have noted lately that it seems that the State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) countrywide intimidation campaign has been successful. Even with this grim observation the next few months offer many occasions for commemorating the 1988 uprising and the important events that followed. While it is a sure bet that SLORC will not allow any public display of solidarity, some Burmese in Rangoon and other major cities are expecting "something to happen", according to a source. An activist in Rangoon recently said, "We are hoping for change because we are fed up with SLORC." He said that by change he meant, "pressure from outside and inside." Many Butmese, indeed, are dreaming about "outside pressure" since they realise that they cannot fight the cruel armed forces. In particular, many Burmese were expecting the UN or one of the superpowers to respond with tough action against the Burmese military during the uprising of 1988. Even with attempts to apply pressure by the international community the Burmese military is still allowed to terrorise and to purge all opponents. Six years after the nationwide street demonstrations, killings and violence, Burma is like a dormant volcano which can explode anytime. Rangoon resident Hla Htun said "We feel very depressed about the current situation but are always encouraged by Daw Suu [Aung San Suu Kyi]. What we need is encouragement." He criticised SLORC's General Secretary, Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, for recently refusing to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi. Khin Nyunt turned down a proposal by U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson to hold a dialogue with the detained leader. Another Rangoon resident, Aung Myint, said Khin Nyunt's decision had "crushed people's hopes", adding, however, that he and others are still hoping that "SLORC may see the light in the end. Aung San Suu Kyi is still the strongest leader we have." Though it is not known what the remamlng opposltion groups are planning at the SLORC-sponsored National Convention, the National League for Democracy (NLD), winner of the 1990 elections, is still opposed to SLORC's proposal to give the armed forces a leading role in the constitution, an inside source reported. According to the source, people in Rangoon are not told what is happening at the convention, but "some of SLORC's hand-picked delegates also feel guilty because they know they are lying like SLORC and that the ordinary Burmese do not have faith in the convention." While SLORC is forcing delegates to the convention to accept what SLORC wants, it has meanwhile been reaching cease-fire agreements with the armed ethnic groups that have been fighting for autonomy for more than four decades. As these agreements do not really guarantee peace for Burma, it may be that SLORC is just testing the waters. The ethnic groups are tired of war and are seeking peace, but different circumstances among the armed groups have led to these cease-fire talks. Some groups, for instance, the Karen and the Mon, are being forced to make peace with SLORC through pressure from neighbouring countries. Even the peace agreement between the Kachin Independence Organisation (KI0) and SLORC, which was formally signed in Myitkyina last month, has an uncertain future. At the signing ceremony, which was broadcast by Burmese television, Lt Gen Khin Nyunt was still using the term of "coming back to the legal fold" in referring to the KIO. This certainly did not go down well with some Kachin leaders. Later, Maj-Gen Zau Mai, vice-chairman of the KI0, said at the ceremony that although both parties were agreeing to sign the cease-fire agreement, it would be possible for the KI0 to return to its armed struggle if the peace process falls. As it is, the people in the tea shops, markets, pagodas, factories, and schools who were active in the prodemocracy movement in 1988 and the following years are still waiting for true democratic change. These people can become street-fighters again at anytime. For this reason, fear is increasing in Burma, not only among ordinary people, but also within SLORC itself. According to well-informed sources, Matriculation students staged a brief protest against the SLORC after sitting for the final exams in mathematics in Rangoon early this month. The students dispersed before the authorities arrived, the sources said. There were no arrests reported. Burma did have a parliamentary democracy before 1962, and there was even a short-lived democracy in August-September 1988, but SLORC's leaders considered these only as "disturbances." It does not matter what the medieval Burmese military dictatorship thinks about democracy, most Burmese will continue to believe that democracy and freedom are essential for Burma. Recently, a U.S. State Department spokesman hinted that the Clinton administration may push for an international arms embargo against SLORC and may put pressure on SLORC's leaders to open a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi by appointing a special UN envoy to Burma. These long overdue moves by the U.S. may be the "encouragement" that Hla Htun and so many other Burmese desperately need.
