The march began at 1600 in Paseo La Reforma, near the Child Heroes Monument in Chapultepec. They walked to Bucarelli Street, moving along Juarez Avenue until reaching Maderos Avenue and El Zocalo. During their march, they chanted slogans against the situation in Chiapas State and the North American Free Trade Agreement. About 40 buses were impeded by the group, which blocked traffic on the streets and avenues on its path. Mr. Ricardo Barco, one of the leaders of the Independent Proletariat Movement, said a peaceful agreement between the warring sides in Chiapas was necessary. There were also two demonstrations in Mexico city during the morning. A group of university professors picketed outside the Government Secretariat. With placards and banners, they protested the violence in Chiapas and the manipulation of Indian groups in the conflict. Afterward, 150 people from the Mexico City Neighborhood Assembly demonstrated outside the Televisa building on Chapultepec Avenue, demanding clear reportage of the events in Upper Chiapas. This group, headed by Marcos Rasconi and Javier Hidalgo, members of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, marched toward the Government Secretariat, where it joined the group of university professors in a rally.
