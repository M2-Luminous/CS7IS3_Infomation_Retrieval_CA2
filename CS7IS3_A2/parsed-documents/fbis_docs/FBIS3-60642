According to a government source, during recent contacts with the United States, North Korea presented "a six-point package proposal." In connection with the nuclear threat, the demands include: (1) a U.S. guarantee, supported with documents, that it will not launch a preemptive nuclear attack (NSA) [expansion unknown]; (2) a U.S. statement on not deploying nuclear weapons in South Korea; and (3) the permanent suspension of the Team Spirit exercise. In connection with the abolishment of the U.S. hostile policy toward North Korea, it asks for: (1) the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement; (2) the withdrawal of the U.S. designation of North Korea as a terrorist state; and (3) the support for North Korea's policy of reunification through the founding of a confederal republic of Koryo. In a package solution proposal on 11 November, Kang Sok-chu, first vice foreign minister of North Korea, called on the U.S. side to take practical actions to abolish its "nuclear threat" and "hostile policy." However, the details of the package solution proposal were not revealed then. Most of these demands are believed to have been proposed by North Korea in previous contacts. However, it has not been confirmed whether North Korea presented these demands at the final U.S.-North Korean contact as a proposal for a package solution. North Korea was learned to have left out demands for U.S. support in the construction of a light-water moderated reactor, recognition of North Korea as an actual state equivalent to South Korea, abolition of the export ban against North Korea and economic assistance, and withdrawal of U.S. troops in this package solution proposal. North Korea's exclusion of such demands from the current proposal is thought to have been prompted by its judgment that once the nuclear problem is solved in a package deal, the United States will take appropriate steps for North Korea. The United States was learned to have conveyed its position towards this package solution proposal by North Korea on 24 November that a comprehensive [pogwalchok] solution would only be possible if North Korea accepts inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and comes to North-South dialogue. Therefore, North Korea's response, which will attract a lot of attention, is expected to be revealed soon. A high-ranking government official stated that "the U.S. position is that with the exception of the point on supporting the Koryo confederal system, the remaining five points in North Korea's package solution proposal are negotiable." This official said that "since written assurance of not using nuclear weapons and a pledge not to deploy them are already reflected in the existing U.S.-North Korea joint statement, more specific progress would help. In addition, the United States is open to considering a temporary suspension of the Team Spirit exercise." He added that the U.S. position is that "once transparency in North Korea's nuclear issue is guaranteed, the prospect for implementation of the denuclearization declaration will be brighter and accordingly, assistance in North Korea's construction of a light-water moderated reactor as well as humanitarian economic assistance will be possible."
