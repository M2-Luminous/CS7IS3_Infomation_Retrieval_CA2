German Government Demands of Zhirinovskiy's Party"] [Text] Berlin -- When in early January this year the Berlin newspapers reported the sensational news that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] may be being financed from Germany, few people believed it. Only one thing was known for sure: The German firm TFO GMBH following a ruling from the independent state commission for checking the property of parties and mass organizations of the former GDR, was subject to a search during which important documents were confiscated at the firm itself and at the apartment of its leader, Werner Hirche. According to Josef Dirdorf, leader of the German trust agency's "special property" directorate, these documents confirmed the suggestion that "TFO had intensive contacts with Zhirinovskiy." Official representatives of the FRG's trust agency assert that in the fall of 1993, on the eve of the elections in Russia, V. Zhirinovskiy's representatives received from a representative of Hirche's company 63,600 deutsche marks [DM]. In October-November last year over the course of a month four representatives of Zhirinovskiy's party headed by Aleksey Vedenkin, the LDPR leader's financial adviser, were in Berlin at the invitation of TFO. The DM13,600 went to keep them and 50,000 were transferred to Moscow. Now, through its lawyers in Moscow, the German trust agency is demanding that Zhirinovskiy return that sum to Germany. The LDPR categorically sweeps aside the trust agency's demands. They say our liberal democrats are not familiar with the TFO firm. Perhaps the FRG trust agency would not have managed to establish the true nature of the LDPR's relations with the TFO firm had it not been for one important circumstance. According to BERLINER ZEITUNG Werner Hirche, the firm's owner, has been "cooperating fruitfully" for several months now with the German law enforcement organs. With his aid the trust agency has managed to find our for sure how many German marks the Berlin company representative put into the accounts of his Russian partners in foreign banks. The trust agency has documents attesting that this sum was over Dm1 million. Thus, the accounts of Russian representatives in Luxembourg banks have been sequestered. They contain DM600,000 while a Prague bank contains DM840,000. All your IZVESTIYA correspondent's attempts to find out the names of the Russian citizens whose bank accounts have been sequestered in Luxembourg and Prague have failed. The BERLINER ZEITUNG editorial office and the trust agency had just one reply: Specific information relating to the questions you are asking about is not yet being made public. In accordance with the federal "data protection" law it is not permitted to cite specific names until the end of the investigation. Most likely they are known to the Moscow militia but not to the journalists in Berlin. The commission asserts that Hirche has already helped Germany to recover DM60 million. Hirche engaged in the "concealment" of Socialist Unity Party of Germany currency stocks. It was to him that the GDR's communist leaders entrusted part of their currency wealth. Hirche gave away to the commission the secret accounts of his former communist bosses in foreign banks. Hirche's truthfulness has thus been tested and his evidence is authentic. So Hirche's testimony that currency was transferred to Moscow for the election campaign of Zhirinovskiy's party and also the existence of the relevant financial documents looks convincing. It will be very, very hard to dismiss the meticulous German officials. The FRG mass media have taken up the LDPR leader in earnest and are beginning to investigate his "past and present with a fine toothcomb." The DM50,000 handed over to Zhirinovskiy belong to the German state and giving them to anyone is a crime.
