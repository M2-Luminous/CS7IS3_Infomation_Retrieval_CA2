For a little over a year since he assumed power as the president, the traitor Kim Yong-sam has persistently adhered to antireunification maneuvers, thus showing his ugly shape as a matchless national traitor and a most vicious separatist. Traitor Kim Yong-sam was exposed to have constantly waged anti-Republic confrontation commotions and provocative northward nuclear war exercises together with outside forces ever since he came into office. Thus, he has aggravated North-South relations. Besides, he blocked [chadan] all dialogue and exchanges between the North and the South and laid more grave obstacles on the road of reunification. In fact, this is an exorbitant unpardonable crime even greater than all of the separatist maneuvers committed by former South Korean dictators throughout the period of their political power. Just as the South Korean people have branded, the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is the most vicious antireunification separatist regime of all the successive regimes in South Korea. It is the treacherous enemy of North-South dialogue and peaceful reunification. This is proven by the fact that the rascals have totally blocked North-South dialogue which was held even during the previous periods of military dictatorship. Last year, we put forward the 10-point program of great unity of the whole country for national reunification, out of a desire to seek national reconciliation and unity and to expedite reunification in the nineties. We also put forward before the South Korean authorities, the issue on exchanging special envoys of top-level authorities between the two sides in order to discuss and solve pending problems, including the nuclear issue. People from all walks of life in South Korea said that only if the people follow the 10-point program, will the peaceful reunification which 70 million fellow countrymen ardently aspire after, be achieved. They expressed a firm determination to rise more vigorously in the reunification movement. However, traitor Kim Yong-sam, even after personally receiving our 10-point program for great unity of the whole country, rejected the magnanimous proposal of fellow countrymen for reconciliation and unity, and advanced the road toward confrontation and division against fellow countrymen. The Kim Yong-sam group totally froze North-South high-level talks and obstructed the exchange of special envoys between the two sides. Moreover, it confiscated letters we sent to South Korean authorities, representatives of political parties and public organizations, and figures from all walks of life in order to appeal for achieving reunification in the nineties with the united strength of the nation. By not even delivering the letters, the Kim Yong-sam group acted rashly. In a news conference marking the 100th day of his inauguration, the puppet traitor said that he cannot shake hands with a partner who has nuclear weapons, and in talks between heads of ruling and opposition parties, he raved that unless the nuclear problem is resolved, he cannot hold a summit. During the early stages of his power, the puppet traitor also made remarks on discussing the reunification issue, and improving relations with the North from the standpoint of being of one people, as though he were going to bring about a change of policy on North-South relations. However, all of his remarks were merely cunning, deceitful tactics designed to mislead public opinion at home and abroad. The Kim Yong-sam group viciously blocked not only dialogue between the authorities in the North and the South but also multilateral contacts between the North and the South, as well as reunification dialogue between peoples from all walks of life. Claiming that regardless of form, North-South contacts unapproved by the administration, cannot be tolerated, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam mercilessly oppressed youth, students and people from all walks of life who aspired to contact and hold dialogue with the North for reunification through collaboration with communists and with the North. As a result, last year's 12 June Panmunjom talks between youth and students from the North and the South, the fourth Seoul congress of the pannational meeting for national reunification, a soccer game between students from Pyongyang and Seoul, a bicycle race by students of the North and the South, and all other just advances of exchanges with South Korean youth, students, and people for national reconciliation, unity, and reunification, were suppressed and blocked. The puppet traitors blocked us from conveying our condolences for the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan in Seoul, and our plan to hold a working-level contact between Chondoist delegations from the North and the South at Panmunjom in order to jointly commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Kabo farmers' war. They blocked the condolence call by fellow countrymen and infringed upon the patriotic intention of the Chondoists of the North and the South. This is an act that can be committed only by such matchlessly wicked traitors and the most atrocious fascist tyrants as that of the Kim Yong-sam clique. Traitor Kim Yong-sam's antireunification color was eloquently illustrated in his theory on the uselessness of reunification which claimed that unless free democracy and market economy are guaranteed, reunification is worse than division. His antireunification nature was also clearly shown in his so-called three-stage reunification plan which assumes reunification of the system [chedo tongil], which may evoke confrontation and war between fellow countrymen, as a precondition for national reunification. Many South Korean people unanimously criticized traitor Kim Yong-sam's three-stage reunification plan as keeping intact the main point of the Korean people's commonwealth national reunification plan. In his New Year address and in the New Year press conference early this year, rascal Kim Yong-sam made no mention of reunification, and merely made provocative remarks slandering fellow countrymen. This suggests that traitor Kim Yong-sam will continually aggravate North-South relations this year, too, and will deny reunification. This also shows once again traitor Kim Yong-sam's true color as an antireunification element. All successive puppets in South Korea repeatedly committed maneuvers for national division. However, no group was as wicked and cunning as separatist maniacs as the Kim Yong-sam clique. Today, when all fellow countrymen unanimously rise as one in the patriotic reunification movement in order to make 1995 the first year for national reunification, the Kim Yong-sam group wields a bayonet against the people calling for national reconciliation and unity and totally froze North-South dialogue which existed even in times of military dictatorship. The crimes of the Kim Yong-sam group can never be pardoned. Neither North-South dialogue nor peaceful reunification of the nation can be achieved as long as the Kim Yong-sam clique remains intact. The Kim Yong-sam antireunification regime must immediately be overthrown so as to achieve independent and peaceful reunification of the nation, which all fellow countrymen aspire after. It is natural for the South Korean people to rise in the antigovernment struggle by shouting slogans, "Let us give a hard blow to the Kim Yong-sam separatist regime!" and "Let us cut the neck of the Kim Yong-sam clique, the enemy of reunification!" The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, the enemy of dialogue and reunification, cannot avoid a hard blow by the nation.
