Superficially and without going into details, he has responded to those who have dared to question the presence of these troops in the country. The U.S. troops are already in Juanchaco, but the debate on whether their presence should have received Senate approval is just beginning to get hot. [Begin Senator Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa recording] What is understood by the term troops is an armed and trained group under the command of an officer and the flag of a certain country. This is exactly what came to Colombia. [end recording] Notwithstanding, the president told Senators Fabio Valencia and Gustavo Rodriguez, who demanded an explanation, the construction of a school and a health center did not merit a report to the Senate. [Begin Senator Rodriguez recording] As a result of this theory or subterfuge by the president, which I believe is an effort to disregard the Constitution, we are yielding our national sovereignty to foreign troops, no more and no less. [end recording] In addition, the Defense Ministry explained the entry of U.S. troops is backed by a mutual assistance defense agreement signed in 1952. [Begin Carrizosa recording] The Constitution takes priority over any agreement signed by the Defense Ministry in 1952 and the Constitution demands permission from the Senate. [end recording] While the controversy continues, 259 U.S. soldiers are in various parts of the country working on construction projects in spite of the opposition.
