Who is responsible for the current crisis in Russia? [Rybkin] I believe we are all to be blamed for that, but the intelligentsia more than others. Even though it started perestroyka, it did not present a concrete program for work. We have lost nine years with the search for it -- and we have not been successful up to now. Why not? Precisely 70 years ago even the Bolshevik economic experts managed to stabilize the country within a few months! However, they were all shot later. [Rybak] Today the Duma and the president are calling for harmony. Does this mean that the various political forces no longer want to blame each other? [Rybkin] It costs enormous time and energy to be constantly looking for someone to blame. And we do not have any time anymore, we must concentrate on overcoming the profound crisis. [Rybak] How do you want to do that? [Rybkin] We must regain control over the economy. The state companies must be controlled by the state again -- just as in Germany. The private sector must be expanded and its share in the overall product must be increased. The Duma should primarily prepare laws that are necessary for overcoming the economic crisis. Then we need laws that ensure the development of a rule-of-law state in Russia: Laws about citizenship, the Constitutional Court, the penal code, the election law. [Rybak] You were the driving force behind the Duma's decision on amnesty. If the released extremists, like Aleksandr Barkashov or Viktor Anpilov once again strive for confrontation, as they are already announcing, would you feel personally responsible? [Rybkin] If these people once again stage brawls, fighting, and all kinds of Russian gladiator games in the streets, to amuse other countries, we, the Duma, the president, and I myself, will put these people behind bars again. Then nothing will help them anymore. [Rybak] Several Duma deputies recently said that deposing the president is their roost important goal. Is the call for harmony not also to be seen as an admission of helplessness by the opposition? According to the new Constitution, the president is backed by the Army, the police... [Rybkin] The acceptance of the Constitution on 12 December 1993 was a vote by the people for the president. Therefore, I consider all calls for the ousting of the president as political cock-crows. Now we must sit down together and work, even if this may be difficult for many people. However, this is expected of us in all towns and villages in Russia. There are many people who can just shout and not work. This applies both to rightist and leftist fringe groups. [Rybak] When the Supreme Soviet was dissolved on 21 September 1993, Boris Yeltsin announced early presidential elections this year. Will the Duma insist on that? [Rybkin] The Duma has no right to do so. In the Constitution it says clearly: The president remains in office until the end of his term -- and this is 12 June 1996. [Rybak] In Yeltsin's speech on the state of the nation at the end of February new tones were heard -- away from the shock therapy, turning toward Greater Russian imperialism. Has Yeltsin's policy changed or is all this political tactic? [Rybkin] I believe that the president simply analyzed the mood in the society and reacted to it. This is done by any head of state. [Rybak] The president's administration uses any opportunity to humiliate the Duma. Does this not give rise to feelings of revanche among the deputies? [Rybkin] I do not share this opinion. The Duma cooperates closely with all structures of the president, with the government, and with the Federation Council. Possibly, there are a few exceptions, people who have not been able to overcome the events of the past months and want to put a fire under the president's behind again and again. [Rybak] The politicians speak of harmony, the people are suffering. Could mass protests not throw the country into a civil war? [Rybkin] This danger exists. However, I believe that our appeals have a positive effect. The people are fed up with these power struggles at the top. They want social peace. The energy that is lost in the power struggles is needed somewhere else. Among the people it is said: In Russia so much energy is wasted for whistling that the locomotive does not start moving. [Rybak] Will the opposition not make use of this explosive situation to grab power? [Rybkin] Parties are founded to come to power. Perhaps this time again someone will try to grab control of the helm. However, I would not advise anyone to do this, because no single party would be able to lead the country out of the crisis. [Rybak] A power struggle has broken out between Moscow and the regions. Can this lead to national conflicts? [Rybkin] The center must give up part of its power to the regions. It is simply impossible to rule such an enormous country centrally. In Germany this is understood very well -- the laender have a certain independence. We have 89 regions; they should elect their governors themselves. Today the governors are often hated, the people break out in a rash when they just see them.
