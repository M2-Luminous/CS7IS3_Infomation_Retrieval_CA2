This is the view shared by some well-known foreign personages who participated in the 1994 China summit which opened in Beijing Wednesday. In his speech entitled "Global Multilateral Trading System: The Role of the People's Republic of China", Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), said that there was no doubt that China's reform starting from the late 1970s has yielded good results. "The reforms have given a far greater role to market forces and have led to a rapid liberalization of its foreign trade regime," he said, adding that the Chinese people have benefited from the reforms too. "I am sure that producers, traders and consumers the world over, including those in China, are keen to see full implementation of these and other announced reforms," he said. Great changes have taken place just after the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round multilateral trade negotiation, and on the eve of the establishment of the new World Trade Organization (WTO), the director-general said. He pointed out that the reforms would help China to finish the negotiations on the terms and conditions for its rejoining GATT as early as possible, and to become one of the initial member states of WTO. "China's ambitious program of trade and economic reforms has contributed greatly to bringing China more closely into line with the world trading system," he said. "Observing the Chinese economy in the process of reform, one sees that China is essentially doing autonomously what the WTO would in any case oblige it to do." "Given the magnitude of China's economy and the likelihood that China will assume a leading role in shaping the global economic environment of the next century, I think it to be of critical importance that close attention be paid to the manner in which China proceeds with its full integration into this newly-strengthened multilateral trading system. "China's membership would increase the universality of the multilateral trading system and in other respects reflect positively on the evolution of international relations." Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed said in his speech that Southeast Asia should have no fear of a wealthy and strong China. In contrast, "the Southeast Asian countries would benefit from a huge market at their doorsteps" since the demands of China would increase tremendously with its development, he said. A stable environment is necessary for Asian countries to catch up with the Western developed ones, Mahathir said, adding that China had set a good example for other countries in this regard. "An anarchic situation is neither going to facilitate the growth and flowering of a free market, nor help the transition from a command economy to a market economy," he said. Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, said in his speech that the World Bank would continue to support China in deepening its reform. Since the quality and stability of the economic growth is one of the important elements that would shape China's future, he said, the World Bank would finance China in support of macroeconomic stability, reform of state-owned enterprises, improvement of the infrastructure, environmental protection and the development of its poor areas. The World Bank has been China's partner in its reform drive, he said. Till now, the bank has supported 130 projects in China, involving accumulated finances of over 16 billion U.S. dollars. Former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said in his speech entitled "China and the world" that China was playing a more important role in current world affairs and economic and trade exchanges, and in 20 years, China would become an economic giant. For this reason, he said, all important world organizations including GATT should accept it. In order to fulfill its target, Schmidt said, China should be stable at home and upgrade its infrastructures to empower people in the inland and the countryside, as well as controlling inflation. He also pointed out that the United States should not interfere in China's internal affairs and that it is not wise to stop China's most favored nation status.
