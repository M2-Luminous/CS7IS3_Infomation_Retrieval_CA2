"Estonian military authorities together with Russian officials will go over the lists and permit applications and, if everything tallies, the documents will be stamped for registration," Tikk said. The stamp allows Russian military to move freely in Paldiski during the dismantling of the nuclear reactors when control over persons staying there will be stepped up. Tikk said the command of Russia's 144th motorized rifle division and the Baltic Fleet are supposed to present similar lists, since some officers serving in those units live in Paldiski. At a meeting with Russian officials on Tuesday [22 March] the two parties agreed that family members of the Russian military living in Paldiski as well as their cars will be registered and that lists of officers and seamen will be given to Estonian authorities. Tikk said about 600 Russian military are currently stationed in Paldiski. "We are not entirely satisfied with the compromise, but there's no other solution at present," Tikk said. "On the basis of the lists we are to get we shall issue the Russian military with temporary permits for moving about in Paldiski. We hope the lists can be trusted."
