After the disappearance of the Soviet Union, that is, after the severely impaired might of the second superpower, this balance also disappeared. Unfortunately, the setting of the new balance of powers is being tested on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This is where many values and principles of an epoch have been failing. This is where the principles from Helsinki and the principles of the CSCE have failed. This is where international law has failed. The United Nations could also be buried on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, this institution that -- despite many problems -- has had the greatest authority in the world for half a century. Since the beginning of the Yugoslav crisis, there has been evidence that the United Nations does not have the inner strength to be up to the task. Instead of its own authority, this organization that used to be respected -- and, pathos aside, looked up to with hope by a large part of humankind -- has become only a shield and an instrument of the most powerful countries in the West, primarily the United States. The latest decision of Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to allow Turkish troops into Bosnia within the UN peacekeepers is the most obvious indication that the United Nations is no longer capable of abiding by its own principles. The attitude that the neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia, and countries that historically represented occupying forces here, cannot come as peacekeepers has been ignored. The reactions of Bulgaria and Greece best show what a danger that is to peace not only in former Yugoslavia, but in the entire Balkans. Bulgaria and Greece this time reacted in their own interests. The Security Council is setting a new time bomb, is the reaction in Bulgaria. Greek Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis says that one cannot at the same time be a participant in a clash and the keeper of peace in that clash. This is completely unreasonable, illogical, and dangerous, the Greek defense minister stresses. A question arises here: Do the most powerful in the international community care about peace in the former Yugoslavia? We have in fact been all along witnesses to a double game, the apparent search for peace and the search for ways to avoid peace. Every time it seemed that peace was at hand, there was parallel action aimed at having the war continue. Therefore the stories that the key to peace lies in Serbia, Yugoslavia, or the Serbian side are stories for the hostile or the politically illiterate and uninformed. In the shadow of the sensational decision to allow Turkish troops into Bosnia, Germany is creeping back into the Balkans, true, only politically so far. What does the administration of Mostar by the Germans mean? Just the above. Is it not the future of the former Yugoslav republics gradually to fall under the administration of foreign powers under the excuse of bringing peace, which is an age-old political excuse? Because of that hypocrisy -- the parallel search for peace and the instigation of war -- and to hide that hypocrisy from the their public and voters, those who conduct such a policy need political lies in the world media. But how to explain that to the world public, when the rich managers and brainwashers of that same public manipulate that very public with their media? [passage omitted] The world has finally understood that Serbia is not an aggressor, but that apart from the others, Serbs, too, live in the former Croatia and the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite that, the world is gradually learning that the departure of the Serbs from the countries imposed on them by force is not the creation of greater Serbia but a constitution of a smaller Yugoslavia, in continuation of the country that existed for 70 years. [sentence as heard] After all, that is the right that has been given to others, the right that was given to all the nations by United Nations itself. One more time: Is the United Nations to meet the fate of the League of Nations, its predecessor from between the two world wars, which was destroyed by the power struggle between the great powers?
