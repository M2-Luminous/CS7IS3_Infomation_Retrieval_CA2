In a statement to AL-AHRAM, which the paper will publish tomorrow, Wednesday, Velayati denied that his country has assisted any terrorist group in Egypt or Algeria. He also denied that Iran is holding Egyptian prisoners since the Iraq-Iran war. All Egyptian prisoners were handed over to Egypt, he said. Velayati invited the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates [UAE] to visit Tehran to continue the peaceful dialogue on the future of the three UAE islands. This dialogue stopped about a year ago. Velayati said: If there is a solution to this problem, then it must be found through peaceful dialogue. But if one side tries to get others involved in the situation or internationalize the issue, then this side will lose more. The Iranian foreign minister expressed his belief that the security of the Gulf region starts with economic, political, and security cooperation, but he admitted that the essence of this idea has not been discussed. Velayati said that Iran's spending on armaments, considering the population, is less than that of any country in the region. He said Iran spends only 4 percent of its budget on arms.
