E. Gamza, first secretary of the Amur Regional Committee, V. V. Grishukov, first secretary of the Maritime Territorial Committee, and L. A. Golub, first secretary of the Khabarovsk Territorial Committee, of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, staying in Korea. The joint statement says the smear campaign launched by the western media at the instigation of the ruling quarters of capitalist countries is aimed at concealing the nuclear ambition of the Japanese militarist forces and the South Korean ruling quarters which are stepping up the production of nuclear weapons in secrecy. Through such vilifications, the aggressive forces of the United States, Japan and South Korea are seeking to take the edge off the successes made by the Korean people in socialist construction under the guidance of the great Comrade Kim Il-song, before the world public opinion and to tay a foundation for openly destroying the triumphant socialism of Korea, the statement charges. It stresses that they would conduct brisk activities for rousing the entire far eastern people in Russia to positively support and encourage the Korean people's struggle.
