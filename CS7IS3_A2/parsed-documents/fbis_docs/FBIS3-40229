The principle of the optical implementation of the four-function exchange-switch and Omega network via an 8-pixel liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (LCSLM) and special polarizing prisms is discussed in detail. The optical system and experimental results with twisted-nematic liquid crystal plates are given. Figures 1, 3, 4, and 6, reproduced below, show an Omega interconnection network (P.S. = perfect shuffle, A-L are the twelve 2 x 2 switches), a schematic diagram of the optical Omega network with four-function optical exchange-switch (I and II are polarizing optical prisms, lines AB and CD indicate polarizing films, C[.sup]0[/] and C[.sub]4[/] are two of the eight pixels in the LCSLM, and PB[.sup]1[/] and PB[.sub]2[/] are prism blocks), the four states of the exchange-switch corresponding to the different states of the liquid-crystal pixels, and a schematic diagram of the optical Omega interconnection network with four-function optical exchange-switch arrays, respectively. Figures 2, 5, and 7, not reproduced, show a simple schematic of a four-function exchange switch, five photographs (input light-beam permutation, left P.S. connection, right P.S. connection, down-spread connection, and up-spread connection) of the experimental results for the four-function optical exchange-switch, and five photographs of the experimental results for the optical Omega network with four-function optical exchange-switch, respectively. There are no tables. Figure 1. The Omega Interconnection Network (N = 8) Figure 3. Schematic Diagram of Optical Omega Network With Four-Function Optical Exchange-Switch Figure 4.
