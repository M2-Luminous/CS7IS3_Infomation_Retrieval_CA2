The admission and recognition of the extremely complicated effects of the crisis that started in the middle of the 1970's, the efforts to ensure the survival of an additional 60,000 mouths to feed each year, and administrative efforts to implement "new economic mechanisms" further exacerbated economic difficulties and brought them to the surface. The wages paid under conditions of very low production levels and the granting of some limited freedoms to state enterprises increased imports and caused a significant increase in the budget deficit (15 percent of the gross domestic product in 1990 and 25 percent in 1991). Albania's involvement in currency transactions also led to the creation of a foreign debt of $500 million, adding to the country's isolation by cutting it off from the world's financial institutions. After 1991, all means of obtaining foreign credit were in practice closed. When the democratic government came to power in April 1992, it immediately undertook a comprehensive program guided by the policy of moving to a market economy. In implementing this program, the government used all its intellectual energies to stabilize all the necessary macroeconomic indicators with its privatization and its legal recognition of new allies in economic life: the struggle against inflation, the control of the budget deficit, and the establishment of a tax system based on the market economy. To enforce this program, considerable help was secured from abroad in many different ways, from the European Community and the "Stand-By" agreement with the IMF, whose success made possible in July 1993 the signing of an agreement in support of the medium-term economic reform program, as well as a World Bank loan. Besides this help, many other states also gave free help with food, development plans, and technical assistance. Italy, Greece, the United States, Germany, Turkey, and the other G-24 countries carried the main burden of this. At first, the government concentrated on its policy of gradual macroeconomic stabilization and of establishing control of the main financial indicators as the sole way of promoting economic growth. Now that the main part of the program has been implemented, visible progress is evident in reaching its principal objectives. The severe fall in production has been halted, mainly reflecting the significant response of agriculture to price reforms and privatization. Spiraling inflation has been reversed and the government's budget deficit has been significantly reduced from 40 percent of the gross domestic product at the start of the economic stabilization program to less than 10 percent in the first half of 1993. This is the result of the enforcement of strict discipline in expenditure, which shows that the process of reducing the budget deficit is continuing, despite constant demands for expenditure and to create and sustain a social welfare network for those most affected by the transition period. In greater detail, expenditure has been made in several main directions: 1. The application of a social policy through an institutional network and a range of economic and social mechanisms, such as unemployment benefit, widening the basis of welfare assistance, and increasing pay and pensions in education and health. 2. Increasing budget expenditure for investments, including a fund of 4 billion leks for the restructuring and support of enterprises. 3. Price subsidies for a range of staple goods of household consumption. At the same time, monetary policy has been conducted in accordance with the objectives of the general anti-inflation program, the balance of payments, and development. The level of inflation is now considered to be within the limits of the program. From March this year, it has fluctuated around an average of 0.5 percent a month, with the exception of July, when an increase arose from the change in bread and flour prices, and September when there was a relative rise because of the administrative increase of some controlled prices. The rate of money circulation rose from 1.7 in 1992 to 2.1 in 1993. The reestablishment of control over the principal financial indicators led to the stabilization of the lek, which, after its fall in 1992 to 130 leks to the dollar, rose gradually to 85 leks to the dollar in August 1992. Since then, the lek has declined gradually and is now stabilized at 99 leks to one U.S. dollar. The private sector's share of bank credit has grown from 12 percent in December 1992 to 30 percent. Nevertheless, this is a relatively small proportion because of the institutional shortcomings of the banks and the private sector credit network. Significant advances have been made in the enforcement of pricing policy and the reduction of budget subsidies. Wholesale and retail prices have in general been freed. Nevertheless, control is being maintained over 25 items, such as wheat, bread, and certain non food-items, such as water, electricity, bus transportation, and schoolbooks. Although the prices for these latter items have risen several times, they still do not cover costs. The policy of price rises aims to remove the obstacles to increasing the production of goods that are currently imported. A visible result of this policy has been the reduction of price subsidies from 3.3 percent of the gross domestic product in 1993 to 2.2 percent in 1992. In agriculture, the government's attention has concentrated on privatizating and restructuring the state farms, completing the reform of the prices of agricultural products, repairing the rural infrastructure, and privatizating the distribution and processing enterprises. The World Rank and other donors have closely collaborated in this reform. The priorities have been to privatize and restructure the state farms and to increase the prices of agricultural inputs approximately to the level of the equivalent imports. I wish to emphasize here that the measures to transform the Agricultural Development Bank into a new kind of body entirely subject to the Bank Law are of particular importance for the role this bank will play in supporting the restructuring of agriculture. Many enterprises remain in a difficult situation in an industry dominated by state enterprises. Many of them are closed or operating at below full productive capacity, incurring major losses in almost all sectors. Lack of financial discipline, failure to adapt to the market economy, and budget restrictions led to an accumulation of debts between enterprises. The life expectancy of several large sectors of Albanian industry is uncertain without deep and painful restructuring and an influx of foreign investment. For this reason, the government created the Enterprise Restructuring Agency, which has direct responsibility for about 30 key enterprises that present the most serious problems, and of whom the majority are loss-making. The goal of this agency is to restructure these enterprises, enabling decisions to be made concerning their future within one or two years, with the aim of turning them into effective enterprises, later privatizing them, liquidating them, or selling their assets. Within financial constraints, the government's program supports the infrastructure, on the basis of a general assessment that the larger part of Albania's public infrastructure will not suffice to develop a modern economy or encourage investments in various branches of the economy. Although the transportation system has been judged to be adequately extensive, it falls far short of the necessary quality standards and has deteriorated to a degree that it hampers economic development. One of the government's priorities is to repair the main roads and to extend roads in mountainous areas. One positive indication of the fast development of the transportation sector is the private sector's domination of inter- urban and international passenger and freight traffic. Albania's telecommunication infrastructure is extremely limited. As part of a master plan, it is forecast that a $30-million program financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, ltaly, Switzerland, and Austria will be carried out, making it possible to restructure this sector. It is planned to obtain resources to quickly introduce modern telecommunications systems as a necessary precondition for attracting investors and tourists. There have been significant improvements in construction, both in the towns and the countryside, mainly carried out by private investors. In order to cover the shortage of housing and to improve the existing housing stock, the government has aimed to increase the role of the private sector and to reduce costs. The law as approved has been implemented, leading to the fast privatization of the housing stock. In order to encourage private housing construction, the rents of recently constructed dwellings have been deregulated. Work has resumed to complete half-finished apartments, and 1,452 of these apartments have been completed and handed over. During this period, investments to the tune of 713 million leks have been made. Private investors have constructed 8,401 dwellings amd 24,090 business premises in the countryside, and many others are under way. The privatization program has aimed to encourage private initiative in two main directions: the creation of private enterprise in all sectors of the economy, without restriction, and the privatization of state property. In the second field, besides the priority privatization of the retail sector enterprises, handicrafts, road transportation, construction, the food industry, and light industry, it was planned that enterprises and plants in the industrial sector (mainiy small- scale enterprises and production lines) would also be privatized by the end of 1993. In the course of this program, 25,432 privatization deals have now been concluded, covering 9,000 retail stores, 4,500 service premises, 4,000 deals in transportation, 5,000 in agriculture, and 2,800 in other sectors. More than 100,000 people are now employed in the private sector. The Privatization Law has been revised to accelerate the process of privatization within the strategic framework. The authorities directly involved in privatization have been reorganized, and an incentive fiscal policy has been adopted. The laws on the bankruptcy of enterprises and on the restitution and compensation of property are expected to exert a positive influence in this direction. Despite the objective difficulties that are emerging, every effort is being made to implement the compensation policy through compulsory orders and to create opportunities for those benefiting to take part in the privatization process. Suitable legislation for a market economy is being passed quickly. Parliament has approved a law on retail firms, a law on the Albanian bank, a bankruptcy law, an accountancy law, labor legislation, and a very liberal foreign investment law that facilitates the registration procedure and, most importantly, consistently refers disputes to international law. The tax and customs laws have been entirely reformulated in accordance with the principles of the market economy. The increase of investments through the introduction of foreign capital is one of the most important paths toward economic revival. Despite the problems that have arisen, interest among foreign firms and investors to come to Albania is visibly growing. Estimates show that firms with an initial capital of $50 million, and contracted capital of $100 million, have signed contracts and begun work. Different firms making a total investment of $70 million are also expected to begin work on the basis of contracts that have been concluded. The government is making increasing efforts to create an attractive climate for foreign investors. Foreign investors are not subject to capital controls and are free to transfer their profits. Tax-free status for four years is also offered to all investors in the productive sector, with extensions of this period for firms that reinvest and those who invest in tourism. Moreover, investors will benefit from liberal customs concessions for those articles that will be used for investment purposes. Foreigners may now lease land for 99 years at a very favorable rate and may also buy this land for certain projects. The imminent approval of the civil code will permit private land ownership and the rights stemming from this ownership will give fresh encouragement for foreign investors to come to Albania.
