Mr. Speaker; deputies; the holding of the first session of your respected house, which coincides with the 9 April anniversary, has more than one significance. [passage omitted] As a gesture of a pledge to those pure martyrs, those brave people, those militants and those who fought for the goals of the country; and as the best greetings and honor that one can give them, we should all be at the level of national responsibility, and at the level of the trust that the people placed in us by electing us. We should place the people's interests above all other considerations, and we should work continuously to realise their ambitions and aspirations within the framework of justice, dignity, solidarity and stability, within the principles and the visions laid down in the 7 November Declaration, which we have been implementing gradually, a policy that has resulted in a number of achievements and gains for our people. [passage omitted] Your duties, which you will carry out in this chamber, will enable you to closely view all things concerned with the political, economic and social course of this country. Your participation in the regional assemblies will enable you to be absolutely informed about the realities of your areas and the expectations of the people. In both cases, it will help you to follow up the government's activities in all fields and to enrich the contents of plans and proposed budgets with your contributions and clarifications. [passage omitted] Ladies and gentlemen, because of the differences in your party affiliations, the multiparty system -- for the first time -- has materialized in the Chamber of Deputies. It was a fundamental choice made available by the policies we followed since the move for change to establish democracy and pluralism. We stressed in the 7 November declaration that our people are worthy of a developed political life, truely based on multiparties and popular organizations. From this context, we developed laws and institutions in line with the society's development. Your election took place in the shadow of democracy, transparency, civilized behavior and under the administration's total neutrality. And so, pluralism has found its way into this chamber. [passage omitted] In the new stage we will work on consolidating the foundations of a civil society, entrenching democracy, strengthening human rights by disseminating its values and spreading it, assuring legal guarantees for everyone so that they may practise their freedoms in the widest scope given to them by law, respond to the requisites of justice, and ensure balance and cohesiveness of society. Today, after the people have had their say and have chosen their representatives, the influence of every person in the political sphere has become apparent to all. There is no scope, outside these institutions and organizations, for anyone to speak in the name of the people except those who have the right to represent them or sectors of society. They, alone, are the ones qualified to do this. The state of law, whose foundations we established and strengthened, does not solely mean the state's respect for the law, but also means respect for it by everyone -- individuals, groups, organizations, institutions. We will also stand firm in the face of any outlaw employing any slogan. We will also not allow anyone who finds excuses in the name of freedom and human rights to cause damage to the homeland, distort its reputation or harm its relations with brothers and friends. Each citizen has the right to defend his freedom and rights, and we will be the first to listen to him, to remove the grievances which could be imposed on him, and to enable him to obtain his rights in full and preserve his dignity, because we consider guaranteeing rights and protecting values to be a duty and a responsibility. Our country is organized; it has its own institutions and bodies which have the capacity to guarantee all freedoms and rights, be it political, civil or humanitarian. It is the responsibility of each quarter, body or individual, including human rights societies, to work toward respecting the law, implement it in all cases and to protect the rights of the group and its interests, and not to demand the suspension of the laws and search for reasons for infringements, or restrict oneself for defending whoever makes vocational errors and deliberately breaks the law for a selfish interest or personal purpose which he would make an issue for the people and the country. Among the practices which simply indicate a feeling of inferiority and self-hate, is the initiative of some who issue statements directly to the foreign media as though they are seeking support against their country or appeal for assistance against it. Honorable deputies, ladies and gentlemen. International institutions and agencies have praised our success and have renewed their readiness to cooperate with us. We have managed to clinch the confidence of private monetary institutions, which forge no deals except on the basis of the productivity and effectiveness of a partner. They have no other considerations. These monetary bodies would not do this if they had not found credibility and guarantees, seriousness and stability in our country, which encouraged them to make such deals. All objective foreign media, for its part, also did not hesitate to praise our country's achievements in all fields, accomplished day after day. When it does this it balances between the positive and negative aspects. We welcome it and follow what it writes with interest. We do not care what some foreign media has persisted in pursuing in an attempt to harm Tunisia's honor and undermine its sovereignty by publishing biased reports containing insults and slanders. It has opened its pages to some people who claim they belong to the world of journalism, or to some journalists whose nostalgia for the colonialist period has not abated and whose feelings of animosity and domination have not dwindled. Such newspapers have no place in Tunisia, and doing away with them is very easy because of the spread of objective newspapers and other means of communication. The same is true of some nongovernmental organizations which have also not ceased claiming that they are mandated -- in the name of human rights or freedom of the press -- to discuss our laws, investigate how far we have implemented them. Others want to carry out referendums and opinion polls, and to publish only what pleases them, which is restricted in mentioning the shortcomings, or making up these shortcomings if they cannot find any. Our country is not a laboratory or a test field, and is not in the custody of anyone. [applause] Some countries deliberately shelter some Tunisian terrorists and do not hesitate to enable them to obtain asylum despite the decisive evidence and the firm rulings which we presented to those countries against those people. Some of these countries open their official media channels for thee terrorists and present them as victims of human rights and wasted freedoms. Those responsible for these actions would only be convinced by either of two ways: Either we embark on preplanned courses and enter ready made models in which they want to squeeze us and become like excellent pupils, with all the belittling aspects implied in this formula, or we admit to them that we are underdeveloped and our laws are confined and become subject matter for their pens and clubs. Every successful person is envied. Were it not that our country was distinct, nobody would pay attention to it. Some quarters are offended by our success and envy us for it. They do not understand how we can carry out the necessary reforms, achieve distinguished gains and live in security and stability, and how we can succeed and be safe in matters where others have not succeeded and become safe despite the differences in the conditions and capabilities. What essentially concerns us is our people's trust and their rallying around their system, their choices, and our trust in ourselves. We derive all this from the purity of our intention, the sincerity of our determination, the soundness of the accord program we are following, the importance of the gains we are achieving and from the prospects which unite between reality and the aspirations which we open before our country and people. [passage omitted: recalls election campaign and says current parliament will work toward achieving the pledges made]
