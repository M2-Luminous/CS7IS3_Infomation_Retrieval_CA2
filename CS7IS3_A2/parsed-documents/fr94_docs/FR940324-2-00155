The National Endowment for Children's Educational Television was established by The Children's Television Act of 1990, Public Law No. 101&hyph;437, 104 Stat. 996 (1990) (codified at 47 U.S.C. 394 (1991)). Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) 11.551; The National Endowment for Children's Educational Television. Program Description NECET Background NECET funds are intended to support the creation and production of children's television programming that is specifically directed toward the development of fundamental intellectual skills. In so doing, NECET's efforts are intended to supplement children's educational programming that is funded by other governmental entities. Congress directed that NECET be administered by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary, in turn, has delegated this responsibility to the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, who serves as the Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The Children's Television Act of 1990 stipulates that, during the first two years following project completion, NECET-funded programming may be offered for distribution only to noncommercial public television stations. After the initial two-year period, NECET-funded programming may be made available to commercial media as well, including broadcast television networks and stations, and cable television networks and systems. The 1990 Act authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, under certain circumstances, to modify some aspects of these distribution requirements. Through the 1990 Act, Congress sought to ensure that commercial television entities would have at their disposal a growing pool of high-quality programming appropriate for a children's audience that would be available at an affordable cost. Accordingly, the 1990 Act authorizes the Secretary to offer NECET-funded programs to commercial television stations and cable television systems at a rate designed to encourage these entities to air such programming. NECET Objectives For the FY 1994 grant round, NECET has three major objectives that applicants should consider when preparing their submissions.
