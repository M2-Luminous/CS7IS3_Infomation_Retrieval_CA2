From foreign sources, the perception of the nonstrategic component of the French nuclear force has periodically been put forth as a justification for the refusal to participate, with full confidence, in the building of a secure Europe with Paris as the motivating force and guarantor of stability, based on its minimal strategic deterrent capacity. From the historical point of view, and apart from the transition from the concept of a warning shot as a test to that of a final warning that must have its own military efficiency, the prestrategic doctrine has undergone many fluctuations. However, certain French politicians and experts, including Jacques Chirac and Francois Heisbourg, have finally advanced the idea of carrying out the final warning on the very territory of the aggressor. While this proposed method has the advantage of avoiding collateral damage to close allies and of being entirely attributable (the opponent's radar would determine precisely who was responsible for the ground-to-ground shot), confusion could develop about the distinction between a warning shot and a strategic shot, with consequences one can readily imagine. Paradoxically, this desire to make the final warning dependent on a strike of strategic range had the effect of stripping the principle of tactical nuclear warning of its legitimacy. If the Hades can no longer be the potential basis for the building of a secure Europe, and if French doctrinal specificity in the prestrategic realm has never resolved the basic contradiction between the political message of the atom and nuclear support of tactical maneuvers, France today must approach the doctrine of the prestrategic warning strike in a different way. Nuclear weapons today are undergoing a veritable conceptual and doctrinal revolution that is being given further impetus by the reduction in military budgets. This change is operating in two main directions. First of all, we are seeing a rebirth of the strategic level. In other words, a considerable number of so-called tactical conventional weapons will in the end be used within a strategic framework, while in the nuclear sector, their counterparts with a limited range of action in the nuclear sector will have to be enhanced to give them greater range, or they will vanish from the military landscape. The second trend is toward conventional weapons and polyvalence in the weapons systems previously assigned an exclusively nuclear capacity. Based on the lessons of the Gulf war, the numerous stages of infrastrategic nuclear deterrence might be replaced by conventional deterrence through the use of strategies based on strikes from a distance, preventive strikes, and classic long-distance strategic strikes. Tactical nuclear weapons are being replaced by high-precision classic weapons with very powerful explosive charges--MLRS [multiple rocket launchers], FAE [fuel air explosive] bombs, bombs with a zone-saturation effect, and conventional cruise missiles. These replacements are capable of achieving the same results in the field, while they also eliminate the problem of certain undesirable effects, both immediate and deferred, such as unacceptable collateral damage, residual radioactivity, and political and philosophical criticisms. With the effort to ensure greater polyvalence for its prestrategic aerial vectors, France should be able to approach the problem of the warning strike today with greater flexibility. The emergence of a multipolar world makes an update the "three-circle" strategy and a review of the doctrine and the needs related to the prestrategic strike necessary. The goal is indeed a transition from such a specifically East-West warning to an "all-points" strategy. This requirement for flexible use is only met by the cruise missile. Where the strategic nuclear weapon would continue to serve as life insurance for the vital interests of France, the conventional weapons for retaliation, which are less powerful but more accurate, would have the task of conveying warning messages on more tolerable, but equally effective, levels. At the intermediary level, a high-altitude warning strike in the form of EMP [electromagnetic pulse] charges would provide earlier protection of the vital interests of France, making clear the possibility, as an entirely last resort, of strategic nuclear intervention in the event that this deterrent measure failed. There is nothing to prevent the establishment of a new French prestrategic concept based on conventional weapons. At a time when nuclear weapons cannot cover all of the risks with which France might be faced, and when its vital interests at the heart of the nation are less and less threatened, in the military sense, it becomes desirable to organize the conventional resources and to extend their use to strategic missions. In addition, conventional warning weapons are better suited to a sharp, precise, and very meaningful blow delivered within a context that is no longer exclusively East-West, but multidirectional, with strategic and political-military goals that have high priority but are less and less vital, in that they do not in any way involve a threat to the national survival of continental France. The use of conventional weapons for a prestrategic strike would also have the advantage of simultaneously preventing the disproportionate use of weapons, by limiting the process to the reasonable conventional level, as well as facilitating speedier coercive and classic warning strikes without the danger of escalation to extreme measures. It will from now on be a matter of a conventional deterrent that is credible because it is practical, as distinguished from nuclear deterrence based on the nonuse of the weapon. At a time when the new British defense white paper, "Defending Our Future," which came out last July, has raised further questions raised about the nuclear air-to-ground missile that was to replace the WE-177 gravity bombs, and which was to be the possible focus of cooperation with France or the United States, it is probable that Paris cannot avoid a redefinition of prestrategic nuclear missions. With the probable disappearance of chemical weapons toward the year 2000, the elimination of a large part of the American-Russian nuclear theater and tactical weapons, as well as the reductions in the strategic realm resulting from the START [Spacecraft Technology and Advanced Reentry Tests] treaties, the remaining nuclear potential will increasingly be considered in terms of the logic of nonwar, within a context of "existential deterrence," thus being reduced to a subsidiary and residual role. Following this new definition, the high-technology conventional weapons will be able to acquire a deterrent capacity that, unlike that of nuclear weapons, can be more easily adapted to conflict situations of low or moderate intensity. Today, clarification and the placing of nuclear instruments and pertinent doctrine in proper perspective are needed. In France, the drafting of the white paper and the military planning law expected this coming spring should favor this new strategic approach, setting aside certain contingencies and taboos.
