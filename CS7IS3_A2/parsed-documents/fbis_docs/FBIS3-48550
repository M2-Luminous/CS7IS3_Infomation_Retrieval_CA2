Edward S. Neymark [spelling of name as received], chief of the aircraft industry department at the Russian Federation State Committee for Defense Industries, said such cooperation would benefit both countries. The Russian aerospace industry is faced with an urgent need to convert to commercial use due to military spending cuts. Neymark was speaking at a press conference in a Tokyo hotel after meeting officials in charge of aircraft manufacturing at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Neymark said he told MITI officials that Russia is ready to cooperate with Japan in any aerospace field ranging from electronic parts to joint development of a 600-seat passenger airliner. The Russian official is visiting Japan following a memorandum signed last May between the Japanese and Russian aerospace industries to promote bilateral relations and personnel exchanges.
