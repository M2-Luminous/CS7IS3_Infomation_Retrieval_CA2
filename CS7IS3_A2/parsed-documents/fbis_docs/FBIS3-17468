At a press conference Thursday [24 March], the premier said budget receipts were too small lately to increase salaries and pensions, however the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of Social Security were commissioned this week to consider possibilities to increase payments April 1. "The step is very hard in some aspects, especially considering preparations for the inevitable negative consequences of introducing the value-added tax." The government increased budget salaries and pensions nine times in 1993 and once this year. The premier said the new gas and electricity prices will most probably be introduced when the heating season ends. Slezevicius said electricity prices must be increased because the Ignalina nuclear power plant has to use much more expensive nuclear fuel cartridges. One cartridge costs 60,000 U.S. dollars and the plant needs 90 million dollars a year, he said. Slezevicius said electricity prices remained stabile for nearly a year. In his words, electricity bills now make up only an insignificant part of an average family budget. The press conference that Slezevicius attended was devoted to a continuing political dispute over the appointment of Vytautas Skuodis to head the Lithuanian genocide investigation center. The premier said he will "initiate" an investigation of facts suggesting that documents were stolen from the former KGB building in Vilnius in 1991-1992. "This of course should have been done earlier, but it is better to do it now than never."
