Representatives from Russia and the Baltic states "simply have to gather together and constructively resolve problems inherited from their common past," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told a news conference in Moscow on Thursday. According to him, Russia "has the impression that some Baltic politicians believe that they can ensure their national interests by means of confrontation with Russia." This is "a great delusion," Churkin noted. "They can protect their sovereignty in real terms only by building relations of partnership with Russia. Russia acts in precisely this way, and it hopes that this kind of approach will triumph," the deputy foreign minister said. Speaking about the presence of Russian troops in the Baltic countries, Churkin said that Russia has already withdrawn 85% of its troops from there. He called attention to the fact that at the very beginning of this process Moscow insisted on the need to sign corresponding inter-governmental agreements. "Unfortunately, the Baltic countries failed to understand the realities we have to cope with, when, despite our serious internal problems, we remove our troops from there," Churkin said. Russia, he stressed, "is seeking to imbue this process with an element of greater cooperativeness." According to Churkin, at present Russia and the Baltic countries are "at the decisive stage of final troop withdrawal." In his view, 90% of the agreement on troop withdrawal from Latvia is ready. What remains to be coordinated are questions connected with the situation of military retirees and with the functioning of the radar station in Skrunda. With reference to the human rights situation in the Baltic countries, Churkin stressed that Russia "never linked the issue of troop withdrawal to changes in the situation of Russian speakers." "Moreover, it is Latvia and Estonia which insisted on such linkage, saying that the situation of ethnic Russians in the Baltic countries will improve after the withdrawal of troops. We view this as a promise. Let's see how they honor it," he said. Speaking about Estonia's territorial claims to several areas in Russia's Pskov Region, Churkin pointed out that "there is no need to create additional irritants, which, as a matter of fact, will bring no practical results. We can take retaliatory measures, and our Estonian partners will not like it." In his view, "the territorial issue is clear. This is Russian territory, it is controlled by Russia, and our present border with Estonia has the status of state frontier."
