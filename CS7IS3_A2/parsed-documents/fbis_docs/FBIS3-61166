However the drop that made the cup run over was a firefight in central Tallinn during the middle of the day. Mrs. Parek's special force, K Command, which consists of policemen who always appear in black masks, launched a formidable attack last week. On Friday at 1400 hours they lay in wait on Parnu Street, right next to a hospital. The aim was to seize Major Asso Kommer, chief of the notorious disbanded Estonian commando company. He came along the street accompanied by his three bodyguards. When the police in the black masks stormed across the street they were met by shots from automatic weapons. Long salvos were fired by both sides and passersby had to fling themselves headlong to the ground, according to eyewitnesses. Two police officers were badly wounded. At first Kommer and his gang managed to escape. Later they were seized and mistreated during the arrest. It was a miracle that no innocent bystanders were killed or wounded, eyewitnesses say. K Command's ambush was regarded as so foolhardy that Parek was forced to resign. Prime Minister Mart Laar is now also acting as interior minister until a new minister is appointed. Parek was one of four candidates in last year's presidential election. She was also one of the last political prisoners in Estonia. In the past Parek urged Estonian citizens to obtain licenses for firearms and arm themselves. It is now a big problem in Estonia that many people are running around with firearms in their pockets, most of them illegal. After some 50 car bombings this year alone and a great many corpses in the Mafia wars, citizens are now anxious and want the government to take strong steps.
