FR941028-0-00048 FR941028-0-00009 Section 773.15_Review of permit applications. In the proposed rule. OSM proposed to amend 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) to refer to relevant amended definitions and AVS-related rules as the basis for a regulatory authority's analysis when reviewing a permit application. The proposed regulation required the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant. Such information would include that obtained pursuant to §773.22 (verification of ownership or control application information); §773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information); amended §778.13 (identification of interests); and amended §778.14 (violation information). While those regulations will be discussed in detail later in this preamble, the net effect of referencing such provisions in §773.15(b)(1) was to assure that the regulatory authority makes a decision with respect to permit issuance or denial based upon complete information relating to ownership, control, and violations. Such compete information includes the mandated use of AVS. The proposed rule would have further added a paragraph (b)(4) to 30 CFR 773.15. This provision would have provided that delinquent civil penalties for violations cited prior to October 3, 1988, not form the basis for a permit block against persons linked through ownership or control to such violations, where reclamation had been completed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable regulatory program and where, with respect to each cessation order for which a delinquent civil penalty exists, such persons had paid $750 of the amount of such penalty to the regulatory authority which issued such cessation order. In substance, this regulation proposed a ``safe harbor'' with respect to owners or controllers of delinquent civil penalties cited prior to October 3, 1988. In addition, the proposed amendments to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) would also have deleted the presumption contained in the then current version of that rule that allows a regulatory authority, in evaluating whether a surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by a permit applicant is currently in violation of the law, to presume, in the absence of a failure to abate cessation order (FTACO), that a notice of violation (NOV) has been or is being corrected, except where evidence to the contrary is set forth in the permit application, or where the notice of violation is issued for non-payment of abandoned mine reclamation fees or civil penalties. Further, the proposed amendment to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) would have incorporated by reference the amended definition of ``violation notice'' and the proposed definition of ``ownership or control link'' contained in proposed §773.5 by requiring a regulatory authority to review ``all reasonably available information concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant.'' This proposed change would have eliminated the need for the detailed list contained in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) of the types of violation information which a regulatory authority must review as part of the application review process provided by 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
