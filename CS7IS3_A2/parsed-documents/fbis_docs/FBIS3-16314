[Nuri] In the name of God, the almighty and merciful. I am 'Abdollah Nuri and am 46 years old. I was born in Tajikistan's mountainous region during the communist rule and at the peak of atheistic and communist propaganda. [passage omitted] Since my father was acquainted with Islam, he started to teach religion to his children. At that time, the KGB put pressure on the Muslims. But despite all these pressures, we learned Islamic teachings and ideology from our father. I continued my studies in Dushanbe with a learned scholar, Qari Mohammad Jan, who had been in Afghanistan and India. [passage omitted] In 1971, I was officially summoned by the KGB for the first time and was threatened because of my educational activities. Again in 1973 I was arrested by the KGB in the basement of a house in Dushanbe where we held secret classes. But fortunately our teacher, Qari Mohammad Jan, was not present at that time. However, all the students who were in the classroom were arrested. The KGB intended to send us to prison and then to exile us to Siberia. But we bribed them and were released. Then pressures on us and on our father started and we were unable to continue our studies in Dushanbe. Therefore, we went to Forqan Tappeh which was our home and continued our lessons in night classes. It was in the same year that liberation movements were initiated by me and since we were under extreme pressure, we sought solutions so that we would be free to practice our religion and to carry out our Islamic duties. With God's help, we received books from abroad which offered us solutions to our problems. [passage omitted] With the help of these books and Koranic teachings we reached the conclusion that the Islamic movement should be in the form of an organization, and that the numerous Islamic forces inside Tajikistan should be consolidated and work under the supervision of a group and a movement to vindicate our rights and to propagandize Islamic ideas among the youths who had been distracted from Islam by the communists. For this reason, we formed this group and continued our struggles. [passage omitted] [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Since then what have the activities of this movement been? [Nuri] [Passage omitted] The revolution in Afghanistan was an impetus to our movement. But the basis of our movement was the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran in which all the forces in the movement and all the Muslims in Tajikistan trusted. After the Islamic revolution in Iran, these forces were convinced that when Islam was able to prevail in Iran, the same could happen in other countries too. This gave the people self-confidence. [passage omitted] We were able to achieve the official recognition of the Islamic Movement Party in Tajikistan. Following this recognition, the movement was led by Hemmatzadeh. Our first newspaper was HAQIQAT-E ESLAMI [Islamic Truth], the publication of which led to the arrest of more than 24 of the Islamic Movement's members. Later on a magazine called HEDAYAT [Guidance] was published. After the official recognition of our movement, the Islamic Movement Party started the publication of another newspaper called NEJAT [Salvation]. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Apart from publications, what other activities did the Islamic Movement have? [Nuri] Among the activities of the Islamic Movement was its calls on youths to turn to Islam and the formation of meetings and gatherings for the people. [passage omitted] We also established a school with the people's help in order to offer Islamic teaching to our Muslim children. [passage omitted]
