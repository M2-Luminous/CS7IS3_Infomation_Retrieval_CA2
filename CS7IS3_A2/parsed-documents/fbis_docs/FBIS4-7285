FBIS4-7285 "dreas083__a94010" FBIS-EAS-94-083-A Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Banks Selling Credits Rights on Former USSR Banks Selling Credits Rights on Former USSR OW2904042594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2904042594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Japanese banks are actively selling their credit rights on the former USSR because repayment by Russia, which took over the former USSR's obligations, remains uncertain. Total Japanese bank loans to the former Soviet Union totaled 200 billion yen at the end of March, nearly 100 billion yen less than in September 1993. These credits are being sold to European investors through European commercial banks and securities firms. In some cases, East European countries with outstanding loans with Russia are buying them to offset such credits. A total of five or six city banks, including Fuji Bank and Daiichi Kangyo Bank, and a number of local banks are reportedly selling off their credit rights with the former USSR. Most of Japanese banks-held credit rights with the former USSR are loans to the Russian Bank for Foreign Economic Relations [BFER]. The current price of credit rights on the Russian BFER being dealt on the international financial market is 27-28 percent of the face value. It has been falling since last December, when the price saw its peak at 54 percent. Although the main cause of a drop in prices is a rise in long-term interest rates, some analysts point out: "Japanese banks' active sales are another cause of a drop in the prices." In addition to those of former the USSR, Japanese banks are actively disposing of bad loans of other nations. Last year, they disposed of their claimable assets of Argentina by changing them to Argentine government-issued bonds (Brady bonds). They also disposed of their credit rights with Brazil last April. For Japanese banks, how to sell off credits with the former Soviet Union is another major issue. And with this in mind, they have started selling their credit rights with the former Soviet Union.
