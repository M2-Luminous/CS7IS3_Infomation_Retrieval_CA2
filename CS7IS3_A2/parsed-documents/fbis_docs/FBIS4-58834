"Violent clashes are now taking place at the gates of the city between government forces and rebel troops," said SABA'', which is run by the northern administration loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. "Aden is expected to fall within hours," under a barrage of tankfire and artillery, it said, reporting fires had broken out around the city. SABA'' said a southern brigade had been destroyed in Abyan province near Aden and two of the south's warplanes shot down as the north seized control of al-Dhalih, a town 60 kilometrers (25 miles) north of the port city. Despite the northern reports of military success, the situation in Aden itself was still calm, according to an AFP correspondent in the city of more than 500,000 residents. Diplomats in the region, meanwhile, said the north had trapped Aden in a "pincer movement" and captured the south's main air base. But the south said it repelled northern forces in al-Kawt, 30 kilometres (18 miles) to the east of Aden and that Salih's troops were in retreat toward the mountains. Other northern elements had been ambushed and wiped out in Radfan, to the north, said military spokesmen in Aden, the power base of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the president's bitter rival.
