The trackage rights will, in effect, substitute for trackage rights CSXT held over another W&LE line, between Brewster and Creston, OH.

The trackage rights were to become effective on June 23, 1994. This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information the exemption is void ab initio . Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction.
