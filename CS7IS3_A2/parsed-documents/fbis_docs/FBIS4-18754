His uncompromising line was made clear in a letter to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, who had asked for direct dialogue with the Government on how to move the peace process forward. Earlier, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, made a last minute appeal to the IRA to extend the cease-fire, which is due to end at midnight tonight. In a statement issued from Cyprus, where he is on holiday, he said that the strong momentum for peace among ordinary people on both sides of the divide made it "essential" that the cease-fire was prolonged. But Mr Adams appeared to rule that out. He said that, although his party would keep moving the process forward, he believed it was "unlikely" that the cease-fire would be extended. Mr Adams had sent two letters to No. 10 Downing Street calling for clarification of the Dec 15 Downing Street declaration in which Whitehall and Dublin set out an agreed framework for a settlement in Northern Ireland. He had blamed the "stalemate" in efforts to secure peace on Mr Major's refusal to enter talks on the meaning of the document. A letter to Mr Adams from Downing Street, signed by Mr Roderic Lyne, the Prime Minister's private secretary denied that the Government was to blame. "Any pause in the movement towards peace is because of the continuing violence and Sinn Fein's failure unequivocally to renounce violence as a means to achieving political ends," the letter said. "It is Sinn Fein that excludes itself from playing a full part in the political process." The letter reaffirmed that, if there were a permanent end to violence and if Sinn Fein committed itself to the democratic process, the Government would be ready to enter preliminary exploratory dialogue with it within three months. "The joint declaration offers the way forward," the letter said. "Sinn Fein can take it or reject it. But if violence continues, it will only be because Sinn Fein have spurned the opportunity to enter the democratic process." Last night Mr Adams described Mr Major's response as "evasive and wholly inadequate." He said: "This letter is a transparent attempt to evade the issues which I raised in my correspondence, and it is a wholly inadequate response to the very real opportunity to move the peace process forward that currently exists." The IRA's three-day suspension of its activities was "unilateral and without condition." Sinn Fein had welcomed it as an opportunity to end the present stalemate around the issue of clarification. "Unfortunately Mr Major does not share our concern to move forward." Mr Adams also published for the first time his letter to Mr Major accusing ministers of a "negative and dismissive" response to the IRA's "significant initiative." He urged the Prime Minister "to reflect on the seriousness of the present situation and on the opportunity to move out of the present impasse, provided by the IRA. I would again urge you to grasp this opportunity to move the peace process forward. You can best do so by authorising a meeting with representatives of Sinn Fein so that we can receive clarification of the Downing Street declaration in the same manner it was provided to other particular parties. Your refusal to do so up to now has created the present stalemate situation. It is crucial to the peace process that this stalemate be ended." A call for the IRA to extend its ceasefire also came from the Irish foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring, who denounced the 72-hour suspension as a "pathetically brief respite." He added: "If it is to have any potential, that can be realised only be extending it and making it permanent." Addressing a conference in Tralee, Co Kerry, Mr Spring said the Irish Government had made great efforts to clarify for Sinn Fein and the IRA "any genuine points of perplexity" in the Downing Street declaration. Mr Spring said he saw no difficulty in both governments "making clear where they stand on any aspect of the declaration." But he said the republican movement must recognise that much of the confusion had arisen from its own failure to specify in a commonsense way the points it wished to have clarified. "Their failure to do so raises understandable worries that their aim is to draw the governments into a world of verbal mirrors and shifting goalposts so as to blur the vital distinction between politics and violence and to enter political negotiations on a basis of armed conflict," he said.
