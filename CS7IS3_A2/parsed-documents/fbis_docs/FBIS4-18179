The Commission's Directorate-General for Energy (DG XVII) organised a two-day conference to bring together top Energy industrialists and officials from the EU [European Union] and China to examine ways of applying EU technology in clean coal combustion, electricity, oil and gas to China's problems. As a follow-up, Chinese participants will make a business tour to facilities in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK on March 21-24 to see EU energy technology in operation and establish joint venture agreements. They then return to Brussels for further discussions with DGXVII on how best to bring the contacts to fruition. China ranks third in terms of world energy production and consumption and fostering Sino-European energy technology cooperation is a strategy designed to bring benefits to both the European and Chinese energy sectors. DGXVII has co-operated in the energy field for more than 10 years with the Chinese State Science Technology Commission through the EU's Thermie programme for the promotion of energy technology, and Synergy, for development of energy policy and management in non-EU countries. With the theoretical bases well established, the Commission felt the time was ripe to stimulate their practical application.
