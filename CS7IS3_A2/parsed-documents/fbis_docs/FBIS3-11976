Professor Carles has said that although the government has stopped trying to reach an agreement on the foreign debt with commercial banks, these efforts will now limit the financial actions of the new government. Therefore, the next president, whoever he may be, and his team will have played no role in those negotiations. For this reason, he hopes these negotiations are suspended immediately. [Begin recording] [Carles] Despite the goodwill and great effort made by the negotiatiors -- and I admit that the work done so far by Delia Cardenas, planning and economic policy minister, is very commendable -- I feel it would be advisable to immediately suspend those talks. [Reporter] Why? [Carles] The country is not in any condition to take on the responsibility of paying 3 billion balboas and to obtain, if possible, a special consideration or adjustment. I think we can achieve our goal of being in a better position later. [end recording]
