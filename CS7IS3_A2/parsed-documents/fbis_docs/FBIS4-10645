Laying of the first cable began yesterday, at 1400, starting from the shores of Camuri, on the central coast, aboard a British ship bound for Trinidad. The procedure will take 24 hours, after which our country will be connected to the system, which will be offered to domestic and international users on 1 September. At the national level, the project is being financed by CANTV [National Telephone Company of Venezuela]. At the same time, 53 communications companies representing 46 companies are also participating. Total investment amounts to $230 million; the project contemplates a network of 7,500 km of fiber optic cable. Venezuela is the second largest investor in the project, surpassed only by the United States. In addition, it constitutes one of the cable's land connections, at Camuri. The national telephone company plans to recover its investment in two years. Manuel Caceres, CANTV's vice president for international operations, called the system an "information superhighway" that will unite the country with the rest of the world, at the required speed and efficiency. It will connect Venezuela with North America, the Caribbean, and South America, in order to offer digital telecommunication services between the continental area of the United States, St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and Brazil. The system has four branches. The first, from St. Thomas to a deep interconnecting point in the Atlantic at a distance of 1,700 km to the south, was installed on 5 January 1993. The second was from that interconnecting point to Trinidad, over a distance of 583 km. The third--whose laying began yesterday--connects Trinidad with Camuri at a distance of 781 km and the last, which ties in the interconnecting point in the Atlantic with Fortaleza, Brazil, at a distance of 3,000 km was installed on 19 January 1994. The "Americas 1" is only one of the projects in the telecommunications field; another is Columbus II, whose cable will be added to networks that go in the direction of Mexico, the United States, and Europe, reaching places as distant as Turkey and Israel. CANTV has also planned the construction of a coastal cable that borders Venezuela and joins the Colombian system to have access to fiber optic cables of the Caribbean. It will also encourage cable networks from the United States in the direction of Japan, where the connection with Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore is already being negotiated. The most important Venezuelan telephone project in the international area is the fiber optic belt, which will cover the entire planet in the future. The first of the fiber optic submarine cables that involved Venezuela directly was that which began to be installed yesterday, at a cost of $60 million. This technology transmits a signal by means of a beam of light that has to be revitalized every 130 km with a repeater. This first course will have 10 repeaters. The fiber optic, protected by a double armature of copper and steel, is the size of a human hair, and among its advantages is that of guaranteeing the greatest capacity and best quality of communications in traffic, high velocity of telephone transmissions, and of special services in voice, data, television, and video. The cable uses two and three pairs of fiber in its first and second connections, respectively, to Trinidad, which will allow the establishment of 8,000 calls per pair each second. The French firm Alcatel is responsible for manufacturing the cable, repeaters, and auxiliary equipment, as well as for marine and land supply and installation. The testing period will begin at the end of March in order to start commercial operations at the beginning of September.
