We had hoped that the efforts of the sincere sons of Yemen would be pooled to produce a solution and a way out of the stifling crisis which has taken hold at all levels. We have followed the efforts of the good Yemeni men and leaders from the various political forces as well as the efforts of the brothers and friends to promote a solution that would safeguard Yemen, its unity, and its democracy and spare Yemen and its people entry into a dark tunnel with no known end and a catastrophe the dimensions of which only almighty God would know. We have always pointed out that a lack of a comprehensive strategic vision for the post-unity era would certainly lead Yemen to this tragic situation and that an approach by the political leadership to this civilized shift [unity] based on narrow-minded perspectives and calculations would lead everyone to this critical uncontrollable situation. We made every possible effort to prevent the situation reaching the point it has now reached, and we submitted a serious initiative based on advanced local government that would preserve Yemen's unity and popular democracy and lay the foundations for the future. We explained that we left the homeland in the interest of unity and that we will remain loyal to that unity because we cannot forget the waves of martyrs who died for it nor can we forget that all the wars and infighting that occurred in our recent history were for the sake of unity, and also that we should not fight among ourselves for the disintegration of Yemen because history would condemn our entire generation for such a sin. Despite all that, the crisis has deepened and the situation has worsened, warning of grave consequences as all institutions are being geared toward serving the conflict and the parties to the conflict, reaching the point of sharp polarization in the armed forces and security forces, which are being systematically mobilized on a divisive basis to resolve the situation. Signs of explosion and infighting are looming on the horizon in our country, warning of a civil war that would destroy everything, tear Yemen and its people apart, revive all sectarian, partitionist, and tribal ills which were buried by the September, October, and great May revolutions, and destroy the achievements of generations of our struggle people. Masses of our great people, the situation has reached a critical point and the time has come for the people to pronounce their verdict: No to infighting, no to the logic of force, no to the revivial of partition and totalitarian rule, and no to the disintegration of Yemen. Here and in the name of millions of our people, I appeal to the political leadership to resort to reason and serious dialogue, which is the only option, and to begin to implement, step by step, what was agreed in the Dialogue Committee. I particularly appeal to our armed forces not to be dragged into that fatal conflict and not to aim their guns at any party because by doing that they would be aiming directly at the very heart of the people and their hopes and aspirations. Only the united voice of the people, all the people, and of their armed forces would safeguard unity, a resounding voice saying no to infighting and no to ruinous civil war, and yes to dialogue, for only dialogue will protect unity and democracy and maintain general security and stability in the region.
