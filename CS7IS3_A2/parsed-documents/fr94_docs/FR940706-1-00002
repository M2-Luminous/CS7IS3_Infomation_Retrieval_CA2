FR940706-1-00002 FR940706-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;26&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, 280, and 280C Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to The Endstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, 280, and 280C series helicopters, that currently requires an initial and repetitive visual inspections of the upper swashplate bearings for corrosion, and replacement of defective upper swashplate bearings with airworthy bearings. This action would require that the visual inspections apply to both the upper and lower swashplate bearings (bearings); expand the applicability to those affected helicopters manufactured prior to January 1, 1981; establish a retirement life of 1,200 hours' time-in-service for certain bearings; and provide a corrected upper swashplate bearing part number. This proposal is prompted by the necessity to require visual inspection so the lower swashplate bearings; expand the applicability to include the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2 helicopter; establish a retirement life for certain bearings; and correct the upper swashplate bearing part number from the existing AD. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Comments must be received by September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;26&hyph;Ad, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation, Twin County Airport, P.O. Box 490, Menominee, Michigan 49858. This information may be examined at the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meachum Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;26&hyph;Ad.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;26&hyph;Ad, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137. Discussion On March 19, 1976, the FAA issued AD 76&hyph;01&hyph;11, Amendment 39&hyph;2560, (41 FR 13906, April 1, 1976), to require an initial and repetitive visual inspection of the upper swashplate bearing, part number (P/N) Z993L13XR3B, for corrosion, and replacement of corroded upper swashplate bearings. That action was prompted by three reports of upper swashplate bearing failures that were attributed to corrosion. These failures occurred between 205 and 586 hours' time-in-service (TIS). In two of these incidents, the probable cause of the upper swashplate bearing failures was corrosion of the balls and race due to water impregnating the housing after the loss of lubricant. This led to a spalling interaction between the balls and race, resulting in upper swashplate bearing failure. After reviewing the data, the FAA has determined that corrosion of either upper or lower bearings (bearings) could create an unsafe condition. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in failure of the bearings and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.
