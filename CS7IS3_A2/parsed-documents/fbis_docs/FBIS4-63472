It has been revealed that Simferopol's delegation at these talks will be headed by Sergey Tsekov, head of the Crimean Supreme Soviet. Yevgeniy Saburov, the head of government of the Republic of Crimea, expressed a hope in an interview with our radio station that the talks will be successful, the conflict resolved, and the situation in the Crimea will remain quiet. [Begin Saburov recording] We continue to work in a calm manner. Crimea does not respond -- tries not to respond -- to provocations. Crimea is living its normal peaceful life. The Crimean Government is at the moment working on a report about the socioeconomic situation in the Republic, which is very poor. The Kiev leaders are disseminating false reports that the situation in Crimea is unstable and unquiet and because of this people are not coming here very much. I would like to tell you that the situation in Crimea is absolutely stable and quiet. No one is really interested in these bickerings between authorities. The weather here is marvelous and we look forward to seeing you all! [end recording]
