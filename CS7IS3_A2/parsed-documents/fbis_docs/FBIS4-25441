By the middle of this century, the Rong family had more than 20 cotton mills, dyeing factories, and flour mills, and was the "richest" in national industry and commerce. Foreign media called the Rong family the "Rockefellers" of China. The Rong family originally became from Wuxi in eastern China. Of the Rong family, Mr. Rong Desheng and Mr. Rong Zongjing were enterprise pioneers. Rong Desheng was the father of Rong Yiren. In February 1896, the Rong brothers set up the Guangsheng Private Bank at Shanghai's Xiongsheng Wharf with a capital of 3,000 yuan. In their business, they were prudent with every word and action, and went about things steadily. This has continued in the Rong family and has become the key to their devotion to and the success of their enterprise. The time the Rong family really made a fortune was when they began the flour business and the textile business. In 1902, the Baoxing Flour Mill, the first enterprise in which the Rong brothers invested, began business. Despite difficulties, they finally set up 12 flour mills under the names of Maoxin and Fuxin, and 10 cotton mills under the name of Shenxin, as well as their largest industry -- the Kaiyuan Machine Factory -- thus supporting the national industry and commerce in completely devastated old China. Unexpectedly, the war against the Japanese broke out. After taking Shanghai, the Japanese aggressors broke into wanton massacre and looting. The Rongs' enterprises were mostly ruined, looted, and occupied. Mr. Rong Zongjing was so infuriated at this that he had a relapse and died in Hong Kong in 1938. Mr. Rong Desheng then took over the Rong family's business in Shanghai. The worst blow to the Rong family was the "kidnapping of Rong Desheng" in 1946. Some comments held that the most noted kidnapping in modern world history was the kidnapping and murder of the son of the American pilot hero Lindbergh. In modern Chinese history, however, the most noted kidnapping was that of the Shanghai tycoon Rong Desheng in 1946. Rong Desheng, born in 1875, was the father of Rong Yiren. He was already 71 when kidnapped. He was locked up by kidnappers for 34 days. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of $1 million, but they finally agreed to $500,000. In those days, $500,000 was somewhere between $5 million and $7 million today. Following the incident, the entire Rong family was anxious, not knowing who might be the next to encounter misfortune in a time and a world where there was no difference between policemen and criminals. In order to avoid another misfortune, Rong Yiren went to study in the United States, yet he lived in constant fear. On the eve of liberation, many capitalists in Shanghai left. Rong Yiren and his father also felt extremely confused. They had very little understanding of the Communist Party and the Liberation Army, though they had heard many rumors about them. Rong Desheng told Rong Yiren that whatever might happen he would never leave and that he wished to spend his remaining years in his home town. As his father had decided not to leave, Rong Yiren became increasingly hesitant, at a loss for what to do. Seeing this, his wife, Yang Jianqing, asked someone to rent an apartment for them in Hong Kong so they could move to Hong Kong in case of "emergency." Nonetheless, Rong Yiren and his father did not leave in the end. Rong Desheng thought to himself that China was, after all, good for the Chinese. Rong Yiren thought: The communists at their worst could be no worse than the Kuomintang [KMT]! As they hesitated, Shanghai was liberated. Invited to Beijing To Discuss the Tax Reform Issue, Rong Yiren Boldly Says: "It Is You Who Invited Me. I Can Remain Absolutely Silent If You Don't Want Me To Say Anything." Rong Yiren recalled, saying: "On 25 May 1949, the Liberation Army entered Shanghai. I was 33 then. I remember that I drove a car on the street and saw PLA soldiers lying on the sides of the street and not disturbing anyone at all. My car pulled up and a PLA soldier told me, with a polite and honest attitude, not to cross over because fighting was still going on up ahead and it was not safe. That was the first time I had met a PLA soldier, and he was completely different from a KMT soldier. "In early June, the city's military control meeting asked me to go over for a meeting," recalled Rong Yiren. "At the meeting, I met Chen Yi, Zeng Shan, Pan Hannian, and other leaders. That day, when Sheng Kangnian and Jin Oubu saw me, they introduced Comrade Xu Dixin to me. Comrade Chen Yi announced that the party's policy was to allow industrialists and businessmen to restore their businesses without worry. He said that they should continue their factory and shop operations, and that if they had difficulties, they could go and ask for help from the party and the government. He also said that the party and the government meant what they said. As I heard this, I thought to myself that this was a good policy. Although I doubted whether the government could resolve problems, I felt that I had to continue my business anyway and that I would not care until it was in trouble. Therefore, I went back to the company and arranged for the restoration of work." "Between April and May 1950, Beijing called a national work conference on the tax issue. Industrialists and businessmen were invited to send representatives to it. I headed for the conference. Industrialists and businessmen had never been invited to a meeting on the tax issue before. Central leaders Comrade Chen Yun (then Financial Committee director) and Bo Yibo (then Finance Minister) presided over the meeting. At the meeting, I expressed the opinion of industrialists and businessmen regarding the questions of taxation and of readjusting tax rates. I was young then and said too much. A tax bureau head told me that I said too much! I retorted: "It is you who invited me. I can remain absolutely silent if you don't want me to say anything." The atmosphere suddenly got tense. Comrade Bo Yibo said: "We have invited industrialists and businessmen to express their views. It is not right if we don't let them say anything." He asked me to keep my temper. Gu Huai, director of the Shanghai Tax Bureau, told me later that after hearing my words, the party held an overnight meeting and made criticisms and that they could not go to sleep. I knew from this that the party really sincerely solicited views from us businessmen, attached great importance to and seriously considered our views, and that they were realistic and acted on good choices -- all for reviving the national economy." In October 1955, the National Alliance of Industrialists and Businessmen called a meeting of executive members. Rong Yiren came to Beijing to participate in it. Mao Zedong also came and presided over a discussion meeting in person. The meeting lasted approximately two hours in an earnest and sincere atmosphere. The "capitalists" said: "We must be a little more farsighted. We must not fear socialism. We must hold our fate in our hands and must not be perturbed." Mao Zedong then told the story of Xiao Guiying, a character in the Beijing opera theme the "Fisherman for the Revolution." He said: "Xiao Guiying went to join in the revolution, but he did not forget to lock his door because he feared that his pitchers and kettles would be stolen. Industrialists and businessmen are not like this. They must be a little more farsighted." That was the eve of the high tide of public-and-private cooperation in joint ventures throughout the country. Mao Zedong's sincere words gave lots of food for thought. He said: "If one really works for the people, really offers help the people, and does good things for them consistently when they are in difficulty, the people and the people's government will have no reason to desert him and no reason not to give him an opportunity to earn a living and to make contributions." After the discussion meeting, Rong Yiren felt he was greatly inspired. On his return to Shanghai, he made a guarantee to the Shanghai People's Congress, saying: "I surely will invest in enterprises and purchase public bonds with the profits I have made to support the country's development." Rong Yiren remained in Shanghai for a very long time following liberation, but the financial situation of this city could be reflected to Zhongnanhai almost every day. In January 1957, Shanghai called the first session of the Second People's Congress. Chen Yi, who had previously been the Shanghai mayor and now worked as vice premier of the State Council, went from Beijing to Shanghai and delivered a sensational speech. Marshall Chen Yi said in a Sichuan accent: "Chairman Mao has trusted me with a special task on my Shanghai trip this time. He wants me to discuss with comrades in Shanghai so they can vote for Rong Yiren and elect him vice mayor." Mao Zedong Praises Rong Yiren, Saying: "He Is Patriotic and Capable and Is Fitted for Important Tasks." Chen Yi Said: "As a Veteran Communist Party Member, I Will Campaign for This Red Capitalist." In the eyes of Shanghai people, Chen Yi had a very lofty status as an old mayor. They had great respect and deference toward him. Chen Yi said: "Chairman Mao said Rong Yiren is the first of our country's national capitalists. Now the Rong family has handed over all their enterprises for cooperation with the state. This will have a very great influence at home. He is patriotic and capable, and is fitted for important tasks." Chen Yi said wittily: "I must admit that Rong Yiren is one of my best friends. Today, I will campaign for this red capitalist." There followed a loud applause in audience. Chen Yi added: "With his special status, he can play a role among the bourgeoisie at home and abroad which I, Chen Yi, cannot." He told a story vividly: Several years ago, a big French capitalist came and visited Rong Yiren. After chatting with him, the French tycoon felt very happy. Chen Yi asked Rong what topics had made the Frenchman so happy. Rong Yiren said in a perplexed manner: Just some everyday topics like that my family lives very comfortably and does not fear racketeering or kidnapping, that we have found goals for our careers and education, and therefore we want to do more for the state and are ready to use the fixed interest on our earnings to set up one cotton mill a year. The foreign capitalist who had feared the Communist Party as much as a tiger changed his outlook on socialism. At this point, Chen Yi asked everyone in a loud voice: "Do you think we should elect Rong Yiren vice mayor?" His words were immediately drowned by thundering applause. As a result, the people's congress resolved to elect Rong Yiren vice mayor of Shanghai." In 1959, the central authorities made the decision that Rong Yiren be transferred to Beijing to act as vice minister of the Textile Industry Ministry of the Central People's Government. The transfer should have been a good thing, but the Cultural Revolution soon began. "Talented capitalist roaders" like Rong Yiren were the first to become the targets of "dictatorship." He and his wife were forced to clean the streets and had their property confiscated. Now the "big capitalist," who is nearly 1.85 meters tall, was forced to clean the streets and transport coal. In the wake of the Cultural Revolution, people hoped that he would "settle accounts," but Rong Yiren only whispered: "It doesn't make any sense to settle old accounts." Deng Xiaoping Said to Rong Yiren: You Are To Take Charge of Things, but Do Not Make the Enterprise a Bureaucratic One. The China International Trust and Investment Corporation's [CITIC] Businesses in 1993 Had Nearly 51 Billion Yuan in Assets In 1979, Deng Xiaoping had Rong Yiren and several other former industrialists and businessmen come. They then explored questions regarding China's opening to the outside world. Deng Xiaoping asked Rong Yiren to put forward proposals on attracting foreign capital. He said to Rong Yiren: "You take the lead in setting up economic entities and in opening windows on the outside world. The choice of personnel is up to you. You are to take charge of the business and things, but do not make the enterprise a bureaucratic one." Returning home from the long and sincere talk, Rong Yiren fell into deep contemplation. Afterward, he really came up with "proposals." He suggested setting up an international trust and investment corporation in keeping with international practice. When the proposal reached Zhongnanhai, it immediately won the full support of Deng Xiaoping and other leaders. Soon afterward, CITIC, headed by Rong Yiren, was set up. Later, CITIC made some world-renowned deals, such as taking over Hong Kong's Ka Wah Bank and investing in building Australia's Portland Aluminum Mill. CITIC has become a large "multinational corporation," which last year had over 51 billion yuan in assets and more than 200 enterprises. CITIC's great achievements have made "Rong Yiren, the boss" known all over the world. The Asia Satellite Corporation's plan to purchase satellites from Houston in 1989 failed as a result of the sanctions of Western countries. Later, Rong Yiren helped in the matter and the purchase was concluded. In 1990, the Asiasat I was successfully launched in China's Xichang. Rong Yiren is very "harsh" with his subordinates. Before making a decision, he lets everyone make good preparations and express their different views. Once a decision is made, it must be carried out resolutely and must not be defied. His "precept," which has created the enterprise's prestige, is very "simple:" "Answer every letter and question." "Tell only the truth. Do whatever you can and, if you cannot do something, say so. When people think what you say is reasonable, they will understand you." Different from others, he likes "defiant, yet resourceful" people. He thinks they often have the real expertise and learning and that they can do great jobs as long as they are guided properly. In March 1993, he was elected PRC vice president at the Eighth People's Congress session. He considers work the greatest fun in life. He has almost forgotten the hobbies of flower-growing and photography, which became his pastimes in his unoccupied moments during the Cultural Revolution. His only "amateur hobby" now is to watch television, especially soccer games. He can name, at one go, many of his favorite Chinese soccer players and remember all their team numbers. Rong Yiren's wife, Yang Jianqing, was once a CPPCC delegate. She is a virtuous woman who supports his husband's career. In 1986, they marked their golden wedding anniversary. They have five children. The Rong family has over 400 relatives scattered all over the world, many of whom are celebrated figures of industrial and commercial circles, as well as scientific circles.
