After a prolonged conversation between the two countries' leaders in the Elysee Palace there was a ceremonial signing of the French-Georgian treaty, which will create the legal framework for the future relations of cooperation between the two countries. After this, Eduard Shevardnadze signed on Georgia's behalf the Paris Charter for a New Europe - the basic document of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, marking the end of the Cold War and proclaiming the principle of the settlement of all conflicts by peaceful means. The conclusion of the treaty between France and Georgia means that we are establishing special relations of cooperation and interaction between us, Francois Mitterrand said at the signing ceremony. Today Georgia is encountering significant difficulties of a political and economic nature, and it can count on the solidarity of its friends, the French president noted. We face interaction in Europe, which is now being built anew, and both our countries bear responsibility for the success of this, the French head of state said. The signing of today's documents represents a historic moment for Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze said in his reply. Today we are going through a difficult period, but I believe in Georgia's future, and it is linked above all with the fact that we have friends in the world, the Georgian leader said. We arrived in Paris with great hopes, and I must say that these hopes have come true. Today we are opening a new page in the relations between our countries, the head of the Republic of Georgia said. Eduard Shevardnadze summed up the initial results of his visit to France at a news conference today. The main aims of the visit are to establish normal relations with France and discuss the most important political problems with its leader, and these have been achieved, he said. France, he remarked, has promised aid for Georgia in various fields, including by taking an active role with Russia, the United States and Germany in the work by states friendly to Georgia to find a way of resolving the Abkhazia conflict. Georgia is placing particular emphasis on developing relations with Russia, Eduard Shevardnadze said. He stressed that there are high hopes in his country for the visit to Tbilisi by President Yeltsin, scheduled for early February. I hope that these hopes are justified, he said. I spent much time with my French counterpart discussing the new Russia and its new role in the world, meaning in the post-communist period, Eduard Shevardnadze remarked in reply to a question from ITAR-TASS. We noted that this role can only be performed if Russia takes a democratic path, he commented. We believe the adoption of a new Russian constitution to be a significant event and attach great importance to the part that the country's presidency can play in guaranteeing democracy, the Georgian head of state said.
