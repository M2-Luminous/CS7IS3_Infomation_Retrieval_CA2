Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistics Bureau, said today that China adopted a secure monetary policy to curtail the undue fixed assets investment and excessive money supply, absorb savings deposits, increase the input and adjust the structure of credit and loans. These measures guaranteed the supply of capital for state key projects, in industrial and agricultural production, in purchasing farm and sideline products and in alleviating the shortage of circulating capital encountered by some important enterprises, he added. At the end of 1993, he said, savings in various forms in state banks totalled 2,324.5 billion yuan, an increase of 433.9 billion yuan or 23 percent more than the total a year before. The money in circulation amounted to 586.5 billion yuan, up 35.3 percent, and the money supply in 1993 was 152.9 billion yuan. At the same time, China's foreign exchange reserve increased, standing at 21.2 billion U.S. dollars in cash (savings deposits in foreign exchange at the Bank of China excluded), 1.76 billion more than at the beginning of that year, statistics showed. Zhang said China's insurance service also made big strides in 1993. Property insurance of various kinds totalled 5,137 billion yuan, up 12.6 percent over 1992. Over 776,000 enterprises joined in enterprise property insurance, 130 million households participated in household property insurance and 250 million persons in life insurance programs. He said that insurance companies tackled nearly 7 million claims of property loss and paid an indemnity of 13.7 billion yuan for settled cases. Another 9.1 billion yuan was paid to 6.64 million persons as reparations in life insurance programs.
