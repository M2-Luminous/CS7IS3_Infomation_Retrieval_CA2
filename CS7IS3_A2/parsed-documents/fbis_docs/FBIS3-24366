Zhaboyev, under rubric "Politics," by I. Mezova: "Makhmud Zhaboyev: I Like To Be Surrounded by Strong People..."] [Text] After the 12 December 1993 election, one of the houses of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] Parliament -- the Representatives' Council -- was headed by 55-year-old M. N. Zhaboyev, who had previously worked for more than 30 years at the Tyrnyauz Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine. [Mezova] Makhmud Nazirovich, you are a new person in the republic's agencies of authority. Could you tell our readers a bit about yourself? [Zhaboyev] I was born in 1938 in the settlement of Belaya Rechka, in a school teacher's family. My father was called to the front on the second day of the war, and he never returned. He did not even manage to come home to say goodbye, but I am told that he wanted very much to see me, his elder son, before he left. My cousin, hearing about this, put me on his bicycle, and we dashed to the railroad station, but we were too late. In 1946 my mother died in Kirgizia, where she had gone, together with many other Balkarians who had been forcibly evicted from their homeland. My younger brother, five-year-old Muzafar, and I were left completely alone. [Mezova] You were about eight years old. How, then, did your life unfold? [Zhaboyev] We were taken in by uncles on my father's side who were living at that time in Kazakhstan. I grew up in the family of Sultan Babayev, and Muzafar grow up in the family of Musa Sozayev. We were among the first to return to our homeland -- in 1955. My uncle's family was one of three that had received authorization to do that, and so we came here. I was still in the tenth grade then. At first, everything in our life was complicated, so my uncle took me to a boarding school for orphans. The people met me there, to my surprise, in a welcoming way, and I completed my schooling there. Nevertheless, I never did get the reservation [for higher education] that was issued to almost all the children at the boarding school, even though I had received a good certificate: I had let people know my feelings about the so-called Balkarian question, which had not yet been finally resolved. But I did not get depressed about that. Instead I enrolled at the Kiev Polytechnical Institute. [Mezova] You went to Kiev? Why did you go so far away? [Zhaboyev] The fact of the matter is that my father had sent his last letter from around there, and somewhere deep within my soul I harbored a crazy, completely unfounded hope. Anything can happen, I kept telling myself, and suddenly I would find out something. But my trips through the archives and the graveyards did not yield anything. I did not see my father's first or last name anywhere. [Mezova] So you enrolled at the institute. How did your education go there? [Zhaboyev] I passed my examinations, got through the competition, and, naturally, enrolled there. My education proceeded normally. I got a stipend, and that practically was all I had to live on. Although I did find odd jobs from time to time. I became friends with some Ukrainian guys, about whom I still have the best recollections: knowing my situation, they always shared with me the food that their parents had sent them. [Mezova] What specialty did you acquire? [Zhaboyev] Mining engineer. The year was 1961. The institute received a telephone call from Kabardino-Balkaria about student Zhaboyev. But they did not want to release me. There was also a shortage of specialists in Kiev. After much difficulty I managed to get released, and arrived at my homeland. However, in Tyrnyauz the chief of the Molibden [Molybdenum] Mine said that there was no work for me. [Mezova] What? After they had called for you? [Zhaboyev] Not only that, but I said that I was agreeable to begin working there, but that was not to his liking. It was not until chief accountant Zhilyayev and chief geologist Dzagoyev intervened that I was given a job. Two months later the same mine chief, thanks to what he called my good references, made me a mining foreman. [Mezova] And you have been working at the combine since then? [Zhaboyev] In general, yes. But in 1963 I was elected first secretary of the Komsomol's first Tyrnyauz City Committee. I worked two years there and decided to return to the combine. [Mezova] Why? Didn't you like Komsomol work? [Zhaboyev] It was not because I didn't like it or that it wasn't in my area of specialization. They even asked me to continue working there. But my heart was drawn more to a specific kind of work, and I had to stand on my own two feet as a professional. At any rate, in order to make a statement about myself in public work or politics, I had to have two kinds of experience --everyday experience and professional experience. [Mezova] Did you return to the same position? [Zhaboyev] Yes, the position of mining foreman. And I went up absolutely all the rungs of my career ladder. My last position at the combine was chief engineer. The time was good, especially when I was working as the chief of high-speed drilling. It was fashionable at that time -- that is, it was not fashionable, but there a requirement of the day, inasmuch as the international situation was complicated and there was a need for metal -- to establish records. Twice we established nationwide records for the drilling of mines, and twice I was received by the country's minister of nonferrous metallurgy. I also received awards --governmental orders and medals. The most cherished of them were the VDNKh [Exhibition of the Achievements of the National Economy] Gold Medal and the badge "In Recognition of Aggressive Work in the Komsomol." [Mezova] All told, you gave the combine 31 years. Am I correct in thinking that it was not so simple for you to break away from it, to change your life so sharply? [Zhaboyev] Yes, it was no simple matter, and it is not even a matter of the number of years. In my previous work, things were more concrete, and one could see the results more clearly. There were more opportunities to display my on-the-job qualities there. And also, to tell the truth, there is nothing that can replace communicating with the working class, with unspoiled, unsophisticated people. These actually are not high-sounding words for me. Thanks to the workers, I felt strong. I was convinced that they would never let me down, and I would never let them down either. [Mezova] And so, Makhmud Nazirovich, you arrived at Parliament. With what hopes? What did you hope to bring into its activity? [Zhaboyev] You can see what we turned production into. We enterprise managers rushed into politics in order to exert an influence on the poorly thought-out, unjust attitude toward the producer. Do you think that the director corps developed this aggressiveness from having had a good life? Industry is in a very serious situation. The kolkhozes are being ruined. It is unbearable to feel helpless and incapable of helping one's own collective. People would say, "Hand over your last jacket without even thinking about it!" But what justifications were there for bringing the country to that point? None. [Mezova] There are a lot of famous people in your house --administration heads, and managers of large enterprises, kolkhozes, and sovkhozes. Do you think that they will succeed in making life better for the nation? [Zhaboyev] Unfortunately, everything does not depend on us. It is impossible to build a good life in an individual republic when things are bad all around. First, I am convinced that we shall never get rich unless we economize. [Mezova] How do you think we must or can economize? [Zhaboyev] It is necessary to put the budget under strict monitoring: where is the money going, for what purpose, and what return will it provide? The money should not disappear down a hole in the ice. Instead it should float to the surface in the form of new schools, new shops, etc. That process should be broadly illumined. Secondly, taxes and all kinds of assessments have stifled both the private and state producers. Someone ought to study this situation. [Mezova] Who, for example? [Zhaboyev] Maybe even Parliament. The appropriate commissions of both houses should analyze the situation, develop specific recommendations, and submit them to the government. The third problem is crime. In order to eradicate it, it is necessary to create new jobs. It is necessary to give a person the opportunity to earn a living by honest labor. If he is deprived of that opportunity, he chooses another path. [Mezova] How can we create new jobs if the jobs that do exist are standing idle? [Zhaboyev] I currently drive out to the enterprises and become acquainted with their financial and economic situation. I have also recommended that to our deputies. We must not bring everyone to the point of collapse. A few more and even the director corps will be unable to withstand it. Incidentally, in our republic that corps is very strong. Nor is the engineer-administrative complement any weaker. It is simply criminal to lose it. After all, it took three or four decades to create it. [Mezova] You have a large amount of practical experience, as well as an equal amount of everyday experience. How do you think the republic should attempt to get out of the crisis? Are there any previously unused reserves? [Zhaboyev] Our agriculture and industry are operating at a loss. In my opinion, we have good reserves of various types of building materials. We have unexploited reserves of millions of cubic meters of sand and gravel that are in short supply in Stavropol and other regions, and even in foreign countries. A second source of our prosperity could be the tourist industry. It might make sense here to take advantage of the services of foreign investors, or maybe even to sell certain items... But it is necessary to begin somewhere. [Mezova] Parliament was formed not too long ago, but you already know many of the members of your house from the previous Supreme Soviet. What would you say about the makeup of the Representatives' Council? [Zhaboyev] I am very satisfied with it and I feel that it is sufficiently strong. Most of the deputies have a large amount of everyday and professional experience. In general, I have always liked to be surrounded by strong people, by a strong team. In Parliament, once again, i have been fortunate in this regard. [Mezova] In addition to the tasks that were previously enumerated, what do you consider to be an inseparable task of Parliament? [Zhaboyev] The RF government, in my opinion, is making certain reasonable attempts to help the producer. For some reason they are being ignored or met with bayonets. It seems to me that Parliament must go to the Federal Assembly with official declarations about supporting the government's efforts and stabilizing the population's life. I do not remember any precedents for this, but why cannot this be done by way of our deputies in the Federal Assembly, of whom we have three? Of course, other alternatives are also possible. Something that upsets me very much is the fate of our youth. We really ought to revive the public youth organizations, even under different names, with other ideals. But they should be revived. Such an important job as educating the upcoming generation should not be allowed to drift along unguided. [Mezova] I remember, Makhmud Nazirovich, the statement that you made against a professional Parliament... [Zhaboyev] Yes, I was against it, inasmuch as I felt that the parliamentarians would rapidly divorce themselves from the vitally important problems, from real life. In any case, we must remember that today is not the time for politics mongering. It is better to give everyone the opportunity to buy bread. Today Parliament in its work is proceeding, as it were, by touch, but I feel that it will find itself and there will be work for it to do.
