In the first place, we thank God Almighty for this privilege of serving our beloved people. We accept this challenge with humility and ask God to enlighten us in every one of our actions. We know there is no privilege without responsibility, and for that reason we accept our responsibility with full awareness of the historic moment for the nation and the world. In a very special manner, we want to voice our most sincere gratitude to the noble Salvadoran people, assuring them that we will work for them, day after day, throughout our entire administration. We will not forget for a single minute the principle that public power comes from the people and that government officials are their delegates with the powers granted by the law. With pure patriotic fervor, we express our deepest appreciation to all the men, women, and youth who form part of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA. [applause, cheers] Five years ago you forged the way toward national recovery, and you are today propelling us toward the overall reconstruction of the country, making it possible for us to experience this historic moment. Once again you told El Salvador you are here for the fatherland, a fatherland that joins all of us [applause] in constructing a future in which there can be coexistence and in which peace, progress, and liberty can be shared. [applause] We wish to make special recognition of President Alfredo Cristiani, [applause] artisan [applause] of peace. His administration will go into the pages of our history, and current and future generations will reap the benefits of his extraordinary work as president. I am receiving today the presidential sash, which I must hand over five years from now on a day much like today, as the symbol that the work accomplished is just a relay to continue onward in building the future of the nation. We are grateful for the presence of representatives of friendly peoples and governments. We regard it as a new expression of support for the people of El Salvador in this process of peace and strengthening of democracy to which we are so fervently committed. We are building a new El Salvador, which is modern, democratic, and participative. This demands legality, security, honesty, respect for each other, solidarity, and opening. The framework for our administration will be the Constitution and the laws, which we, the government and the governed, must all respect. Our objective is the full state of law that will guarantee the equality of all Salvadorans before the law, making sure that this will be the golden rule of national coexistence, without improper privileges or unjust exclusions. We will work tirelessly to achieve the conditions that will ensure the highest level possible of safety for the people, within the framework of the law and full respect for the rights of individuals. We will combat crime, drug trafficking, kidnapping, extortion, and violence with total commitment. In this respect, we will [applause] In this respect [repeats himself] we will give top priority to developing public security as the guarantor of internal peace and the tranquillity of citizens. Our administration will not tolerate corruption of any kind. We will make sure public functions are honest and integrity exists in all public servants so that honesty in every one of our actions becomes the norm that guides the work of the administration as a whole. We believe in the irresistible force of example. That is why, before the entire nation, we pledge to have an administration that is honest and respectful of public affairs so that democracy can continue gaining credibility. [applause] We will work toward strengthening a society that lives in harmony and where respect for human dignity is the basic rule of coexistence among Salvadorans. We do not want any more confrontation, much less polarization. We will work for cooperation among all the political and social forces to advance the important national project. To us, it is very clear that this society should work as a one; however, its social integration is not a beautiful [word indistinct]. It is also a challenge to improve, directly linked to the living conditions of human beings. In terms of Salvadoran solidarity integration, we will work unceasingly to improve the standard of living, particularly for the most needy so that no Salvadoran falls by the wayside on the important road to development. We consider fundamental initiating broad development of all the currents of thinking, of ideas. If ideas are not challenged they do not develop, thereby preventing the possibilities of finding the best options in the search of solutions to problems. The time of dogmas and fanatics has ended. Historical rationality prevails as a prerequisite of reality. Our country is an example of this spirit, and we will do everything possible for it to continue on this road. These principles are fundamental to generating trust. This is a vital condition for governing and leading the nation on the road to progress. A nation without faith in itself, its government, and its future, is prone to go under at any time. We are faced with enormous challenges in the reconstruction of our nation. The greatest effort should originate from ourselves. As a nation we are grateful for the support we received during the conflict and during the period of fulfillment of the peace agreements. We ask the international community to continue with the cooperation to totally reconstruct this nation and to consolidate peace that serves as an example for the world. [applause] To our Central American brothers, we send you our most sincere greetings. The significant political changes the world has experienced in the past years and the economic globalization process demonstrate to us the indisputable need to continue working arduously as a region to integrate [word indistinct] and find together favorable positions when facing third nations. During the last years, thanks to the regional presidents' work and dedication we have obtained significant progress toward Central American integration. Nevertheless, we also recognize there is still a long road ahead. Therefore, from here on we promise to work with our counterparts, with our best resolve and energy, within the framework of respect and sovereignty, to contribute to the progress of our peoples. Our administration's clear goal will be to achieve social peace. For this we must turn El Salvador into a nation of opportunities, with social [word indistinct]. [applause] The lack of opportunity to progress causes poverty and frustration. We have just come out of a conflict that to a great extent was the result of despair over the lack of opportunities. A large number of our compatriots live in poverty. We must break the vicious circle of he who is born poor must die poor. [applause] We will give special attention to education, health, child protection, and the environment. We must work toward solving these big problems through the participation of all Salvadorans. We will foster support programs for human promotion to improve the standard of living. We will put our efforts in the people to achieve human, social, economic, and political development, so that this can be a truly sustained development. This demands a different attitude, a different frame of mind, and a different focus that will allow us to move onto the path of modernization and which, in turn, will allow us to cope firmly with the challenges of the new millennium. We must stress the best characteristics all Salvadorans have -- our creativity and hard-working nature -- because this is our greatest resource. We have attained peace, and now the guns are silent. Nevertheless, we must still do away with senseless rivalries and antagonism. We must rebuild our nation in a physical, moral, and spiritual manner in order that, together, we can achieve a social peace that will be a new means of attaining harmony, respect, security, and participation among all Salvadorans. [applause] Social peace must be born in our homes, taught in our schools, and improved in the workplace. This is the best legacy we can leave to our children, who are the future for which we are working today. We will prepare our youth to enable them to face the challenges of the future, guide them along a productive path in all branches of human knowledge, and work hard in order that Salvadoran youths be able to live, study, and work in a dignified and happy manner. Our government will promote reforms that will lead to obtaining the greatest possible degree of efficiency in our work. Now that all currents of political thought are gradually uniting over the social market economy, efficient government will mark the basic difference in our ability to satisfy the hopes of the people and to maintain their support. Therefore, we are going to carry out a thorough reform program in the public sector that will satisfy the demands of a free, participative, and unified society that will promote the most efficient use of resources and will improve the quality of services. During this process, we will seek adequate means to decentralize and stimulate the private sector's participation in government services in an orderly and gradual manner, as well as in accordance with the capabilities of local governments and the private sector. We are going to help strengthen the municipalities to enable them to assume the responsibilities that result from the decentralization of public services and that will heighten their sensitivity to the needs of their citizens. In this way, we will seek mechanisms that will allow greater participation of the communities so that they can become key players in resolving their problems and promoting their own development. In this way, we will be respecting their dignity and putting an end to the state paternalism that has inhibited the initiative of the people. In our government work, we will try to strengthen the democratic model to create a solid foundation that will lead us to stable and lasting social harmony. Now that all political beliefs have room and freedom in our society to express themselves, we must defend ideological pluralism in the face of systematic confrontation, authoritarian impositions, arrogance, and political violence. All political parties, social organizations... [applause; Calderon Sol repeats himself] all political parties, social organizations, and the government must maintain an open and sincere dialogue to reject and eradicate, as much as possible, those practices that generate excessive passion, hatred, and violence, all of which undermine democracy and take away freedom from the individual. [applause] All political groups are present in the Legislative Assembly. As president, our work requires sweeping dialogue and support to carry out the government plan. We want to tell the opposition that we are going to maintain open channels of communication with the assembly to listen to its opinions and to reach a basic consensus. We hope to have a constructive opposition so that, together, we will find the best options for our people. [applause] In a similar manner, we will work with various civil organizations to attain alliances in terms of our government plan and to find solutions to specific problems. Dialogue, sincere communication, and the fulfilling of commitments are basic requirements for generating confidence, progressing with determination, and governing in a way that reflects the hope of the people. I would like to speak of an institution that, as an integral part of society, has already begun a process of renovation to accommodate itself within the new peace process: our Armed Forces. [applause] Our Armed Forces have a clear mission and full knowledge of the role they must play within the Republic's renovated institutional picture. It is with great pleasure that its commander greets the military institution, in general, and wishes it a promising future [applause] while fulfilling its patriotic duties within the Constitution's framework. We wish to reiterate to all Salvadorans and the international community that is amply represented on this occasion our decision to comply properly with the peace accords, because they represent the commitment [applause] not of a government or a sector, but of the whole nation. We cannot ignore that this is a necessary condition on the path of no return that will lead us to constructing social peace. [applause] Concerning justice, deep changes are necessary as well as a determination to carry them out. The Presidency is ready to do what it must do, and it will cooperate with the other state organizations in doing what they must do to ensure that our judicial system meets the requirements of a modern and democratic society. In doing so, we must strengthen judicial order. We must see to it that everyone abides by the law and that no one is above the law. [applause] We cannot speak of justice if we do not have public order, and we cannot speak of public order if we do not have a police corps that is properly trained, equipped, and deployed throughout the country. Our commitment is to make the National Civilian Police [PNC] an institution that will give true and ample protection to the people, a PNC that will strictly abide by the law, a PNC that will make us proud. [applause] I must state that we will encourage a full respect for human rights and absolute freedom for Salvadorans. In schools and through the media we will encourage the teaching of peace and a respect for these fundamental rights so that these principles will become part of our most cherished beliefs. We believe it is a state's duty to create conditions that will foster equal opportunities to all so that everyone can achieve better standards of living. We will tackle poverty by promoting plans of human development and by giving productive work to those who have nothing, thus giving them the opportunity to attain a true wellbeing. Ours is not, however, a short term vision. The real solutions aimed at eradicating poverty from its root are long term. It will take much more than one presidential term to do this; therefore, we commit ourselves to work, from day one, to create the basis for an overall permanent development. We will stress sectorial policies and investment in the people to undertake the path that will lead to human development. Education and health are the two main factors to increase human potential; education and health are also the best tool for man's advancement, for the advancement of his families, and for the advancement of the country. The coverage and quality of education are major factors. We must encourage research and technological development in order to compete in the world, which is increasingly becoming more globalized each day. We cannot stand on the sidelines of progress. We are going to promote a profound reform in education by earmarking greater resources, improving educational programs, and training teachers, to whom we convey our respect and admiration. Our goal as a country must be to reduce illiteracy to a minimum and bring quality education to the most remote area of our territory. The men and women of this nation are our greatest resource, and educating them is to invest in the future. [applause] Higher education and technical institutions are facing a major challenge; that is, to grow in step with the demands of the new El Salvador we are building. If these institutions would truly like to contribute effectively to the country's overall development, they must compete for excellence, upgrade their programs and the quality of their education, expand their potential for research, and explore new ideas to reaffirm individuals' liberty and creative capability. Health services also directly increase human potential and encourage the development of individuals. Although we have made progress in past years, the health system is still inadequate to meet the demand, thus creating frustration among the people. In this field we will also implement a profound reform by promoting methods that demonstrate they can solve health problems. As the government, we will work to solve these problems by emphasizing preventive care, seeking ways to decentralize services, and achieving greater participation by the private sector and the communities. When we talk of overall health, we are also talking of the environment, because most illnesses afflicting our country's neediest are caused by the pollution of the earth, riverbeds, and the air, as well as by the deterioration of the environment. If we do not protect our resources, we are betraying future generations, dooming them to a world of desolation due to our indifference and ineptness. Our government will play an active role, because the state has to ensure, as part of its (?complementary) duties, the protection of the environment by legislating, educating, and encouraging the implementation of adequate projects; therefore, we are going to generate policies that succeed in making growth and the environment complementary, because there can be no sustainable development if that is achieved at the expense of the environment and the extinction of our natural resources. [applause] There can be no overall social progress either if we do not meet the demand for decent housing, a large-scale problem the solving of which requires unbelievable amounts of resources and time. In past years, we have had encouraging progress in this field. We must be more daring, however, and find new ways to solve housing problems so that El Salvador can become a country of homeowners. Reforming the social security system, which is inefficient and does not provide sufficient coverage, is fundamental. We must improve the current system, which excludes almost 80 percent of the economically active population from protection. We will promote new options to expand coverage of Social Security, encouraging the participation of the private sector. We want to prevent the anguish with which most of our workers view their elderly years, because they are condemned to be a burden for their families after having spent their lives working for the country's progress. [applause] Special attention must be given to youths and sports, because our low-income youths are exposed to high-risk social situations, and only by giving them spiritual guidance, moral education, training, and healthy recreation will we have sports-minded and studious youths. Along with cultural programs, these things will bring about the overall education of the young people of El Salvador. [applause] Our social agenda is directed in one way or another at protecting the Salvadoran family, because that is where the most beautiful lessons in life are learned. Those lessons are a love of God, country, and fellow man. [applause] Many women today are responsible for their homes. They play the double role of mother and father, and their families live under difficult circumstances. For them, we will create programs that will enable them to improve their standard of living. We will also provide special protection to women, children, and the elderly. [applause] During the administration which has just concluded, great economic reforms were carried out, and noticeable progress was achieved, permitting significant growth in recent years. Our challenge now is to maintain high rates of growth and to turn them into economic growth with equality. To this end, our policy will seek to maintain conditions that will ensure stability to consolidate the confidence of the private productive sector, which is the generator of wealth, the primary agent of modernization, and the promoter of progress. [applause] Concurrently, we are going to strengthen free market competition, in which the state must act as a mediator to prevent abuses. In this field, the elimination of the imbalances that still exist will be necessary in order to provide protection to both producers and consumers. We clearly speak of freedom, not of free license, much less of any kind of privileges. [applause] Economic progress must be based on the efficiency of competition, but without losing sight of the fact the economy must play a social function, because the reason for its existence is not the accumulation of wealth but, rather, the generation of wealth to improve the quality of life and the standard of living of all citizens. [applause] In other words, it must be the vehicle to achieve the common good. Within the social market system, we are going to stimulate domestic savings and encourage private investment, both national and foreign; in this way, we want to expand the productive borders and the sources that generate resources and permanent jobs, because that is where the opportunities for individual and national progress are found. One cannot speak of greater private investment, however, if the public sector does not contribute to progress; that is why a thorough reform must urgently be undertaken to achieve efficiency in this sector and, as much as possible, to eliminate the fiscal deficit, the primary source of inflation. We must be aware that the telecommunications, electricity, water, and state infrastructure services are inefficient. They represent a financial burden for the public sector, and they restrict growth. As a result, we must urgently establish the conditions for the private sector to play a more prominent role. Therefore, we will begin a privatization process in many public services. [applause] Workers must actively participate in this process and be shareholders of these enterprises. They face the challenge of becoming workers and investors where their capability and experience contribute to progress, allowing them to directly benefit. If we talk of development with equity, with programs to reduce poverty, we must then regard economic growth and private investment as the primary source in generating jobs. This is fundamental, because employment gives dignity to individuals, allowing them to advance by the fruit of their own effort. This is not sufficient, however. We must also seek a true increase in workers' income, something that cannot be done by decree. We must train them and seek the technologies to raise labor productivity. Only in this way will we avoid inflationary pressures that diminish the value of wage increases. We understand that a harmonious relationship between workers and businessmen is necessary, because they comprise an inseparable nucleus that generates benefits for the country. The informal sector of the economy and small-scale businesses generate most jobs. Under our government, training programs aimed at these sectors will be especially important, as will be the funneling of loans in market conditions. We will promote a joint effort aimed at upgrading the capability to produce and the efficiency of these sectors so that their goods and services will improve the quality of their products, and, therefore, their revenues. Likewise, all sectors of the economy face the challenge of modernization and constant technological changes if they want to stay in the market. Though meeting internal demands must be an important objective, conquering new international markets must become the goal of every Salvadoran businessman, given it is there where the opportunities to expand our commercial borders as a country lie. Agriculture is one sector that demands attention. We are committed to encouraging productive changes, stimulating technological progress and training, as well as guaranteeing the right to property and personal security in the countryside. [applause] We shall create special programs to encourage personal and family progress for peasants within the agrarian reform program [sector reformado]. We are going to jointly establish conditions that free them from any sort of political manipulation so that they can play an active role in their own development and ensure that they can acquire property when they wish. During El Salvador's new era, tourism will play an important role, because it generates resources and jobs. We must prepare ourselves to offer the best of our natural resources as well as the personal warmth that characterizes us. We believe we speak for all Salvadorans when we say our goal as a society is to attain social and economic development; nevertheless, it must be realized this demands great amounts of resources, investments in both human resources and the infrastructure. These resources should be supplied mainly by us, Salvadorans, meaning we must all contribute to the country by paying our taxes. [applause] We are going to fight decidedly against the culture of tax evasion and fraud until one day we can say with satisfaction: I can demand, because I pay my taxes. I can demand, because I am a tax contributor. [applause] I can demand, because I contribute to making my country big and prosperous. As this new government takes office, we reaffirm we have only one commitment with El Salvador and its people: to build a better future. We do not want to create false hopes, because there are no miracles along the road to progress. There is serious and coordinated work, however, that must be carried out with dedication and as a team trying to interpret the people's true feelings and aspirations. Our objective is to execute our government plan and fulfill the promises we made during the campaign. We will do so with everyone's support and by joining our efforts and volition. Our challenge is to build a better country for all, with equal opportunity for each of us to progress according to our effort and will to succeed. With every action we must bear in mind that the solution to our problems must arise from our own efforts as a community and as a nation, overcoming any temptation of state paternalism and ensuring respect from the international community. My fellow countrymen, our country is beginning today a new phase in the transition toward a consolidated democracy, for which our country has been working since 1982. We realize the new government, being the first presidential inauguration of the postwar era, brings high hopes and opens new horizons for national development. We must say we are fully aware we are not here just to do a job but to accomplish a mission. It is a moral job, a job with political content and historical responsibility. This job, in essence, calls for hard work and requires a degree of effectiveness that will allow the people to see the benefits of democracy in their day to day life, not only on the political level but on social, economic, and cultural levels as well. [applause] We promise the nation and the world we will not fail in this vital task, as the future depends on our success. Our administration will be the last historic step toward the new century; thus, it symbolizes the challenge we now face in favor of peace, democracy, and development. We have come to the Presidency to continue the promotion of an ongoing process, but we are well aware our true task will be to demand a large dose of creativity and imagination, capability, and sensibility. We will not shy away from this challenge, because we are sure we will have the people's understanding and support. They will be the comptroller and judge of our actions. In order to succeed in this truly patriotic endeavor, we invoke the grace and inspiration of our Lord, the Savior of the world, that He might enlighten our decisions and provide the strength and wisdom to bring them to life for the good of our nation and each and every Salvadoran. May the Lord guide us to work together to make a new El Salvador, as that is the only way we will live a better life.
