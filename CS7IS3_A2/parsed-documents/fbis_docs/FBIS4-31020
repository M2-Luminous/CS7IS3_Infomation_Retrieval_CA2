FBIS4-31020 "dreeu106__a94032" FBIS-EEU-94-106-A Daily Report 31 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Treaty With Hungary To Simplify Border Crossing Treaty With Hungary To Simplify Border Crossing AU0106101594 Prague CTK in English 1848 GMT 31 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0106101594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 31 (CTK) -- The signing of the Hungarian-Slovak readmission agreement, the draft of which was approved by the Slovak cabinet today, would open new prospects in relations between the two countries, Slovak Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner told CTK today. "The signature of the readmission agreement will naturally also simplify the question of opening further border crossings," Pittner said. The draft agreement has been prepared in cooperation with Hungary, but it would be necessary, unofficial Foreign Ministry sources say, to discuss its wording with the new Hungarian Government. Pittner described the draft agreement as similar to readmission agreements already concluded between Slovakia and its other neighbors. The only exception is a provision concerning the deadline for returning persons to Hungary, according to which illegal refugees have to be returned in 48 hours. Hungary has so far linked the signing of the Hungarian-Slovak readmission agreement with the opening of new border crossings and a change of a similar Slovak-Romanian agreement, which does not include a provision on returning refugees from third countries. In contrast to this, the Slovak Government of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar made the opening of the border crossings conditional on the signing of the agreement, rejecting Hungary's proposal that only Hungarian citizens be returned.
