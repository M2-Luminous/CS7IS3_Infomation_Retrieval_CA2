FBIS4-19203 "drweu073__a94014" FBIS-WEU-94-073-A Daily Report 15 April 1994 ANNEX Germany NVA Expert Confirms Use of German Tanks Against Kurds NVA Expert Confirms Use of German Tanks Against Kurds AU1404152294 Hamburg DPA in German 1315 GMT 14 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1404152294 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- According to a former GDR officer, the Turkish military is using German tanks against Kurds. They come from the stocks of the former National People's Army [NVA] but, before their delivery to Turkey, they were technically reequipped for the Bundeswehr, the former NVA colonel confirmed to the ARD magazine program "Monitor." As Westdeutscher Rundfunk [WDR] announced in Cologne on Thursday [14 April], tank expert Lothar Mann used film material from "Monitor" to identify tanks recently used against Kurds as military equipment from former GDR stocks. "These tanks -- they are BTR 60 PB armored personnel carriers -- clearly come from the stocks of the former NVA." According to the WDR, the military expert noted that the tanks could have been delivered to Turkey only after having been reequipped for the Bundeswehr. "Proof of that are the changes that have been made on the vehicles, which were made in connection with the transition to the licensing regulation under the FRG traffic code -- such as rearview mirrors." Thus, it is quite clear for Mann that these vehicles are not deliveries from the former Soviet Union or from Russia but German tanks. The WDR pointed out that, even in the last few days, Turkey had claimed the tanks used against Kurds came from Russia. FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (FDP) on Wednesday said in the Bundestag that it has not yet been proven Turkey has used German weapons in the country against Kurds in violation of the treaty. In contrast, on Thursday the "Kurdistan Information Office" in Cologne announced that the delivery of German weapons of all kinds to Turkey, "with which Kurds are massacred," has indeed been proved. Concerning the discussion about the deportation of Kurds to Turkey, the Information Office said that politically active deported Kurds are threatened in Turkey with torture and treatment that violates human rights. It would be pointless to conclude a deportation agreement with Turkey. Turkey has also signed the European Convention of Human Rights, the Antitorture Convention, and the Geneva Refugee Convention without ever adhering to these agreements.
