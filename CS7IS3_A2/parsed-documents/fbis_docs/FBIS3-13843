Abrik al-Suwaysi was chosen as official spokesman for the organization's constituent committee. The committee included in its founding statement its overall intellectual and political view of the situation in Libya and possibilities for change. It stressed that it will continue its contacts to convene the constituent conference to form organizational institutions. It also pointed out that its mission ends with the convening of the constituent assembly and that its framework is open to all Libyans who agree with the principles it announced. Al-Suwaysi told AL-HAYAH that "the announcement of the statement from Geneva has no political significance. We had hoped to announce the organization from a neighboring state, but current circumstances did not permit." He expressed his hope that the constituent conference will be held within four or five months. "The constituent committee is preparing for it and has not set a particular date for it, because we are still at the beginning." He said that "the Libyan National Army, which is led by Staff Colonel Khalifah Haftar, is an integral part of the organization, as it consists of our comrades who decided to separate from the Salvation Front for the same reasons that prompted us to break away. Col. Haftar is a founding member of the political organization and has both the political and military capacity. However, the Army will not be confined to those who join the organization, but will be open to all Libyans wishing to make sacrifices. We do not make it a condition that membership of the organization be confined to those who want to participate in its military program."
