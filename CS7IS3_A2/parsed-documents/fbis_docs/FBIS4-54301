However, Chaisit admitted that it was not possible that the men were still in Thailand. Mohammadt Lotfollah and Hossein Shahriarifar, both about 40 years old, have been identified by police in connection with the plot. Police said they had asked Interpol to help. "We still don't know where they are living but we are certain that they left the country through the southern border of Thailand," Chaisit said. The plot was unveiled on March 17 when the owner went to claim his truck, which had been taken to Lumphini police station a week earlier. Police then discovered a one-tonne water tank full of powdered ammonium nitrate, large quantities of C-4 plastic explosive wired to detonators and four 25-litre containers filled with diesel oil in the back of the truck. The body of the man who delivered the truck to the alleged saboteurs was found in the water tank. According to police, the truck had been stored at the police station since being involved in a minor accident at Phloenchit intersection, about 100 metres from the Israeli embassy, on March 11.
