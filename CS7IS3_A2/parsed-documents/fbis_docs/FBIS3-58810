Is this assessment also a result of your contacts? [Klestil] First of all, on account of my contacts, I am sure that Austria is assessed in a particularly positive way in all EC capitals. We are treated as if we were already fully integrated. My second assessment is that we achieved an enormous success before Christmas regarding the question of the environmental package. It is an Austrian habit to always assess our successes very modestly -- but a terrific thing happened. The European Union [EU] adjusted its lower environmental protection standards to that of Austria's. Thus, small Austria did not adjust itself to the lower environmental protection standards, but rather the big EC states adopted our particularly high environmental standards. This is an incredible success in the negotiations. If the same concessions are made to us in the remaining open questions, then the date in March may work out absolutely. [NEWS] Do you believe that it is still possible to conclude the negotiations in March and carry out the referendum in June? [Klestil] This target date is certainly very important because, on the one hand, it puts pressure on both sides and, on the other hand, it forces everyone to work day and night to achieve this date. [NEWS] In your opinion, are the negotiations currently stagnating, or is this pessimism mere tactics? [Klestil] It is certainly not tactics. There are really several very important open questions regarding the topics of agriculture and transit. In March, provincial diet elections will be held in the provinces that are affected most by these questions -- for example, Tirol -- which clearly complicates an objective discussion. But even without the pressure of these elections, the following would have been valid: The result is more important than the date. [NEWS] There is also the attitude that we have to hurry with our entry because the situation in Russia might jeopardize Europe's security. [Klestil] A delay would, of course, be deplorable. Precisely in view of the speedy change of the political situation around us, I would prefer all that to be settled in March. Therefore, both things are very important for me: that we achieve both the March target and the June referendum with great commitment and a result in the negotiations that is convincing and that one can present to the people with self-confidence. In the next few weeks, all our energy really has to be aimed at Brussels. The conclusion of the negotiations in March, a referendum in June, and entry into the European Community in early 1995 -- this would be the ideal schedule. [NEWS] In the political scene in Vienna, there is currently a very decisive question: How much will you personally commit yourself to the European Community in the election campaign before the referendum? [Klestil] First of all, I will have a close look at the result of the negotiations and exclusively assess it according to Austria's interests. I will then clearly give my opinion on this result of the negotiations. I will state my point of view on this question for or against the European Community. And the citizen can deduce a guideline from it, if he wants. I will state my point of view very clearly before the referendum. [NEWS] In favor of the European Community. [Klestil] My basic attitude toward the European integration process is known. I pursued it very consistently over the past few years. [NEWS] What will happen if the negotiating teams do not achieve an agreement by March? [Klestil] This will be deplorable, but it will not be a tragedy. [NEWS] In that case, would you clearly come out in favor of advanced Nationalrat elections in June so that the referendum can take place in the autumn and the process of entry will be accelerated? [Klestil] It is exclusively the business of the Nationalrat to decide when the Nationalrat elections will be held. It is not my task to give advice here, not in public. [NEWS] And behind the scenes? [Klestil] When my opinion was asked during my regular contacts with government members, I always stated it very openly. [NEWS] That is, the advancement of the Nationalrat elections to the spring so that a new government can carry out the EC referendum unburdened in the autumn? [Klestil] This is certainly a possible variant. However, by all means, the date by which we have to become an EC member is 1 January 1996. The main decisions on the political future of the European Union will be made in 1996. Joint security policy, joint foreign policy, and joint monetary policy will then be discussed -- all decisive security questions. It is my wish that Austria will be able to participate in the decisions and have a say. [NEWS] We are currently witnessing a race for NATO membership of the former East Bloc states surrounding us. You said two years ago that you think that neutrality presently is outdated, and you were criticized severely for it at that time.... [Klestil] I said that the State Treaty has to be considered fulfilled and, therefore, obsolete. Because otherwise there will be the danger that successor states of the Soviet Union suddenly will call for their rights as partners of Austria. The developments that have taken place so far have borne me out. Referring to neutrality, I said that it has to be adjusted to the new reality. If you have a look at the threats of today, which go far beyond the military sphere -- floods of refugees, drug-related crime, organized crime -- a new way of thinking is required in the field of security. Neutrality has never been an end in itself; neutrality serves security -- and if a collective security system that serves security more than neutrality is developed in Europe, then one should be able to think about it.
