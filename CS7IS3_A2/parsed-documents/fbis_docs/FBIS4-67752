It also noted with satisfaction that the European Commission has carried out preliminary action along these lines which will allow dialogue with the other Community institutions. The EP, that is particularly concerned about the "immense" risks entailed by the collapse of the Soviet system for the control of nuclear exports and the possibility that some of the 2000 to 3000 USSR specialists in the nuclear weapons field will turn into "nuclear mercenaries," calls on the Union to insist upon the establishment of a universal control regime of the complete uranium and plutonium cycle for civilian use (also possibly of thorium), including material from the military cycle further to the partial dismantling of military arsenals. The EP notes that between 27,000 and 30,000 nuclear tactical and strategic weapons are stockpiled in the former Soviet Union alone. It also stresses the importance that the European Energy Charter attaches to nuclear energy and its safety, and the strategic role that this form of energy plays in energy supply and in the CIS' export potential. In its resolution, the EP calls on the European Union, on the basis of Article VII of the NPT, to carry out political action aimed at encouraging the creation of denuclearised zones: The Parliament notes that, further to South Africa's accession to NPT, the African continent may be considered as a denuclearised zone, and calls on the Union for vigorous diplomatic action so that Brazil may follow the example of Cuba which joined the Tlatelolco Treaty. This would also make Latin America a nuclear weapon-free region. The EP states that the EU should include conditionality clauses on nuclear non-proliferation in cooperation agreements with third countries and that the cooperation actions eventually established by these agreements in nuclear energy matters should be strictly limited to the use of this type of energy for peaceful purposes. Such clauses should particularly be included in agreements with the CIS and Eastern European countries and the International Centre for Science and Technology in Moscow should make it possible for nuclear experts to specialize in energy applications. In addition, Parliament notes that: - in the context of the Middle East peace talks, a denuclearized zone should be created in the region; - the Commission departments responsible for security checks in the framework of the Euratom Treaty should apply the provisions on controls of exports of nuclear material to North Korea as stringently as possible. Lastly, the EP calls for useless duplication between the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna) and the security control mechanisms established under Article 77 of the Euratom Treaty to be avoided.
