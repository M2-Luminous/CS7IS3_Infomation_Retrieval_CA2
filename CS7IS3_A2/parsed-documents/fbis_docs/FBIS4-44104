[Pillinini] The manned component of the air defense consists today of seven squadrons of E-104S aircraft. This aircraft is still able to provide optimal performance as a pure interceptor. However, there is a need for an aircraft which can oppose new generation aircraft and which has a sufficient flying range, including via inflight refueling, and is able to operate internationally. The arms system able to meet this requirement has been identified in the form of the Eurofighter 2000, the fruit of cooperation of the aircraft industries of Italy, Great Britain, Germany, and Spain. In the program, the Air Force has made provision for a total of 130 aircraft. And it should be pointed out that 130 aircraft are the minimum number which are essential in order to secure the defense of our national airspace, compared with an "optimal" demand originally put at 165 aircraft. The first two prototypes (the German and the English) flew early spring, but the line can be operational only from 2002 onward. From the need to secure the continuity of the manned aircraft defense system, where we risk a crisis of continuity between the E-104-ASA and the E.F.-2000, there arose the demand for a transitional solution which makes operational sense within the new strategic context and which is feasible in our country's present situation. We had to assess the possibility of having aircraft available at short notice, taking account also the effects of involving the Armed Forces with a new model of aircraft, with its subsequent impact on equipment and all the technical-logistical and financial repercussions. At the same time, the Air Force and the government remained firmly resolved to continue the Eurofighter program. From among the solutions assessed, which involved leasing quotas of F-15's, F-16's, and Tornado ADV's, we went for the solution of leasing 24 Tornado ADV's from the RAF [Royal Air Force] for 10 years (1995-2005), and operating them alongside around 100 modified E-104-ASA's. These modifications involve work to extend the life and improve the technical reliability of the aircraft and the engines, and adding certain avionics subsystems. I believe the Tornado ADV/E-104-ASAM solution, which is the fruit of a careful and realistic examination of the situation, is the optimal answer for the Armed Forces, from the viewpoint of acquiring the E.F.-2000 at the beginning of the next decade. [Di Risio] There is a recurrent demand for economy and the need to restructure the military instrument without delay, making it smaller but more flexible and effective. How has the Air Force confronted this problem, in particular in terms of air bases? [Pillinini] The air bases are a key element in the ability of the Air Force to operate. The restructuring of the Air Force, which moreover is already under way with the scrapping of obsolete aircraft, which have not been replaced, appeared to be leading possibly to the closing of certain bases with obvious potential management savings. In fact, after careful examination, this proved impossible, given that the majority of our airports lack sufficient reception capacity for the units which continue to exist. Increasing such reception capacity would require considerable resources for expropriating land, the construction of new infrastructures, and so on, involving investments which today are certainly not possible. Moreover, certain of our airports are open to civilian traffic. Despite this, we are working to transfer the combat units from certain airports (Brindisi, Rimini, and Treviso) which are now completely enclosed by residential areas. However, we have to continue to keep the structures and services in these airports operational. Finally, we decided that the 24 air bases in operation today can be reduced to 20, but we will not achieve any savings unless we can close and abandon the installations for good. [Di Risio] The 46th Airborne Brigade, stationed at Pisa, is being committed more and more frequently during operations, often very far from Italy, in ever less safe operating theaters (Somalia, Mozambique, Yemen, Rwanda). Within this delicate operating sector, which is seeing Italy involved in the international arena, what is the present situation of Air Transportation and what are the programs for confronting future needs? [Pillinini] The importance of transport aircraft has been recognized unambiguously in the New Defense Model itself which, against a background of general cuts in personnel and resources, provides for a significant increase in the transportation fleet. Right now, however, we can count on a line of G-222's which, even though available in sufficient number and ideal in certain climatic conditions, does not meet the demands of medium- to long-range transport, and on a series of C-130 "Hercules," available in a fairly limited number but which is also able to meet long-range needs. In the short term, there are no plans for acquiring new aircraft and we will therefore continue to operate with the same craft, which will, however, require technical work in the form of a midlife modernization. Work is going ahead on a new aircraft, the "Future Large Aircraft" (FLA), in which Germany, France, and the other European countries are also interested, and which ought to respond to our global transportation demands. Assuming the program is continued, the aircraft will not, however, be available before the second half of the next decade. In the intervening period, a buffer solution will perhaps have to be sought in this area as well. [Di Risio] Why is compensation slow at being imposed in the case of aerial incidents involving the civilian population? [Pillinini] Compensation for damage in the case of aerial incidents involving the civilian population involves extremely delicate and difficult themes. It is true, right now there are people who have suffered damage who have not been compensated, or only partially. In the present state of affairs, the complexity of the administrative procedure in force for defining compensation for damages by means of individual settlements renders pointless the considerable amount of committed work undertaken by the Defense Ministry's Directorate General for Disputes, generating a large number of disagreements and polemics, including suits for damages. The time periods involved are considerably lengthened if the damaged parties, instead of respecting the proposed settlements, prefer to take recourse to the Civil Judicial Authorities, or if the families of the victims put in private claims for damages, alongside the prosecution. In this direction the Air Force General Staff has since 1986 been committed to promoting Law No. 424 of 27 October 1993 which, as from 1 January 1986, provides, within a relatively short time frame, for intervention to assist citizens and victims of incidents occurring during operational and training activities. We believe that it is now necessary to align our legislation without delay with that of the most advanced nations, through organic reform of the legislation governing the consequences of such incidents, with provisions for a procedure for paying compensation for damage within a shorter time frame. In this respect we are undertaking certain detailed examinations in order to make operating proposals. At the same time, it would be a good thing to provide better legal aid and assistance to the military personnel involved in carrying out activities connected with the Armed Forces institutional tasks. In this regard it would be desirable, within the present legislative period, to approve an initiative, presented in 1979 and proposed again during the present legislative period by Senator Savio, based on which -- while maintaining the principle of compensation by the state for damage to private individuals -- the responsibility of military personnel involved in incidents to pay compensation out of their own pocket be limited to cases of intent to cause damage or serious fault, with military personnel defended free-of-charge in court by the State Attorney's Office or by a freely chosen attorney of confidence, subject to recourse by the administration where liability for malicious incident is ascertained.
