A provincial government official in charge of agriculture said that the Jihu project, with a total investment of 445 million yuan including 60 million U.S. dollars loaned by the World Bank, began four years ago. It was aimed at setting up production bases for domestic animals, poultry and forestry and developing the processing industry for farm and sideline products. To ensure the smooth operation of the project, local governments have offered a package of production-supply-marketing services for farmers. One who has benefited from the arrangement is Wang Doubin, a farmer in Zhangshu City who borrowed 95,000 yuan in loans to set up a pig farm in late 1990. By the end of 1992, he had sold 828 lean meat pigs and had 38 breeding hogs and 277 meat pigs in stock. His net income that year amounted to 42,000 yuan. The farmer paid off all the loans within three years. Wang is a typical example of 1,800 households that have begun to pay off loans ahead of schedule. A survey shows that the project has enabled local farmers to create an annual output value of more than 600 million yuan and generate profits and taxes totalling 150 million yuan. The annual income of farmers involved in the project averages 3,000 yuan per participant, about five times that of local farmers. By the end of last year, the project had recovered 3.134 million yuan to go toward retiring World Bank loans.
