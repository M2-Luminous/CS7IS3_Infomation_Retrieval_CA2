Before his visit to Saudi Arabia, Mubarak visited Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain and held talks with officials. During the visit, Mubarak is discussing regional and Arab problems with the host countries. The Egyptian president and the countries' officials still place special emphasis on developments in the Persian Gulf and on the process of the Arab governments' talks with the Zionist regime. The Egyptian president's visit to Persian Gulf countries is noteworthy. First, basically speaking, the Egyptian regime--especially during the Mubarak era--focuses special attention on the Persian Gulf in its regional policy. This interest stems largely from the Egyptian regime's economic desires for the Persian Gulf countries' wealth. Thus, this regime is always seeking a pretext to expand its relations with these countries and to score economic points through these relations. After the Persian Gulf war, on the pretext of ensuring the security of the Persian Gulf's southern littoral countries, Egypt became one of the founders of the Damascus security pact, the six-plus-two pact, which failed because of its ambiguous and suspicious nature and because it lacked a specific identity. Since then, the Egyptian Government has constantly resorted to political intervention and propaganda efforts to create security tension in the Persian Gulf in a bid to ensure a base for itself. But apart from exporting manpower to Saudi Arabia to replace the 1.5-million-strong Yemeni manpower, which was ousted because of Yemen's political stance in the Persian Gulf, Egypt has been unable to achieve much. The second noteworthy point in Mubarak's Persian Gulf tour is the link between this tour and the Persian Gulf's move to welcome the Zionist regime under the guise of multilateral sessions, the first of which was held in the Omani capital, Muscat, last week. The second such session is to be held in Qatar in a few days, while the third is to be held in Bahrain. The Egyptian regime is playing the role of middleman for a compromise between the occupying Zionist regime and Arab regimes and considers itself as having a special mission in this. When the Muslim public is enraged with the direct or indirect establishment of ties and with publicizing these ties, Mubarak considers it his duty to support a compromise. It is noteworthy that Mubarak's tour coincides with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's departure for the region to activate the slow, heavy wheels of compromise. Some sources say that on the first leg of his tour, Christopher will visit the Saudi capital, Riyadh, and will hold a joint session on Wednesday morning with the foreign ministers of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council. Another point that should not be ignored is the scheduling of Mubarak's visit, which is being carried out before the religious-political Hajj pilgrimage. Last year too the head of the Egyptian regime visited southern Persian Gulf states, most notably Saudi Arabia. Political observers are considering the negative impacts of Mubarak's visit.
