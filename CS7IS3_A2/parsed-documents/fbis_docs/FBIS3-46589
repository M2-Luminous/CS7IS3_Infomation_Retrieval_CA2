A senior Foreign Ministry official on 21 December commented on the apparent change in the U.S. stance. He said: "It is a feint operation. There is no change in the U.S. belief in the importance of trade results. American experts and the media have criticized the way the United States has pushed for numerical targets as a way of seeking managed trade. The United States is probably shying away from using the term numerical targets in the face of this criticism." He continued: "The substance of the U.S. policy of attaching more importance to trade results than on the market opening process, and of pressing Japan to raise the share of foreign goods in the Japanese market to levels comparable with the rest of the G-7 nations, remains unchanged."
