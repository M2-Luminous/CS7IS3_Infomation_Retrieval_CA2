The authority citation for part 213 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 3301 and 3302, E.O. 10577, 3 CFR 1954&hyph;1958 Comp., p. 218; section 213.101 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 2103; section 213.3102 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 3301, 3302, 3307, 8337(h) and 8456; E.O. 12364, 47 FR 22931, 3 CFR 1982 Comp., p. 185. 2. Section 213.3301 is revised and section 213.3301b is removed to read as follows: §213.3301 Positions of a confidential or policy-determining nature. (a) Upon specific authorization by OPM, agencies may make appointments under this section to positions which are policy-determining or which involve a close and confidential working relationship with the head of an agency or other key appointed officials. Positions filled under this authority are excepted from the competitive service and constitute Schedule C. Each position will be assigned a number from 213.3302 to 213.3999, or other appropriate number, to be used by the agency in recording appointments made under that authorization. (b) When requesting Schedule C exception, agencies must submit to OPM a statement signed by the agency head certifying that the position was not created solely or primarily for the purpose of detailing the incumbent to the White House. (c) The exception from the competitive service for each position listed in Schedule C by OPM is revoked immediately upon the position becoming vacant. An agency shall notify OPM within 3 working days after a Schedule C position has been vacated. 3. Section 213.3302 is revised to read as follows: §213.3302 Temporary transitional Schedule C positions. (a) An agency may establish temporary transitional Schedule C positions necessary to assist a department or agency head during the 1-year period immediately following a change in presidential administration, when a new department or agency head has entered on duty, or when a new department or agency is created. These positions may be established only to meet legitimate needs of the agency in carrying out its mission during the period of transition associated with such changeovers. They must be of a confidential or policy-determining character and are subject to instructions issued by OPM. (b) The number of temporary transitional Schedule C positions established by an agency cannot exceed either 50 percent of the highest number of permanent Schedule C positions filled by that agency at any time over the previous 5 years, or three positions, whichever is higher. In the event a new department or agency is created, the number of temporary transitional positions should be reasonable in light of the size and program responsibility of that department or agency. (c) Individual appointments under this authority may be made for 120 days, with one extension of an additional 120 days. They may be deemed provisional appointments for purpose of the regulations set out in parts 351, 831, 842, 870, and 890 of this chapter if they meet the criteria set out in §§316.401 and 316.403 of this chapter. (d) An agency shall notify OPM within 5 working days after a temporary transitional Schedule C position has been encumbered, and within 3 working days when it has been vacated. The agency must also submit to OPM a statement signed by the agency head certifying that the position was not created solely or primarily for the purpose of detailing the incumbent to the White House.
