FR941222-0-00106 FR941222-0-00015 39 CFR Part 111 Revisions to Weight and Preparation Standards for Barcoded Letter Mail AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning the maximum weight of an automation-compatible barcoded letter-size mailpiece. Subject to additional preparation requirements, certain barcoded mailpieces weighing more than 3 ounces will be acceptable at Barcoded rates for a trial period of up to 1 year. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 16, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anthony M. Pajunas, (202) 268&hyph;3669. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 14, 1994, the Postal Service published for public comment in the Federal Register (59 FR 35873&hyph;35875) a proposed rule to amend the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards for the physical characteristics of automation-compatible barcoded letter-size mail. For a period of up to 1 year, the Postal Service proposed to conduct a live test of barcoded bulk third-class regular rate letter mail weighing between 3.0 and 3.3067 ounces, and First-, second-, and bulk third-class nonprofit rate letter mail weighing between 3.0 and 3.3363 ounces. Although the Postal Service believes that this mail can benefit from barcoding (as the means of moving this mail into an automated processing environment), it also believes that this benefit can be achieved only under specific standards governing the construction and preparation of this ``heavy letter mail.'' Thus, the proposed new standards required that each ``heavy letter'' mailpiece comply with the following: (1) Be part of a mailing that is 100 percent delivery point barcoded. (2) Have the barcode in the address block. (3) Be in an envelope that has no open windows. (4) Not be bound or have stiff enclosures. The Postal Service proposed to set the maximum weight for Barcoded rate letter-size mailpieces at 3.3363 ounces (or 3.3067 ounces for pieces mailed at regular bulk third-class rates), the break points between the bulk third-class minimum per-piece rates and the two-part piece/pound rates then in effect. (These values increase to 3.3376 and 3.3071 ounces, respectively, when R94 rates are implemented on January 1, 1995. The increased values are used in the text and DMM revisions appearing below.) If the maximum weight were set at 3.3 ounces, a small amount of letter-size minimum per-piece mail would be excluded from the rates otherwise available to letter mail. For simplicity and consistency, the maximum weight for First- and second-class barcoded letter mail was also proposed to be set at 3.3376 ounces. For regular bulk third-class rate only, the maximum is set at 3.3071 ounces, which is its ``break point.'' If the proposed test or changes in the ``break point'' indicate that this alignment is not in the best interest of the Postal Service, the maximum weight will be adjusted accordingly. The Postal Service received 14 comments on the proposed rule, including three from mailing industry trade associations, one from a mailing-related business, and 10 from companies and corporations. The specific topics covered in those comments are discussed below. Consideration of Letter Mail Heavier Than 3.0 Ounces for Automation Rates All 14 commenters expressed support for the Postal Service's efforts to conduct live tests of barcoded letters weighing between 3.0 and 3.3376 ounces (or 3.3071 ounces for third-class regular rate mail). One commenter encouraged consideration for a much higher weight limit. The Postal Service believes that for the heavy letter-mail test period, the maximum weight should be limited to 3.3376 ounces. Previous controlled tests conducted by the Postal Service revealed that increased problems (such as damage, jams, and throughput) arose or worsened with mail heavier than 3.3376 ounces. Another commenter (a mailing company) supported the Postal Service's effort but expressed doubts that presort service bureaus would accept address-block barcoded heavy letter mail to run through their automated equipment because of possible machine jams, lowered machine throughput, and the requirement for 100 percent delivery point barcoding. Participation in this test is voluntary. Although the Postal Service realizes that some companies will be unable to participate, it does not believe that the objectives of the test can be served if the test criteria are altered. The Postal Service believes that it will be able, under the requirements adopted by this rule, to obtain sufficient participation to conduct a valid test. Requirement for Enveloped Mailpieces Two comments were received opposing the proposed standard that all heavy letter mail be in envelopes. One commenter thought that the heavy letter mail tests should be conducted using mailpieces constructed under current standards and encouraged the use of tabbed catalogs during the trial period. One commenter recommended the inclusion of self-mailers. The Postal Service believes that only enveloped mail should be tested as part of this trial and that the proposed restriction on self-mailers and on bound or booklet-type mail should remain. The preliminary tests were performed only on enveloped mailpieces that were heavier than 3.0 ounces and not on tabbed catalogs. The Postal Service has recently tested tabbed catalogs weighing 3.3 ounces on its automated equipment and found that such pieces caused equipment jams and were more susceptible to damage. As a result, the Postal Service believes that it is prudent to proceed to test only enveloped mail. Accordingly, that portion of the proposed rule that specified only enveloped mail would be eligible for the test will be retained in the final rule. In allowing only enveloped mail in the proposed test, the Postal Service is seeking to evaluate the performance of heavy letter mail having the best opportunity for successful automated processing, insofar as that can be predicted by physical criteria. Accordingly, in addition to retaining its focus on enveloped mail, the Postal Service also wishes to point out that by including heavy letter mail in the general category of automation-compatible mail for the test period, it is expecting that this mail will be prepared in trays, as is currently the case for other automation-compatible letter mail. Although the proposed rule did not explicitly discuss this point, the Postal Service finds it appropriate to emphasize this point in the final rule as a logical corollary to the temporary transfer of heavy letter mail into the automation-compatible category. Restriction of Open-Windowed Envelopes Four comments were received opposing the standard that heavy letter mail not be in envelopes with open windows. The Postal Service has conducted tests in which preliminary results indicate that open windows on mailpieces above 3.0 ounces have a greater tendency to snag on automated processing equipment. The Postal Service is also concerned about damage to the heavy letter mailpieces with open windows and other mail that might be adjacent to it during automated processing. Thus, the Postal Service has determined to retain the proposed prohibition of open-windowed envelopes in the final rule. 100% Delivery Point Barcode Requirement
