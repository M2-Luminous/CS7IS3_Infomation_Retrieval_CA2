In July 1993 his signature appeared on that famous "Document of the 29," which called upon the Sandinist party leadership to take a clear position opposing Violeta de Chamorro's government. Six months later, in January 1994, he attended a meeting of about 50 members of the Pikin Guerrero Union School, which some members of the National Directorate also attended. Here the Discussion Forum or faction to which he belongs was formed. Julio Lopez Campos has agreed to answer our questions. [Lacayo Guerra] You are one of the promoters of a faction called Sandinist Left. What does that mean? Is not the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] itself a party of the left, entirely composed of people on the left? [Lopez Campos] First of all, we are not a Sandinist Front faction. If you check the public statements of the Democratic Left Discussion Forum, we have never claimed to be a faction. As the name clearly indicates, we are a discussion forum, that is, a large group of Sandinist comrades who are promoting democratic debate within the FSLN structures. [Lacayo Guerra] What do you mean by faction? [Lopez Campos] Faction? The only faction here is the one led by our comrades Sergio Ramirez and Luis Carrion, with an alternative proposal for the FSLN, developed with the clear intention of offering an alternative and renovating proposal for Sandinism. That is a faction. The Democratic Left Discussion Forum is not a faction; it only promotes debate among comrades. On the other part of your question, we believe Sandinism is revolutionary; historically, the FSLN has been the vanguard in this country, it has been the greatest expression of the Nicaraguan left. But that fact should not automatically lead to the conclusion that all Sandinists are necessarily on the left, and that we all hold revolutionary positions. Within Sandinism there have appeared some comrades who claim to be centrists. That is part of the present situation in the FSLN. [Lacayo Guerra] The Sandinist Front is an electoral party and the 1996 elections are--as the saying goes--just around the corner. In your opinion, what should the FSLN do to win back the majority it has lost? [Lopez Campos] The FSLN must evaluate its history and the 1990 election results objectively and fairly, so it can have its feet firmly planted on the ground to handle the work it must do. That, I believe, is where some of our problems stem, for the record of what the Sandinist Front has done is not being considered carefully and equitably in terms of the 1990 election defeat. There are some very prejudiced views; people want to continue seeing us as an exclusive Sandinist Front. During the war the FSLN did have to take specific steps to promote extreme cohesiveness on the part of its forces, which generated the image of an exclusive internal party, but if we look at the party structures now, we will find that in the party's operational areas there are absolutely no exclusive or authoritarian attitudes. Just the opposite is true. I believe it is important to portray the FSLN accurately, and that is the first step in being able to position ourselves correctly to do our jobs. In this context, access to the government is not going to come about through arms, but elections. [Lacayo Guerra] The party program is one basic element for a party to win elections, but so is its presidential candidate. How do you think the FSLN should select its candidate? [Lopez Campos] I am absolutely convinced that the FSLN has to return to office by electoral means, and so it must reaffirm its historic mission. In a country in which 80 percent of the population has an income of less than $200 a month, obviously the most suitable program for Sandinism must be based on the needs and interests of these large masses of campesinos, young people, women, the unemployed, and the workers. A party that wants to obtain the support of the masses must necessarily have a popular mission; if it does not, it cannot claim to lead the struggles and represent the interests of the masses. I do not see how it could bring to the next elections the forces needed to get the results we have to obtain. Sandinism arose with the aim of creating profound transformations in Nicaraguan society. In this phase it was through the vote, but Sandinism has not restricted, nor can it restrict its political work within formal institutional confines. These struggles cannot be limited solely to the four established branches of government, even though there may be some comrades who believe that is possible. What can be done about the arbitrary evictions ordered by the courts? The FSLN has to organize to defend the interests of all those families. We have no other alternative, even though that may mean clashing with the forces of law. What can be done in the rural areas of Matagalpa and Jinotega where the lives of our Sandinist comrades have been threatened? I am one of the militants who say that in that area the FSLN must take the lead to protect the lives of our Sandinist comrades who have been threatened. This places us at odds with the strictly legal order, but that is not important to me. What matters most to me is the lives of the Sandinists in that area. [Lacayo Guerra] Let us get back to the question. What mechanism should be used to select the FSLN's presidential candidate? [Lopez Campos] In the Discussion Forum, we act in the context of what was decided by the Sandinist Front. That is why I insist that we are not a faction. In the FSLN, selecting the candidate for 1996 is not on the agenda. That is not the reason for convening the Extraordinary Congress. This congress is being convened to discuss the program and the statutes. Absolutely nothing is planned about candidacies. We believe it is too early to introduce the issue of candidacies when we have still not resolved the problem of our new identity. In my opinion, Sergio (Ramirez) made an extremely grave political mistake when at the end of last year he and his comrades decided to give an electoral emphasis to what they had been doing, by introducing the dynamics of the presidential candidacy. In fact, that faction was working inside the FSLN and to some extent, the Discussion Forum arose as a reaction to that faction that had been active without publicly acknowledging its existence. They could have continued to promote the policy they wanted. All that was healthy and positive. That is no crime, there is no problem with that. But when they decided to combine their political work and start to identify an election slate, including possible deputies--because they had talked of candidacies, and some were talking about "possible positions" in the future government--then we said: those comrades are making a very serious mistake. In saying this, I am not censuring the legitimate right that any comrade has, and some have more than others. In my opinion, Sergio has every right to aspire to be a candidate for president of the Republic, but I do feel it was a political mistake to have started to work with a view toward candidacies for 1996, when what is on Sandinism's agenda now is solving its internal problems and developing its program, its statutes, and its new identity. So my answer is that it is too soon to talk about candidacies. [Lacayo Guerra] Sincerely, you have never thought about who might be the right candidate for the Sandinist Front? [Lopez Campos] Yes, I have thought about that...one difference between an electoral and a revolutionary party is that revolutionaries organize to fight in an ongoing manner. Their ultimate objective is the election, and in the meantime, they face struggles every day. Only a combative front that goes to the neighborhoods, to the streets, to the fields, and to the mountains can help us to win back the masses of the people. Later, we will work out the election issue more easily. I think a slate that weakens the front, that splits it, would not be viable. I would not even reject a candidate who might not be in our party; we might form an alliance for the elections. The candidate could also be someone from the front who is not a part of its leadership structures, someone like Mariano Fiallos, who is not a leader of Sandinism, but who has great prestige and authority. There is a full array of possibilities. It is typical of electoral political processes that when you want to get rid of someone, you toss his hat into the ring early, and he will be sure to burn out. In my opinion, that is another mistake Sergio made. He began his own process of self-destruction. His latest positions are creating friction and a lack of consensus in the Sandinist Front, and that affects him as a leader. [Lacayo Guerra] Moving on to the Atlantic Coast election results. Could you comment on that? [Lopez Campos] In all honesty, I am waiting to hear the evaluation made by our Atlantic Coast comrades. Sometimes we in the Pacific area are very arrogant, and the truth is that the Atlantic Coast is a very special situation. There they have what does not exist in the Pacific, and the decisive factor is the ethnic problem. The truth of the matter is that we Sandinists in general do not know that situation very well. So the first thing we have to see is how the people from the coast view the situation, and see how we feel about their evaluation. And, since I am speaking to EL SEMANARIO, I want to say that Sergio made an overhasty evaluation of the Atlantic Coast results without first knowing the official views of the comrades. I am sure support for the Atlantic Coast elections has not become a priority issue in either the leadership of the front or the Sandinist Assembly. I would rather wait for their evaluation before expressing an opinion. [Lacayo Guerra] In general, what is your opinion of the debate among Sandinists, and the strong dissent that offends some party members? [Lopez Campos] Well...we have to be open to an intense debate, and the debate among Sandinists about the nature of the matters we have to discuss must be a firm, impassioned debate with strong convictions, but that should in no way lead us to exclusive attitudes and terms that destroy the fraternity that should exist among Sandinists. I believe it would be a mistake not to admit that there have been faults on all sides. Similar or worse damage is done to the debate not only by one who speaks in extremely frank language, which may be rude, and by one who wields his words as skillfully as a surgeon's scalpel, making cuts and deep wounds without those wounds being perceptible to everyone. There has been some of that in this debate. There are some comrades who have the ability and skill to open wounds without them being apparent to everyone, and there are some who resort to rough language. [Lacayo Guerra] What do you think the FSLN's relations with the U.S. Government should be? [Lopez Campos] The U.S. ambassador stated in EL SEMANARIO that history cannot be repeated. People who forget their own history are people who do not deserve respect. The United States will respect us if it sees that we are consistent with ourselves and our history, and with our healthy intention of having friendly relations with it. We did not attack the United States. It was the United States who has attacked us throughout our modern history, and we cannot forget that. Nor can that be the starting point for maintaining a position of friction and hostility. I do not know any Sandinist who thinks that he can conduct Sandinist politics by seeking confrontations with the United States. I do not know a single one. Some points that Sergio has been making have greatly displeased me. In his statements to EL PAIS, in his zeal for strengthening his proposals for renewal, to which he is fully entitled, he has been distorting his diagnosis of reality and dwelling on an apocalyptic image of the nation's future, saying that the tragedy will be to be torn between radical Sandinism, on one side, and Arnoldo Aleman's extremism on the other. In that situation, says Sergio, the prospect is chaos, and so we need to converge toward the center of the Nicaraguan political spectrum. Honestly, I say I do not see where Sergio gets that extremist and radical Sandinism. It seems to me that he is trying to strengthen his own position by using that image or invoking that "horrific danger."
