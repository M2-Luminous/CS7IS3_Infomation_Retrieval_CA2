The signing has paved the way for the launching of the oil exploration in the more than 7,000 square kilometer area known as the Joint Development Area, JDA. It took 14 years of talks and negotiations. But the fact that they have led to a successful conclusion is a positive sign of the majority of the leaderships of the two countries and their senior officials who have been engaged in the talks. Studies made in the JDA have shown that it can be a source as well as a reservoir of oil and gas. Several oil discoveries have already been made in the area. The joint exploration will no doubt lead to more discoveries that will be of benefit to both countries. Four agreements have been signed, including two for production sharing and the other two for joint operations. It may be remembered that both Malaysia and Thailand had previously laid claims to the area in question. So the presence of the prime ministers of the two countries, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and Mr. Chuan Likphai, at the signing ceremony gave added significance to the new venture that the two ASEAN nations have jointly agreed to embark upon. Dr. Mahathir has described the approach to the agreements as a model for the settlement of overlapping claims. With the signing of the agreements, both countries can look towards broadening cooperation in many other fields that will bring benefit to the people as well as contribute towards a peaceful, prosperous, and stable Southeast Asia. On his part, Mr. Chuan has expressed confidence that the agreements will boost the close cooperation between the two countries. The agreements, in his words, are a testimony to a long and fruitful relationship between his country and Malaysia. The body that is chiefly responsible for bringing about the joint exploration deals is the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority, MTJA. It ought to be congratulated for its award of contracts to three big companies -- one from Malaysia and the other two from Thailand -- to carry out the operations. The MTJA emerged from the foresight of past leaders, namely, the late premier of Malaysia, Tun Hussein Onn and his then Thai counterpart, General Kriangsak Chamanan. Their intention to resolve the problem of overlapping claims in the Gulf of Thailand came out with a novel idea of establishing a joint authority. To the MTJA, there is great scope for the two countries to develop and intensify their economic cooperation. The joint exploration for oil and gas is a unique venture. The MTJA and the three contracting parties have a big task ahead to bring about fruitful results for the benefit of both Malaysia and Thailand.
