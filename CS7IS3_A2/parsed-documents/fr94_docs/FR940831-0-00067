FR940831-0-00067 FR940831-0-00025 46 FR 58086 (Nov. 30, 1981); see also 48 FR 35965, 35969 (Aug. 8, 1983) (advance notice of proposed rulemaking) (affirming RSPA's discretion as to whether and how to regulate hazardous substances under Federal hazmat law). In response to RSPA's decision not to regulate certain hazardous substances at a one-pound RQ, Congress amended section 9656(a) to direct that hazardous substances, when designated by the EPA, be ``listed and regulated '' as hazardous materials. Pub. L. 99&hyph;499, section 202 (Oct. 17, 1986) (emphasis added). This is the present language of the statute. In accordance with the amendment, RSPA issued a final rule on November 21, 1986, subjecting all hazardous substances listed under 42 U.S.C. 9601(14) to the shipping paper, package marking and packaging requirements applicable to hazardous substances under the 1980 rule. The agency, citing its lack of discretion in complying with the statutory mandate, found that public notice and comment were unnecessary and issued the final rule directly. As the EPA has designated additional hazardous substances or changed the RQ for those already designated, RSPA, without public notice or an opportunity for public comment, has issued final rules incorporating those changes into the HMR. The present rule is the fourth of these (see preceding rules at 54 FR 34666, Aug. 21, 1989; 54 FR 39500, Sept. 26, 1989; 55 FR 46794, Nov. 7, 1990). With the exception of training and registration requirements established by statute for hazardous materials as a whole, the HMR requirements that apply to the bulk transportation of hazardous substances designated as hazardous materials have not changed substantially since 1980. B. RSPA Discretion To Regulate Hazardous Substances RSPA's discretion in implementing 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) is limited in two important respects. First, the directive to ``list and regulate'' each hazardous substance as a hazardous material requires RSPA, at the least, to provide a regulatory framework to ensure that a motor vehicle or train operator has a means to know when the cargo includes a reportable quantity of a hazardous substance. As discussed above, RSPA's May 1980 rule, subjecting hazardous substance transportation to hazardous material shipping paper and package marking requirements, was issued to this end in order to implement FWPCA discharge reporting requirements. Seven months later, Congress enacted CERCLA, essentially incorporating the FWPCA hazardous substance discharge reporting requirement. Furthermore, the CERCLA legislative history reveals a congressional intent to adopt and enhance the FWPCA framework for preventing and mitigating oil and hazardous substance spills. See generally H.Rep. 96&hyph;1016(II), 1980 USCCAN 6151, 6160&hyph;6223 (incorporating H.Rep. 96&hyph;172). Therefore, RSPA reads section 9656(a) to have codified the basic purpose of the RSPA rule, that of providing carriers the knowledge of their cargo needed to comply with CERCLA reporting requirements. Accordingly, RSPA has no discretion to modify the HMR framework in a way that undermines the operator notification function of the shipping paper and marking requirements. Congress' 1986 amendment to require both listing and regulation of EPA-designated hazardous substances is further evidence of RSPA's limited discretion. Second, the regulatory framework under Federal hazmat law historically has been oriented toward those materials that, in transportation, present immediate hazards to public health, safety and property by virtue of qualities such as explosivity, flammability, reactivity, acute toxicity, radioactivity and corrosivity. RSPA, in coordination with the Department of Transportation (DOT) modal administrations (Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, United States Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration), possesses the expertise and the resources to assess the physical and chemical properties of materials in transportation; to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations; and to make considered regulatory judgments.
