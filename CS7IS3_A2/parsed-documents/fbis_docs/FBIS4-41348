I can only say I am an optimist and am convinced nothing grave will happen. We shall build a strong, prosperous Ukrainian state, but only by working, being together, and not hoping for some extraordinary help. [passage omitted] I believe the president's role must above all be to consolidate all power structures and enable the organization of power both centrally and locally. [passage omitted] We today formed a working commission at the Supreme Council, which is to check the program of privatization and sort out who has taken what for how much and on what conditions. If someone has taken something unlawfully, they should put it back. We have a different view on the problem of land reform. I have established this by collating positions by many of Ukraine's citizens and know that Ukrainian land must not become a commodity and must not be sold out. Otherwise, there shall be no justification for us in the future. [passage omitted] I believe we must introduce serious changes to our state's domestic and foreign policy. I can explain the details of these changes when answering questions. I would, nevertheless, like to briefly describe the contents of two other very important key elements. One of them is the issue of international economic cooperation. It is not only with Russia that we must have good economic relations, but also with the other countries that formerly constituted the USSR and that are now our neighbors. One more thing is to do with the independence of our Ukraine. I shall say the following, which is quite unorthodox: I believe we must have an independent Ukraine. But independence is only the state where people populating it feel independent. It is in that respect that we shall still have to do a great deal. But there will only be success if we act together, from top to bottom. So I am asking you, esteemed electors, on the evening of 26 June, to help me form the power structures that will work as a team.
