Kozyrev conveyed greetings from President Boris Yeltsin to Goncz. He assured Goncz that Moscow always examines how its foreign policy moves contribute to Central-European stability. He said Moscow supports cooperation and peace partnership with NATO, but stressed the need to find concrete solutions to individual problems in the region. Russia also attaches great importance to the CSCE and its summit, to be held in Budapest at the end of the year.
