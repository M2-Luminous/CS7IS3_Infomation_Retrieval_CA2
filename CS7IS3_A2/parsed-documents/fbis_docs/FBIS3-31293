In connection with this, the Presidency accepted a total cease-fire and freezing the positions of all the front lines in the Sarajevo region. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army will observe this decision in full, the Presidency concluded. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency upholds UNPROFOR's proposal to collect up all those weapons that remain within the 20-km radius of Sarajevo and deposit them in a part of Sarajevo airport temporarily controlled by UNPROFOR. At today's session the Presidency voiced concern over the positioning of UNPROFOR troops next to the Serbian positions around Sarajevo. The Presidency fears that UNPROFOR troops positioned in such a way could in several localities serve as a shield for the Serbian positions in case of a NATO air attack. There is a realistic danger that in the case of NATO air strikes the Serbian aggressor would not permit UNPROFOR units to abandon these positions, and so UNPROFOR soldiers could find themselves as hostages. Within the framework of these activities, particularly worrying are the statements by some lower UNPROFOR commanders, who are in various ways and, in the opinion of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency members, wrongly interpreting the NATO declaration. The current positioning of UNPROFOR troops in [the Serb occupied Sarajevo suburb of] Grbavica is acceptable only in order to supervise the cease-fire and can have no political connotations, it was concluded at today's session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.
