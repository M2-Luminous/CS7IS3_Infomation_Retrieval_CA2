Speaking at a press conference, Longuet said if Japan opens up further to U.S. exports, he hopes the same treatment will be awarded to Europe. The French minister's remarks were in reference to the drawing of plans by Japanese automakers to import more U.S. car parts in line with ongoing U.S. trade negotiations. Longuet said that during the meeting with Japanese leaders, France and Japan agreed to set up a private-level committee to promote European automotive exports to Japan. He said automakers' use of European car parts in Japan is at a ratio of only 1.4 percent. He arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday to have talks with Japanese Government and business leaders and attend an international conference on assistance to Cambodia.
