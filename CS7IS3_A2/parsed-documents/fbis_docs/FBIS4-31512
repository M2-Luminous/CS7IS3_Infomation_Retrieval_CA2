Searching for an answer, the left-wing of our political spectrum thought that this is perhaps a blow whose hidden meanings are not yet known. Therefore, this side preferred to adopt a position of prudent silence. However, Corneliu Coposu's political friends interpreted this declaration as a gaffe. This is also what the ROMANIA LIBERA editorial devoted to this issue says, not without some sort of gentleness. Condemned as being untimely, with serious consequences for the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] the declaration is explained by the fact that the PNTCD leader, an honest man, insisted on telling the Romanian people "what the PNTCD has in mind if it comes to power." Under the nicer aspect of this statement there is also a deadly hidden thorn. The concealed reasoning is the following. Coposu knew what disaster his declaration on reinstating of monarchy would cause to the PNTCD and the opposition in general. Nevertheless, without anybody forcing him, he started, out of the blue, to state what the PNTCD will do in the event it comes to power. And all this only because he, unlike others, is an honest man. Why is this reasoning a thorn in the nice aspect of the statement? Because it shows us Coposu as a great personality when it comes to the moral aspect of the issue, but infantile when we consider the political aspect. Luckily, Coposu is far from the way the reasoning of his friends wants to present him to us. Without any concessions to the moral aspect of the issue, one has to admit that Coposu is an experienced politician who is carefully weighing his moves and statements. From this point of view, his statement regarding the reinstatement of the monarchy in Romania is not a gaffe, as some would have it, but the result of a rational calculation. Through this statement, the PNTCD leader solves several things. First of all, he brings back the radical and inflexible anti-government and anti-presidential position of the PNTCD that the negotiations with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] have seriously damaged. Nothing can separate the PNTCD from the PDSR and from President Iliescu more than such a categorical declaration regarding the restoration of the monarchy. This is a point on which the ruling party and President Ion Iliescu will never reach a compromise with any party. Thus, Coposu's declaration is meant to reaffirm in a spectacular way in the eyes of the electorate the fact that between the PNTCD and those in power there is a huge gap. One of the diversionary maneuvers used against the opposition was to systematically release rumors about secret negotiations that the PDSR and the presidency are holding with the PNTCD. Affirming that the program of his party is based on the restoration of the monarchy, Coposu makes it impossible for those in power to resort to such maneuvers in the future. Likewise, this makes impossible any attempt of the PDSR and of the presidency to resume the masquerade of negotiations with the opposition. Thus, strongly separated now from those in power, the PNTCD insists on emphasizing more clearly than ever that the entire responsibility for the disaster rests exclusively with those currently in power. Second, through his definite declaration, Coposu is preparing his party for the future elections. It is clear that the next elections will be dominated by the idea of the need to change the current state of affairs. Certainly, the parties will propose to the electorate a radical solution that the Romanian people has not met so far. No doubt, political parties will propose all kinds of solutions to the electorate. The party that is going to propose a radical solution that the Romanian people has not met so far will have a chance to win. No doubt this proposal will not be the reform, privatization, or return to communism. Such solutions have already been expressed, with the already known disastrous results. Therefore, the solution that one could bet on, even if it involves certain risks, would be the establishment of the monarchy. Apart from the fact that it has not been applied so far, this solution has a few important advantages: it is radical, since it presupposes a total change of the current situation; it is simple to explain, because it does not refer to very complicated economic arguments, which are difficult to understand, but resorts to political and sentimental arguments; and it is based on the nostalgia of the Romanian people for the providential person (the kings will come and solve everything!). It is possible that the PNTCD leader is mistaken in his calculations. He might be taking an enormous risk with this electoral program. However, any risk is preferable to the disaster that the opposition is currently facing.
