Long-grain Thai rice imports reached 570,000 tons, against total rice imports of 1.7 million tons. The Food Agency made the decision as contracts on purchases of Thai rice expired in April, the officials said. They also cited anticipated boarding troubles of the Thai rice during the May-June period, the usual rainy season in Thailand. But some experts say the real reason for the decision is sluggish sales of long-grain rice, unpopular among Japanese who favor short- or medium-grain rice. The agency, which plans to stop sales of Thai rice to wholesalers at the end of August, has signed contracts to buy about 400,000 tons of short- or medium-grain rice from China, the United States and Australia as of Wednesday, the officials said. The agency plans to purchase an additional 750,000 tons of rice with expectations of another off-crop season. Sales of Chinese, U.S. and Australian rice to domestic wholesalers will begin in September and October, according to the officials.
