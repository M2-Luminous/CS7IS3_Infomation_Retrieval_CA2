Comrade Xie Shijie said: It is far from enough for Sichuan to rely on self-accumulation in economic construction; it must rely on opening up to the world and foreign investments. This will develop Sichuan's economy rapidly. In this respect, we should make a faster move and be more dynamic. All kinds of measures should be taken to encourage foreign investments. He added: The way out for Sichuan's agriculture is stabilizing grain production, increasing income, and striving for moderate prosperity. Grain production and agricultural development should be carried out by means of science and technology, and township and town enterprises should be developed. A link must be formed between enterprises, markets, and peasants to blaze a track of rural industrialization. In the course of encouraging development of private economic sectors, there is also a need to vigorously develop collective economic sectors and strengthen rural party organizations' coherent force and combat worthiness. Comrade Xie Shijie said: Key construction projects must be given full attention. The 10 construction projects arranged by the provincial government involving Sichuan's long-term development must be fulfilled as scheduled. Reform of existing enterprises must be deepened according to the 33 regulations, a good job must be done in carrying out reform experiments in the 22 enterprises selected, and experience in this respect must be promptly summed up and then popularized. In the meantime, particular attention must be paid to resolving the problem of loss-incurring enterprises. If this problem is not resolved properly, it will affect stability and unity. Comrade Xie Shijie stressed: We must do two kinds of work simultaneously and lay equal stress on them and make a success of spiritual civilization. Leading cadres should set strict demands on themselves, curb corruption, improve grass-roots-level organizations for social order, and help protect social order so as to spend the New Year and the Spring Festival happily.
