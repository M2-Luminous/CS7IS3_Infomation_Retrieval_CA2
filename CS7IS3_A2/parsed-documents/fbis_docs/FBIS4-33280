The report begins with file footage of Castro's August 1993 address to mark the Batalla de la Sacra anniversary, during which he announced the EJT's creation. The report then switches to footage of the 25 May final analysis meeting with several Politburo members, generals, local officials, party officials, enterprise representatives, and a large group of journalists. He emphasizes that "the EJT was primarily created to solve the lack of manpower in the sugarcane, agrarian, and livestock sectors in the fertile lands of Camaguey." Aerial shots of the farms and EJT members at work are shown while Castro speaks. He says the EJT flag has been hoisted in 56 municipalities, "from the coffee-growing mountains of Baracoa on the eastern tip of Cuba to the Isle of Youth and the tobacco plantations in western Pinar del Rio," and that their unselfish efforts and higher productivity and efficiency were praised by Commander in Chief Fidel Castro at the 7th Science and Technology Forum, where he said the EJT continues to grow, and is the most productive force in the agriculture sector. Raul Castro indicates that the EJT is in charge of "19 integral farms owned by eight enterprises, which produce assorted crops in Havana Province. The integral farms encompass 830 caballerias, which represent half of the tillable land owned by those enterprises. The other half is organized in production cooperatives. The two forms of organization using state-owned land encompass 60 percent of the area destined for the production of edible roots and vegetables, and the remaining 40 percent belongs to the peasants." This means that "the EJT fighters are responsible for 30 percent of the area destined to provide these products for the population in Havana Province, which has close to 3 million inhabitants." The announcer indicates that "all this work must be done despite the shortage of fuel, fertilizers, pesticides, farming tools, spare parts, assorted materials, clothes, shoes -- even hats, which are essential in the tropical sun." Within the meeting, various camp leaders review the work carried out on each farm, the types of problems encountered, the efforts to find appropriate solutions, the Union of Young Communist's [UJC] efforts in the area. Colonel Jorge Romero says, "The Minfar [Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces] commission adapted its work to the control system used by EJT leaders. This allowed an in-depth analysis of the work methods and styles. The most evident advantages include the possibility of confirming results and developing production processes and work systems," as well as "learning about current deficiencies and problems and pinpointing their causes more accurately; evaluating the overall results rather than partial or individual results; being more objective in our assessment and enabling us to solve certain problems during the visit." Col. Romero says, "Officers are prepared to control all of the farm's activities regardless of their specialty;" adding that "compliance with the measures and recommendations" has helped train the Havana Division, and that this "will be systematically checked until their full implementation." Other camp leaders discuss the EJT members' education levels, relations with the community, visits to the capital, entertainment programs, costs of food and clothing, and minor issues brought up by the workers. Castro reviews the final report and asks that a copy be given to the journalists so they can review it and ask questions. One of the journalists says he is "impressed with the report because it is very specific and reviews problems honestly, but without pessimism." In reply to another journalist's question, Castro responds: "We will let no one [pauses] we will act within the law, and I say this before someone interprets this as a threat to anyone. We will act within a legal framework so nothing, neither the illegal street vendors nor the deficiency of our government bureaucracy, prevents the fruits of our soldiers' work from reaching their final destination -- the local market, the people." The meeting continues with reports from various Minfar officers. Some of them review visits to other farms and their assessment of the technical and material supplies, time allotted for travel, EJT members' complaints about meals and potable water supplies. Other officers refer to farm machinery, fuel consumption and delivery, work attendance, salaries, costs, and production levels. Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan also addresses the meeting and says that "undoubtedly, the transformation process currently being implemented in the agriculture sector, based on the Politburo agreement, actually represents five forms of production" because it involves state-owned farms; 29 UJC farms; 28 agrarian and livestock cooperatives; and 49 credit and service cooperatives. The sum of all this must necessarily increase production." Minister Jordan adds: "We recently checked the integral farms' work during the first period, here in Havana. We said it was necessary to adapt an overall control system for the in-depth simplification process we must logically continue in the agriculture sector. We must change the agriculture sector from top to bottom. We must evaluate the work and we must do it correctly. We will refer to the EJT integral farms' work based on what we have seen here. We will also evaluate the work done by agrarian and livestock cooperatives, individual peasants, and credit and service cooperatives." The official also admits there prevail "a series of difficulties and problems; they are part of the overall process currently underway. Like I said in the beginning, I am fully convinced, fully and truly convinced that, under the current circumstances and despite the limitations of resources we have, the number of things we can do is infinite, and the information presented here proves it. I think this was ascertained everyday wherever we went -- how much more can be done with the fuel we deliver, how much more can be done with the fertilizer we deliver, how much more can be done with the chemical products we deliver, and how much more can be done by the leadership to optimize the manpower we have. The number of things that can be done concerning crop production is infinite." Furthermore, Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, first vice minister of the Minfar and chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, summed up the work carried out when he said that "this is the second work visit the Minfar has carried out in the Havana Division, according to the method we have created to periodically ascertain the work carried out by this great unit, the results of its production tasks, the problems it faces, and the help it needs." He says every effort is being made to overcome "the shortages we still have and the problems which preclude the achievement of higher levels. This is where we must fulfill our duty to guarantee and support the processes and systems. We cannot let this production effort be limited or go to waste due to the lack of means that could have been obtained on time, an activity that could have been carried out in advance, or a lack of effort," because "that is our role, and we are sure the EJT will fulfill its role -- as it recently showed us with the results achieved in the latest potato harvest," which "resulted in more than 744,000 quintals and obtained a profit in excess of 300,000 pesos. Twelve farms achieved positive economic results. Upon evaluating the EJT's production results on this occasion, we stress that the EJT has again demonstrated its determination to not only produce and achieve a high yield, but also to become more and more efficient and feasible." Gen. Rosales concludes his statement by praising the EJT soldiers and commanding officers for their work and dedication, to fulfill their main task, while dealing with the shortage of agricultural products.
