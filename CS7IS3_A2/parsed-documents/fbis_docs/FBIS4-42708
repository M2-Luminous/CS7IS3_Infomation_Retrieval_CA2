Some of them had broken through a barrier and loudly protested against the chancellor's speech. At the rally with 5,000 participants, Kohl had called for participation in building a joint European home. Only the "United States of Europe" guarantees peace and freedom, Kohl stated in his speech one week before the European elections. His comments were accompanied by violent booing and a chorus of whistles. On banners, citizens opposed the expulsion of eastern Germans from their plots. The chancellor said that the reduction of unemployment is the greatest challenge of the country's community of solidarity. Unemployment will not disappear overnight, but it can be warded off. At the same time, Kohl admitted mistakes in shaping German unity and substantiated them by a lack of experience.
