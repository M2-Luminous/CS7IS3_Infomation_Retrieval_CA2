FR940127-2-00038 FR940127-2-00028 [Project 2299&hyph;024 California] Turlock and Modesto Irrigation Districts; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and To Conduct a Scoping Meeting January 21, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing (OHL) has reviewed the licensee's post-licensing filing that proposes to modify the minimum flows from the project reservoir. The intent of the proposed flow modification is to help protect fishery resources (primarily the chinook salmon) in the Tuolumne River. Staff's initial evaluation was issued on December 22, 1993, in a draft environmental assessment (DEA). In the DEA, staff determined that because some of the proposed alternatives could, under certain circumstances, reduce the amount of water available to users of the Hetch Hetchy water supply, some of the proposed alternatives may constitute a major federal action affecting the human environment and recommended preparation of an environmental impact statement. A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by staff and considered in the final EIS. Staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final decision. Scoping Meeting A scoping meeting will be held on Thursday, February 10, 1994, at 9 a.m. at the Best Western Mallard's Inn in Modesto, California. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. The DEA will be considered the initial scoping document. Copies of the DEA are available in the Commission's Reference and Information Center, room 3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Copies of the DEA will also be available at the scoping meeting. Objectives At the scoping meeting the staff will: (1) Present environmental issues that are identified for coverage in the EIS; (2) receive input from meeting participants on the issues presented; (3) clarify the significance of issues; (4) identify any additional issues that need treatment in the EIS; and (5) identify those issues that do not merit treatment in the EIS. Procedures The scoping meeting will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) will become part of the Commission's public record for this proceeding that was noticed on December 29, 1992. Interested persons who are unable to attend, or do not choose to speak at the scoping meeting, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record. All written comments must be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, on or before February 24, 1994. All written correspondence should clearly show on the first page of each document the following caption: New Don Pedro Project, FERC Project No. 2299&hyph;024. Further, please note the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring note entities to file an original and eight copies of any filing with the Commission and parties filing documents, must also serve the documents on each person whose name is on the official service list.
