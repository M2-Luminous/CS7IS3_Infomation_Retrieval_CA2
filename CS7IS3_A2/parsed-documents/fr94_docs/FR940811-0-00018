FR940811-0-00018 FR940811-0-00007 (1) Make a careful visual inspection of all the electrical wires and connectors between the synch-lock and its applicable power circuit breaker. (2) Repair all the unserviceable electrical wire and connectors that you find. (3) Use the multi-meter again to make sure there are no ``hot'' short circuits in the electrical system which can accidentally supply power to the synch-locks. (d) If you find the correct conditions when you use the multi-meter, continue on and do the mechanical test of the synch-locks. Note: Make sure the circuit breakers shown above continue to be set to the closed position. Do not install the electrical connectors on the synch-locks at this time. D. Do the mechanical test for the synch-locks. (1) Supply hydraulic power. WARNING: MAKE SURE ALL PERSONS AND EQUIPMENT ARE CLEAR OF THE AREA BEHIND EACH THRUST REVERSER. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS INSTRUCTION, INJURIES TO PERSONS OR DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR IF THE SYNCH&hyph;LOCKS DO NOT OPERATE CORRECTLY AND THE THRUST REVERSER EXTENDS. (2) Move the reverse thrust levers for the two engines to try to extend the thrust reversers with hydraulic power. Note: If the thrust reversers do not extend, the synch-locks are serviceable. If the thrust reversers extend, the applicable synch-locks did not operate correctly. (3) Replace the applicable synch-locks on the thrust reverser that extended when you moved the reverse thrust levers. (4) Make sure the reverse thrust levers are in the fully stowed position. (5) Install the applicable L(R) electrical connectors, D20194(D20196), on the L(R) synch-locks, V170(V171). WARNING: MAKE SURE ALL PERSONS AND EQUIPMENT ARE CLEAR OF THE AREA BEHIND THE THRUST REVERSERS. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS INSTRUCTION, INJURIES TO PERSONS OR DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR WHEN THE THRUST REVERSERS ARE EXTENDED. (6) Move the reverser thrust levers for the two engines to extend the thrust reversers with hydraulic power. Note: If the thrust reversers extend, the synch-locks are serviceable. If the thrust reversers do not extend, the applicable synch-locks did not operate correctly. (7) Replace the applicable synch-locks on the thrust reverser that did not extend when you moved the reverse thrust levers. E. Put the airplane back to its usual condition. (1) Move the reverse thrust levers to fully retract the thrust reversers on the two engines with hydraulic power. (2) Remove the hydraulic power if it is not necessary. (3) Remove the electrical power if it is not necessary. (4) Close the fan cowl panels. (f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (g) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (h) The installation shall be done in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0060, Revision 2, dated August 19, 1993; and Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0061, Revision 1, dated August 5, 1993; as applicable. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Certain other actions shall be done in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0054, dated December 13, 1991; and Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0053, dated December 13, 1991; as applicable. The incorporation by reference of these documents was approved previously by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 as of January 27, 1992 (57 FR 3004, January 27, 1992). Copies may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. Copies may be inspected at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (i) This amendment becomes effective on September 12, 1994. Issued in Renton, Washington, on July 28, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18840 Filed 8&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;U
