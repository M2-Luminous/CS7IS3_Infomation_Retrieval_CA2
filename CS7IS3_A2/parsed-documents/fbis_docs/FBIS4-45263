The spokesman said his country has decided to suspend the supply of information from the radars that operate in Leticia and Aracura because Colombian military authorities had downed planes. Minister Pardo Ruedas told Caracol the following: [Begin recording] [Pardo Ruedas] Thus, it seems to us that.... [pauses] it is a startling decision. We do not have any final position apart from the one that a signatory of a multilateral agreement has unilaterally decided--without prior announcement or explanations--to suspend its participation. [Gonzalvez] Could any preceding events have led the United States to make this decision, minister? [Pardo Ruedas] This is what we would like to know. [Words indistinct] multilateral cooperation that is advantageous to us and other countries. We work on a par with other countries. It is advantageous to all those who are interested in controlling drug trafficking. We do not understand why a decision has been made abruptly and without advising, consulting, or giving reasons for it. [Gonzalvez] Perhaps they fear the wrong plane will be downed due to information given? [Pardo Ruedas] However, they would have to report this and discuss it with us. This decision cannot be based simply on [words indistinct] a meeting without, for example, taking into account our opinion. [end recording] Other Defense Ministry spokesmen told Caracol that while the U.S. Government suspends the supply of radar information to Colombia, it congratulates the Peruvian Government each time it downs a plane.
