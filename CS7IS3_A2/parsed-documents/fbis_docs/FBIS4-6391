Last year the fossil of Korean archaeopteryx of the early Jurassic period of the Mesozonic era was discovered there, which shows the course of the evolution of birds from primitive reptiles, a higher land vertebrate. This convincingly proved Korea being a cradle of human civilisation where extinct animals and plants evolved systematically. The discovery of the fossil frog in the same stratum is an irrefutable proof that a fast evolution of the frog was in progress in the Mesozonic era on the globe and the northwestern part of Korea was the central arena of that evolution. The great leader President Kim Il-song named the oldest known fossil frog discovered this time "archaeofrog." The fossil unearthed and ascertained by authoritative natural scientists clearly preserves part of the vertebra, foreleg bone, hindleg bone, and the pelvis. Fossil frogs in the world had so far been discovered in the stratum belonging to the period of and after the third Cenozoic era, or about 60 million years ago. The frog fossil recently unearthed in Korea belong to a time 90 million years earlier. With the discovery of the fossil of archaeofrog which helps establish a new academic view on the evolution of the frog and its phylogeny and classification system, the long history of the land of Korea has become ever clearer.
