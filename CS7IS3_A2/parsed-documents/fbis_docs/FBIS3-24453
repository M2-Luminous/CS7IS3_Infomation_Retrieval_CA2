Pogorelov and V. Uvarov, senior special investigators under the general procurator of the Russian Federation, and I. Kuryanov, special investigator of Voronezh Oblast procuracy: "A Case of Special Importance: Investigators Appeal to Authorities and the Public"] [Text] Over the past years we have been hearing constantly about crime overcoming the country, with corruption accounting for an increasingly greater share of it. This topic gets especially exaggerated and played up during the period of preparation for a referendum and in speeches of candidates for deputies on the threshold of another election. Yes, crime has indeed overcome Russia: Gangsters are on the rampage; businessmen are the prey of choice; people are killed day and night, on the streets and in their apartments; bombs are placed in their work place and homes; huge numbers of bureaucrats reap dividends from simply doing what is supposed to be part of their job; increasingly often, the criminals' victims are children. In 1993 the highest rate of solving all kinds of crime in Russia was 69.7 percent in Tambov Oblast, the lowest--34.1 percent in the Republic of Karelia. In Moscow and Petersburg, respectively, the figures were 44.5 percent and 44.4 percent. All in all, 2,799,644 crimes were registered in Russia (not counting latent, unregistered crimes), of which only 50.8 percent were solved, that is, one half. A more than depressing picture. What, in our opinion, stands in the way of putting a successful barrier to the bacchanalia of crime? First and foremost, of course, political instability and the economic crisis. They create fertile soil for criminal activities. But there are also organizational shortcomings in crime-prevention work itself. Among them we should point out first and foremost the fact that investigative-operational units are scattered among different agencies and their actions are poorly coordinated. Tremendous damage to the cause is created by the lack of a new legislative base. And what is most depressing, there is no light at the end of the tunnel; moreover, on the wave of reformist agitation, "preferential" laws are being adopted in the interests of criminals. There are also other factors contributing to runaway crime. Among them are lack of responsibility for failures in investigative work, which is often conducted poorly from a professional standpoint; the inequality of citizens before the law; and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] being overloaded with other tasks that are unrelated to crime solving. Especially regretful is the failure to use to the necessary extent the operational and technical potential of the former Ministry of Security [MB], which is being endlessly spontaneously reorganized, a fact the criminal world is skillfully using to its advantage. It is possible that the initiators of the final abolishment of the Ministry of Security were guided by good intentions. But what was the result of not seeing the absolutely obvious outcome? A highly skilled investigative apparat, which is so much needed today, has been destroyed. It is true that its cases under investigation--and there about 2,000 of them--were transferred to the procuracy, together with the suspects in detention. But who will investigate them there, especially within a compressed time frame? Especially taking into account their specificity? The investigators from the now former MB have not been transferred to the procuracy, so in reality the investigative corps has been reduced in total number. The result is that the only ones to gain from this presidential edict are the criminals, and not the small fry at that. Not least important in this disintegration are political appointments to jobs in law enforcement. Let us look once again at the interagency commission for combating crime and corruption. While its creation could be perceived as the desire to have a highest-level coordinating body, the appointment of a politicking lawyer as its head at the very least raised the eyebrows of everyone more or less knowledgeable in these matters. The results, as they say, were quick to show. Slandered, as the Moscow City Procuracy has established, Rutskoy had to be hastily exonerated in the eyes of the public opinion... How do we see the body for combating crime (the name is not important--whether it is a department, ministry, committee, bureau, and so on)? It must include an investigative committee, comprising units along the following lines: criminal investigations, and a combined unit for combating economic and organized crime. Currently existing units most often duplicate one another's efforts. It should also include expert evaluation institutions (except medical), operational units, and investigative detention facilities. Naturally all of them should be removed from MVD jurisdiction. It should maintain business contacts and interaction with the Federal Counterintelligence Service, and conduct joint actions on matters within the latter's competence. Gathered together, in one powerful fist, the aforementioned units--the head of the entire structure absolutely has to be a member of the Security Council--will be capable, in our opinion, of conducting investigations promptly and successfully, and in the final analysis, suppress crime. We cannot leave unmentioned the role of investigator in such a body. In essence he is the main actor, and it is for him that the operational services should work within the framework of a specific criminal case, intensifying or reducing their activities depending on the results. He should receive in writing all their information without identifying the sources, which then remains outside the bounds of the case handed over to the court, which allows who did what and how to be checked. Right now information relevant to numerous cases under investigation bypasses him, goes into the file of a militia operative, and after a period of time is destroyed. On top of that other militia officers, who are not part of the criminal case (and responsibility for it) have access to it, as well as technical personnel at the stage of registration and handling. That is, there is a myriad of opportunities for information leaks, and only the procuracy investigator, alas, has no access because it is classified. A criminal can take advantage of this information, but the investigator cannot. This situation allows criminals to avoid prosecution, and operational services--to hide their inactions and incompetency. There is also great potential here for abuse of official position. The time has come to bring up the question of redefining the rights and duties of the investigator and the procurator, and their relationship. The current Criminal Process Code of Russia says that in the course of preliminary investigation the investigator makes independently all decisions on the direction and conduct of investigative action, with the exception of instances envisaged by the law when a procurator's sanction is needed (and now from the court as well), and also bears complete responsibility for their legal and timely conduct. Complete independence? Do not be too hasty. Here are the rights of the procurator, which do not leave the investigator any room for independence. He, the procurator, initiates the case and requests an audit; revokes investigators' decisions; issues written instructions on investigating a crime, on selecting, changing, or repealing a measure to secure the appearance of the accused, on classifying a crime, and on conducting individual investigative actions, and all his instructions are mandatory for compliance; participates in conducting investigations, personally conducts certain investigative actions or full investigations; removes the investigator from further handling of the case; affirms the bill of indictment; and sends the case to the court... In other words, it is the procurator who makes all the major decisions on the case, while the investigator is relegated to the role of executor of his will, which is far from always based on the law. A serious miscalculation was made by the procuracy's previous leadership in the GKChP [State Committee on the State of Emergency] case. It was precisely this case that did a lot of damage to the procuracy's authority, and that of the investigators with it, although their fault in this is a lesser one. Considerable resources and high-level specialists were brought into the investigation of that case; they carried out their duties in keeping with the requirements of the law. However, the proof they collected was evaluated not by them but by Procurator General--now former--V. Stepankov, his deputy Ye. Lisov, and V. Frolov. One of the authors of this article was in Foros and worked with the border troops personnel, who were blamed for everything under the sun during the first days after the rescue of the "Foros captive." Who, by the way, has never been found a victim in this case. The investigator's assessment, based on the testimony of the people who guarded the president's dacha, not only was not needed by anyone--the team's leadership did not even listen to his report on the work done. As to the circumstances of developing the procurator's assessment, which then became the basis for the prosecution's case, there was a testimony of one of the organizers of the investigation--the same V. Frolov. In IZVESTIYA dated 11 January 1994, in his "advice" to the procuracy he blames himself for at the time "...not having been able to find a precise classification for the case. But this was an unprecedented case, and the opinions of scholars and specialists were split exactly half-and-half...." That is interesting; somehow, we, during all our years of investigative work, believed that the facts that serve as evidence are established through the testimony of a witness, the victim, a suspect, the accused, and others, among whom the "opinions of scholars and specialists" or perhaps someone else are not envisaged by the law. By the way, it is not surprising that Mr. Frolov was not able to "determine his position." Although he is called a "former investigator," and after his interrogation of Gorbachev even was listed for some time as the "prime" investigator, he never worked as one in his life. Hence Mr. Frolov's "advice" to produce a political rather than legal assessment of the actions of those using tanks to shell point-blank the parliament legally elected by the people, and those who issued this order. We think that all jurists, including the "resigned" General Procurator of the Russian Federation, A. Kazannik, who recently wrote an anniversary article about A.F. Koni, remember how the latter made precisely a legal assessment of the criminal case against V. Zasulich, for which he ended up for many years in disfavor with the authorities but went down in history as a great jurist. There are people in Russia to emulate! The State Duma amnestied the participants of the October events. However, the lessons of the investigative actions in this case must be learned. As is known, the Office of the General Procurator of Russia initiated criminal proceedings on the Moscow events on 3-4 October 1993. Article 20 of the Criminal Process Law, which is mandatory for the procurator and the investigator, says that they, along with the court, must take all measures envisaged by the law in order to conduct a comprehensive, complete, and objective investigation of the circumstances of the case; the next article of the same law mandates that the causes and conditions that contributed to the commission of the crime must be identified. Based on these requirements, an investigator must examine the "site" of the incident, facilities, objects, and documents for the purpose of uncovering criminal evidence and determining the situation. Now a trick question. Was it necessary to examine the Russian parliament? Without question, any jurist will say, and it had to be done right away on 4 October, immediately after the president's opponents left it. The investigators in the central apparat waited in vain for instructions to go and examine the site of the incident. The investigators spent the first half of 5 October waiting. Now let us turn to ex-General Procurator V. Stepankov, who recently broke his vow of silence and in an interview to the Perm newspaper ZVEZDA said the following. "On 3 October [as published] we found no corpses in the White House. Not a single one. Therefore, the investigation was deprived of the opportunity to establish to the full extent the cause of death of each person who had been taken away from this building before we arrived. What we saw differed a lot from the picture in which the White House is presented as a source of threat stuffed with numerous armaments." Excuse me, Mr. Stepankov, but why did you not fulfill your duty and did not issue instructions to begin the examination as early as 4 October, or at least in the morning of 5 October, and did so only after all the casualties had been removed, thus immediately nullifying all the efforts of the investigators to establish the truth? And generally, the question of "the eyes of the sovereign" deserves special attention. They are losing their vision increasingly often. Examples? Certainly... The general procuracy removes itself from initiating a criminal case based on the fact of V. Bakatin's handing state secrets over to the United States. The law is the law, and no matter how you twist it, the actions of the former chairman of the KGB did contain the attributes of the crime envisaged by Article 64 of the RSFSR Criminal Code--betrayal of the motherland. How many facts of pilfering the national wealth with the participation of highest officials have come to light, while criminal proceedings have not been initiated in a single one. We have had five general procurators over the past few years. All of them were appointed for understandable reasons. M.S. Gorbachev had A.Ya. Sukharev; the situation changed somewhat--now it was N.S. Trubin; during the period of the "battle of sovereignties"--"our man" V.G. Stepankov. He did not meet expectations and was immediately replaced. A. Kazannik did not carry out the president's "political will" (again, let us note, not the law but someone's will), and he had no choice but to resign. All the aforementioned procurators had something in common, however: They all attempted to subjugate the investigative apparat and use it in political battles. There is no question that in matters of combating crime far from the last place belongs to the preliminary investigation, which should be concentrated in only one single organization. In order for it to function normally, norms of criminal and criminal process law must be urgently changed to take current realities into account. The procuracy's oversight over investigations must be abolished by transferring the right to issue sanctions to the court. Perhaps it makes sense to have in the central apparat a few irremovable investigators for the investigation of cases of particular importance--for instance, those initiated on the materials of parliamentary commissions. The legal status of such an investigator will protect him from bureaucrats' arbitrariness and enable him to work in keeping with the letter of the law. As to the procuracy, it should be retained, without the right to oversee investigations, and precisely as an eye--an all-seeing eye at that--that will promote compliance with the law and facilitate the building of a law-based state. It is a different matter to correctly organize its work, find qualified personnel, and place them skillfully, to serve the law and only the law, and to rid itself of inert, unprincipled staff members who "go with the flow" and orient themselves on "evenly split" opinions. In this article we, professional procuracy officers, have presented our views on investigation and the shortcomings existing in combating crime, and it will be enough of a reward for us if at least some of what we have said will be used to root out problems.
