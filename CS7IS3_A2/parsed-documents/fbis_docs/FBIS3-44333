A survey shows that the province has invited 250 foreign experts to work in industry and agriculture over the past three years. Using an agro-technique imported from Japan, Zhejiang has harvested an additional 783.5 kg per ha on 10.88 ha of experimental farmland. The technique is now being promoted across the province. With help from a German expert, the Hangzhou Steam Turbine Plant in this provincial capital has improved technological processes and modernized its products, which are now sold well abroad. To attract more foreign know-how, the provincial government has worked out special preferential policies while encouraging localities to take good care of foreign experts.
