This was announced at a news conference of Slovak Economics Minister Jan Ducky and chairman of the Council of the Czech-Slovak Customs Union following its extraordinary session today. The conference was attended by six Czech and Slovak ministers. Both sides will meet before March 31 to iron out an agreement of the individual criteria which Slovak quality certificates must meet in the Czech Republic, and vice versa. The ministers said only one percent of their countries' mutual trade still needed to be coordinated at the future meeting, because for the other 99 percent of goods the certificate question had already been resolved. The Czech representatives at the meeting had requested the Slovak Customs Administration reconsider its decision to require the certification of all imported goods by domestic inspectors. Czech Agriculture Minister Josef Lux informed reporters of the Czech contingents' intentions before the meeting.
