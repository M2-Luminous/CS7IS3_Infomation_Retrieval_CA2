The European Union and UN mechanisms that put the issue of a possible introduction of economic sanctions against Croatia on the agenda would not have been set in motion. Silajdzic mentioned 10,000 to 12,000 members of the "regular Croatian Army" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali mentioned 3,000 to 5,000 Croatian Army members in Bosnia-Herzegovina in a letter to the UN Security Council chairman dated 2 February 1994. Apart from that, Butrus-Ghali also wrote that, at the beginning, Croatian Army soldiers, mostly groups of volunteers, directly supported the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] with equipment and weapons, and concluded: "Since the offensive of the army of the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina grew stronger, it seems that the number of Croatian soldiers has increased." Butrus-Ghali did not mention in his report that this offensive of the "government forces" expelled approximately 120,000 Croats from their homes in central Bosnia, that several towns and many villages were completely destroyed or burned down (not to mention the massacres committed on civilians), that the Croats from Central Bosnia were pushed into three enclaves (Lasva Valley -- 80,000 people, Kiseljak-Kresevo -- about 100,000, Zepce -- 50,000 and Usora -- 20,000), and that the Croatian people are facing complete extinction because of constant Muslim attacks (with the exception of Usora, which is constantly being attacked by Serbs). Mr. Puljic, the Bosnian archbishop, realized this and said in a sermon some time ago that "a propaganda machine is being created in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aim of which is to completely destroy the Croatian enclaves." He made this statement although it is known that he is inclined to support Izetbegovic. He asked the world to exert pressure on the Muslim leadership in order to prevent them carrying out their goal. Illegal "Legal Organs" Since the Croats in the Central Bosnian enclaves are defending their territory, trying to save their existence in the places in which they had a majority according to the last census (see the table at the end of the text), and since the Muslim leadership is, at the same time, trying to destroy the Croatian Army in order to take land from the Croats -- as was proven during peace negotiations (in the talks on territorial partition, Izetbegovic told Tudjman that he would sign the Bonn proposal on condition that the whole territory of Central Bosnia became a part of the Muslim republic) -- it is not clear why the international community shows understanding for these politics. Even more, since there is no multicultural element in the Muslim politics, they are motivated exclusively by the national idea -- it wants to gain as much territory as possible for its state, even territories in which other peoples have lived for centuries, as is the case in Central Bosnia. Silajdzic's letter to the United Nations is an act of revenge because the Muslim forces failed in their attempt to seize the Croatian enclaves or to begin their breakthrough to the south. Silajdzic knows that he cannot count on a victory in Central Bosnia, because the HVO have strengthened their positions there (it could happen that the Croats will take some Muslim territories), so he is now trying to reconstitute Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unitary state in order to get international support. According to its Constitution, Bosnia-Herzegovina is a state of three constituent nations, which means that all three have to reach consensus when decisions are taken. Since first the Serbs and then, after the Muslim offensive, the Croats also left the government and the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are now no legally elected representatives of these two nations in the legal bodies of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Silajdzic was incorrect when he told Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy: "We are a UN member and there are not three sides in Bosnia, there is only one side and that is the government of Bosnia- Herzegovina and the other legal bodies that represent Bosnia-Herzegovina as a UN member." Akashi knows, however, that the government and "other legal bodies" of Bosnia-Herzegovina are composed of Muslims only. Since they represent only one nation, and the Constitution says that Bosnia-Herzegovina is a state of three nations, Silajdzic's bodies do not have legitimacy. For this reason, Silajdzic can represent only Muslims, not Bosnia-Herzegovina. His wish is similar to that of Milosevic, who claims for Serbia the continuity of the former Yugoslavia. International law (Badinter's commission) contested Milosevic's wish, so that there is no reason to doubt that Silajdzic will receive the same answer. Right to Bosnia-Herzegovina The international community is afraid of the unfolding events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since Bosnia-Herzegovina is a UN member, its collapse could, so it is claimed, become an argument that other states, especially in Eastern Europe, could use in order to annex territories of other states under the pretext of protecting their national minorities. This opinion prevailed during the discussion on Bosnia-Herzegovina in the U.S. Senate when it was decided that the U.S. President should propose the introduction of sanctions against Croatia. It was clearly stated in the resolution that "although the Croatian aim might be the protection of the ethnic Croatian community from the Muslim offensive in the short run, there is the doubt that Croatia might wish to change the borders in the long run." This doubt is not unfounded, but it is not correct that the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are an "ethnic community," as is stated in the resolution adopted by the U.S. Senate. The Croats are one of the constituent nations. This is stated in the Constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so that the relation of the Republic of Croatia to the Croats in Bosnia cannot be an example for other countries (Russia, Serbia, Iran...) that are starting, or have already started, aggression against other states, trying to take territories from them and change borders by force. The Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are not a minority, but a nation, they have the same rights as the most numerous nation there -- the Muslims (and the Serbs, too). This makes it clear that Bosnia-Herzegovina can survive only if its three nations reach an agreement, as has already been stated thousands of times. In other words, Bosnia-Herzegovina will not survive unless the legitimate representatives of its three nations find an acceptable concept for its survival. Through intervention from outside, Bosnia-Herzegovina can be saved for some time if a protectorate, in other words a certain kind of occupation, is introduced. From the Turkish occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the present day it has existed only as a province of an occupier. The occupiers were first the Turks, who granted it a certain autonomy within their empire. Bosnia-Herzegovina was then occupied by the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, and, in the end, there were the periods of the greater-Serbian (Yugoslavia between the two world wars) and communist (Tito's Yugoslavia) dictatorships. When Yugoslavia was dissolved, the population of Bosnia-Herzegovina decided in a referendum that their country should become a sovereign state (the Croats also voted for this proposal), which was later recognized by the international community. Milosevic committed an act of aggression against it, occupying around 70 percent of its territory. He also carried out ethnic cleansing of the Muslims (but also of Croats in Bosnian Posavina). Since the international community was not able to force the Serbs to stop the aggression and to return the territories they had cleansed, the Muslims adopted the Serbian concept and started occupying the territories with a Croatian majority (Central Bosnia, Vares), as well as those areas in which the Croats were a minority (Travnik, Bugojno, Konjic, Jablanica...). The Croats were expelled from their homes. They no longer control a single town in which the Muslims had the majority before the war (approximately the same number of Croats and Muslims lived in Stolac). Failure of Peace Offers It is true that during this war the political leadership of the Bosnian Croats and their army made certain moves that cannot be justified (they were accused by the leaderships of both the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosna and of Croatia), but regardless of how significant they might have been, they still cannot justify the Muslim offensive, the aim which is -- as was expressed by the Sarajevo archbishop -- "a complete destruction of Croatian enclaves" and -- as politicians warn -- a breakthrough toward the south in order to cut the Croatian state into two parts. These intentions of the Muslim leadership cannot be regarded benevolently by the political leadership of the Republic of Croatia, the state that is taking care of half a million refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina (mostly Muslims). Croatia simply cannot allow the Muslim army to expel 200,000 Croats from the enclaves in Central Bosnia. The Croatian leadership was aware of the danger that sanctions could be introduced against it, so it did not want to send its army to the territory of another state, although there were requests for help and although it did not have the intention of occupying territory, but of protecting the people in the enclaves and in northern Herzegovina. Supported by the international community, the Croatian leadership tried to break the Muslim offensive through various peace initiatives and compromises offered to Alija Izetbegovic, but to no avail. Since Izetbegovic and Silajdzic did not want to give in, and since the Muslim army continued its attacks, volunteers from Croatia born in Bosnia-Herzegovina joined the HVO in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was, however, not enough to stop the Muslim aggression, so the associations of Bosnian Croats active in Croatia compiled lists and carried out an informal mobilization of Croats born in Bosnia-Herzegovina (about 1,500 people), who went to Bosnia as volunteers. On 7 February, when deciding on the introduction of sanctions against Croatia and on the proposal they will submit to the United Nations, the foreign ministers of the European Union will hopefully not forget that the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are neither a minority nor an ethnic community, but a nation, that they are fighting in Central Bosnian enclaves against the Muslim forces ("government forces") that want to carry out ethnic cleansing there (as has already been done to 120,000 Croats). They will hopefully not forget that Croatia is taking care of 700,000 refugees, half of whom come from Bosnia-Herzegovina, that Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be an example for some countries that may try to annex the territories of other countries on the pretext of protecting their minorities. Apart from that, the European Union has to bear in mind that Bosnia-Herzegovina can survive only if the European Union establishes a protectorate over it, as was done by Austria after the Berlin Congress. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |National Structure of the Croatian Enclavesin Central Bosnia According to th-| |e 1991 Census | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Commune |Inhabitants |Croats |Muslims |Serbs |Others | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Busovaca |18,883 |9,064 |8,497 |566 |755 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kiseljak |24,091 |12,527 |9,977 |723 |964 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kresevo |6,699 |4,756 |1,541 |-- |402 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |N.
