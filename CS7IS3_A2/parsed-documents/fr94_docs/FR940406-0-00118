FR940406-0-00118 FR940406-0-00011 The benefits vary over time and with the scenario analyzed. Benefits vary over time because of the phase-in of the ORVR requirement and the need for fleet turnover to occur before full implementation of ORVR-equipped vehicles occurs. The key variable with regard to scenarios is the presence and possible phase-out of Stage II controls. ORVR benefits in NAAs include control over service stations in NAAs without Stage II, control at service stations which now receive waivers, and control over vapors missed by Stage II equipment. For the rulemaking as a whole, neglecting the presence of Stage II controls, LDV/LDT ORVR would achieve average annual emission reductions of over 420,000 tons per year. With Stage II phaseout when ORVR and Stage II would cover the same percent of fuel in use, the average annual emission reduction is about 378,000 tons. Even if Stage II controls are retained, an incremental benefit of 285,000 tons occurs nationwide. Of these reductions, approximately 20 percent occur in NA areas, with the overall percentage in NAAs increasing substantially if Stage II is phased out. B. Costs of Control ORVR costs of control are comprised of control system hardware costs plus short term (five year) costs for research, development, and testing (R,D,& T) minus fuel vapor recovery credits. Costs were derived incremental to the effects of enhanced evaporative emissions and RVP control, with the assumption that most vehicles would use integrated evaporative/refueling control systems with liquid seals in the fillneck. The retail price equivalent (RPE) for hardware and R,D,& T costs range from $6&hyph;8 for LDVs and LDTs. Even these small costs are somewhat offset by ORVR fuel recovery credits. The level of the ORVR recovery credit depends on whether Stage II equipment is used when refueling. For the nationwide case, which involves Stage II and non-Stage II areas, the NPV of the recovery credit ranges from $2&hyph;$4 per-vehicle for LDVs and LDTs. Accounting for these recovery credits, both short and long term net costs are under $5 for LDVs and LDTs. EPA assessed the net costs of LDV and LDT ORVR controls for three scenarios. The first (baseline) scenario neglected the presence of Stage II controls, the second accounted for Stage II controls with phaseout in 2010, and the third included Stage II with no phaseout. In each case, the ORVR hardware and R,D,& T costs are the same, but the recovery credit varies. In the first case the average annual cost is about ^$6 million over the period 1998&hyph;2020. With Stage II present and phasing out in 2010, the average annual costs is $2 million. With no phase out average annual costs increase to $27 million over the period 1998 to 2020. The 1998 NPV costs (discounted at 7 percent to 1998) for the same three scenarios are $102 million, $264 million, and $435 million, respectively. In the cases where costs are negative, it is because the value of the recovery credits exceeds the hardware and R, D, & T costs. C. Cost Effectiveness Using the net present value of the costs and emission reduction benefits, EPA has calculated the cost effectiveness of LDV/LDT ORVR controls for the three scenarios mentioned above. For the first case where Stage II controls are neglected, the cost effectiveness is about $35 per ton. In the second case where Stage II control is considered, but phased out in 2010, the cost effectiveness is about $100 per ton. In the final case where Stage II is not phased out, the cost effectiveness is about $210 per ton. When all costs are included in the calculations but only NAA emission reductions are credited, the cost effectiveness values change. For the first case discussed above, cost effectiveness value is $70 per ton. In the second and third scenarios, the cost effectiveness would increase to about $250 and $775 per ton, respectively. D.
