The Russian president and the British prime minister reiterated that it should be resolved peacefully above all. Responding to journalists' questions after the signing at the Kremlin of the Russo-British declaration on strategic missiles, Boris Yeltsin said: Certain people are trying to decide Bosnian questions without Russia's participation. We will not allow this to happen. Russia will be an active participant in the talks, so that a peaceful end is found to the war in Yugoslavia. On Monday the UN Forces Command in former Yugoslavia ordered the Russian battalion stationed in eastern Croatia to send 400 men to Bosnia. RIA Novosti correspondent Sergey Gryzunov reports on the situation in former Yugoslavia: [Begin Gryzunov recording] Russian diplomatic sources in Belgrade confirmed that the UN Command in former Yugoslavia had ordered the Russian battalion stationed in the Vukovar region of eastern Croatia to send a reinforced company to Bosnia and deploy it on the demarcation line between Serbs and Muslims. Unconfirmed reports say that after consultations with Moscow the battalion commander was instructed to stay put. According to unconfirmed reports, the Russian battalion did not receive a categorical order from the UN Command, but an inquiry about the possibility of transferring part of the battalion. In this instance the Russian paratroopers, who number 1,200, are subordinate to the peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia, not to the command of Russia's airborne assault forces. Today, 16 February, Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special representative at the talks on former Yugoslavia, changed his travel plans and made an urgent flight to Belgrade from Zagreb. He will probably hold a fresh round of meetings, his second during the last three days, with the Serbian leadership. The question of participation by Russian soldiers in the Bosnian conflict is bound to come up at these talks. Yesterday in Zagreb Churkin said that as long as the West makes decisions about Bosnia-Herzegovina without Russian participation, there could be absolutely no question of using the Russian army in operations on the territory of the present conflict. A former criminal nicknamed Arkan, who set up his own Party of Serbian Unity and became a member of parliament, called on the Serbs to rally to the defense of the motherland if air strikes go ahead. Arkan, whose extradition is being unsuccessfully sought by Interpol, has said he is using Russian secret weapons that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy gave to him. Thus, one can say that attempts are being made to draw Russia into the Bosnian conflict under any pretext. [end recording]
