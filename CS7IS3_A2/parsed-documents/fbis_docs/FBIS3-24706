Museveni told a news conference that although Uganda did not have an extradition treaty with Burundi, the two soldiers will not be allowed to stay in Uganda. "I have instructed our people to arrest the officers and expel them from Uganda although we shall not take them back to Burundi," Museveni said. Museveni did not name the soldiers, but last month Burundi was reported to have asked Uganda to extradite Major Lazaro Busokoza and Lieutenant Paul Kamana who fled to Uganda after the October 21 coup attempt. President Melchior Ndadaye was killed when the army, dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe, tried to overthrow his popularly elected government. Ndadaye was from the majority Hutu group and winner of the small highland nation's first multi-party presidential poll. Meanwhile, Museveni and visiting Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki signed an agreement for economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. Isayas is scheduled to leave Uganda later Friday after a five-day official tour.
