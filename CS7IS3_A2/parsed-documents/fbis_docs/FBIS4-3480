It is necessary to adhere to the principle of promoting unity, stability, vigor, and positive publicity; put the stress of news propaganda on economic construction, reform, and opening up; serve the central task--economic construction--in a more conscientious and effective way; and take a clear-cut stand in supporting and publicizing reforms. Comrade Danzim said: All news media should devote their major energy to reporting Tibet's great undertakings of reform and opening up, the people's pioneering spirit during the course of creating a new life, and the political stability, economic prosperity, social progress, and happiness enjoyed by the people. News articles, pictures, and photographs should be aimed at reporting the cadres, workers, peasants, herdsmen, and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, public security police, and armed police force who are working hard on the forefront of economic construction, maintaining stability, and building the two civilizations. Comrade Danzim pointed out: News propaganda should be designed to guide, protect, and bring into play the initiative of the people and of all quarters; and to make people's thinking and deeds conform to the party's basic line, and the general guidelines and tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee and autonomous regional party committee. News media should serve as a center of public opinion for promoting reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability in Tibet. Comrade Danzim emphasized: Strengthening leadership over news media is of extreme importance in providing correct guidance for public opinion. The party committees and propaganda departments at all levels in Tibet should establish and improve the system of meeting the press. News media should step up contacts with economic departments. Economic departments should constantly keep the news media informed of economic work so they can promptly and accurately know the economic situation and report it accordingly.
