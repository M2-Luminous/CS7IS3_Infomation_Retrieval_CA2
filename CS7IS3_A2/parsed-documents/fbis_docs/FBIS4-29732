The adjournment of the meeting, which was seen as a tactic employed by the Democrats in collaboration with the NAP, effectively blocked the attempt by 21 PTP rebel MPs to move forward their motion for constitutional reform which they had hoped to be debated in the House on Thursday. Had the motion been passed which the PTP expected so with the backing of the Opposition and the Solidarity, another coalition party, Chalat Worachat would have ended his fast and the protest would be over. The fact that the PTP rebels were outwitted by the Democrats could be attributable to their political apprenticeship compared to the Democrats' mastery in political intrigue and treachery. Several members of the temple faction in the PTP have also blamed some senior party members of working "hands in gloves" with the Democrats to block the rebels' charter motion. The setback sustained by the PTP rebels and the temple faction including de facto leader Chamlong Simuang, came one day after the party managed to enlist unanimous support from the executive committee for the rebels' motion for constitutional reform. This was something unusual because the party itself was earlier widely split over the motion issue. Yet, they did not discuss about moving forward the charter motion and would ask for the motion to be moved forward at the parliamentary floor. The rebels had hoped that this would be discussed on Thursday. But the golden opportunity was missed out. Government whips moved quickly by holding a meeting Thursday morning which ended with a resolution for the PTP not to move forward the motion of the rebels. Bound by the resolution, the rebels did not ask to move forward their motion, hoping that this would be done by the Opposition or the Solidarity Party. Eventually, they realised that neither the two sides would request the motion to be moved forward, the PTP rebels tried to initiate the move themselves and to enlist their support. By the time they regrouped, it was already too late. The House was adjourned before the move materialised. For the time being, there was nothing that the PTP rebels and the temple faction could do until next Thursday when the House reconvenes to consider motions. Badly outmanoeuvred and outwitted, the only trump card that Chamlong has in his hand and that he could play is to pull out of the coalition government. A meeting of the executive committee was tentatively scheduled this Monday during which an important decision would be made. And the likelihood is that the party, with the urging of Chamlong, will opt to withdraw. The stage has already been set to put pressure on the PTP to call it quit. Sudarat Keyuraphan yesterday resigned as deputy government spokeswoman. Ruangwit Dusadisuraphot and Thamrong Saengsuriyachan also quit as deputy secretary-general of the prime minister and government whip respectively, citing their conflicting views with those of the government. Without any doubt, this whole political episode has driven a deep wedge within the PTP as never before. The chasm of division will be further widened if the party decides to pull out. The temple faction will certainly demand pulling out and this is most likely to be resisted by the ministers and the so-called layman faction. Some observers believe that Chamlong may have to come back to take the rein of the party and to assert his authority to put his own house in order. The task is easier said than done because it may involve some sacrifices. But there seems to be little choice if the PTP wants to restore its bruised image and also if it intends to stay on in the political arena. If the pullout of the PTP is intended to force the hand of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to dissolve the Parliament and call a new general election, then this is likely to be strongly resisted by Mr Chuan who has, on various occasions, announced that he would not dissolve the Parliament. This will be the last option if other alternatives do not work out. Behind-the-scenes political manoeuvrings have reportedly started when news leaked about the PTP threat to withdraw. Informed political sources said the Democrats through their new deal-maker, Agriculture Minister and deputy secretary-general Niphon Phromphan, would approach the opposition Chat Thai or the Chat Phatthana parties to replace the PTP should the PTP actually calls it quit. Both Chat Thai and Chat Phatthana earlier announced openly that they would not simply replace the PTP. Instead, they want a major Cabinet reshuffle with the prime minister resigning in order that a new Cabinet can be formed. This may sound to be too much for the Democrats because of their mistrust towards the two opposition parties. Provided that there is no change of position from either the Chat Thai or the Chat Phatthana Party and if the Democrats is unreluctant to part with the New Aspiration, the Democrats may not be able to find a new partner to replace the PTP and have no choice but to dissolve the Parliament. But anything is possible in Thai politics. An ally today may become an enemy the next day. And today's foe may turn out to be an ally the following day. After all, it was the Democrats themselves who have pushed themselves into the corner. Had they been less stubborn and more flexible and had they allowed the PTP rebels' motion to be debated in the Parliament, they would not have plunged themselves into yet another crisis.
