Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said Thailand will (?listen to) the ASEAN representatives' opinions on the (?dispute) at a meeting, which will prepare for an ASEAN ministerial meeting in (?June), to be held in Bangkok next week. Moreover, a report from Bangkok said Prasong on 18 April appealed to diverse countries or outsiders to stop supplying armaments and ammunition to Cambodia, saying the military aid would further inflame the conflict between the Phnom Penh government and Khmer Rouge rebels. The Thai foreign minister also told reporters in Bangkok that the aid was not (?an approach) to solving the problem. He added that various countries and outsiders appear to be bringing more violence to Cambodia on top of the existing conflict. It is wondered whether Pasong Sunsiri's [words indistinct] statement contradicts the accusation by the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] about Thailand's recent support for the Khmer Rouge -- support that is contrary to Thailand's pledge made during Chuan Likphai's visit to Cambodia -- and that Thailand supports the Cambodian government, not the Khmer Rouge. According to the 19 April issue of Thailand's THE NATION, Thai Army Chief General Wimon Wongwanit has issued an indignant threat to Cambodian leaders, warning them that Thailand can no longer maintain a good relationship [words indistinct], referring to Phnom Penh's accusing Thailand of helping Khmer Rouge leaders. Wimon added that between human beings, true friendship is very important, and so it is with international relations. Without sincerity, there can be no friendship. He further said that [word indistinct] without Thailand as a true friend, Cambodia would certainly be in trouble. Observers wonder why, since the Cambodian Government occupied the Khmer Rouge's important bases along the border, Thailand has never expressed support for the occupation or denounced the Khmer Rouge. It has only done things, such as the recent repatriation of 25,000 Cambodian refugees in violation of human rights, that appear to be opposed to victories by the RGC and opposed to international organizations. Analysts are anxious about the conflict, which is becoming more and more serious. As for the Kingdom of Cambodia, it has always wanted peace and friendship. It is also grateful to its friends for their understanding. We wholeheartedly welcome (?Thai) friends, but not those having a vested interest. The Cambodian people have never practiced the policy of catching a fish with two hands.
