He noted that Lebanon is facing an attempt to undermine it economically and cut it down to size geographically. He said that ending the resistance would be a surrender to Israel. Speaking at a Ramadan dinner banquet held by al-Mabarrat Charitable Society, Birri warned that ending the Arab boycott of Israel without the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 would be a stab in the back for Lebanon's steadfastness and sacrifices.
