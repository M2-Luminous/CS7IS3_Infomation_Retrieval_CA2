Economic recovery must begin with engineering industry, the foundation of which was arms production, he said. It is necessary to draw up a production program for exportable goods based on existing structures, he went on. "The problem of re-expanding arms production is so complex that it is more than illusory to speak of producing new defense systems," he emphasized. The problem of Slovak arms producers' indebtedness was resolved last year by granting loans funded by the National Property Fund and from commercial bank reserves, but it is difficult for arms producers to find new creditors, Magvasi explained. As for the firm Armex, founded by Meciar's government and specializing in arms trade, there exist in Slovakia more qualified and capable companies involved in the same activities, he said. Armex's activities will have to be re-evaluated in the context of the government's new economic policy, Magvasi said. The government decides who can participate in deals on arms exports by requiring that arms exporters obtain licenses, he said, adding that he did not want to favor any particular firm. Obviously, most arms producers are still state property, Magvasi added.
