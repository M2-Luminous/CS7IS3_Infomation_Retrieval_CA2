Pyongyang did not give the IAEA a green light to resume inspection of its declared nuclear sites, agency spokesman Hans Meyer said. In the three-hour contact at IAEA headquarters, the North Koreans conveyed their position and opinions in detail on IAEA inspection while IAEA officials explained details of the demands for inspection, he said, but did not make any further comment. The IAEA team was led by operations director Demetrius Pericos and three diplomats from the North Korean Embassy in Vienna were headed by Yun Ho-chin, a councilor. "I made the proposal enough to secure the continuity of nuclear safeguards," Yun said after the contact. "Next time, it's the IAEA's turn to answer, and the consultations will continue." He declined, however, to comment on whether Pyongyang will allow inspection of its radiochemical laboratory and a 5-megawatt reactor. "You will get the information little by little," he said. The North Koreans rejected the IAEA's demand for extraction of samples from the radiochemical laboratory and reactor while the IAEA people demanded that Pyongyang allow full-fledged inspection according to nuclear safeguards regulations, an IAEA source said. North Korea answered the requirements set by the IAEA at the second contact, Dec. 10, and the discussion focused on narrowing differences.
