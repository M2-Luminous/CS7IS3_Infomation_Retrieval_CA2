When it manufactures metallic rings and cylinders by centrifugation, the PMI Industrial Bronzes kills two birds with one stone. Actually, it uses centrifugal force to achieve concentrations of up to 50 percent of silicon carbide particles in its aluminum parts, over a thickness of its choice, and in parts ranging from 80 mm to 2 m in diameter. This is an original way of exceeding the 20-percent rate, above which the alloy becomes too viscous to be cast. "When silicon carbide concentrations reach 30 percent, the aluminum-matrix composite becomes practically insensitive to friction, its mechanical performance improves, and it can withstand temperatures as high as 300�C," Luc Lajoye, the technical manager, explained. This means a tenfold increase of the application range of light-alloy cylinders. Aerospatiale already placed a test order for space applications. Sollac also decided to subject the alloy to severe testing, using it for an electric collector ring immersed in water heated to over 100�C. It was after the completion of the Euram BRITE [Basic Research in Industrial Technologies for Europe] project, completed jointly with the Grenoble National Polytechnic Institute (INPG) at a cost of 12 million French francs [Fr] over three years, that the PMI developed this knowhow. The manufacturer makes an aluminum alloy containing 10 percent of silicon carbide, and centrifuges this alloy to mold it into a cylinder. Being heavier than aluminum, silicon carbide then migrates toward the outer perimeter. There, it accumulates in concentrations of 30, 40 and even 50 percent. "By varying the temperature and centrifugation rate, we manage to control the concentration and thickness of the solidified zone. But we also vary the particle size (from 10 to 100 fm) to modify the mechanical strength and wear resistance," Luc Lajoye added. Another distinctive characteristic is that the parts are strengthened both at the surface and throughout their thickness. Witness the tests carried out on engine cylinder liners, causing silicon carbide to migrate and accumulate in a 5-mm thick homogeneous peripheral zone containing 35-percent silicon carbide. After the cylinder has cooled, its inside must be machined to remove about 10 mm and get down to the strengthened zone. "Compared with the `Nicasil' surface treatment (using nickel and silicon carbide), the price is divided by two," Luc Lajoye assured.
