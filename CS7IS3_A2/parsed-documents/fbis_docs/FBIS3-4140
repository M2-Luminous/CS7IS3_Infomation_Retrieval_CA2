This is an effective means of supporting reform and solving financial problems, and is also an important matter concerning this year's overall situation of our work in all fields. Issuing national debts to raise funds for national construction in a compensatory form is the method that has been used for many years in our country since the beginning of reform and opening, and this method plays an important role in balancing the state's financial budget, supporting reform and opening, supporting key construction projects in the national economy, and improving the people's livelihood. This year, the issuance of state treasury bonds is of greater immediate and profound far-reaching significance. As Premier Li Peng pointed out in his government work report, the general tasks for the whole party and the whole nation are to grasp the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening, promote development, and maintain stability. In order to support the fulfillment of these general tasks, support reform in various fields this year, increase workers' wage income, and support agriculture, science and technology, and capital construction at some key points, the central government must provide sufficient financial guarantees. This will result in increasing expenditures and reducing financial revenues in state finances to a certain degree. Thus, the financial deficit may become a bit larger. In order to strengthen budgetary management and control, beginning this year, deficits in central finances will not be made up for by means of bank overdrafts in order to prevent the aggravation of inflation caused by the deficit-led currency issuance. Therefore, in addition to measures for increasing revenue and reducing expenditures, the financial deficit of the central government will have to be covered by means of issuing government bonds. People's active purchase of state treasury bonds will be their concrete action of supporting reform and opening and supporting key state construction projects. Through purchase of state treasury bonds, part of the consumption funds and idle money scattered in society may be turned into state's construction funds and used to guarantee key state construction projects and economic development. In fact, this is structural redistribution of financial resources in society. Such practice not only solves financial insufficiency, but also prevents excessive increase in the money supply. It gives correct guidance to the flow of funds in society, and also helps increase the lasting momentum of national economic development and mitigates inflation pressure. The people may also benefit from such results. Therefore, purchasing state treasury bonds is a good thing beneficial to the state and the people. In recent years, with the gradual establishment of the market for government bonds, a favorable tendency to take an active part in trading and purchasing state treasury bonds has appeared among the masses. People have paid more attention to making financial investments, mainly through purchasing state treasury bonds. Government bonds not only play a role in raising construction funds for the state, but have also become a major means of saving and investment. This year, consideration was also given to the personal interest of bond purchasers when arrangements were made for the issuance of state treasury bonds, and more sales points were set up so that purchasers would find it easier to buy the bonds. Various specialized banks and post savings offices have set up tens of thousands of bond selling points. Securities companies, government bond service centers, and the securities departments of trust and investment companies also are involved in selling state treasury bonds. All relevant sales points should act positively and adopt various measures to make things more convenient for investors. The masses should be able to feel that investing in state treasury bonds will bring stable returns to them, and should also be able to feel that it is convenient to purchase and resell the bonds. We believe that with the full understanding and great support of the people throughout the country, with the leadership of the people's governments at all levels, and with the joint efforts of the institutions involved in the process, the task of issuing state treasury bonds this year will certainly be fulfilled.
