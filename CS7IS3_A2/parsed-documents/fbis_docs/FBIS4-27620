FBIS4-27620 "dreas106_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 31 May 1994 North Korea U.S. Said Encouraging Nuclear Proliferation U.S. Said Encouraging Nuclear Proliferation SK0206091094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1650 GMT 31 May 94 SK0206091094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1650 GMT 31 May 94 Korean BFN [Unattributed talk: "The U.S. Imperialists Are the Criminals Who Are Encouraging the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"] [Text] As a needle in a sack still pierces, it can no longer be possible to hide the fact that the United States is the mastermind of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As has already been reported, the SANKEI SHINBUN carried on 18 May an article entitled "The United States has Exported Nuclear-Related Equipment to Eight Countries Suspected To Be Engaged in Nuclear Development--There Is Even Criticism This Violates the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]." The article quotes a 17 May report by the General Accounting Office [of the United States] that the United States had exported more than 1,500 pieces of material and equipment, which can diverted to the production of nuclear weapons, to various countries, including Israel, from fiscal year 1988 to 1992. This is a very grave development of the situation, which can make the NPT itself a scrap of paper, and is an intolerable criminal act that can arouse a high degree of alertness from the international community. Until now, as a signatory of the NPT, the U.S. imperialists have said that they are prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In reality, however, this is a falsehood and it has now been fully disclosed that the United States is none other than a criminal state that is encouraging nuclear proliferation. As everyone knows the NPT stipulates that signatories cannot hand over equipment that can be used for the production of nuclear weapons--including nuclear weapons, of course, or other nuclear explosive devices--to other countries. This notwithstanding, the U.S. imperialists have not only indiscriminately exported materials and equipment necessary for the production of nuclear weapons to various countries, while ruthlessly violating the NPT, but also turned South Korea into the Far East's largest nuclear powder magazine by introducing about 1,000 nuclear weapons into South Korea alone. In addition, recently the U.S. imperialists have continued introducing numerous lethal weapons, including Patriot missiles--weapons of mass destruction--and assault helicopter Apaches, into South Korea, and mobilized them in the area along the military demarcation line, thereby running wild in preparations for a nuclear war. Such acts by the U.S. imperialists are creating a big obstacle to building a nuclear-free world and are seriously threatening the existence of mankind. This clearly shows that the U.S. imperialists are the masterminds who are encouraging the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the basic source of nuclear calamity upon mankind. What cannot be overlooked is the fact that the U.S. imperialists, the masterminds of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, are making an issue of the peaceful use of our nuclear energy while shamelessly talking about the need to abide by the NPT by finding fault with our nonexistent, so-called nuclear issue. We cannot but say this is a brazen-faced thievish logic like a thief crying: Stop thief! Starting with antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuverings, the United States, the ringleader of nuclear proliferation, is trying to give us a title of a nuclear criminal by artificially fabricating a falsehood named North Korea's nuclear issue. This is really ridiculous. In actuality, what should be regarded seriously at the moment is the United States, which is preventing a nuclear-free world by exporting nuclear-related equipment to potential countries with nuclear weapons. As a criminal state that is proliferating nuclear weapons, the United States should be judged in the culprit's dock of the international community. The U.S. imperialists should not find fault with our peace-loving Republic, but apologize to the international community for their own criminal act of violating the NPT and encouraging nuclear proliferation, and should no longer apply the brake on the building of a nuclear-free world.
