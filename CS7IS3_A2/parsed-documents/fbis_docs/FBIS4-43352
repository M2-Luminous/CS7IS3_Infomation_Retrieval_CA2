Commenting on the result, Jacques Delors said: "That the Austrian people, very proud of their history and treasures, very proud too of their intellectual movement, of what people like Chancellor Kreisky and others were able to do, that this people wants to join the European Union, this a far-reaching event and demonstrates that the Austrians went to the heart of the matter. European construction has as aim to extend peace, mutual recognition, as well as making a Europe, threatened by decline due to global changes, radiate. The Austrians understood all this. It is therefore, I believe, a great lesson." In Stockholm, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said that this clear victory of the "yes" vote was a "positive sign" for the referendum on accession planned by Sweden for 13 November, and in Finland, Minister for Trade Pertti Salolainen, who said he was "amazed" by this "crushing majority," also predicted positive effects "for Finland and the other countries" which had negotiated their entry into the Union (in Finland, the referendum will take place on 16 October).
