FBIS4-38522 "drsov105__a94030" FBIS-SOV-94-105-A Daily Report 1 June 1994 ANNEX Belarus Kebich Not Charged by Prosecutor Over Monetary Treaty Kebich Not Charged by Prosecutor Over Monetary Treaty LD3105222694 Moscow RIA in English 1935 GMT 31 May 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD3105222694 Moscow RIA English BFN [Text] Minsk, May 31, RIA -- The actions of Vyacheslav Kebich, chairman of the Council of Ministers, in signing a treaty on merging the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, contain no corpus delicti. This is the conclusion formed by the republican prosecutor's office which examined, at the request of some political parties in opposition to the government, whether some articles of the treaty correspond to the Constitution of Belarus. Nikolay Kupriyanov, head of the supervisory department of the prosecutor's office, explained that certain clauses of the treaty, in particular one on transforming the national bank into a subsidiary of the Russian Central Bank, contradict the republic's fundamental law, which grants the national bank the rights and duties of the country's sole issuing centre. But, in Kupriyanov's view, actually Kebich did not sign this clause, because Stanislav Bogdanevich, the chairman of the National Bank, had previously refused to initial it. So there is no reason to charge the prime minister before the entry of the treaty into force. The charge against Kebich was lifted today -- the day his candidacy was entered in the list of presidential candidates as no. 1, a RIA correspondent was told in the Central Electoral Commission.
