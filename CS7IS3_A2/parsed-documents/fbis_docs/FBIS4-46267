Hamas said it had decided "to halt, for the time being, the pursuit of agents and their execution, in order to allow the Palestinian police to carry out their duties in this area." But it warned that "the role of agents is turning more and more dangerous for the mujahedeen (Islamic fighters), who consider themselves in a constant struggle against the (Israeli) occupation forces." A Palestinian police official, declining to be named, told AFP that the pledge was not enough. "They have not handed over the culprits of Friday's executions and we are going to launch a search for them . . . not because it is Hamas but because they have broken the law and killed people living under our authority," he said. The police earlier ordered Hamas to hand over militants who killed two Palestinians found hanging from electric pylons, in the first such murders since self-rule was launched this month. "We have officially asked Hamas leaders to hand them over so we can try them. It is as much in their interest as it is in ours that they do it," said police chief Nasir Yusuf. He said it was unacceptable that Hamas act as "prosecutor, lawyer, judge and hangman." Control for security on the autonomous Gaza Strip and the self-rule enclave of Jericho has passed to the Palestinian police under the terms of the Israel-PLO autonomy deal, an agreement which Hamas opposes.
