Mr. Samaras also maintained that, within the same framework, any military intervention in Bosnia would be a tragic mistake and added: It would be an even more tragic mistake if Greek forces in any way participated in these actions and the same goes for the participation of any Balkan country, including Turkey, in such actions. KKE [Greek Communist Party] political bureau member Orestis Kolozov said: The KKE opposes any military intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that if this road opens, there is great danger for the Balkans to become engaged in such a way that nobody knows how they would get out. Kolozov concluded: The Greek Government should remain firm in the position that was decided upon at the meeting between the four party leaders and the president on the noninvolvement of our country if the tension escalates. It should also withdraw Greek troops, whether they are members of the AWACS crews or a Greek ship so that no support can be given to these operations. Coalition of the Left and of Progress issued a statement which, among other things, stressed: Resorting to air bombings in Bosnia would complicate the vicious circle of blood and throw oil on the fire with danger for a broader conflagration in the Balkans. The statement added: The Greek Government, from its position as European Union president, must firmly and categorically oppose the option of military intervention that is being promoted. At the same time, the Coalition of the Left proposes that the siege of Sarajevo and the embargo on Serbia be postponed for one month so as to make easier the achievement of a peaceful settlement through diplomatic means.
