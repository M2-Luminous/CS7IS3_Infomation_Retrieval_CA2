The English daily KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL said that the Palestinians were sure to make the Zionists pay heavily for their crimes. The fact that "such a despicable act should have occurred in the holy month of Ramadhan and that too in a sacred place and at a time when Muslims were in prayer speaks of volumes of the peace proclamations that Zionist Premier Yitzhaq Rabin has been making since he signed the fraudulent autonomy agreement with PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat on September 13 in Washington." Refuting Tel Aviv claims to distance from the massacre by blaming the incident on a lone deranged gunman, the article said such a destructive crime could not have been carried out single handed and it's certain that the Zionist regime was involved in the premeditated murderous attack. "Sponsoring state terrorism is not a new game for the Zionist regime," said the daily adding, "it is a part of state policy, backed by its Western allies, ever since Israel was created 45 years ago." The editorial criticized Western governments for turning a blind eye and remaining silent on the Zionist atrocities against Palestinian Muslims. Referring to Washington's approach, it said while it quickly condemns "acts of terrorism" or calls for a halt to violence by the Palestinians it has never asked the Zionist regime to disarm the Jewish settlers or give up their provocative acts even after initiating the peace process. It reminded that the Jewish settlers in Hebron were armed with the latest military equipment and that the Jewish extremists wanted to turn the region into a Jewish town and therefore had indulged in provocative acts to force out the Palestinian residents. Turning to the "sincere condolences" expressed by Rabin on this occasion, the paper said, "Rabin has mastered the art of speaking peace through one end and firing bullets through the other." On claims by peace brokers that Israel and the PLO are more than half-way to launching Palestinian self-rule, it said, "in reality the Zionists are more than half-way to wiping out the Arab population in the land of the Palestinians." Another English daily TEHRAN TIMES criticized the indifference shown by the West to the Palestinian plight and said that the world Muslims should take the initiative and begin implementing independent measures to resolve this historical injustice. "The world Muslims, particularly the Palestinians, can use their own potentials and capabilities derived from Islam and its traditions to reject those leaders who still believe in making peace with the butchers of Tel Aviv, and remove the Israeli cancer from the body of Islamic Middle East." It said that the illegal Jewish settlements populated by recent Russian and East European immigrants are ripe for physical violence because of social, religious and cultural incompatibility of the Zionists with the indigenous Palestinian population. Turning to the Zionists' refusal to abide by U.N. resolutions, it said that the Jews have believed that they can not only steal Palestine but also massacre Palestinian Muslims. "The selective and totally biased way in which the U.N. implements its own resolutions regarding Palestine is weighing heavily on the world's conscience, while the United States, as Israel's military supplier and financial supporter, bears the major share of guilt for Palestine's miseries as well as for this latest Zionist savagery." The daily refuted the U.S. attempts to introduce itself as an honest broker in the Arab-Israel conflict that has humanitarian motives free from political and financial considerations. "But the recent history of U.S. and Western European mediation in this conflict has proven that the West only acts when it is assured that the consequences of its actions are not against Israel or Western interests. Commenting on the same subject, the Persian daily JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI said that all should enter the scene to take revenge for the massacre of innocent Palestinian Muslims. The incident, the daily noted, unveiled the true nature of the Zionists at the international scene and to the world nations. This showed that Palestinians are not secure even in their mosques and at the time of prayer. However, said the article, this is while the traitor 'Arafat and his compromising faction are even ready to massacre Palestinians to guarantee further safety for the Zionists. The occupied Palestine is passing through sensitive and determining moments, stressed the article, adding that the crime, aimed at cementing 'Arafat-Israel compromise, reveals the vicious alliance of Zionism and its supporters. "However, there is evidence showing that the enemy has repeated the same big blunder in this connection and the Palestinian nation will tremble the earth under the feet of the usurper Zionists," concluded the daily.
