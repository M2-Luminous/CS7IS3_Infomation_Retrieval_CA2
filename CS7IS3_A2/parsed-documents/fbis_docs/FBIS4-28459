The embassy, in a brief statement, said Iran "strongly rejects and condemns any act of terrorism against the life of innocent people and considers it unislamic and inhuman." "Since Zionist circles are trying to damage the prestige of the Islamic Republic of Iran by creating false terrorist scenarios, we highly urge the Thai authorities to remain more vigilant on the events," it said. It was the embassy's first public response to the arrests last week of three Iranians suspected to be responsible for the sabotage plot which police believed was intended against the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. [passage omitted] The three suspects were escorted to the Criminal Court, tightly guarded by heavily-armed police commandos, yesterday to be remanded for 12 more days as requested by investigators. They were transferred to the Khlong Prem Central Prison for detention after the court approved a police request for the remand. Investigators said they needed some more time to complete the questioning of 10 more witnesses and collect evidence to substantiate charges against the three in court. They also asked the court to deny any bail request for the suspects, fearing they could flee. Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen Sophon Warachanon said yesterday he expected the suspects to be charged in court in 10 days.
