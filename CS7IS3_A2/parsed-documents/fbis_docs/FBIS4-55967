The sources specify that tensions are most intense in central Bosnia, in the regions of Mostar, Gornji Vakuf, Prozor, Vitez and Vares. Moslems and Croats have obstructed the transport of humanitarian aid, banned refugees to return, and made many other similar actions. The Bosnian Moslems and Croats continued fierce fighting during the last year for the territories with mixed population in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina until they abruptly reconciled in March. The Serb side has learned about more frequent Moslem-Croat armed incidents, which threaten with conflagration of war. Material destruction of facilities, including religious buildings, continues on both sides. It is pointed out that, despite preparations of both leaderships to solemnly inaugurate a new Moslem federation on May 30, agreed under strong U.S. pressure, both people and local authorities of the two sides are becoming convinced that it is impossible to live in a new community. Both Moslems and Croats secretly pile up food, fuel and ammunition reserves. In such a situation, the U.N. peacekeeping forces do their best to prevent atrocities and large-scale clashes from spreading and intensifying which could annihilate the Washington accord on a Moslem-Croat federation, the VRS sources say. The sources point out thtat inter-Moslem clashes continue in the autonomous province of western Bosnia (APZB), in the far west of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is estimated that these clashes may escalate. The APZB was proclaimed by advocates of a peaceful settlement in Bosnia. It was pointed out that units loyal to the Moslem government in Sarajevo have massively displaced population from the outlying sections towards the APZB. This fact is more than an obvious sign that forces loyal to the Moslem leadership in Sarajevo will launch a large-scale attack against the defenders of the APZB, the VRS military sources explain.
