FBIS4-53695 "dreas099_a_94031" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Sakigake's Takemura Criticizes Strategist Ozawa Sakigake's Takemura Criticizes Strategist Ozawa OW2105103494 Tokyo KYODO in English 1026 GMT 21 May 94 OW2105103494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Utsunomiya, May 21 KYODO -- The leader of new party Sakigake [Harbinger], a 15-member opposition group in the House of Representatives, criticized chief coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa on Saturday [21 May] of trying to turn the country into a major military power. In a speech in Utsunomiya, some 110 kilometers north of Tokyo, Masayoshi Takemura said he was opposed to Ozawa's argument for turning Japan into what Ozawa calls an "ordinary country." When Ozawa says "ordinary country," he means one which owns a military commensurate with its economic capability and assumes responsibility jointly with the United States for troubles in the world, Takemura said. Takemura, who served as chief cabinet secretary until late last month in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said his party will never follow the path toward such a military power. Takemura said Japan should make international contributions in such nonmilitary fields as environmental protection, north-south issues, aids and narcotics. Ozawa is regarded as the de facto leader of the ruling coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which is nominally headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. While Ozawa calls for changing Japan into an "ordinary country," Takemura has proposed the nation be a "small but twinkling country." Many political analysts say differences between Ozawa and Takemura represented the underlying cause for the breakup of the Hosokawa cabinet. Takemura's Sakigake did not send any member to the Hata cabinet, but has vowed to back it up from the outside of the cabinet until the fiscal 1994 budget passes through the Diet.
