An announcement by the Defense Ministry Press Center states that facts have been established confirming gross violations during the recent allocation of housing that began on 11 January, connected with certain people enriching themselves at the expense of others. The announcement further states that a group of 30 officers from the Sofia Garrison came to see the defense minister and explained to him their complaints. Their complaints had also been deposited with the commission supervising sales at the Sofia Garrison. Despite explicit instructions issued by Minister Aleksandrov, the commission chairman, Colonel Georgi Vutov, adopted a rude, unceremonious attitude toward the senior and junior officers. The defense minister went in person to the place were the commission sits and immediately dismissed Colonel Vutov from active military service for violations in carrying out the duties entrusted to him. The minister also ordered the replacement of all the members of the commission.
