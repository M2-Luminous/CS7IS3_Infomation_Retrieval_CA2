Japanese participants said U.S. businesspeople taking part in the closed-door session complained about slow progress in opening the Japanese markets for auto parts, insurance and electronics products. On the other hand, the Japanese insisted that progress has been made in bilateral business cooperation to help U.S. firms do business in Japan, they said. As for trade in autos, representatives from Japanese and U.S. automakers pointed accusing fingers at each other over why the U.S. share in Japan's auto market is so small. Delegates from the "Big Three" U.S. Automakers said this is evidence of the closed nature of the Japanese market, but the Japanese pointed to the fact that the European share in Japan's auto market is the same as European makers have in the U.S. market. Some 30 business leaders from the two countries are attending the two-day meeting, arranged by the Japan-U.S. Economic Council and the U.S.-Japan Economic Council and slated to end on Tuesday.
