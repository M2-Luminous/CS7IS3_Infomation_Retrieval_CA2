The area, with nearly 300 ha under the development program, will become another of the city's new industrial bases. It is only six km from the Hongqiao International Airport and linked closely with Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces. Within the area, necessary key infrastructural facilities such as a transformer substation, a water plant and a program-controlled telephone system have been built. So far 32 industrial projects, mainly from joint ventures with businessmen from Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have become established in the area with a total investment of more than 80 million U.S. dollars. Among them technology-intensive and labor-intensive projects co-exist, as do those which are export-oriented or serving domestic markets.
