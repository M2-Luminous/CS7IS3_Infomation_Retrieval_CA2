What will this election entail? The Vyacheslav Kebich's entourage zealously proves that the advent of the current prime minister to the presidential post is inevitable, and there is no alternative to him. Several teams can compete on equal grounds in great Russian, though somewhat differing in programs but having equal strength. But, Byelorussia hardly scraped up one membership of the Council of Ministers. Probably, this also may explain the first place held by Vyacheslav Kebich in the political hierarchy of Byelorussia. This is a team man, a company. In the past, a man of party "clip," who did not try to show off his intelligence. He is winning people's favor first of all by his sociableness and simplicity. A rare deputy who has not asked credits on easy terms, a batch of cheap refrigerators or trucks, a flat or a car for himself. Vyacheslav Frantsevich is generous not only towards his associates but also offers his political opponents whatever help he can. Vyacheslav Kebich is a business manager, rather than a politician. He won his "first" popularity as director of the machine-tool works. The promising organizer was sent by the party to a backward enterprise, which he managed to place among the foremost in the socialist emulation. He was the first among business managers in the capital to recognize such a bourgeois novelty as sociology, providing sociologists with full freedom for any polls. It is noteworthy that with absolutely anonymous questioning the director of the plant received a very high rating of the majority. Vyacheslav Kebich was always distinguished for business activity and the ability to get on with people. Everything seems to indicate that he has kept these qualities even today. The head of the government, addressing the national intelligentsia and convincing them that he places above everything else the independence of his country, and the head of government who made a report to leading industrialists and assured them that he is building a confederation with Russia -- is one and the same man, Vyacheslav Frantsevich Kebich. He is equally ready for both, depending on the circumstances and the situation. MN File In the republic, Vyacheslav Kebich mainly relies on the scientific-industrial association that unites the leading economic executives and entrepreneurs, as well as the pro-communist popular movement of Belarus. He has a major lobby in the parliament. On the eve of the election campaign, this lobby enabled him to remove his rival Stanislav Shushkevich without any problems. What's more, the prime minister called the campaign against him "kitchen squabble" and did not allow himself to make any attacks on his opponent, even in retaliation. In the course of a single day he collected 70 votes in the Supreme Soviet needed for his nomination as a candidate for presidency, and in one week -- about 150,000 votes of ordinary electors. The awakening of the Byelorussian premier's national self-consciousness which took place a year and a half ago, most likely may be explained by the tough pragmatic policy of Yegor Gaidar's government regarding the fraternal republic: inflating the fuels prices, ultimatum demands to pay the debt right up to switching off oil-and-gas supplies for a lengthy period. On the other hand, the present craving for Slav unity is nothing but a calculation on an amicable shifting off of economic burdens on the shoulders of Viktor Chernomyrdin's government. The psychological compatibility of the two premiers has more than once helped Belarus out of seemingly hopeless situations -- with the same enormous non-payments to Russia's Gazprom. The question arises: how compatible are the economic models of the two states and is Vyacheslav Kebich going to accept the tough financial-credit terms of the Russian side or hope to prolong Byelorussian socialism at the expense of Russia? Vyacheslav Kebich was greatly impressed by the outcome of the latest Russian elections. In Minsk they were assessed as the alienation of the broad masses from the market-economic reforms. Large-scale restoration of socialism started, in the form of distributing advantageous credits, allowances, impressive increment of pensions, minimum wages. From the beginning of the year this thricely devaluated the Byelorussian "zaichik."* It is hard to suspect the prime minister of not knowing the real price of such reforms. But the election marathon calls for sacrifices. Let's take, for example, bread. Belarus is importing wheat. By spring, Kazakhstan's grain had run out at the bakeries and the grain for hard currency flowed from Europe. The retail prices of rolls and buns from wheat, officially called "free," automatically rose more than two-fold, sparking off the discontent of the population. Knowing for sure the objective need for the price rise, Vyacheslav Kebich instantly responded live on TV, explaining everything by the arbitrariness of certain officials and promising to punish them. Indeed, he found the "guilty" and punished, even if with official reprimands, and restored the previous prices. The subsidy from the budget remained in the shade. It was allocated for making long loafs cheaper -- 49 billion only for one month. The Finance Minister Stepan Yanchuk was compelled to state that the "unplanned growth of state subsidies on some types of food, housing, communal and transport services resulted in the exhaustion of the annual limit of the budget deficit today." MN File According to the Council of Ministers, during the first quarter the gross domestic product and payments to the budget went down by 40%. The drop came closer to the limits which dictate "the minimum necessary production volume to ensure the minimal requirements of the state." The number of unprofitable enterprises trebled. The average monthly inflation came to 50%. The Cabinet of Ministers sees the way out in rough vertical management, selective backing of enterprises and collective farms, in centralized regulation and, no doubt, in monetary and economic unification with the Russian Federation. The team of Vyacheslav Kebich reveals full unanimity. A special stand is taken only by Stanislav Bogdankevich, Chairman of the National Bank, and Finance Minister Stepan Yanchuk, who nurse no illusions regarding unification and suggest the introduction of market-economy mechanisms. This is explained not so much by personal qualities, as by objective circumstances: the financial system of the republic is coming closer to failure. At the meeting with war and labour veterans, when Vyacheslav Kebich was accused of the disintegration of the economy, he parried: "Just name me an ex-USSR republic where the life of people is better?" As a result of debates the representatives of the older generation unanimously backed up the candidature of the prime minister for the post of the President. There is a great deal of truth in what Kebich says. He did not overlook control over industry, at a time when becoming a head of the government, about 50% of the industrial potential was in republican subordination. Social security spreads not only to old men and children, but practically to all of the able-bodied population. Not a single bankrupt enterprise has been shut down, the giant plants standing idle pay rather impressive wages "or, to be more exact -- allowances." The favorite leisure of the prime minister is angling. The recently economic reports of the prime minister are increasingly reminding of anglers' stories. From time to time Vyacheslav Frantsevich assures that the economic situation is improving. And from the autumn of 1993 the most successful catch is the idea of economic union with Russia. Today Vyacheslav Kebich maintains: "The creation of a single ruble zone is the aim of my whole life." As though his life has not passed in that ruble zone. Was it that long ago at a press conference regarding the introduction of "zaichiki," that the prime minister tried to convince people that Byelorussian and Russian rubles are absolutely equal, but shortly "zaichik" will outweigh and "one Russian ruble will be equal to 60-70 Byelorussian kopeks." Meanwhile, the widely-advertised abolition of the customs duty on raw materials and fuels in the Russian Federation from May 1 did not produce the desired effect. Instead of the customs duty Russia introduced an excise tax which did not improve the situation in the republic. Vyacheslav Kebich must be done justice. Initially the conditions of the Byelorussian-Russian financial-economic union really promised a number of advantages to the Byelorussian side and could really become a ring-buoy. But the methods in "the settlement of issues," polished throughout years, began to malfunction in bilateral relations. The most sober-minded supporters of Kebich believe that it is quite in vain that he has become stuck so strongly to this idea, actually becoming a hostage of the Russian authorities. The hearty attitude of Viktor Chernomyrdin may be balanced by the cool attitude of Boris Yeltsin: unlike Stanislav Shushkevich, the Byelorussian prime minister was not in a hurry to express his support to the President in the critical moments of his confrontation with the legislative power. Vyacheslav Kebich is a pragmatic business manager, and this undoubtedly does him credit at the post he occupies. Quite timely he parted with the communist party "on moral and ethical" considerations -- after the August coup. In Byelorussia he kisses the hand of the Metropolitan Filaret, in Israel wears a skull-cap, in the Arab Emirates would surely accept a Muslim ritual under guaranteed supplies of cheap oil. But the impression lately taking shape is that the sense of realism is leaving the prime minister. He is beginning to believe in his promises, making too big a stake in the political game with Russia. As to his personal qualities, Vyacheslav Kebich on the post of President would guarantee the absence of sharp changes in keeping to traditions (as an ideal prototype for the Byelorussian President he considers Pyotr Masherov, leader of the Communist Party, rather popular even today). But in case of unification with Russia the economic levers of management will be passed over to Moscow which will hardly back up Byelorussian socialism. If the agreement fails, then the economic situation, undermined by the election campaign of the prime minister, will inevitably lead to the worsening of living standards and will call for unpopular tough measures and a corresponding leader for their implementation. MN File Vyacheslav Kebich is a Byelorussian. He was born in Volozhin District in 1936. Finishing school with a gold medal, he enrolled in the Byelorussian Polytechnic Institute. In 1958 he became a business manager as a rank-and-file engineer at the plant of automatic transfer lines, covering the road to one of its leaders. At the age of 40, he became general manager of the Kirov machine-tool works, at the same time heading its design office. In 1980, he was promoted to party work: Second Secretary of the Minsk City Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia and head of the department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia; Second Secretary of the Minsk Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia. He also headed the republican Committee for Economic Planning. Since April 1994, he has been Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and one of the most realistic aspirants for the post of the first President of the Republic of Belarus. He is married and has two children. The members of his family were mentioned in the materials on the parliamentary anti-corruption commission. However, the Procurator's Office did not find any facts of the crime in their actions. * The Byelorussian national currency depicts various animals (including a hare on the one-ruble note), therefore among the people, Byelorussian money is called "zaichik."
