Speaking today in the Presidential Quirinale Palace at a Labor Day ceremony for the award of "stars of merit" to new "masters of labor" from the Lazio and Umbria regions, the president extended his glowing words to include the labor minister in Ciampi's cabinet, Gino Giugni, and the activities of the government installed at the end of April last year. Addressing the gathering which included Ciampi and Giugni, Scalfaro recalled the "burst of applause" of the constituent assembly of the republic on hearing of the constitutional definition of Italy as a republic "founded on labor." "A fine definition because it lends dignity, defends the dignity of man. And this is where thanks are added, thanks due as an act of justice from the head of state to Premier Ciampi," added the president. The labor minister, who spoke earlier, defined "the great cooperation agreement between the government and the labor and business sides" signed July 23 last year as "a genuine social pact" and voiced the hope that "this experience will be prolonged under the sign of continuity in the new phase beginning." Recalling his year in office, Giugni referred to the 70,000 workers "in excess," especially those on the workforces of the automaker Fiat, Ing. C. Olivetti SpA and at the Enichem plant in the southern city of Crotone and named this problem as not only Italian but European and world-wide. [passage omitted]
