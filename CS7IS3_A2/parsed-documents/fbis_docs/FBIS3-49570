Yasushi Akashi spoke in more detail about the results of these talks at a news conference that he held in Sarajevo this evening. Zoran Pirolic reports: [Begin Pirolic recording] During a two-day visit in Sarajevo, Yasushi Akashi met with the representatives of our country's authorities, but also of the aggressor' side in Pale. His impression after these talks put forward in Sarajevo tonight is definitely interesting. I was given assurances by both sides that they favor peace and unhindered movement of humanitarian convoys, Akashi said. This afternoon I was given firm assurances by Mr. Karadzic that his side will fully observe the free use of Sarajevo airport. He reiterated his devotion to the free movement of convoys, Mr. Akashi added. This UN representative said that he had heard from both sides -- the Bosnian authorities and the aggressor's side -- that they favor multiethnic and multicultural life although they differ a little in their views on the implementation of this. After these, definitely unusual assessments, the UN special envoy to former Yugoslavia was exposed to a real barrage of often very unpleasant questions. First of all, he was asked whether he believed Karadzic's promises even though they had been made on numerous occasions before and as a matter of rule subsequently broken. According to Akashi, the entire problem lies in the line of command. Dr. Karadzic admitted to him that the resolutions and declarations had not been observed so far because of disobedient soldiers on the ground, but that the line of command would be strengthen and similar things would no longer recur. Asked about the possibility of air strikes against the Serbian aggressor, Mr. Akashi was at first surprised and then asked what air strikes were. It seems that there is a great confusion between air strikes and what we, in the UN, call air support, Akashi said. The forces on the ground will resort to this sort of protection only in the case of self-defense, Akashi added. Answering to a question whether the recent murderous shelling of Sarajevo, which lasted several days, was also one of the incidents by disobedient soldiers, Akashi replied that elements beyond control exist on all sides. He admitted that four UN Protection Force experts confirmed that Karadzic's Serbs had damaged the runway of Sarajevo airport, but added that he was given firm assurances that this side would not obstruct the flow of humanitarian aid. Asked about the possibility of a military intervention in Bosnia, Akashi said that this was a highly serious issue and that the final decision on this will be passed by the UN Security Council. However, I hope that we will never reach the stage of passing a decision about a military intervention, he said. Asked to explain what is a close air support and how does it differ from air strikes, Mr. Akashi said that the final decision about this action lies in the hands of the UN Secretary General and that it will be based on the assessments of the commanders of the peace troops on the ground. The blue berets had, on several occasions, drilled such an action, Akasi said, adding that he hoped that there would be no need for its application. General Francis Briquemont, commander of the UN peace troops for Bosnia-Herzegovina, also attended the news conference. Asked whether he had proposed air strikes he replied: I have never uttered a word about air strikes or air support, never. I said in August what I thought about this. The air support was organized but I never demanded it. I am the only one who can demand air protection, but I have never done this. I am not upset by what is being said about this in New York, Paris, Brussels, and Geneva. I have enough problems in Bosnia, General Briquemont concluded. [end recording]
