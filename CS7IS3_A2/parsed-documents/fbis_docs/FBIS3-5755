"Reorganization is an inevitable move facing the industry," said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who declined to be named. The comment followed a merger accord reached earlier in the day between Sumitomo Cement Co., the fourth biggest cement maker in Japan, and the eighth largest Osaka Cement Co., a move that will create the nation's second largest cement maker with a market share of about 18 percent. The merger is expected to speed up the collapse of joint sales alliances formed among Japan's cement makers a decade ago. Of the five joint sales entities, two -- one led by Onoda Cement Co. and the other by Ube Industries Ltd. and Chichibu Cement Co. -- have already been dissolved. Another, led by Sumitomo Cement Co., will be disbanded by the end of this month. The latest move by Sumitomo and Osaka would lead to extinction of one of the remaining two alliances -- the one led by Nihon Cement Co. -- because Osaka belongs to the group. The alliances were established as an exception to the Antimonopoly Law under the MITI's strong administrative guidance as part of the cement industry's streamlining efforts. But the long recession in Japan has prompted business tie-ups beyond the framework of the original alliances. Mergers could have more cost-cutting effects than under the alliances in which cement makers cooperated in such sales fields as unification of product brands and distribution systems, the MITI official said.
