The agreement emerged from the bilateral "framework" trade negotiations under way in Tokyo, and will be officially announced after the meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton slated for February 11 in Washington. Under the scheme, Japan will give 3 billion dollars and the U.S. 9 billion dollars over the seven years. The sums compare with 70 million dollars in annual financial aid extended by Japan for such purposes and 600 million dollars by the United States. The sharply boosted aid will be used to try to find an AIDS cure, supply developing nations with condoms, and enlighten people there about the disease. The money will also finance projects designed to spread knowledge of family planning and help poor countries compile more reliable population statistics. According to data by the World Health Organization (WHO), the world's HIV carriers number 14 million at present and are projected to rise to 30-40 million by the year 2000.
