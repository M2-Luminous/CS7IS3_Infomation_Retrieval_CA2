FBIS3-35544 "drnes038dd_94030" FBIS-NES-94-038 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Feb 1994 Palestinian Affairs Commentary Stresses Arab Right To Jerusalem JN2402083594 Sanaa Voice of Palestine in Arabic 1800 GMT 23 Feb 94 JN2402083594 Sanaa Voice of Palestine Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Text] Israel does everything it can to conceal the name of Jerusalem from the march [words indistinct] under the cover of darkness, and when the name of the city of peace surfaces, the Zionists' reality is exposed by their shouts and allegations that Jerusalem is Israeli and will remain the permanent capital of the State of Israel. Despite the frank international resolutions and the rejection of most countries, including the big powers, of the legitimacy of the decision to annex issued in June 1980 to annex Jerusalem, Israel continues to reject any discussion of the fate of the city of peace. It threatens to obstruct the whole peace process if this issue is raised. By this, Israel is exercising every kind of blackmail and Judaization. All these methods cannot change any of official documents and treaties, despite Israel's control of the land, its daily Judaization measures, and its continued settlement operations to change the face of the flower of cities. These documents stress something no one can ignore or hide from. No one has free disposal over Jerusalem or can relinquish any inch of its holy land. No leader, organization, or official alone can negotiate with the Israelis on the decided, irrevocable facts that Jerusalem is Arab and will remain Arab despite all intrigues and conspiracies. It is Islamic and contains the first of the two qiblas, the third of the holiest shrines, and many Islamic holy sites, the foremost of which are al-Aqsa Mosque, 'Umar Mosque, the holy Rock of the Dome, and the place from which the prophet ascended to the throne. It also contains Christian sanctities, including the Holy Sepulcher, but does not contain any Jewish sanctities, contrary to Zionist propaganda allegations. Israel has pursued a well-studied strategy to reach its goals. It began by oppressing Arab residents by confiscating their land, arresting men, damaging the sanctities, demolishing houses, denying construction licenses, waging economic war, and imposing an unethical and inhuman siege on Arab Jerusalem to force its residents to leave it and hand it over to Zionist settlers as an easy morsel. As a result, the character of the old city changed. A series of settlements and brute-like colonies that distort the spiritual and aesthetic face of Jerusalem have been established. The Israeli Government also insisted on separating Jerusalem residents from their brothers and families in the West Bank and Gaza. It prevented any citizen in Jerusalem from joining the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. What is worse is the agreement the Israeli Government recently signed with the Vatican. This has provoked fear that this Catholic edifice may retreat from its resolute rejection of the annexation of Jerusalem and from its insistence on finding a solution ensuring everybody's rights, even through the internationalization of the whole holy city, as demanded by the former pope. The Madrid peace formula suspended the issue of Jerusalem, in accordance with a U.S. demand to postpone complicated and difficult issues until after deciding matters and defining the concept of land for peace, namely, the concept of total peace and total withdrawal in accordance with international resolutions, foremost of which are Resolutions No. 242 and 338. Israel alleges and brags every day that Jerusalem is excepted from total peace and total withdrawal and that it will not sign any final agreement that stipulates a change of the present situation. Therefore, it has resorted to tricks, dividing the solution and demanding partial agreements with each side. Despite all this, the Israelis know they have not been able to impose a fait accompli. Therefore, they are building more settlements, oppressing Jerusalem residents, and [words indistinct]. Some specialized gangs call for the destruction of al-Aqsa Mosque and building the Temple in its place. Despite these difficulties, Jerusalem's residents have proven their ability to defend the den of Arabs and Muslims and have asserted to the whole world that Jerusalem is Arab and will remain so forever. Its current ordeal is not the first. It was subjected to the crusaders' occupation and was liberated at the hand of victorious commander Salah al-Din al-'Ayyubi.
