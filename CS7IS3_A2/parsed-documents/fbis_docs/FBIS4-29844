FBIS4-29844 "dreas120_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 South Korea DPRK Acceptance of Contact Proposal Reported DPRK Acceptance of Contact Proposal Reported SK2206055194 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0500 GMT 22 Jun 94 SK2206055194 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Text] North Korea has notified that it accepts our government's proposal for making a preliminary contact between the South and North to discuss the procedure of the South-North summit talks at the Freedom House in our side's area at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM [0100 GMT] on 28 June. On the telephone line now is a reporter who is covering this issue. Reporter Kim Chong-chin. What is included in the message from the North Korean side? [Begin Kim Chong-chin recording] Yes. In a telephone message sent to Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok today, Kang Song-san, premier of the North Korean State Administration Council, gave an answer to the effect that a preliminary contact for the South-North summit talks be made at the Freedom House in the South's side at Panmunjom at 10:00 on 28 June, as proposed by our side on 20 June. For this, North Korea disclosed that it will send three delegates headed by a vice premier-level official and four entourage members. In today's telephone message, North Korea said that it welcomes and agrees to the South side's proposal because the acute situation prevailing in the Korean Peninsula makes it all the more urgent than ever before for both the South and the North to hold top-level summit talks. North Korea pointed out that the holding of South-North summit talks will be a historical event brining the joy of national reconciliation and unity to the 70 million fellow countrymen and giving a new hope of peace, and independent and peaceful reunification of the country. In this connection, the dialogue between the South and North, which was discontinued because of the 19 March remarks about engulfing Seoul in a sea of flame, will resume after about three months. For the first time since the national division, both the South and North sides will have official discussions on summit talks. One National Unification Board [NUB] official said: It is fortunate to see North Korea accept our side's proposal as it is. We can construe this as a sign with which we can judge in an affirmative way the intention of the North's side to see an early realization of the summit talks. Meanwhile, in the telephone message, North Korea did not mention the list of the delegates. In view of the past practices, it is expected that there is the high possibility that it will notify us of the list one day before the contact, that is, on around 27 June. Although our side's delegates have not been confirmed yet, Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the NUB, will surely be the head delegate. I have so far reported the news report that a preliminary contact for the South-North summit talks will be realized at Panmunjom on 28 June because of the North Korean side's acceptance of our proposal. I have been reporting from the NUB. This is Kim Chong-chin, KBS News, from the NUB. [end recording]
