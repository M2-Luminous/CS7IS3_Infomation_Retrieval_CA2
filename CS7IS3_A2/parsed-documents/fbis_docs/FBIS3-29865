The February 1-10 WPI stood at 93.8 against 100 in the base year 1990. It was down 2.9 percent from a year earlier. The domestic WPI, on which the central bank keeps a close eye, was unchanged from late January but fell 1.9 percent from a year earlier. The index was 97.5. The central bank said prices of steel and electric appliances dropped due to sluggish demand, while those of pork and eggs rose because of a supply shortage and textile goods prices increased due to higher costs of imported materials. The export price index gained 0.1 percent from late January and 4.7 percent year on year on a contract currency basis to stand at 104.7. Officials said higher prices of electric equipment pushed up the figure. In terms of yen, the index dropped 1.2 percent from the preceding 11 days and 3.8 year on year to stand at 84.2, affected by the appreciation of the yen against major currencies. The import price index on a contract currency basis gained 0.2 percent from late January but slipped 3.0 percent from a year before to 93.2. Prices of food and miscellaneous products went down, while those of primary aluminum and cotton were higher.
