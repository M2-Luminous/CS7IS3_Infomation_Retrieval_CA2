In his words, the Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds from the fact diplomatic methods have not been exhausted. This stand is shared by other interested nations, including China, said Moiseyev. The official reminded of the Russian proposal to convene a multilateral conference on security and non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula, which, in his words, "has been positively estimated by all potential participants in the conference with the exception of North Korea". The potential participants include the Russian federation, the United States, China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, as well as representatives of the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time, Moscow is using all political methods to influence Pyongyang and has informed North Korea of its stand, said Moiseyev. For instance, Moscow has invited the deputy North Korean foreign minister to visit Russia in early summer within the framework of bilateral diplomatic contacts. But all Russian diplomatic efforts "cannot have a force nature or pressure form," stressed the official. If the question of sanctions or russian participation in them is raised, "one will have to take into account feasible consequences of this step not only for North Korea but also for Russia," said Moiseyev. The Russian-North Korean goods turnover amounted to 530 million U.S. dollars in 1993, which is 25-30 per cent of the North Korean foreign trade turnover. Russia exported 450 millions worth of goods to North Korea and purchased 80 millions worth of products there. The problem of the North Korean debt to the former Soviet Union and Russia, which is estimated at approximately three billion dollars, remains unsettled.
