Gu Yongjiang, head of the Chinese delegation and vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, made the appeal at the 17th meeting of the GATT China team responsible for the talks. In his speech at the meeting, which began here today, he said that since China applied for reentry eight years ago it has made great progress in its economic and foreign trade reforms. "China has made a series of reforms on its own conditions to meet GATT demands." he added. "In some fields the Chinese markets are more open than some developed nations." Gu said that after the 16th team meeting held in March this year a positive and constructive momentum emerged in the negotiations on the issue. According to the Chinese foreign trade official progress has been made in the bilateral talks China held with some individual GATT member countries and those on cutting tariffs and non-tariffs. "China's economic and foreign trade systems have further conformed to the international ones." Gu said adding that China abolished tariffs on 208 kinds of import commodities from the beginning of this month. [sentence as received] He said China would further cut tariffs by negotiations with the GATT members concerned but stressed that as a developing nation it can only fulfill the obligations taking into account current economic conditions. Gu said GATT's conditions for China's reinstatement should help perfect the Chinese market economy, promote China's social stabilities and economic steady growth, thus making China's markets more open to the world and beneficial to a large number of the GATT member nations. The four-day meeting is discussing the protocol articles on China's reentry. On Tuesday [28 June] Long Yongtu, secretary general of the Chinese delegation and assistant to Chinese foreign trade and economic cooperation minister, complained that the articles are burdensome for China's current economic capabilities and therefore unacceptable. He pointed out that although China attaches importance to the resumption of its founding membership in the world trade body, it has other important things to do. Long expressed his hope that all the parties involved in the talks act fairly and realistically in the discussions on the protocol articles. During the meeting the Chinese delegation will also hold separate consultations with the United States, the European Union and Japan.
