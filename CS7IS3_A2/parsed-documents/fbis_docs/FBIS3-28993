Japanese officials said Hata left Blair House shortly before 1 A.M. for his third encounter with Kantor since Thursday morning. "There is always room for mutual concessions," Hata told reporters as he showed up at Kantor's office for the meeting. The sticking point centers on a dispute over how to set "objective criteria" to measure imports into Japan. Japanese officials say the United States insists on interpreting "objective criteria" as numerical yardsticks. "Without objective criteria, we can't have a good agreement," U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as telling Hata in a meeting Thursday evening. Senior administration officials have warned that President Clinton has made it clear he would rather have no agreement than "a bad agreement" by papering over differences. Officials from Japan and the United States have only until 11:30 A.M. to close an agreement. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to meet with Clinton at that hour.
