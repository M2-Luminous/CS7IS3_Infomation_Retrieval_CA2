The prime minister explained the Greek position. President Bill Clinton is greatly interested in a solution; Nimetz will divide his time between Skopje and Athens at this time. I believe I cannot say anything more because it would only be predictions. The climate is positive. There is U.S. interest and the personal interest of President Clinton. I hope in the next few weeks we will have some positive results. [Correspondent] Did Skopje make any conciliatory moves? [Papoulias] I do not know if Skopje gave any indications of being conciliatory. Certainly, though, there are people in Skopje who believe that a solution is necessary. [Correspondent] Did Nimetz bring any new proposals? [Papoulias] Nimetz did not bring any new ideas. He listened to the views of the Greek Government. We exchanged views on how we can overcome some obstacles. I believe the next few days will be more productive and effective because Nimetz intends to visit Skopje very soon and then return to Athens. [Correspondent] When will he return? [Papoulias] I do not know about this, but I have told you that Nimetz will visit Skopje and Athens in the next few days. [Correspondent] Did Mr. Nimetz ask that the measures be unilaterally lifted? [Papoulias] No, Nimetz certainly discussed the sanctions but both the prime minister and I explained to him the reasons why Greece adopted these measures. [Correspondent] Does the United States view the measures as political or economic? [Papoulias] Look, there has been no evaluation on how they view the measures. The measures are certainly included in the negotiations package. [Correspondent] Did he ask for a unilateral lifting of the measures? [Papoulias] No. [Correspondent] Did Mr. Nimetz set the prime minister's visit as a deadline for progress? [Papoulias] He considers that the prime minister's visit is a framework within which some progress should be made. [Correspondent] Are there any ideas on lifting the measures temporarily? [Papoulias] No, I have told you that.
