These leaders continue to tamper with the future of coming generations, who will never forgive them for the innocent blood they shed and the installations and utilities they destroyed, which belong to all the Yemeni people. In an editorial today, AL-AKHBAR states that Egypt and its leader Husni Mubarak advised Yemeni leaders to use dialogue to settle the Yemeni crisis and has repeatedly warned against resorting to arms, particularly between brothers. It points out that the fate of a homeland and people must not be decided by officials who are controlled by arrogance and personal whims. It says that a leader who is not concerned about the interests of his homeland and people is unworthy of his post and he had better look for another job in the interest of his people.
