"It is different to negotiate from a hostile perspective than to do so from a perspective of two countries that want to work together," he added in brief statements from Casa Rosada after the meeting between President Carlos Menem and U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Granillo Ocampo said that the Menem administration "is very interested in the approval" of this law on pharmaceutical patent rights, which is currently being discussed in Congress. "We believe patent rights must be recognized. We are also discussing the way in which national interests must also be taken into consideration," the diplomat said. Making a balance of his work, he pointed out the strengthening of the national image and a greater understanding between Argentina and the United States. "Several problems that were harming our relations have been solved, we have obtained important visits, and all this is positive for the five months I've been in my post," Granillo Ocampo said.
