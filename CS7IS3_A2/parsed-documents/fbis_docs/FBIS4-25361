[passage omitted] Before they left Kai Tak [Hong Kong's airport] yesterday, they complained that Chinese authorities had delayed telling them about the tragedy, in which 10 other foreigners were killed. They said they would be demanding "due compensation" for the whole incident. Northwest offered each family US$5,000 (about HK$38,600) to cover the cost of their trip to Xian. Relatives were holding meetings in their hotels early this morning to decide what demands they would make for visiting the site and claiming the bodies. "They haven't told us anything yet, I just have to wait," said a Chinese woman from Beijing, whose business colleague was killed when the Tupolev 154 crashed soon after take-off from Xian on a regular flight to Guangzhou. [passage omitted] A spokesman for the Government of Shaanxi province said the two explosions had been caused by the "breakup of the flight deck" but denied there had been a fire. An airline spokesman said the pilot had not made a mistake. He said that just before the disaster, the pilot, in his mid-40s and with 20 years of flying experience, had shouted that he was losing control. "The plane was shaking as if from violent turbulence -- listing at an angle of first 20, then 30, then 40 degrees. Radar equipment had broken down," the spokesman said. "The pilot could not hear the control tower, though the control tower could hear him. He said he would take the plane in for landing. Then the control tower lost communications." At the crash scene in the village of Mingdu, 30 km southeast of Xian, three parts of a plane were clearly visible from outside the barrier set up by security officials. The nose of the plane could be seen lying flat in the gold-coloured wheat fields that surround the small village. About one km away, the plane's large white tail was stuck into the ground like the end of a dart. [passage omitted] A China Northwest spokesman said the airline was debating whether to ground the remainder of its TU-154s for safety checks. The airline operates more TU-154s than it does any other plane. A Russian aviation source quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency said China had taken delivery of the jet in December 1986 and that it had been given a scheduled repair in 1992.
