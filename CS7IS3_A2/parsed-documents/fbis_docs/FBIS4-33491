He denied a possible coup d'etat as a result of an alleged reduction of troops. Lechin said the U.S. Government fears rapprochement between the Armed Forces and peoples' organizations. He praised the role of the military since the country returned to democracy. Shriqui told PRESENCIA: "We are very pleased with his comments, and he is quite right. Mr. Lechin deserves our respect as a combatant who has always struggled for the workers' needs. If at times we may have been adversaries, as he stated, it was only for constitutional reasons." Lechin also warned that the Latin American military would stage a coup if the U.S. continues to demand a reduction of the Armed Forces and that the Bolivian military would adopt a similar attitude. Shriqui said: "That is what Lechin says, maybe we should ask him why he says that." The journalist insisted: "What do the Armed Forces think?" The military chief answered: "We abide by the Constitution and are determined to defend it. We remain aware of the situation within the country." Lechin admitted that in the past he criticized the Armed Forces due to its involvement in politics. The old union leader said: "I have dreamed of a productive Army, whose ideal was to have soldiers carrying rifles but dressed in overalls." He added that the people will never allow the elimination of the Armed Forces.
