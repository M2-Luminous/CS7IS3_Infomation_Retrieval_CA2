Of the 12 new ICs, seven had been designated as Eighth FYP Key State S&T Projects and five were developed based on domestic market demand. The seven Key State Project ICs are: the BI/AT�89C51 high-performance 8-bit monolithic microcontroller, the BIJ1101CP inductosyn interface circuit, the BID0101CP/BID0102CP tuning-frequency digital display ASIC, the BIJ9121 phonetics teaching-machine ASIC, the BIC0001GP programmable counter and statistical controller ASIC, the BISS0001 infrared-sensor signal processor ASIC, and the BIJ81C55 I/O port expander for an 81C55 RAM. Among these ICs, the BI/AT�89C51 is the world's first 8-bit monolithic computer with an all-FLASH 4K memory; this chip has numerous applications in control systems, intelligent instruments and meters, and special electrical equipment, and is fully compatible with the domestically popular MCS-51 product series. The five new IC products developed out of domestic demand are: the BIJ7211AM 4-bit 7-segment LCD driver, the BID9148CP audible [signal] remote-controlled sender, the BID9149CP/BID9150CP audible remote-controlled receivers, and the LSP-9205 laser locator ASIC.
