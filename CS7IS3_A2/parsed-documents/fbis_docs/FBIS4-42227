Officially, Hermann Rappe, the head of the Chemical Workers Union, will still be collecting proposals until Whitsun and then present Heinz-Werner Meyer's successor to the public. And the official vote for the new chairman of the German Trade Union Federatiom [DGB] will not take place until 14 June in Berlin. The fact, however, is that no one today doubts that Dieter Schulte will be elected DGB chairman--not even Bruno Koebele, who heads the Construction Workers Union, the fourth largest union in terms of membership. Though he grumbled about the "scarcely democratic" nominating process, Koebele hastily added that Schulte is an honorable man and that his union, too, would support his candidacy. Objections were also raised today by Detlef Hensche, the chairman of the Media Employees Union, who some days ago had touted Franz-Josef Moellenberg, the head of the Food and Restaurant Workers Union, calling him a "left-wing pragmatist." The media employees delegate votes, however, do not carry much weight, and Hensche himself is something of a DGB outsider. Many of the small and mid-sized unions are grumbling now because it has been customary to yield the chairmanship of the DGB to one of their own to ride herd on the high and mighty. Heinz-Werner Meyer came from the Miners Union; Ernst Breit, his predecessor, came from the postal workers. To be sure, the metal workers who had not elected a chairman since Hans Boeckler, the legendary labor leader of the postwar era, had let it be known four years ago that it was their turn again. Schulte, who is not too well known even inside union circles, is holding back for the time being. He will not be making any statements regarding himself or his program until after the Whitsun holidays. Metal workers leader Zwickel protested all the more loudly today as he tried to dispel any suspicion that the metal workers' proposal was based on an arrogance of power. Critics who voiced this suspicion had added that the metal workers were trying to turn their defensive bargaining tactics or their defeat in wage negotiations into an organizational victory which did not cost much. Zwickel turned this argument around by saying that the metal workers' strong commitment to the DGB was proof of the fact that his union was willing to do its duty. Schulte's election, he said, would turn the DGB into an "effective and universally respected employee organization" once again, adding in a poetic vein that "a strong tree must have strong roots if it is to grow." Schulte is not only familiar with Duesseldorf and the Ruhr area; he also represents employee interests on the EU [European Union] Coal and Steel Commission. Where a market such as the steel market is concerned whose quotas are allocated and regulated by Brussels, the Belgian capital is by no means of secondary importance. As a member of the administrative committee of the Trust Agency, Schulte is also familiar with eastern Germany. That is where Rappe got to know Schulte. The two hold each other in esteem as pragmatists. Thus it is quite likely that not only the metal workers but Rappe himself voiced strong support for Schulte. There are those who object to Schulte's selection, saying that he does not represent a growth industry. But his supporters counter this argument by noting that the ecology movement and the Eisenhuettenstadt experience to the contrary, notwithstanding Germany, will continue to be a major steel producer which will be forced to modernize in the face of international competition. In view of the fact that the metal workers have now come out in Schulte's favor, that the chemical workers support him, and that the public service employees have somewhat grudgingly refrained from raising any objections, the majorities at the DGB congress are assured, since the 600 delegates include 179 members of the Metal Workers Union, 110 of the public service employees, and 46 of the chemical workers. That already represents a majority--which is the very thing construction workers chief Koebele feels is undemocratic. He has been arguing for a long time that the 16 member unions of the DGB should have the same number of votes regardless of their numerical strength. But he stands alone in making this proposal; his critics contend that this would amount to a return to the old guild system and, what is more, that his union would then be constrained to pay as much money into the DGB treasury as the metal workers. Rappe informed the other candidates today that they no longer stand a chance. The only serious contenders who announced their candidacy were chariman Arens of the textile workers and Frau Engelen-Kefer, the deputy chairperson of the DGB. Engelen-Kefer was said to have taken the news "calmly." She probably overestimated her chances. Some days ago metal workers chief Zwickel already commented on them less than enthusiastically by saying "ah well."
