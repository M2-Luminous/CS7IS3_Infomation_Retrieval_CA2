Good evening, and Happy Easter. [Prlic] Thank you, the same to you and to all Croatian TV viewers. [Correspondent] A slightly provocative question to start with: Does the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and its government still exist after the adoption of the Constitution? [Prlic] Yes. In accordance with the adopted Constitution of the federation, all transitional legal arrangements are valid in this period until the elections are held or, in other words, until the Constitution agreement has been fully implemented. [Correspondent] How do you view some statements--for example, the one by Ivo Komsic, that Herceg-Bosna is some kind of a para- state--something that is comparable to the so-called Krajina in Croatia? Can some individuals, such as Komsic from Sarajevo, jeopardize the agreement? [Prlic] We adhere to our own policy, and we know what we are doing. Such statements cannot dispute the rights of the Croat people, which are most fully protected by the very creation and existence of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. [Correspondent] Would you say that those rights have been respected over the last month? [Prlic] Yes, although there have been some attempts--which was clear in Sarajevo--to say that Herceg-Bosna does not exist, that its existence is the key cause of the conflict between the Muslims and Croats. We, of course, have always denied this. The conflict began with Muslim aggression, and that is completely clear to everyone. Another very important thing is an attempt to impose a feeling of collective guilt upon the Croats for everything that happened during the last year, which we have also rejected and have proved just the opposite. [Correspondent] Croatian Defense Council [HVO] soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina told me when I was in Herzegovina that they would never have the fleur-de-lys [Bosnian symbol] sown on their uniforms. Can you comment on that? Also, how long can the transition to the federation last, and what will it be like? [Prlic] The fleur-de-lys will not be worn because the Constitution envisages that all symbols of the Bosniak-Muslim and Croat federation--the flag, the coat of arms--will be chosen jointly. The fleur-de-lys is not a state symbol. It remains the symbol of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina only in the transitional period. For as long as the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina exists--with the old assembly, presidency, and government--the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna will also exist. [Correspondent] Do you personally believe in a quick transition, or will it take time? [Prlic] The transition will last for five or six months. The starting point was the adoption of the Constitution. Local elections will be held within five months and federal elections within six months at the most. We expect that the Constitution agreement will be fully implemented within that period. [Correspondent] There are 32,500 Croats in Sarajevo, according to the church register. Many more of our people live elsewhere in Bosnia. Are they a forgotten part of the Croat people, deprived of their rights? [Prlic] No. Who was looking after all the Croats who live outside of the territories controlled by the HVO? There are a lot of examples; one is the care provided for the Croats in Banja Luka, in the Krajina area [sentence as heard]. We also reacted sharply to the events in Prijedor. (?We also took care of) the Croats in Tuzla, Brcko, Zenica, Sarajevo etc. We allow other positions and views, but we will not go beyond a minimum: to secure for all Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina the same rights as those of the other constituent nation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. [Correspondent] Where is the Sarajevo HVO? We have reports that the Croat National Council and the Bosnian presidency have been presenting themselves as representatives to Western guests? Where is the Sarajevo HVO ? [Prlic] We installed an HVO headquarters in Sarajevo last week, and its activities will be in accordance with the Roso-Delic peace agreement, providing for deployment of our troops, our security service, and our officers. [Correspondent] Some say that Croats have limited themselves to western Herzegovina, that they have forgotten about Sarajevo, Tuzla, and so on. You have just denied this. [Prlic] We have not forgotten, simply because the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is made up of Croats from all parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is why I think that such statements are deceitful. [Correspondent] Some on the Bosniak side are still against the agreement, and this makes things very difficult. Is there any dissent on the Croat side, and how would you define it? [Prlic] Well, resistance to the agreement could be caused by the understanding of some that we have not achieved as much as we could have. This agreement is a historical necessity, and that is how it should be understood. My impression is that a huge majority of Croats and even more Bosniak Muslims support the agreement. Some of those against the agreement are extremist forces in both nations. Some have lost family members or friends during the war and cannot accept any kind of agreement with the side that we fought against over the last year because of the psychological state they are in. However, I believe that we have good foundations for the implementation of the agreement. I even believe that the agreement is being implemented in the field much faster than was expected in the beginning. [Correspondent] When I ask you about the future, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to know more about business possibilities. What can the people from prosperous Herzegovina offer to Croats in Bosnia, since they have been separated thus far? What can they get? [Prlic] We have already worked out some 30 reconstruction projects, particularly in connection with infrastructure, education, and health. The rest of the program is being prepared, and I believe that we have to develop an appropriate system throughout the territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation in the initial phase. Until now--maybe it is immodest for me to say this--the only state that exists and that functions on the territory of Bosnia- Herzegovina is the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. I am aware how the state system functions in the territory controlled by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and now I have seen--and I knew previously from information we had--that such a system does not exist in factual terms on territory controlled by the Muslim army. I expect that the deputy prime minister of the Sarajevo government will come to Mostar this week together with several other ministers. On this occasion, talks will be held on all operational matters in connection with the development of the economic and financial system, on the enabling of the free movement of goods and capital, and--conditionally--on the expected arrival of foreign capital--above all, for the reconstruction of the infrastructure. [Correspondent] One of my friends is a businessman. When will he be able to go to Sarajevo, according to you, and open a factory there? Is there such a possibility, and do you see this happening soon? [Prlic] I do. It was, in fact, I who initiated these talks and the possibility of opening up Sarajevo, and I believe that in the coming month we will be able to have more serious talks on this. We reached agreement in Sarajevo with the military commanders-- who are already installing their headquarters in Sarajevo--to rent two or three large buildings in Sarajevo where we will open a Croatian bank and Croatian insurance company and make it possible for Croatian factories to establish themselves to a large extent and to set up the center of their business operations in Sarajevo. I believe we will achieve this in the coming month or two, and this will make possible the greater presence of Croats in the capital of the federation. [Correspondent] Do you believe personally in the Croats in Sarajevo and in Tuzla? How do you see the possibility of their becoming involved and beginning to live? [Prlic] I believe it is possible. I believe that this constitutional agreement and the quality-based selection of personnel for the authorities of the federation will ensure for them equality and the possibility of full national, economic, and personal prosperity. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, at the end of this conversation, have you got anything you would like to say to people in Herceg-Bosna and to people in Bosnia? [Prlic] I would like to send them word that they are secure, that Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina takes account of all Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as those who are in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who are refugees as a result of the war in these areas. We want to realize our rights, but not to the detriment of the other nation with whom we have joined to form the federation, and also not to the detriment of the third nation that we expect to accept this agreement in the period ahead. I would like to send word to them to be patient and to attempt, in the elections that will be held, to elect those people who can competently represent them and build a state that will be much better than the one in which we lived before the war. [Correspondent] Dr. Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, thank you for being our guest. [Prlic] Thank you.
