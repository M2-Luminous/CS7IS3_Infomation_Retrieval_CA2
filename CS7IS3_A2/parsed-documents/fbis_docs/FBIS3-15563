We are presenting a recording of the interview again. The interviewer is Nato Oniani, a journalist. [Oniani] Batono [Georgian polite address] Eduard, a decision on Georgia joining the CIS caused rather a strong reaction among our deputies. A view was expressed that Georgia did not have to look at Russia as a protector and savior, that this was a loss of the sovereignty achieved in years, that Russia still continued to try to accomplish its own aims, that is, the restoration of the Russian Empire and that help had to be sought elsewhere, because it will be impossible to speak about friendship with a country that itself prompts the issues to talk about. [Shevardnadze] Thank you. I would like the TV viewers to pardon me for repeating some parts from my speech at the parliament sitting, because I have had to return to the debates three times today. I regard this as a landmark in Georgian history. Those who are more or less familiar with our past and watch current affairs closely, will agree with me that all these centuries have been searching times. Friends, allies, and even protectors have been looked for. This is the fate of a small country and especially a country occupying a geopolitical situation like ours. The search is still going on and my personal decision that Georgia has had to unite -- joining the CIS is a continuation of this course, of this road, and of this history. I am sure that future generations will analyze all this and will realize that this has been a necessary step to be taken, a word to be uttered. What response should be given to those who say that this will not solve any problem, or that we have to look for a way for survival elsewhere, or this is a loss of sovereignty? I have already given a comprehensive answer to that but I will reiterate in general terms. First of all, this is an opportunity to settle fundamental problems -- how efficiently this opportunity will be used depends on us as well as on our CIS partners. In the first instance I mean the economy. The economy will never revive, we will not reach our desired goals quickly without the CIS. The documents we have already signed and still have to sign create beneficial conditions for speeding up economic integration or rather for the restoration of what had already existed, what we should not have lost and what we should not have destroyed. But we destroyed it with our own hands and that is why our economy is frozen and on a very low level. Apart from the economy, there are principles and guarantees for collective security, which will come to effect if not today, then tomorrow. This is very essential. In my opinion, it is not serious to speak of the loss of sovereignty just because a part of the sovereignty is delegated to the Commonwealth. Georgia is not the only country in this situation. There are 12 countries in the European Union and they delegate even more rights to the union. Take the ASEAN, a brilliant union in the Pacific and Asia, which created a basis for the revival and prosperity of the once poor countries. A lot of rights are delegated there also. I can also bring examples of other regional unions. There may be discussions, but you have to reckon with common ground rather than only your personal view, while aspiring to believe not to share grounds, and just stick stubbornly to what you consider the absolute truth. I would like to add that when a politician, and a serious politician at that, takes a decision, he is obliged to take into consideration current interests and we have to take into consideration interests of saving the country. Today, we are facing the issue of the country's existence or non- existence and therefore you have to take a decision that provides the chance of survival. At the same time, a politician has to think of what will be essential tomorrow, what effects this present decision will have in five years' time, in 10 years' time, in 20 years' time. I would say that if the Commonwealth develops in the way all other regional and continental unions of the world have developed, I think our step can be justified from the future's point of view. If it does not develop in this way and it disintegrates, Georgia eventually will not lose anything. This is the case when we can gain a lot if the Commonwealth proves to be a real force and we can lose a lot and even everything if we do not join. I would like to tell those who prompt us that Russia and the CIS are not a salvation and we have to look for other ways: Did we not look for other ways? Now, finally, my visit to the United States. Before that, there were my contacts with western, southern, eastern, northern countries. All ways have been tried. Some make our situation easier, some actively help us, but a principal way of survival and salvation has not yet been found. That is why, being guided by the existing situation, I have considered it essential to take a decision like this. I do not think I have made a mistake. There are talks that Russia cannot be the survival [for Georgia]. Some say another way. We apparently had to sign an agreement with Russia but did not have to join the CIS. I do not think there is any logic in this. First of all, it is absurd to ignore Russia, whatever forces come to power there. I believe that whoever argues over the issue on whether it is necessary to have relations with Russia, he is very far from reality and very far from politics. If we agree that Russia is essential [for us], we would rather have relations with the Russia that is in the Commonwealth. For instance, do we prefer to be left face-to-face with a huge state like Russia or is it better to have a variant when we are in the CIS, and Russia is in the CIS, too? This means that bilateral relations are arranged and guaranteed and, at the same time, there are certain guarantees of security, collective security. I think this is also a more or less good reason. That is why I could not agree with arguments in parliament. Although, I have to say that there were sound ideas in certain speeches and I welcome them. [transmission then lost]
