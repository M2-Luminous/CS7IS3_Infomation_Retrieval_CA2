Until recently, it was a subject of contention by the two major parties, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] and New Democracy [ND], since its conquest led to parliamentary majority. Suddenly we now hear people talking about its future, and some people even go so far as to discuss its revival as a political party. This "revelation" resulted from the explosive reaction of [former Foreign Minister] Mikhalis Papaconstandinou, who attacked both the PASOK government and the ND leadership for their "achievements in Brussels, where they presumably were to fight for `Macedonia.'" Papaconstandinou's statements and his almost complete indifference to the "penalties" imposed on him may have surprised the ND leadership. But some of his friends (with whom he usually has lunch at the well-known restaurant at Kolonaki Plaza) had a different view. They said "Mikhalis does not move haphazardly or for personal reasons. He has a plan." The "plan" they speak of is no other than the formation of a "centrist group" within ND which at a later stage (when Andreas Papandreou takes over the presidency of the republic) will "coordinate" itself with a corresponding group in PASOK to revive the "center" in a party form. The more uncertain among Papaconstandinou's lunch companions objected that those who see such a plan forget that the "quarrel" between [now ND chairman] Evert and Papaconstandinou has started since 1964 when Papaconstandinou, then deputy minister of defense, punished today's leader of New Democracy (who was then serving his military stint in the Navy) "for being involved in political activities"! They said that their views about the "Center" were a scenario of political fiction. But in such cases who can be sure that his assessments are correct? In any event, the talk about the "Center" has many ramifications since the political personalities who are supposedly involved approach this question from different viewpoints. All of them, however, share the same theoretical scheme. In its more complete and refined form it originates in the description of the European political stage where the traditional parties have suffered damage beyond repair. It then moves to Greece to present the forecast that the departure of A. Papandreou will lead PASOK to such "developments" that will change into "transitional" the present period in Greece. Out of all this, their conclusion is easy: In the future the dominant parties will be those with more flexible political views without rigid ideological positions. This analysis, or some parts of it, may be incorporated in the political thinking of such disparate political figures as A. Kaklamanis or A. Andianopoulos, I. Alevras or (Ms.) Dora Bakoyianni and others who certainly do not espouse the same ideological dogmas nor do they have similar partisan prospects. Some speak of 30 parliamentary deputies from PASOK who look forward to a centrist [partisan] expression and of a similar number of ND deputies. Others limit the number of those who are really interested in such a development to only two dozen from both major political parties. But beyond those numbers and reasoning, the surrounding atmosphere is so strong as to lead even members of Evert's inner circle to describe those thoughts as "a preparation of the New Democracy for the next period of political developments." G. Souflias finds that PASOK is abandoning its socialist identity while the New Democracy abandons at the same time its more extreme aspects of its policies, so that there is a certain convergence of the two major parties toward the center and that the area of contest between them will not be on ideological "principles" but on their ability to manage and deal with the problems more effectively. In this context one may understand better the inability of ND Deputy Th. Kasimis who could not find sufficiently strong arguments to respond to one of his colleagues who posed the question: "Is it possible that the two major parties have exhausted their historical dynamic?" The person who posed the question is not among those who are known for their studying and analyzing issues; apparently he reflected -- rather unwittingly -- a reasoning already found in international political thought. This current of thought claims that the parties which today exist in the European countries are the product of the bipolarity which prevailed after the war, but do not correspond to the conditions which emerged after the fall of "communism" and the restructuring of all traditional dogmas. The discussions about the "center" to the extent they turn into real political action will find, maybe unexpectedly, a rival in the Political Spring party. Its leader, A. Samaras, of course prefers to speak of a "middle" not of a "center" area. But the section of society that may be defined by the one or the other term is the same and includes the vast majority of those who are not moved by the "dogmatic ideologies" of the two extremes. The notions of "political modernization," and "national awakening and restructuring" used by Samaras and addressed as they are to the "citizens" as a whole and not to a particular social group, constitute his "passport" to the "middle of the road." At the same time, his choice is the necessary "vehicle" in his effort to develop a "new majority current" which will be based on the common, general interests of society. He sees the Political Spring as the force which will be able to serve most effectively those interests. With this strategy he aims at taking away forces from both parties and also to push New Democracy to the right to leave him greater opportunities for exerting influence. At the same time, Samaras rejects for himself the characterization of "politically centrist." In his view, this term is connected with the "Center" of the 1960's, which -- he claims -- gave to the Greek political history the worst there is because it not only failed to undertake the "renewal effort" as it had promised but instead it became the standard-bearer of "horse trading." Samaras takes seriously the "revolution of conscience" he advocates and rejects the tradition of the "center" which wanted "the policy to be a succession of a series of compromises." Besides, he says, "a policy which does not produce specific results is something like a ship without destination"... The renewed competition for the "centrist" or the "middle of the road" area includes three different currents. One originates with those who want to continue the traditions of the old center, the second moves around a reasoning of modernization and the strategic exploration of confluence between the two major parties, and the third is expressed already by the Political Spring. Developments move today at a slow pace but progressively they acquire a more specific and clear content, something which will provide the conditions for a "take-off" as soon as the forces in the major political parties become free to move.
