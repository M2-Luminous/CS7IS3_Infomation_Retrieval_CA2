In an interview with the Berlin daily B.Z. [BERLINER ZEITUNG] (Tuesday edition), the expert on Turkey said: "I would not rule out that, if the overall situation escalates, we will also have to fear an escalation of terrorism in our country, even up to hostage-taking." To the extent to which the military situation in southeastern Turkey becomes more dramatic and the Germans continue to supply weapons, one is increasingly facing the Kurds' dissatisfaction, the scientist said. This is expressed more and more in militant actions. "Therefore, we must also expect retaliatory attacks against German institutions," Steinbach said. Actually, highway blockades are already a step toward this end.
