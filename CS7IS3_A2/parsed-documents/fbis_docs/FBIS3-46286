Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Officials from Taiwan and Thailand Thursday [27 January] opened a series of meetings on an investment guarantee agreement between the two countries. Ch'en Yung-hsiang, deputy director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center, is representing Taiwan at the negotiations. He said the talks would continue into Friday. The Thai delegation is led by Chaiyong Satjipanon [as received], deputy director of the Economic Affairs Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The 10-member Thai group includes Nopporn Ratchawej, deputy director of the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei, Lek Boonsriroj [as received], chief of the Commercial Division of the Thai Office, and officials from the Ministries of Agriculture, Industry, Finance, and Transportation. Chaiyong expressed hope that the ongoing talks can reach a final agreement. Taiwan and Thailand exchanged a draft proposal on the investment guarantee pact last February. Signing of the agreement will certainly boost Taiwan investment in Thailand, he noted. Among the six member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, only Thailand and Brunei have not signed the investment guarantee pact with Taiwan. The other four members are Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Statistics show that Taiwan is the third largest foreign investor in Thailand with 1,098 investment projects, totaling US$4.5 billion, as of the end of 1993.
