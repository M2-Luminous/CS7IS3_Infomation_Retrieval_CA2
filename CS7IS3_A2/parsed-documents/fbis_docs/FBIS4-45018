The latest trade data released by the Ministry of Commerce shows that against a target of $22.138 million set for the whole year 1993-94, the country recorded exports of $22,173.06 million, marginally exceeding the overall export target for the year. Exports during the full year 1992-93 were worth $18,420.49 million. However, there was a significant increase in the imports too which grew by 6.84 percent in dollar terms during 1993-94. Official estimates show that imports would be worth $23,212.13 million as against $21,725.54 million during 1992-93. This also further increases the trade gap to $1,039.07 million which had been successfully brought down to the level of $600-$650 million even earlier this year. Nevertheless, the trade gap is still substantially less than the 1992-93 figure of $3,305.05 million. According to the provisional estimates released by the Directorate-General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, in rupee terms, exports during 1993-94 were estimated at Rs 69,546.91 crores, 30.36 percent up from the 1992-93 level of Rs 53,350.54 crores. Against this, imports were of Rs 72,806.01 crores during the year against Rs 62,922.80 crores in 1992-93, showing an increase of 15.71 percent. In rupee terms, the trade deficit declined from Rs 9,572.26 crores in 1992-93 to Rs 3,259.10 crores during 1993-94. The upsurge in imports this year has been mainly due to the extensive concessions given to the industry on import duty in various sectors. Imports registered a more than 50 percent increase during March 1994 taking the overall import figure higher up thereby increasing the trade gap to the present level of almost $1.4 billion.
