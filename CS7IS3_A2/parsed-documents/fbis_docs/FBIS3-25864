It is reported that according to new aid agreements it signed last year with 61 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the South Pacific, China will implement 272 economic and technical aid projects in 72 [as received] recipient nations, of which 77 are turnkey projects, 113 are technical cooperation projects and cooperation projects of other types, and 82 are preconstruction projects. All of these projects have been proceeding satisfactorily. To meet the economic restructuring and development plans of recipient nations, China will open wholly foreign-owned and jointly owned enterprises as well as leasing firms in foreign countries through economic and technical assistance channels. Forty-five such projects were explored and discussed with 24 recipient nations last year, resulting in the signing of 12 agreements between enterprises on both sides. China also offered over 50 aid programs for general goods and materials to 41 countries to help them solve production problems, meet certain needs for their people's livelihood, and overcome difficulties caused by natural disasters. In cooperation with UN development agencies, China actively participated in technical cooperation projects among developing countries in 1993, offering a host of wide-ranging aid programs. Among them were 23 China-sponsored short-term practical technical training courses in food, aquaculture, agricultural machinery, and small hydropower, in which more than 230 technicians from 46 developing countries were trained. It has been learned that, in the future, while continuing its efforts to extend economic and technical assistance to foreign countries, China will undergo reforms in foreign aid work, primarily the following: focus on projects that help recipient nations develop small and medium-sized production units with local demands and resources and that train personnel; in promoting direct cooperation between PRC enterprises and those of recipient nations, help them develop their national economies while integrating bilateral and multilateral economic and trade ties and promoting better cooperation between governments; and further perfect foreign-aid administration that emphasizes standardized and scientific management.
