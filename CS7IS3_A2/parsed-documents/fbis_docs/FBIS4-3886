Mustafizur Rahman is "very successful" and several major achievements were made during his China tour from April 13-17. Foreign Secretary Mufleh R. Osmany made the statement at a regular bi-weekly news briefing to journalists from local and overseas media. According to the spokesman, Chinese Premier Li Peng has accepted an invitation from Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to visit this South Asian country in the second half of this year. The Chinese side has agreed to buy more Bangladeshi goods in order to reduce trade imbalance and to continue to extend economic cooperation, he said. China has also agreed to finance the construction of the Rupsa Bridge in Khulna in southwest Bangladesh, which is likely to cost more than 100 million U.S. dollars, he noted. During the foreign minister's stay in Beijing, China reiterated its stance that the water-sharing dispute between Bangladesh and India should be settled through bilateral negotiation, the spokesman said. He added that Bangladesh has also been firm to settle the dispute through bilateral talks. At the news conference, the spokesman strongly condemned Bosnian Serbs' killings and bloodshed activities in Gorazde and he called on the Organization of Islamic Conference to take immediate steps for deterring "the continued Serbian aggression". Referring to the slow pace of the repatriation of Myanmar [Burmese] refugees from Bangladesh, the spokesman said the government is now reviewing its process as well as the country's cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the issue. "They are Myanmar nationals, and sooner or later they have to go back," he stressed, insisting that Bangladesh has the privilege to solve the problem which has cost the country enormous resources and involved some 700 personnel specially assigned to deal with the matter.
