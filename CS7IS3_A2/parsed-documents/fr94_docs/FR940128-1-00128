The firm contacts the State Department of Health to confirm certification for unlisted processors. Frequency 1. For finding the certification number: each lot or batch. 2. For finding out if the processor is certified: each lot or batch. 3. For rejecting uncertified molluscan shellfish: each batch that does not meet the critical limit.
