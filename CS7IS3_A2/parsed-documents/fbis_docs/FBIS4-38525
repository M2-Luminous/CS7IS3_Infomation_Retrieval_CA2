It will involve both CIS peace makers and international observers. If all goes well, said Pastukhov in an exclusive interview to the Russian Information Agency, it will provide "experience projected into the future," because there are other regrettable conflicts and hot spots. Pastukhov granted the interview upon his return from the USA where he represented Russia's Foreign Ministry in consultations with the UN aimed to plan peace keeping operations. He believes that the sides have harmonised the format of such an operation, and agreed to provide a broader mandate to international observers and to involve more observers to ensure the operation's success. The composition of the force was not discussed, but Russian troops will naturally make the backbone, and the total strength will reach 2,500-3,000 troops. The deputy foreign minister thinks that the sides agree to begin the operation as soon as possible. The Russian delegation debated the question of setting up an international foundation to ensure peace in the zone of the conflict. Now that it is clear that the operation will be held within UN standards and with close interaction of CIS peace makers and international observers, "the very climate and the public opinion have become more beneficial for the operation," said Pastukhov. He said that the Russian mission has not been delegated by the sides to the conflict, but the discussions in the UN were held within the framework of the Georgian-Abkhazian accords on ceasefire and disengagement of the troops.
