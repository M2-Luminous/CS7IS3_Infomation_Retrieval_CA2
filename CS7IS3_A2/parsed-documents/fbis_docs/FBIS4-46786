Furmanyuk: "Who is Conducting the Orchestra"] [Text] One of the local newspapers, referring to the results of parliamentary elections in Donbass, headlined that if Ukraine wants to conduct an independent policy it will have to separate itself from the eastern region. To wit: it is not Donbass that should demand independence, it is Ukraine that could be free of its obligations to the industrial region which, if one is to believe the press, feeds and clothes itself, "it is at the same time both the orchestra and the audience." Such a super-radical view of the issue is gaining popularity among the increasingly lumpen population mass. An eloquent indication of that consist not only of the outcome of the oblast referendum on the entry of Ukraine (read: Donbass) as a full-fledged member into the CIS and a certain European Economic Community, on a federative land structure of an independent state and on the granting of the status of a second state language for the Russian language, but also of the tactic that was selected on the eve of new elections by leaders of the local national-democratic organizations. For example, the kray Rukh firmly decided to boycott elections to local organs of power since there are no chances even for episodic breaks in the communist party nomenklatura blockade. Therefore let the Reds bear responsibility for the state of affairs in the stagnant preserve. Igor Laponogov, a member of the presidium of the oblast organization of social democrats and a former candidate for people's deputies, was even more frank at one of the democratic meetings: "We have no serious grounds for objecting to the separation of Ukraine from Donbass if power there will belong entirely to the communists." Observers, however, are not in any hurry to assert that after elections to the local soviets from rural regions to the oblast center the East is now colored in red. Yes, Vadim Chuprun, chairman of the oblast soviet, in announcing his candidacy for the post of chairman of the oblast soviet, made a point of declaring restoration of membership in the Communist Party of Ukraine, but his more sober-minded colleagues, heading the power organs, so far have preferred not to hover up in the clouds, but to stand firmly on the ground and rely on tested means: executive structures, trade unions, state enterprises, and local business. It is likely that they will be the ones able to realistically count on victory, the more so since the so-called "new" communists, whose ranks are swelling with pensioners languishing for old prices, readily vote in the electoral districts not for a bright tomorrow, but for the trash heap that was removed and for several kilograms of charity food today. That is why considerably greater interest is aroused not by the reincarnated communist V. Chuprun, but by the outcome of the duel between two other contenders for the governor's seat, two people's deputies of Ukraine who are well-known businessmen in the region, two individuals with the same name--Vladimir and Yevgeniy Shcherbanya. It is unlikely that their programs will differ any more than their names. The issue is something else: who has the money and connections that will prove to be strongest.
