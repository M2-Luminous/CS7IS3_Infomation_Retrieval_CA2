The resumption of activity was more marked in the informal sector where traders selling second hand clothes, drinks, and luxury clothing from Europe, America and Asia were selling. In the last three days, prices of beans and rice, the country's staples, have dropped below the symbolic two hundred francs a kilo (1 U.S. dollar; 575 Burundian francs). Prices of these commodities had risen way above this figure after the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye in an attempted coup on 21 October 1993. Red meat is too expensive for low-wage earners. A slice of beef steak costs up to 1,000 francs. However, fish, beans, maize or casava (manioc) and rice are still affordable for low-wage earners. However, government officials said that few civil servants are back at work. Those who are spend much of their on the telephone enquiring about the safety of relatives and debating political situation of the country. As a result, the speaker of the National Assembly, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, gave a public warning to "idle people" when he visited other parts of the country Sunday [10 April]. "There will be no more wages for people who do not work," he said. The warning seems to have had its effect judging by the resumption of activity in various sectors of production since the beginning of the week. However, the education sector is still paralysed. Students and teachers can still be seen outside the Education Ministry. They are asking to be sent to schools in the interior of the country, where they say is safer. Private schools have never closed.
