Defense Minister David Collenette says a UN relief effort such as being used in Bosnia would have to be approved by the Canadian cabinet. He said a solution to the chaos in Rwanda may have to be part of a larger solution to war, famine, disease, and poverty in Africa. The UN has reduced the number of its peacekeepers in Rwanda from 2,500 to about 270. The head of the UN contingent, Canadian Major General Romeo Dallaire, says more peacekeepers would help the situation there. The UN is reported to be studying a plan to pay for African troops to intervene in the Rwandan civil war.
