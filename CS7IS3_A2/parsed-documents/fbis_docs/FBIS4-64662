The acceptance of Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Austria, which was approved by the European Parliament on Wednesday [4 May], creates additional opportunities for investments, for German companies also, Tyll Necker, president of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said on Saarland Radio on Thursday. "There will be a great number of improved opportunities for cooperation." German industry need not fear potential greater competition by the new members, Necker said. Rather, there is the opportunity for a better division of labor within Europe. Thus, the Nordic states are, for instance, strong regarding the production of cellulose. Traffic routes to Scandinavia could also be improved and expanded. The decisive thing is "that we will all become stronger in international competition through a larger market," Necker stressed.
