Moldavia's [Moldova's] Agrarian Democratic Party, which forms the government, considered it costly for the small state to have 20 ministries and 10 state departments with overly inflated staffs. The state apparatus is being cut by 40 percent. Two departments have been crossed off the list, including the department dealing with the functioning of the state language -- the only one of its kind in the CIS. For the People's Front opposition this means that it is totally excluded from state structures. Andrei Sangheli is still prime minister. He enjoys prestige among the population of the Left Bank and the south of the Republic, and is also well received in Russian Government offices. The 16 confirmed ministers include only one "interloper" -- Vasile Iovv [surname as transliterated], former trade representative in Russia, who made it on the Socialist Party lists. The other ministers are either members of the Agrarian Party or have sworn loyalty to it. Foreign Minister Mihai Popov, a graduate of the Diplomatic Academy, worked in the former USSR Embassy in Bucharest. He was recently ambassador to Belgium. The nationalist newspaper TSARA [name as transliterated] saw the appointment of the new head of the foreign policy department as Moscow's doing and KGB intrigue, forecasting a switch from the Moldavian Foreign Ministry's former "European orientation" to a patently pro-Moscow orientation. It is being said in parliamentary lobbies that the new minister is Parliament Speaker Petru Lucinschi's minion; Lucinschi knows him from working with him for several years. The People's Front, considering the new membership of the government to be pro-Moscow, refused to take part in the ballot, but that had no effect on the result: The list of Cabinet members was passed, and with the current disposition of forces (20 opposition votes to 84) it is quite possible to predict the same outcome for parliamentary decisions in the future.
