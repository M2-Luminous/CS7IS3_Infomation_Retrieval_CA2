Early on 19 May, Congress approved Provisional Measure 482 creating the URV. The bill, which was introduced into the Chamber of Deputies by Deputy Neuto de Conto, was approved by a vote of 281 to 76, with 3 abstentions. In the Senate the provisional measure was approved in a symbolic vote. The provisional measure could be approved only after negotiations between the government and the rural bloc, which did not back the bill. Deputy Nelson Marquezelli, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, allowed bloc members to vote for the measure because, according to him, 80 percent of the bloc's demands were granted. Leftist parties attempted to obstruct the vote because they wanted the measure to provide for compensation of salary losses that occurred before implementation of the URV, a minimum salary of $100 by December 1994, and free collective bargaining. Brazilian Social Democracy Party lawmakers, however, have claimed that the provisional measure does grant the last request, provided salary increases are not transferred to prices. The measure creates an index for adjustment of prices and salaries in reals in case of inflation, sets 1 July for circulation of the new currency, and establishes a single index for adjustment of prices and for financing agricultural production.
