A research team, headed by senior geologist Huang Zhongxin, under the Changqing oil-prospecting administration of the basin came to the conclusion based on a systematic study of a large amount of hydrogeological materials and other related information amassed over the past four decades. According to them, the basin has a water-bearing area of 144,000 sq [square] km, with total reserves of 11,400 billion cu m [cubic meters], of which, 6,960 billion cu m are fresh water. This is equivalent to 267 times the volume of China's largest freshwater lake, Poyang Lake, in east China's Jiangxi Province. Most of the water-bearing strata lie 500 m to 600 m below the surface, but some of them, especially in Shaanxi Province, are no more than 100 m below the surface. The scientists believe that the development of such rich water resources will not affect oil and natural gas prospecting work in the basin. They add that the exploration of the water resources will play an important role in helping solve the problem of industrial and drinking water supply and underground flooding of oilfields in the area.
