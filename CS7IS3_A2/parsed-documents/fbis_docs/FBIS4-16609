He also ruled out the possibility of such a meeting in any foreseeable future. Papazian said the scheduled four-party meeting of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh whose Defence Minister Robert Kacharian was in Moscow during the CIS summit had been derailed because of Baku's rejection of the Moscow-proposed regional peace plan. The meeting would have been held had Baku accepted the plan providing for the deployment of CIS peacekeepers in the region something that Yerevan and Stepanakert agree to, he said. Papazian said Russia had alone agreed to send its troops to the region because the United Nations was unable to do so at the moment. However, he said Russia would prefer to join a peacekeeping operation sponsored by the CIS or Eastern Europe instead. "So will Azerbaijan, I am sure," he said. On Azeri leader Heydar Aliyev's accusation of Armenia of launching aggression on Azerbaijan, Papazyan stressed that although "Armenia is a party to the conflict, it is not a warring side." IF Note: President Aliyev called on other CIS leaders to pass a political assessment of Armenia's aggression on his country, demand an end to hostilities against Azerbaijan and an immediate Armenian pullout from occupied lands. In a statement at the CIS summit, he demanded that Yerevan provide firm guarantees for a non-resumption of hostilities calling for sanctions against Armenia for its aggression on a fellow CIS state. Aliyev accused Yerevan of derailing any constructive proposals for regional peace by setting knowingly unacceptable conditions. Armenia, which set up a military beachhead inside Azerbaijan, now seeks to swap annexed lands for the enclave's independence or in other words, to partition Azerbaijan, Aliyev said. For his part, Papazyan said that although Yerevan refrained from internationalizing the conflict, it would step immediately if Karabakh Armenians had to face the threat of deportation or genocide.
