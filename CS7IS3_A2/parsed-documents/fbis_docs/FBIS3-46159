A simple ceremony at the French embassy here recalled the January 27, 1964 decision of president Charles de Gaulle to exchange ambassadors with Mao Zedong's government, making France the first major Western power to establish full diplomatic relations with communist China. A French delegation consisting of various dignitaries including de Gaulle's son, Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, was on hand. The ceremony came ahead of an official visit here by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur expected within the next few months. The visit is planned to give impetus to the reconciliation between the two countries agreed to in a January 12 communique which ended a year-long freeze in the relationship. At the embassy, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei admitted to "vicissitudes" in Franco-Sino ties, a reference to Beijing's closing of the French consulate in Guangzhou after France's late 1992 sale of 60 jet fighters to Taiwan. The normalisation of ties -- making French firms eligible to compete again for major contracts in China's booming econmy -- required Paris to agree in the communique to make no further arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province of the mainland. With the communique, Tian said, France and China had decided to "open a new page and a new phase of development" in their relationship. Tian said he was "convinced that relations between the two countries were going to develop even more in all domains." The head of the French delegation, MP Alain Peyrefitte, said "the clouds that had accumulated in recent years have now dissipated. Peyrefitte, who was a Gaullist minister 30 years ago, agreed with Tian that the decision taken by de Gaulle and Mao had been "historic," and unveiled a plaque to commemorate it. Later Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's official spokesman echoed the hope that China and France would enjoy a closer relationship in future, while subtly putting Paris on notice that Beijing expects it to stick to its commitment to refrain from any future arms sales to cash-rich Taiwan. "We are convinced that so long as the two sides strictly abide by the principles for the establishment of diplomatic relations and other relevant principles enshrined in the joint communique, bilateral relations are very promising," spokesman Wu Jianmin told reporters. The French delegation, which also includes French officials with a special interest in China and a former French ambassador here, was scheduled to meet Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Thursday evening.
