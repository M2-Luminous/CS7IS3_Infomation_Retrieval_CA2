I did that on the occasion of your visit to the victims of the fiercest barbaric campaign in history against an entire nation under siege, in which thousands of people are suffering slow death from hunger, disease, and sadness. I reminded you that the "civilized" people of the West care about animals and birds and form organizations to protect them, despite the fact that those "civilized" people spend a lot of time thinking about new ways to annihilate other nations without showing any mercy or having any second thoughts. At the time, I did not expect Your Excellency to respond, comment, or react immediately, for many reasons. Primarily, the nature of your mission, which is to supervise the dismantling of Iraq's strategic weapons, in the name of the United Nations. This mission requires a person who has no heart and no feelings in order for him to pass by piles of bodies without showing any sign of sadness. Indeed, yours is a tough mission. And a very sensitive one. You know very well that the embargo is daily claiming lives of men, women, children, and elderly. It is also undermining family ties and destroying the foundations of natural life. The embargo is said to be justified against the backdrop of the "Kuwait problem." However, the human that lurks in the depth of the international envoy can never disregard the fact that this embargo has taken a course that has nothing to do with the Kuwait issue and entered into the labyrinths of international politics and its games, which can get very ugly. Yesterday, I was heartened to see that the human lurking deep within you could not be suppressed by your "international mission." This human shouted loud in protest and shed the robe of callousness and disregard for the inhuman effects of the embargo, when tears filled your eyes while you were listening to the mother of a martyred child that did not complete its first year and the wife of a martyred young man who had not yet turned 30. The woman was telling you about her tragedy and that of thousands of Iraqis who were killed by a hand wearing a velvet glove with the letters UN imprinted on it. A Belgian reporter commented on your tears by saying: "Impossible. Can Mr. Ekeus shed real tears? How can this cold-hearted person cry?" I felt that this reporter was unfair. I am very confident that your tears were true and that your sympathy toward the noble Iraqi woman, Zahra' Yahya, was also true. I am also absolutely confident that that moment was one of your most painful experiences. All of this is good and proves that the seeds of good and humanity are still alive, even in the hearts of those assigned inhuman missions. Allow me, Ambassador Ekeus, to pursue this civilized dialogue by asking a question which obsessed me for quite a while. Do Mr. Ekeus's tears signal that he will not separate his feelings and convictions as a human being from his mission as an international official? We have heard about, and seen, humans whose words and feelings are full of humanity but their deeds are alien to their feelings, as if they are done by other people. Yet, they smile confidently and say: Our feelings are one thing; our duty is another. This answer sums up the tragedy of the Western mind that separates job requirements and personal beliefs. Such a separation could be acceptable if there was no other choice. But how can we understand the obvious contradiction between a person's feelings and his job requirements, when this person can choose one of a thousand jobs in which he can reconcile his beliefs and job requirements? I am sure that Your Excellency, by virtue of your high qualifications, will not die of hunger if you speak up and say: Enough. The United Nations should decide tomorrow, and not after tomorrow, to lift the embargo to stop the tragedy of death and suffering in Iraq. Perhaps, Your Excellency might reply: The United States will not respond. This might indeed be the case. However, your testimony will deliver the coup de grace that will put an end to the U.S. reasoning and deprive the bloodsuckers in Washington of any covers in the face of the United Nations and an angry world public opinion that rejects the annihilation of nations. Are you going to settle the contradiction between your beliefs and duties, Mr. Ekeus? We in Iraq are resolved to end the blockade. We have done a great deal toward achieving this objective. But we want the good-intentioned, and you are one of them, to win their humanity before the blockade is lifted while they are still captive to a destructive contradiction between human feelings and job requirements.
