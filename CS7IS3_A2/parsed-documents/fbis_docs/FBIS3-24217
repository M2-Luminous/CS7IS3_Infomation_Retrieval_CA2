The positive balance reached $1.4 billion, as compared with $1 billion in January of last year. The volume of export comprised $2.5 billion, increasing by 1.3 percent as compared with January of 1993 (we must note that the average export prices on a number of goods in January of 1994 were significantly lower than the January 1993 level). The relative share of power sources within the structure of export declined by 7 percent, and comprised 50 percent. Export deliveries of crude oil declined by 16 percent, to 5 million tonnes. On the other hand, deliveries of petroleum products increased by 38 percent, to 1.676 million tonnes, and of natural by 14 percent, to 10.121 billion cubic meters. Import comprised $1.1 billion, declining by 23 percent as compared with January of last year. Import deliveries of basic staple food products continued to decline. The import of grain declined by 57 percent, of meat--by 64 percent, of butter--by 91 percent, and of tea--by 63 percent. The main reasons for the continued decline in import, explained the deputy chief of the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] Main Economic Administration, Vladimir Kiselev, were the introduction of increased excise tax rates on certain types of goods at the end of 1993, the repeal of subsidy coefficients on centralized import for state needs which became effective on 1 January 1994, as well as the lack of resolution in the question of exempting goods of centralized import from the payment of NDS [value-added tax] and import duties. A significant role here was played also by the sharp decline in the exchange rate of the ruble at the beginning of the year, as well as the increase in import tariffs which was planned for March of 1994.
