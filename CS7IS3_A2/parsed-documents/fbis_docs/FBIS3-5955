The statement points out that this is not a mere humanitarian matter but a serious political problem of the Korean nation and compatriots and, at the same time, an international human right issue. It says the South Korean treacherous clique are committing a crime by violating the dignity and interests of the nation and human rights, hand in glove with the Japanese Government, though it has yet to make apology and compensation. The statement points out that the South Korean authorities, under the mask of "humanitarianism," are trying to lay their foothold against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the Far East of Russia, sow the seed of dissension within the nation and foster confrontation, and thus perpetuate the division of the country. The statement demands that the South Korean authorities promptly renounce the treacherous scheme and the Japanese authorities think first of their compensation to the Koreans overseas and no more do act obstructive to the reunification of Korea.
