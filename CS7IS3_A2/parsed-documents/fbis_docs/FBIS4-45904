The blood donor has to indicate whether he or she has high blood pressure or allergies, has ever had malaria, and whether he or she has suffered from a sexually transmitted disease during the current year. The organization is trying to pinpoint so-called risk users by asking donors more personal questions than before. The donor has to indicate whether he or she has had partners other than his or her regular sex partner during the past two months, whether he has had sexual relations for which he paid during the past year, or whether he or his regular partner has ever used drugs injected with a needle or narcotic medications. Men are asked whether they have had sexual relations with a man. "We don't want any risk to either the donor or the recipient stemming from the donation of blood," chief physician Tom Krusius emphasized. The donor is reminded in the form that he must be over 18 but under 65 years old and weigh at least 50 kg. If he suspects that he may have been infected with HIV or hepatitis, he should not give blood for two months following the [suspected] infection. During that period he could infect someone else, even though the infection does not show up in the test. Less Than 100 Cases of Infection a Year Found The blood donor center looks for syphilis and hepatitis B and C, which cause inflammations of the liver. Nearly 100 cases of hepatitis infection, nine of syphilis, and only one of HIV were found last year. About 300,000 bags of blood a year are given and there are 180,000 donors. The average donor is a 38-year-old male who has given blood eight times. The blood donor center constantly needs new donors when the old ones drop out. However, risk users will not do because "the epidemiology of the HIV virus has changed. People living in a heterosexual relationship and women are becoming infected increasingly more often," Tom Krusius said. Homosexual males account for nearly half of the cases of HIV infection in Finland. Every blood unit that is given is tested in the laboratory and any viruses remaining are killed by heating or chemically treating the blood. About 350,000 units of blood products a year are administered, but not a single case of HIV infection transmitted by blood products has occurred since testing was begun, that is, in nine years. Three Finns were infected with HIV through blood transfusions abroad.
