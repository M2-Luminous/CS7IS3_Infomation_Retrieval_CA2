In practice, this means that stability on the continent -- and, more broadly speaking, its fate -- will be the upshot of cooperation between two powers ensconced outside Europe itself. It was confirmed that our continent has ceased to be the arena of a possible clash between them, but that -- as far as their interests are concerned -- it remains divided between them in accordance with the outcome of World War II. Compared with past decades, the only difference now is that the two super-victors are moving away from confrontation, with its risk of mutual destruction, toward cooperation. Central Europe should now also infiltrate into this concept for cooperation made possible by the collapse of the Soviet regime. Of course, as is becoming ever more obvious, the interests of the Central European countries -- until recently, part of the so-called Soviet bloc -- are not completely safeguarded by this global plan for U.S.-Russian cooperation. This disharmony is due to the fact that their post-war "discomfort" was caused not only by Soviet-U.S. nuclear rivalry, which is now being eradicated but also by these Central European countries being forced to subordinate themselves to unorganized development as a result of Europe's partition after 1945, development that ran counter to their historical, cultural, and economic existence. This pitched them into backwardness from which they now want to extricate themselves by a return to the community that corresponds to their interests. The possibility of such a return is also a crucial condition for their favorable future, for their newly open historical perspective. An inconsistency between the most intrinsic interests of former Soviet Central Europe and the Partnership for Peace plan, which -- a little in the style of consultations with Central American republics -- President Clinton came to Prague to explain, is foreshadowed here. Partnership for Peace gives the Central European countries the theoretical possibility of being selectively admitted into NATO, an organization guaranteeing their security, only this same possibility is also being offered -- without limits -- to the whole of the Euro- Asian region, right up to Vladivostok. This is the intention of Partnership, because it eradicates the mutual Russian-U.S. challenge and creates a basis for strategic cooperation. However, as far as the Central European countries are concerned, it is obvious that such a broadly proposed plan may problematize, if not stymie, their development prospects, because it preserves the former Soviet empire in a region stretching from Prague to Vladivostok. These countries' life-saving trek toward their original European ties, so different from their Euro-Asian ones, makes them uncertain. This is also at the heart of their anxiety about "the fate of the small in the game of the large," which President Lech Walesa -- a politician of refined instinct -- expressed so emphatically prior to the Prague meeting. Czech policy's solo journey -- in this context -- seems more like shortsightedness than foresight. If it reckons that the Czech Republic will escape from the cage of global power interests thanks to its declared advantages, then this is reminiscent of the tragic ingenuity of Edvard Benes. Many things imply that the new era of cooperation between America and Russia is not evolving merely to allow these two powers to rid themselves of the phantom of mutual destruction, but also because the two -- not Europe -- have analogous, if not identical, interests in relation to the rest of the world, first and foremost, Asia, against which they will have to measure themselves more and more explicitly. In view of all these circumstances, Central Europe's strategic interest is defined differently. It cannot have only a U.S. or a Euro-Asian dimension -- except in a tactical context -- but just, and only just, a pan-European dimension. Only the reassurance of being in its original European environment and a thorough reintegration into it can offer the Central European countries -- including the Czech Republic -- a suitable development perspective. Of course, this presumes that their inhabitants will be clear about this aim, that they will take it into consideration, and that they will not overshadow it with obsolete historical reminiscences. Central Europe, and the Czech Republic in it, cannot now, or in the future, function like an uncertain weld in U.S.-Russian special-interest cooperation but must concentrate on returning to the locus of its historical definition: to the center of the European continent. Only in this regenerated unit will it feel safe and only here will it be able -- within the framework of the European defense, economic, and cultural institutions -- to fulfill its own destiny.
