It comprises 47 deputies, exactly half the parliament. Far from all the deputies-members of the "Russia" election bloc, which numbers 155, joined the faction. In observers' estimates, the fact that the Supreme Soviet chairman and his lieutenants will be backing the faction, the deputies comprising it will be able to pass any decisions (with the exception of constitutional ones) ignoring the other parliamentarians' will. "Russia" is the second faction of Crimea's new parliament. The first to have been registered was the Crimea Tatar People's Assembly faction comprised of 14 deputies.
