S. Pondarev; UDC 620.179:621373] [Abstract] Interference methods and results of computing interference contrast and the corresponding errors in light reading in the case of a scalar wave field, depending on the characteristic of the entirely coherent low-order Gaussian beam are discussed in this article. It is assumed that the Fresnel coefficients are invariant and that the reflection from an inclined angle of incidence on the edge of the sample produces no phase shifting. Results of numerical computations for semi-conductor plates are provided. It is demonstrated that the interference intensity in the examined case is determined by a particular thickness of the plate and its effective coefficient of reflection. Curves of the interference contrast as a function of the sample thickness for different values of the effective reflection coefficient, and the relationship between the maximum relative light reading error and light transmissions by the plate were obtained.
