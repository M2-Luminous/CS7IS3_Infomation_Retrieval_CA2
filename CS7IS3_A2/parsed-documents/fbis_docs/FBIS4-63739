(From the Russian Federation Government Decree No. 479). Our defense industry is on starvation rations. It has already become a habit to complain of the dwindling size of funds earmarked by the state. At a press conference Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev complained that the defense industry enterprises are not being allowed to earn money. If they were allowed to trade in their output many problems of the financing of the defense industry would be removed. It is not long since the day when this wish was voiced but it looks as though the minister's dream is beginning to come true. The government decree, one of whose clauses is cited at the start of this article, has switched the trading light for the defense industry from red to green. What rights are being offered to the enterprises which develop and produce weapons and military equipment and which have been certified and registered as participants in foreign economic activity in the field of miltary-technical cooperation? They can look for foreign clients, make presentations, and pass on during talks the tactical and technical specifications of arms authorized for export, give a guideline price, and perform advertising and other marketing operations. But that is only the first authorized step. The second is the signing of contracts and, on the basis of the licenses received, the independent export of weapons and military equipment produced over and above the state defense order, and operations and services for military purposes. But what if a defense enterprises does not yet have specialists capable of trading at international level? In that case it is permitted to choose middlemen among the organizations which have the right to conduct foreign economic activity in the field of military-technical cooperation. The final point of a decree usually contains something of secondary importance. Probably the compilers of this decree did not regard as important the permission given to enterprises without drawing up a government decision to export spare parts and training and auxiliary materiel for weapons and military equipment already supplied abroad and also to perform work on their technical servicing and repair. But this point is extraordinarily important, since because of the absence of permission to carry out repairs and servicing and to sell training models, deals ready for signing were frequently thwarted. This factor is also considered in the low percentage of sales of Russian weapons on the foreign market. Optimists believe that our share is something in the region of 11 percent, while pessimists believe it is 5 percent. Both figures are an indicator of our inability to trade. What is of interest to the foreign customer right now? Primarily aircraft. There is a constant demand for the "Mig-29" and the "Su-27." A lot has been written about the sale of combat aircraft. Just as much has been written about firearms. But in speaking of firearms we for some reason as a rule mention the Kalashnikov assault rifle. But we now produce completely new firearms -- underwater, noiseless, with a great killing power, for the special troops. These innovations are a tasty morsel for foreigners. High-class weapons -- and without exaggeration it may be said there is no other kind in Russia -- are essential in the struggle against terrorists and criminals. The press mentions considerably less frequently the fact that the Russian "Igla" and "Strela" small air defense missile complexes are no less popular in the world than the U.S. "Stingers." The "Strela" was developed at the "Tochmash" design bureau and is intended for troops' air defense. Over 30 countries have bought the "Strela" for their own armies. The latest model, the "Strela-10MZ," is a lightweight missile complex which is directly in the combat formations of the motorized rifle and tank regiments and can effectively protect them from aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, and remotely piloted vehicles. Even more flattering terms can be used to describe the S-300B mobile system of anti-aircraft guided missile weapons with two types of missiles. This supermodern air defense system was created at the "Antey" science and production association and despite its high cost is finding no shortage of customers. And where are these countries which are prepared to respond to our offers of weapons? Russia's defense industry people have business relations with the states of the Near and Middle East, Southeast Asia, China, and India. The East European countries also remain purchasers of Russian weapons. I wrote about the defense industry people's business relations and though I had made a mistake. After all, previously neither the "Tochmash" design bureau nor the "Antey" science and production association nor any other defense enterprises had anything. They had to make do with just the state order issued from above. And with the ruble, constantly dwindling because of inflation. But now the defense industry people will be able to obtain the "greenbacks" so prized in our country now. I want to believe that the dollars it earns will help the defense industry to survive under present conditions and to retain its powerful scientific potential and will enable it to pay people a normal wage. But I want to tell those who, having heard about the dollars, are rushing to conclude the first deals, that the government decree supplements the "statute on the certification and registration of enterprises for the right to export weapons and military equipment and to perform work and services for military purposes." Each point of this statute should be studied thoroughly by a future participant in the trade in arms and combat equipment to avoid any misunderstandings which could result in a criminal case. Meanwhile let us report that the certification and registration are being carried out to assess the possibility of enterprises' foreign economic activity, to protect Russia's state interests, and also to create conditions for coordinating and monitoring enterprises' activity in the field of military-technical cooperation. The Russian Federation interdepartmental commission for military-technical cooperation with foreign countries is carrying out the certification at the request of the Russian Federation state committee for the defense sectors of industry. And so the defense industry's path into international trade is open. I want to believe that even the pessimists' percentage for our participation in a highly profitable business will exceed the optimists' present indicator. But although the green light has been given you must remember that the journey is always full of surprises. You must know how to prepare for them.
