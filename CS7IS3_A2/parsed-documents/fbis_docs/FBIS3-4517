A spokesman for the Romanian Foreign Ministry said that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be a basic topic for inter-Korean dialogue and that steps now should be taken to ease tension in the region. The spokesman said that any signatory to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has responsibilities to comply with its international commitment unconditionally. Complying with the agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the DPRK, including the acceptance of nuclear inspections, will help with the creation of peace and security in the Korea peninsula, he said. To this end, the talks between the DPRK, the U.S. and South Korea must be resumed, the spokesman added.
