Here is the union spokesman, Piotr Zak: [Begin Zak recording] We are asking Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Industry and Trade Minister Mark Pol to hold a direct, working meeting between representatives of the government and the mining and energy generation secretariat of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union [NSZZ] Solidarity. The aim of the meeting will be to specify the range and timetable of talks intended to resolve the problems lying at the root of the conflict. For some time, the Solidarity trade union has, as it were, reached out to the authorities, proposing substantive talks with the aim of resolving the conflict that has arisen. [end recording] [Correspondent Orzech reporting from Katowice] A representative of the brown coal-mining section of Solidarity threatened that if these talks are not held, a strike will once more begin at the brown coal mines. Simultaneously, an activist of the energy generation section warned that there might be wide-scale cuts in electric power supplies, and that these will not exclude the mass media. The trade unionists said that a timetable of strikes has been prepared, but that it must remain secret. According to Marian Krzaklewski, a scenario is also being prepared to meet the situation that would arise if the government rejects talks. Krzysztof Mlodzik, chairman of the mining and energy generation secretariat, said toward the end of the news conference that it would be wiser to give way. He did not make clear what he had in mind. This is Witold Orzech in Katowice. [Announcer] On the "Signals of the Day" program this morning, Labor Minister Leszek Miller addressed yesterday's statement by Solidarity's national mining section regarding talks with the government: [Begin Miller recording] We are open for various contacts with representatives of Solidarity. If such a meeting were to have a consultative character -- by this I mean one during which the both the subjects and the participants are specified -- such talks can certainly come about, such a team can certainly be created. On the other hand, I would here like to clearly distinguish between a consultative meeting and a negotiating meeting. As regards negotiations, our stance is unchanged. We invite representatives of other trade unions active in the mining sector to these talks. [end recording]
