He appealed for the formulation of economic proposals that go beyond momentary problems and set a course along which the Sandinists can take the country. Regarding the internal situation of his party, Tirado stated that "the factions represent a more comprehensive democratization in the FSLN." "No member of the National Directorate will remain aloof from these factions. Otherwise, we will be alone, isolated," he declared. The Sandinist leader said that his participation in one of the factions of the FSLN will depend on how they deal with economic issues. [Irias] Will the FSLN return to power? [Tirado] Like all parties, we always aspire to take office, and to political power in general. The FSLN has great potential for running the Government of Nicaragua. We need to meet a few requirements. To act as a revolutionary party that has committed itself to the defense of the workers' interests. The current conditions are not the same as they were in 1979; now there is a much wider array of parties in the opposition, contending with the FSLN to become the ruling party. The FSLN will have to define three important strategic aspects of the current situation: the democratization of the country, the economic crisis, and the electoral processes. Just as we accepted our electoral defeat and turned over the reins of government to the victorious political forces of the National Opposition Union (UNO), the FSLN must do its part and contribute to the democratization of the country and its institutions. Above all, it must discuss and debate the great issues that we face today. The most important one is the country's economic plight. This issue is being discussed with a lot of limitations, without giving it the priority it deserves. Elections are now replacing the armed struggle of the past. Many countries all over the world are attributing to the electoral struggle the importance it deserves in the effort to continue changes that could not be brought about through armed struggle. In Nicaragua, we must look at the electoral process in a revolutionary way; if we disdain it as an ideologized measure or procedure, we will not make any changes. We must create a democracy in the country, expand it, participate in elections, make the institutions of government and civil society work. Nicaragua is not an island; external influence plays an important role politically, economically, and socially. What is the worldwide trend that is taking place? We have to look at it this way so that we can resolve the problems that have arisen, so that we can take office in the future and govern by national consensus. No doubt about it, the market and competitiveness are the watchwords of the day. We must depart from that point to participate as a nation in this worldwide trend and improve the populace's socioeconomic conditions. [Irias] What are the obstacles to the FSLN's assuming office again? [Tirado] We face one obstacle: the economic crisis. You are not going to defend the workers' interests with alms. I think that defending the workers means creating jobs, training them, and giving them access to the resources generated by the production system. If you want to govern, you have to solve that problem, not with populist measures, but with jobs, investment. [Irias] What can the FSLN do right now to begin solving this problem? [Tirado] We must begin by revising the government's macroeconomic policies; that is the responsibility of all political forces and economic sectors in the country. We must seek a consensus to free up the economic mechanisms and revitalize production. I think that it is in the legal, civic opposition that we have gained the least experience. It has not been a constructive opposition, which we said we would build when we lost the elections. The FSLN's job is not to help solve short-term problems of poverty, but to contribute to a genuine change in the course of economic policy to open up new sources of employment. The FSLN must take a serious approach to economic issues to set the country's economic course. If the FSLN undertakes this task seriously, in the next elections we may not win in a landslide, but we will increase our percentage of the vote. [Irias] What internal effort is necessary in the FSLN to regain its leadership? [Tirado] We must establish leadership in the economic sphere. No leadership is capable of implementing all the economic measures that the trade associations are demanding of the government. Next week the trade associations--coffee growers, stockmen--plan to stage a demonstration, calling for the discussion of macroeconomic policies. That is an effort at establishing leadership. No political party has taken the lead in this discussion. No economic leadership--which is also political leadership--has emerged from within the FSLN. It is not a matter of wresting the leadership from the trade associations; it is a matter of using the legal and institutional means at the FSLN's disposal and sitting down to discuss the economic policies that are being called into question. The Sandinist Front should provide an alternative for all of these demands. That is the kind of economic leadership that I think is most important. [Irias] Do you agree with the existence of factions in the FSLN? [Tirado] There has been a lot of talk here about the democratization of the FSLN. It is not just a matter of holding a congress to reelect our officials. The factions represent a more comprehensive democratization in the FSLN. Some people get upset because these factions could lead to divisiveness. That is true, but the divisiveness is there whether or not there are factions. Those who are in charge of these currents of opinion should bear in mind that political discussion should serve to strengthen rather than to widen distances. Some people have legitimate aspirations, but that should not cause them to split away from Sandinism, because that would be counterproductive. The factions will play an important role in the democratization of the FSLN, independently of the congress or of any other activity that might make the FSLN more credible and help it win the people's trust. [Irias] It is said that the National Directorate agreed that its members would not be involved in any factions. Is that correct information? [Tirado] There was no decision; it was left up to each individual. Each one was to gauge the consequences and decide for himself. I do not recall any clear-cut decision being made. The matter was discussed in a very limited fashion. If this whole process is part of democracy, no member of the National Directorate will remain aloof from these factions. Otherwise, we will isolate ourselves. If this is aimed at democratizing the FSLN, what will Victor Tirado or Bayardo Arce do? Remain on the sidelines watching the action? What will we do? I suppose we will take sides with one faction or another. Actually, right now individuals already participate as groups, classes, or social sectors. The members of the National Directorate will have to decide to go with one of the two camps; otherwise, some will be left out. [Irias] There has been speculation that you would sign one of the documents made public by the factions. Will you sign at some point? [Tirado] My participation in particular--in a faction--will depend on whether they take up and discuss these economic issues and institutions. We must know where we want to take our country. The issue that interests me is economics. I am not satisfied with political matters. This country's backwardness is an economic problem. I think that the factions should discuss economic matters, add economic issues to their agenda. They should also add the issue of the Army. [Irias] Will the FSLN regain its peasant face? [Tirado] It lost the support of the peasantry over the economic issue. They turned their backs on us because of the price controls, expropriations, and distribution mechanisms. We did not use the market to help peasants develop. These measures caused the peasants to distance themselves from the FSLN. The FSLN should participate in the responses to economic problems and attract undecided voters. The Sandinist Front must present an alternative beyond what is being discussed now. In the discussion of the economic policies that are being applied, we can win back the peasant face of the FSLN. It is already happening. [Irias] What are your personal aspirations? [Tirado] I was thinking of beginning to write my autobiography while at the same time staying with the Sandinist Front. Thirty years in the FSLN, that has been my life. I have to find a way of surviving, of earning a living. You always have to participate in political and social activities, in revolutionary activities. It is impossible to live in isolation. I think that sometimes we Sandinists of this generation, who fought against Somoza and spent 10 years fighting against the United States, have turned positive things into obstacles to the organization and to society. We must make way for others, young people, the new generation that lived on the threshold of war and peace. One generation has to replace the other so that we can resolve our conflict. I am in favor of having new young people with a different mentality come in. We cannot remain wedded to what we did in the past. There is always a new alternative that we as a generation have not managed to reinvent. [Irias] Do you think the current situation in the FSLN is being influenced by the differences between Daniel Ortega and Sergio Ramirez? [Tirado] I do not think so. I think the media are largely to blame. When they personalize our leaders, the media take sides. They should be more objective. I do not think it is a personal problem. I think everyone wants reform in the FSLN. Individuals can also have aspirations; individual initiative is not a crime. I believe that these ideas should be channeled through the established mechanisms, that the bylaws should be allowed to function. If the current mechanisms are not working, new mechanisms should be developed.
