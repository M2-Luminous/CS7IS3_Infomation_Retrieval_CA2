Vacuum packaging and other types of modified atmosphere-packaging (those in which the air in the package or container is replaced by one or more gases, in various concentrations, before the package is sealed) extend the shelf life of foods markedly. However, the anaerobic environment created in these types of packaging favors the outgrowth of C. botulinum spores and subsequent toxin production, and it inhibits growth of aerobic microorganisms that might otherwise serve as organoleptic indicators of spoilage (Refs. 180 and 182). Consequently, use of vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging demands strict adherence to temperature-controlled storage and distribution to reduce the opportunity for spore outgrowth and toxin production and to reduce the potential growth of other microorganisms of public health significance (such as L. monocytogenes ). Two methods of reducing the potential public health hazard of vacuum or modified atmosphere packaged smoked, smoke-flavored, and salted fish products are: (1) To store and distribute the products frozen or, alternatively, (2) to use in-package heat processing followed by refrigeration. At freezer temperatures, outgrowth of spores of C. botulinum types B, E, and F is retarded (Refs. 171, 173, and 180). Type A does not grow below 50 ○F (10 ○C) (Refs. 179 and 180). Storage and distribution in the frozen state reduces the possibility that temperature abuse will occur. In-package heat processing, sometimes referred to as ``heat pasteurization,'' at temperatures in the range of 185 ○F (85 ○C) for 85 minutes to 198 ○F (92 ○C) for 55 minutes, inhibits outgrowth and toxin production by type E spores (Ref. 185). Longer exposure to processing temperatures is required for more heat resistant spores, such as types B and A (Ref. 185). In a study examining this method of packaging, samples of hot-process salmon steaks were injected with spores of nonproteolytic strains of C. botulinum types B and E (Ref. 185). The steaks were vacuum packaged, heat pasteurized, then incubated using different time-temperature combinations. The results of this research showed that closely controlled in-package heat processing extends the shelf life of the product, inactivates nonproteolytic C . botulinum types B, E, and F and other vegetative pathogens, and maintains product quality attributes. However, this process is more suitable for pieces, fillets, and steaks than for whole eviscerated fish because this process causes the flesh to separate from the backbone (Ref. 185). C. Specific Processing Conditions The various processing techniques used to produce smoked and smoke-flavored fish are affected by the interrelationship of the smoking, the method of smoke application, the time-temperature combinations used, and the water-phase salt content. A critical factor in determining alternative processing methods is the type of packaging utilized, specifically whether the product is air-packaged or vacuum-packaged. The following discussion sets out the various processing procedures that the agency has tentatively concluded will ensure the safety of hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish, and cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish. 1. Hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish. a. Air-packaged. Research data and industry practice show that a lower minimum water-phase salt content (3.5 percent or lower), in combination with lower processing temperatures (lower than 180 ○F (82 ○C)) than cited in the 1970 final rule for hot-process products are effective in inhibiting spore outgrowth and toxin production when the products are not vacuum-packaged and are held at refrigerated temperatures (40 ○F (4.4 ○C) or lower) (Refs. 24, 163, and 177). Research studies from the National Marine Fisheries Service and testimony presented at a public hearing held by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets on May 3, 1989, to establish a CGMP for the manufacture of smoked and smoke-flavored fish products, show that C. botulinum type E is inhibited in air-packaged smoked fish products when the water-phase salt content is at least 3.0 percent, and the processing internal temperature of the product is maintained at a minimum of 145 ○F (63 ○C) for at least 30 minutes (Ref. 180). In light of these findings, FDA is setting forth these processing parameters in Example 6 of this appendix to provide guidance on the safe manufacturing of these products. The agency is setting forth the following minimum T-T-S parameters for air-packed, hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish in section 5.a.1. of Example 6 of this appendix: Heating at an internal temperature of 145 ○F (63 ○C) for 30 minutes with a water-phase salt content of 3.0 percent in the finished product. b. Vacuum-packaged/modified atmosphere. For vacuum-packaged products, National Marine Fisheries Service research shows that processing temperatures in the range of 145 to 175 ○ F (63 to 80 ○C) for hot-process smoked fish will inhibit C. botulinum type E when the water-phase salt content is greater than 3.5 percent (Refs. 26, 173, and 180). Based on this evidence, New York's CGMP included a procedure for processing vacuum-packaged smoked fish that specifies heating the fish to an internal temperature of 145 ○F (63 ○C) for 30 minutes, with a water-phase salt content of 3.5 percent (Ref. 25). The use of sodium nitrite in combination with sodium chloride significantly inhibits the outgrowth and toxin production of C. botulinum type E. Research data show that when the water-phase salt content and sodium nitrite content are at least 3.1 percent and 100 ppm, respectively, and the internal temperature of the fish is not less than 145 ○F, the inhibitory effect on C. botulinum growth and toxin production greatly increases (Refs. 173 and 179). At higher processing temperatures, e.g., 180 ○F (82 ○C), a water-phase salt content of 3.0 percent or more inhibits toxin formation by C. botulinum type E (Ref. 163). Based on this information, the agency is setting forth the following T-T-S parameters for vacuum-packaged hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish in section 5.a.2. of Example 6 of this appendix: (1) Heating at an internal temperature of at least 145 ○F (63 ○C) for 30 minutes with a minimum water-phase salt content of 3.5 percent in the finished product, or (2) heating at an internal temperature of at least 145 ○F (63 ○C) for 30 minutes, with a minimum water-phase salt content of 3.0 percent, and a sodium nitrite content of 100 to 200 ppm (as permitted by the food additive regulations in §172.175) in the finished product, or (3) as described in §172.177 for smoked chub containing sodium nitrite.
