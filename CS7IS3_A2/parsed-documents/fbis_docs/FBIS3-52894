Otherwise, we will not be able to solve even the most minor issues. The First Plan started with the slogan of more production and production in all fields. But in the end, we had unrestrained imports and foreign debts. Economic growth and development in various dimensions is laudable. But the issue is at what price we achieve all this. 1. We have definitely suffered from weak management of the country's financial resources. The officials at the Ministry of Economy and Financial Affairs, as well as at the Central Bank and the Plan and Budget Organization did not provide timely information on the country's foreign exchange debts and its massive purchases. As a result, we lacked correct management for repayment of the country's debts, and ultimately our bank credits decreased and their guarantees were not accepted. For purchases from abroad, a third party should ensure our bank guarantees, which would lead to a considerable rise in the prices of imported goods. Who is responsible for the losses that have been inflicted on the country? What is the role of the Majles? 2. The Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of Heavy Industries resorted to foreign purchases that were outside the framework of the Plan and thus placed heavy burdens on the shoulders of the country. Purchases on a usance [preceding word in English] basis are usually carried out when the buyer is sure that he can repay within a short period of time. Otherwise, the interest on what he owes increases considerably and thus makes problems twice as bad. Such purchases took place outside the Plan, which was approved by the Majles. These same industries received $33.5 billion in foreign exchange, which is more than they were authorized. And the interesting point is that this violation was coupled with other violations, such as using up resources in industries for consumer goods that were outside the framework of the Plan instead of investing as was envisaged by the approved Plan. What is the duty of the Majles in relation with this? Management weakness should be dealt with appropriately. But more important than this is the way such behavior is justified. In justifying the excessive rise in consumerism and in consumer industries, the minister of industries said in an interview on 23 November 1993: "When a market and a free economy mechanism prevails, demand regulates supplies and the production or non-production of an item cannot be dictated." This comes at a time when we believe that "free economy" is what the Westerners have to say; but that we do not want to follow the West but the correct Islamic policy, as our society and system requires. In the Islamic system, supply and demand is controlled. Starting from the government and moving down to the most ordinary citizen, everyone has to decrease demand and prevent waste. This is at a time when a weak approach to advertising has led to an unrestrained increase in consumerism in the country and when the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran too is playing a noteworthy part in encouraging consumerism. The most important aspect of believing in the West is accepting the West's pattern; and we see this being manifested in the country's planning. Today we should accept the fact that technocrats and those whose plans do not have a religions basis are influential. What they are doing is to overshadow cultural and spiritual growth with consumerism and gaudiness and then blame the clergy and the system for the result of their efforts. The idea that the economy is a worldly issue and that we should lean on it to choose in which direction we want to move makes us to consider our efforts to achieve development and, more important yet, to achieve security to be contingent on astronomic loans from European countries. But even if we disregard the problems that stem from this type of outlook and only take into consideration the experiences of those countries that have tread this path, we will realize that we will not achieve what we want. But if we stop tying our hopes for economic development to the West and rely on our domestic resources, then we will definitely be able to achieve our objectives much more quickly. We should not forget that the main objective is to ensure social justice and to tend to the deprived masses of the country.
