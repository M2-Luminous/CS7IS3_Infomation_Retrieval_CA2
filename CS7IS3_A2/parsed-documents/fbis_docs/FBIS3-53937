Dhar] [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 10 -- Though the United States and India both desire that a meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Rao is overdue, the expectation here is that the initiative for it must come from Washington. U.S. officials, as well as the Indian Ambassador, Mr. S.S. Ray, have been talking about a Prime Ministerial visit to Washington for many months to strengthen bilateral relations, both in the economic and political spheres. The U.S. has to suggest the dates for Mr. Rao's visit to enable the officials to ascertain his convenience and also do the necessary preparatory work. The External Affairs Ministry is keen that the visit should take place so that substantive discussions on matters of mutual interest can be held at the summit level. But the process can start only on receipt of a proper invitation setting out the dates. It feels that the policy pronouncements made by the State Department's South Asia Bureau need not be taken too seriously, particularly when their interpretation keeps changing often. But the positive aspects of the relations between the world's two largest democracies ought to be stressed. The higher-level discussions on such issues as nonproliferation, Indo-Pak relations, human rights and South Asian security in general is overdue. Even though the Clinton Administration's statements on human rights in Kashmir have evoked criticism here, the positive aspects of Indo-U.S. relations are not being overlooked in the face of Washington's repeated assertions about India's stability and territorial integrity. It is pointed out that U.S. investment in India has increased substantially and further expansion of economic cooperation is in the cards. Though the embargo on rocket-related technology is still in force, the U.S. has been unilaterally raising the technology export threshold, and items which India could not obtain earlier from the U.S. are now readily available. The U.S. has also sent many positive signals to reinforce its desire to establish an active and wide-ranging relationship with India. Even with regard to Kashmir, the U.S. no longer talks of mediation. As the State Department has made it clear, "we do not set ourselves in a mediator's role." However, the Indian Government would like the U.S. to take note of the extreme sensitivity of public opinion here over the Kashmir issue. Almost the entire opposition in Parliament has urged the Government to lodge a formal protest over President Clinton's letter to the head of Pakistan-sponsored Kashmir American Council, Ghulam Nabi Fai, who supports militancy, and to underline America's partisan attitude. Even in the face of highly controversial statements emanating from Washington, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao has been playing it cool as he believes that one need not feel either euphoric or frustrated about the ups and downs in Indo-U.S. relations. Both sides, he feels, should make a serious assessment of their interests and the advantages of not only continuing, but also further strengthening this relationship. The last Indo-U.S. dialogue took place in September 1993 when the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, visited Washington. The subject covered global and regional developments, as well as, recent initiatives on issues such as a comprehensive test-ban treaty and cut-off of fissile-material production for weapons purposes. Other issues of interest also figured and both sides reiterated a desire to examine initiatives to enhance security through process of confidence-building. Since then the only worthwhile interaction took place when Ambassador Ray met U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The meeting was largely unproductive and did not help to bridge the differences between the two countries on various issues. India's concern over the move to repeal the Pressler Amendment, which would enable resumption of arms aid to Pakistan has been duly conveyed to Washington. It has been expressly stated that feverish arming of Pakistan would disturb the security balance in the sub-continent and force India to spend more on buying arms to safeguard its security, at the cost of development. The assertions that the U.S. is not pursuing an activist role with regard to Kashmir is, in India's view, not borne out by the recent policy pronouncements which tend to suggest that Indo-U.S. relations may face a prolonged cold spell. According to official sources, the linkage between terrorism in Kashmir and Pakistan's clamour over human rights violations, supported by the U.S., is a dangerous trend. However much the U.S. may desire peaceful relations being established between India and Pakistan and resolution of the Kashmir issue, even tacit support for terrorist activities in the Valley is likely to come in the way of forging closer relationship between India and U.S. On the positive side, it is pointed out that India has agreed to negotiate with Pakistan the Kashmir issue, and offered to host the next foreign secretaries' level meeting in four months in New Delhi. India is also sending a package of six proposals, including on the deployment of forces in the Siachen area, about which the U.S. is keen, and additional confidence-building measures, to Islamabad in four to six weeks if it is in a mood to give serious thought to it. On the non-proliferation issue, the U.S. now understands India's reluctance to sign the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] and has agreed to continue the dialogue. India is supportive of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and also moves to prevent export of weapons-grade fissile material. The differences over GATT negotiations have been fully resolved. During the current year Indo-U.S. relations will get high priority in India's foreign policy projections. Minus the irritants from Washington, New Delhi is keen on strengthening Indo-U.S. relations within the framework of shared interests on narrowing differences where they exist, and extending cooperation in a substantive manner in areas of mutual benefit.
