FR941007-2-00032 FR941007-2-00014 The No Action Alternative was considered within the EIS. This alternative was rejected because, without implementation of the GDP, the objective of an integrated waste management program for the City would not be met. This would result in inefficiencies and inabilities in dealing with the ongoing waste management needs of the City and would continue legal, environmental, and regulatory conflicts. Alternative sites were considered but rejected in favor of the Proposed Project because they failed to meet the basic siting criteria. Such criteria include the site's ability to support all of the GDP elements so that the collocation benefits are realized, the site's location being within the solid wasteshed it would serve, the site's location relative to the ability to pipe/transfer sludge, and the City's current uses on the GDP site. Alternative technologies for certain elements of the GDP were also considered. In general, they were found to be complimentary to, rather than alternatives to, the technologies which are proposed within the GDP. Mitigation measures for the proposed GDP are identified in the EIS. For Phase I elements of the GDP which are proposed for near-term implementation, and where sufficient design specifications support a detailed examination of impacts, specific mitigation requirements are identified within the project-specific analysis. For GDP elements which are still in a conceptual stage, more generalized mitigation criteria are identified. In conjunction with the completion of future Phase II project specific environmental documentation, a determination will be made whether further mitigation requirements are warranted. The Proposed GDP Project is considered to be the environmentally preferred alternative. It is the only alternative which meets the basic purpose, need, and objectives of the project. The mitigation framework of the Proposed GDP also serves to substantially lessen potential environmental impacts by identifying specific requirements for the near-term elements, establishing general mitigation criteria for the conceptual elements, and anticipating the development of more detailed mitigation measures for future levels of planning. FIRMP/NSPF and WMLOD Alternatives Part II of the EIS provided detailed consideration of two projects of the GDP comprising Phase I elements: (1) the Fiesta Island Replacement Project/Northern Sludge Processing Facility (FIRP/NSPF); and (2) West Miramar Landfill Overburden Disposal (WMLOD). FIRP/NSPF The key components of FIRP/NSPF include: (1) The FIRP/NSPF Site, a 30+ acre site, located northwest of the Convoy/SR&hyph;52 interchange, which will be developed with the storage tanks, centrifuges, sludge drying equipment, and associated facilities for the treatment of sludge and biosolids from the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant and from the North City Water Reclamation Plant (NCWRP); (2) FIRP/NSPF Overburden Disposal/Mounding_The excavation of approximately 540,000 cubic yards of earth from the FIRP/NSPF site and mounding of the overburden at the nearby west mound site; (3) Access Road_Construction of a main access road from Convoy Street to the FIRP/NSPF site; and (4) FIRP/NSPF Pipeline Corridor_A 4-mile pipeline route from Miramar Road to the FIRP/NSPF site for the installation of a parallel pipeline system (e.g., one pipeline for sludge and one pipeline for reclaimed water) connecting to the NCWRP. Alternatives for FIRP/NSPF include the No Action Alternative and several alternatives which are particular to the individual elements of FIRP/NSPF. The No Action Alternative was rejected in favor of the Proposed Project based on its failure to meet the basic purpose, need and objectives of the project. It was also rejected because continued reliance on the existing Fiesta Island sludge processing facility would result in a number of legal, technical, environmental, and land use conflicts. Alternative sites for the FIRP/NSPF were considered in comparison to the Proposed Project. They were found to be either more environmentally constrained, less efficient, or not as responsive to the basic project objectives. Alternatives for dealing with the site grading overburden were considered. They included mounding the overburden on NAS Miramar and trucking overburden off the station. The onsite mounding alternative is the preferred alternative based on fewer air quality and traffic impacts and reduced costs as compared to the offsite haul option. Three alternatives for the site access road were analyzed: Northern Access Route; Central Access Route; and Southern Access Route. The Southern Access Route with a temporary Central Construction Road is the alignment selected.
