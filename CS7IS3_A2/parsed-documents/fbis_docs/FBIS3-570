Cameroonian Government sources have refused to make any comment on the purpose of the Nigerian foreign minister's visit which has not been officially announced. Since the Bakassi Peninsula border dispute broke out between the two countries at the end of December 1993, both Cameroon and Nigeria have sent out several diplomatic missions to their neighbors in a bid to try to settle the dispute. In connection with such diplomatic missions, Kingibe first went to Yaounde in early January.
