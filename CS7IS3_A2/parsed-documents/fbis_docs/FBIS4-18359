Necmettin Erbakan, addressing some 10,000 supporters after Friday prayers at the Eyup Sultan mosque, did not spell out what he meant by a "world union of Islam," but he praised Eyup, an Arab soldier who fell during a siege of the town in 668, saying he was a "great example of Islamic jihad (holy war)." Erbakan, whose party won municipal elections here, in Ankara and in some 25 other towns last weekend, joined in prayers with new Istanbul mayor Tayyip Erdogan and 17 other local district mayors before they took up their posts. "We have taken power at the local, geographical and demographic levels in two-thirds of Turkey and now we are marching to take central power in the near future," the leader, perched on a bus, told his supporters. In the municipal elections, the Prosperity Party "soared into the sky like a missile," while centre parties "which copy the West plummeted from the sky," he said. Meanwhile, the Turkish pound was again under pressure here Friday as the country awaited the know whether Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's mainstream secular True Path Party, which obtained the most votes of any single party in the election, with around 22 percent of the vote, would continue to govern. It could continue in a coalition with the centre-left Social Democratic Populist Party or ditch it in favour of an alliance with the opposition Motherland Party. On the local free currency markets, the Turkish pound was trading at 27,500 to the dollar, down from 25,500 on Thursday. The Turkish currency has lost 60 percent of its value against the dollar since the beginning of the year. In Athens Friday, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou expressed concern at the Islamic success in the Turkish ballots, "particularly" in Istanbul. He told a meeting of his ruling PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] party that the Turkish election results were "a worrying sign, especially in this already troubled region."
