After long guesswork, now there came a clear German no. The chancellor never thought of attending the celebrations on the 50th anniversary of the Allied landing; it would be "inappropriate." Well then: On 6 June, almost all of Europe will celebrate, and the supreme European ducks his head and lifts it only two days later for the reconciliation event in Heidelberg. One does not feel comfortable about that. However, on the other hand, this is better for everyone. Kohl would just feel uncomfortable at Omaha Beach, and one would hardly know what to do with him. At home all those would be angry with him who still consider the "invasion" as an ignominy. Those, on the other hand, who see D-Day as an important step toward the liberation from fascism would have to be afraid that Kohl does something embarrassing. Or does anyone remember that he has ever been brilliant at any event that dealt with the fascist past? As much as one ponders, the only thing that comes to mind is the ghostly event at the soldiers' cemetery of Bitburg. Yes, if there were still Willy Brandt or if there were still any politicians who never had problems in Volgograd! Kohl, however, likes to present himself in many shapes, but no one has ever got the idea of seeing him as the personification of antifascism. If he had ended up at the Atlantic beach on 6 June, he would indeed have stood around there as the representative of the vanquished. No, June is not a good month. Only in late summer will Kohl thrive again. Then he will wave farewell to the last Russians, forgiving them for their grandfathers' having once come to our country. Shortly afterwards, Berlin will be completely free from the Allies. This is a way of coping with history that Kohl likes. However, in May 1995 things will get delicate again. Oh, why do we not have a chancellor whom we can show on all days! It would be appropriate.
