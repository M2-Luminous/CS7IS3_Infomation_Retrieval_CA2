FR940303-1-00015 FR940303-1-00003 The definition of ``controlling individual'' is intended to encompass those individuals who typically are part of the organization's control group. A controlling individual under this definition must: (1) Be a current employee or member of the organization; (2) hold a high level position with the organization; (3) participate ``as a decision maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject matter''; and (4) be known by the government to be engaged in such activities. This definition attempts to identify those limited number of individuals affiliated with the organization who actually are involved in determining the organization's position with regard to the legal proceeding or investigation. DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 are intended to protect the attorney-client relationship from unnecessary interference and to protect represented parties from overreaching by opposing counsel. Communications with those high-level individuals affiliated with or employed by an organization who are responsible for employing and directing the organization's counsel and for determining legal positions taken by the organization are the type of communications prohibited by DR 7&hyph;104. Accordingly, this paragraph defines ``controlling individual'' consistent with the principles underlying the disciplinary rules on ex parte contacts. Of all the issues pertaining to 7&hyph;104(A)(1), the issue of organizational representation has engendered the greatest confusion and disagreement among the lower federal courts. Courts considering the question have applied a variety of modes of analysis, either singly or in combination. The Department believes the best approach is that adopted by those courts that have attempted to identify an organization's ``control group.'' See, e.g., Shealy v. Laidlaw Bros., 34 FEP Cases 1223, 1225 (D.S.C. 1984) (a corporate ``party'' under DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) includes ``a person whose employer's interests are, by virtue of his position of employment, so close to his own and to his heart that he could be depended upon in all events to carry out his employer's direction''); B.H. by Monahan v. Johnson, 128 F.R.D. 659, 663 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (``only `those individuals who can bind it [the defendant] to a decision or settle controversies on its behalf' would be considered parties for purposes of DR 7&hyph;104''); Frey v. Department of Health & Human Servs., 106 F.R.D. 32, 35 (E.D.N.Y. 1985) (``the Rule applies to those employees of a government agency who are the `alter egos' of the entity, that is, those individuals who can bind it to a decision or settle controversies on its behalf''); Fair Auto. Repair v. Car-X Serv. Systems, 128 Ill.App.3d 763, 771, 471 N.E.2d 554, 560 (1984) (DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) prohibits ex parte contacts with corporate defendant's ``control group,'' defined as ``those top management persons who had the responsibility of making final decisions and those employees whose advisory roles to top management are such that a decision would not normally be made without those persons' advice or opinion or whose opinions in fact form the basis of any final decision''). The Department believes that the ``control group'' approach most accurately reflects the values underlying DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Rule 4.2. This approach properly seeks to identify those employees who exercise such sufficient authority within the organization that communications with them should be regarded as communications with the organization itself. The Department also believes that the alternative approaches would impose unacceptable constraints on federal law enforcement. Paragraph (b): Communications With Former Employees; Organizational Representation This paragraph authorizes communications with former employees of represented organizations. Because former employees do not direct the affairs of the organization and therefore cannot be considered members of the ``control group'' or any other controlling entity of an organization, communications with them are not considered communications with the organization for purposes of the proposed rule. This reasoning is consistent with the conclusion of the majority of federal courts that have held that DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) does not bar communications with former employees of a represented corporate party. See, e.g., Hanntz v. Shiley, Inc., 766 F. Supp. 258, 267 & n.8 (D.N.J. 1991); Action Air Freight, Inc. v. Pilot Air Freight Corp., 769 F. Supp. 899, 904 (E.D.Pa. 1991); Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc. v. Wasatch Bank, 139 F.R.D. 412, 417&hyph;18 (D.Utah 1991); Sherrod v. Furniture Center, 769 F. Supp. 1021, 1022 (W.D. Tenn. 1991); Dubois v. Gradco Systems, Inc., 136 F.R.D. 341, 345 n.4 (D.Conn. 1991); Polycast Technology Corp. v. Uniroyal, Inc., 129 F.R.D. 621, 628 (S.D.N.Y. 1990). See also ABA Comm. on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 359 (1991) (``Accordingly, it is the opinion of the Committee that a lawyer representing a client in a matter adverse to a corporate party that is represented by another lawyer may, without violating Model Rule 4.2, communicate about the subject of the representation with an unrepresented former employee of the corporate party without the consent of the corporation's lawyer.''). But see PPG Industries, Inc. v. BASF Corp., 134 F.R.D. 118, 121 (W.D.Pa. 1990); Public Serv. Elec. & Gas v. Associated Elec. & Gas, 745 F. Supp. 1037, 1042 (D.N.J. 1990). Paragraph (c): Communications With Former or Current Employees; Individual Representation This paragraph provides that if a former or current employee or a member of an organization retains his or her own counsel, the government shall provide the same protection to him or her that would be provided under this part to any other represented person or represented party. Communications with that individual are subject to the limitations set forth in this part. Although this section provides the general rule for such communications, paragraph (d) addresses the specific situation in which a controlling individual of a represented organization retains separate counsel.
