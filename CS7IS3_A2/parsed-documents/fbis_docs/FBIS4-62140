The plane carrying Yegorov and a group of officers was refused landing in the Amari airport which remains in the disposition of the Russian Armed Forces. Estonian Foreign Ministry Press Secretary Mari-Ann Rikken told Interfax that the appropriate notification had been transmitted by the Russian Embassy in Tallinn only two days before. She underlined that the internationally accepted norms demanded at least fifteen days for consideration. No information on the officers accompanying Yegorov had been given. Rikken said this had made impossible to authorize them to come to Estonia. However, Russian Military Attache in Estonia Anatoliy Chizhikov told Interfax that Russia and Estonia had an agreement giving five days for consideration of notifications on landing of military jets, although such issues were as a rule resolved within one or two days. Chizhikov pointed out that the Russian Embassy had received no clarification on new terms for consideration of such notifications and refused to comment on the decision by the Estonian Foreign Ministry.
