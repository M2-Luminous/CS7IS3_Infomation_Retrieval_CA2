Speaking at the meeting, the honorary chairman of the Cilreco, George Pattas, former Greek general, said what is exasperating with regard to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is that the United States is incoherent in its stand. "I think if the Clinton administration is willing to find a peaceful solution to the acute nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula through bilateral talks between the DPRK and the United States it must adopt its decision properly at the present crucial juncture," he said. Robert Parry, British Labour member of the House of Commons, said the prevailing situation requires that the essence of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be laid bare and the solidarity movement for supporting the Korean people's cause of reunification conducted more vigorously in diverse forms and ways. He said when the international solidarity movement for supporting the just cause of the Korean people is intensified the United States will not be able to impose any kind of "sanctions" on the DPRK and, even if it is possible to do so, it is bound to end in failure. Lawyer Stanley Faulkner, vice-chairman of the Cilreco and chairman of the U.S. Lawyers Committee on Korea, said the United States' deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea is a crude violation of the Korean armistice agreement that prohibits the introduction of new weapons and military hardware from outside Korea, and called for an immediate pullout of the nuclear weapons from South Korea. He stressed that war rehearsals of the U.S. should be stopped at once as they run counter to the U.N. charter on stopping threat to world peace and solving problems through peaceful means. Roberto Gabriele, general secretary of the Movement for Peace and Socialism of Italy, said the Cilreco struggling for the reunification and peace of Korea should lay bare the essence of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula by keeping in close contact with the committees for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people across the world and launch an international campaign to check and frustrate the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and its followers. Prof. Paulette Pierson at Libre University in Brussels, Belgium called on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and governmental and non-governmental organizations to lay bare through international arenas the nature of the Kim Yong-sam "civilian" regime and build up widespread international opinion supporting the democratization of the South Korean society and Korea's reunification. Joe Debono Greck, Maltese Labour member of Parliament, exposed the persistent despicable moves of some force of the United States to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, saying it is a big mistake if the United States and its followers think they can frighten the Korean people united in one mind with pressure and threat and representative of the Sandinist National Liberation Front of Nicaragua Esmeralda Cardenas said if Kim Yong-sam truly wants the reunification he should tear down the concrete wall without hesitation as it is a product of the cold war that was built by the military dictatorial "regime". The secretary general of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Amar Bentoumi, former minister of justice of Algeria, called on the progressive lawyers of all countries in the world who love justice and peace to launch into an international campaign urging the United States to abandon its hostile policy aimed at stifling the DPRK and implement the principles stipulated in the DPRK-U.S. joint statement in good faith. Speeches supporting the Korean people's cause of national reunification were also made at the meeting by Robert Charvin, secretary general of the International Committee of Jurists for Democracy and Human Rights in South Korea; Basco Hago Fernandes, chairman of the Democratic Intervention of Portugal; Jaime Ballesteros, international secretary of the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain, and other figures.
