[Fini] Paradoxically when I said that I was perplexed about the Northern League at the Viminale [Interior Ministry]. I could have said a definite no, but I did not because I was against vetoes. The League behaved the same way when it opposed Dini as budget minister, but not to the point of making the government drown. Everybody did his part in his own way. In the end good sense prevailed: [Interior Minister] Maroni obviously confirmed that the unity of Italy was not under discussion and that our attitude had changed. Delaying things would have meant weakening the governing body and doing the Left a favor. The Right decided to render its services to the nation. We will demonstrate the rest with our ministers who are already at work. [Guiglia] Well, the five hours spent in Berlusconi's house cannot have been idyllic. What was the bone of contention between you and the Knight [Berlusconi nickname]? [Fini] I considered the choice of Previti as justice minister to be inopportune. Berlusconi was not of the same opinion. In those very hours a letter from the head of state arrived concerning the "principles" to be respected in the choice of ministers. However, the prime minister-designate and myself were never at a standoff, not even on the choices of our ministries. [Guiglia] What was your reaction to [President] Scalfaro's intervention? [Fini] That letter had been announced, but, of course, we were curious and wanted to read it word by word. There were no vetoes. There was some "batting" as we interpreted it. [Guiglia] But did the head of state do the right thing by writing or not? [Fini] It did not matter. It was something for future reference. Berlusconi did well to tell Maroni to "ideally sign" his confirmation. [Guiglia] What weight did Scalfaro have in the negotiations? [Fini] He had some weight. [Guiglia] New Chamber of Deputies and Senate speakers, new government, new legislature. Can the "old" president stay at the Quirinale [office of the president]? [Fini] This is not on the agenda. [Guiglia] Not on the agenda or not a problem? [Fini] I have already answered. [Guiglia] How do you judge [League Secretary] Bossi and Berlusconi after 10 days of repeated face-to-face encounters. [Fini] I think I have discovered that Bossi is by no means superficial, even though at times he expresses himself in a simple or simplistic manner. As for Berlusconi, he is an unusual businessman: He talks a great deal but he also listens a great deal. He is incredibly patient, an able mediator. [Guiglia] Are you dealing out compliments to make the government last? [Fini] There is no need to. Either the boat continues to go ahead or it sinks and we all drown. The government was born under a common banner of respect and responsibility. [Guiglia] What were the "real" steps in the turning point of the MSI [Italian Social Movement]? [Fini] The list could begin with a good MSI performance on 5 April 1992. However, it was [former President] Cossiga's blows and the bribery scandals that acted as the detonators of a corrupt and party-system regime. The last shiver I felt was on 11 December when I announced to the central committee that I had gone to the Fosse Ardeatine [site of Nazi retaliation slaughter]. Would the response be an embarrassing silence or applause? They responded with applause and with a standing ovation; at least most stood. This was when National Alliance was born, and I was certain that the MSI would have followed me. To the Palazzo Chigi [government seat].
