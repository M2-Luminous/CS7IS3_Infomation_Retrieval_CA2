Regarding this, a French diplomatic and military mission arrived in our capital this afternoon. It was welcomed at the Yaounde Air Force Base by a delegation led by the chief of general staff, Pierre Temenge. Joseph Ley, you have just returned from the Yaounde Air Force Base where you really saw the disembarkment of a detachment of French paratroopers from Bangui, Central African Republic [CAR]. [Ley] Yes, Charles. At 1525, a French Air Force Transal aircraft landed at the Yaounde Military Base. The heavy-duty transport aircraft was carrying a detachment of French paratroopers and two military jeeps. As you said, they came from Bangui, the CAR. Fifty minutes later, two [name indistinct] helicopters, which generally serve as a support for land troops, also landed at the military base with equipment and some men. The equipment and the men were welcomed by a high-level delegation led by General Pierre Temenge, the chief of general staff. Also included in the delegation were General Claude Meka, the commander of the Yaounde headquarters and of the first military region; Colonel Paul Yakana Yebama, the chief of air staff; Commander Etoga, commander of the Yaounde Air Force Base; and several other Cameroonian military officers. On the French side, it was Colonel (Ballaman), military attache at the French Embassy in Yaounde, who led the welcoming committee. According to a French military official, for now these men and their equipment will remain here in Yaounde. They will only be deployed in the case of necessity and [words indistinct] on the Cameroonian side. France has reacted militarily, but it has also reacted diplomatically, because a French diplomatic mission from Paris arrived at the Yaounde International Airport late this afternoon. This delegation is made up of officials concerned with African and Malagasy affairs at the Elysees and at the French Foreign Service. In addition to this the French Embassy has just presented to us the following statement from the spokesman of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated 25 February. The statement reads: France is very concerned by the tension currently reigning between Nigeria and Cameroon. This follows the entry of Nigerian forces into the Bakasi Peninsula and the clashes that took place on 18 February. France is attentively following the evolution of the situation in the field and in New York, where Cameroon has called for an emergency meeting of the Security Council. France is in permanent contact with the authorities of the two countries. It is making efforts to ensure that any act that may lead to a further degradation in the situation is avoided, and that a peaceful settlement is found to the dispute. To this end, in collaboration with its partners, the French Government has embarked on diplomatic action, both on the bilateral and international levels, where this affair might be discussed. The European Union is also intervening along the same lines. Our concern, the communique continues, is that peace must be preserved and that the most appropriate international forum be found as soon as possible to ensure a peaceful solution to this dispute. Well, Charles, this is all I have concerning this diplomatic and military mission undertaken by France to Cameroon. In case of necessity, this mission will come to support the actions already undertaken, with much success, both by our soldiers and our diplomats. [Announcer] Thank you, Joseph. Still, concerning this border conflict between Cameroon and its neighbor, Nigeria, the minister of defense visited with Cameroonian troops over the weekend. Accompanied by the chief of general staff, the minister visited the front to see the morale was of the Cameroonian troops. Their morale was judged to be good. The outcome of the latest clashes was one Cameroonian soldier killed, with more than 30 dead on the Nigerian side, according to our correspondent, [name indistinct] [passage omitted]
