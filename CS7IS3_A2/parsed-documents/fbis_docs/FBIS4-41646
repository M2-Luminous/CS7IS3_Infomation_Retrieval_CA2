Savchenko under the rubric "Economics: The Market, Reforms": "The Most Dangerous Thing Now Is Not To Do Anything"] [Text] Crimeans are expecting concrete actions from the new government today. And one must say that a start has been made. The Program of Economic Reforms for 1994-98 was considered and approved at the meeting of the government. Ahead lies its approval by the Supreme Council. We addressed several questions to one of the program's main developers, Minister of Economics Andrey Chernyavskiy. [Savchenko] Andrey Vasilyevich, which initial steps must be taken for the economy of Crimea to emerge from its crisis condition? Are these envisioned in the program? [Chernyavskiy] Yes, the program earmarks tasks for the medium-range future that must be carried out during the course of this year. First of all we must improve legislation, contribute to the establishment and strengthening of economic ties with suppliers of raw material and consumers of products, implement a complex of measures for improving the system of credit for enterprises, and try to supplement their working resources. These tasks ensue from an overall analysis of the situation in Crimea, which is given in the first part of this program. The situation in Crimea, as throughout all Ukraine, is indeed difficult since the transition to a market economy is proceeding more painfully than in Russia. This is related to the slow progress along the path of reforms. Privatization is being drawn out. In spite of the fact that the old levers for management of the economy have been lost, certain elements of the old system remain. For instance, the fixed exchange rate between the karbovanets and foreign currencies, the system of ministries, and the system for distribution of financial resources and regulation of wages. Last year Ukraine experienced hyperinflation, which is causing a sharp drop in the standard of living of people, primarily those who receive incomes from the budget. But they include physicians, teachers, and pensioners. The only positive tendency in Ukraine's modern economic policy is its course toward strengthening the karbovanets. But this, in turn, is having a painful effect on the financial resources of enterprises and incomes of the population. Enterprises are experiencing a deflation shock. Prices continue to rise out of momentum. The production slope has become ingrained and, since the beginning of the year, industrial production has decreased by more than 30 percent. [Savchenko] And which enterprises are already standing idle? Foton? [Chernyavskiy] Foton is still in operation, but the Dzhankoyskiy machine building plant has been shut down. Completely. The government is faced with the problem of normalizing the activity of Crimean enterprises and agriculture during this transition period and setting up a financial-credit system. In our opinion, it would be a good idea to bring foreign banks into the territory of Crimea. They would be the conductors of foreign investments, they would make it possible to reduce credit rates, and perhaps they would also make it possible to effectively invest the funds of both the population and the enterprises. But, so far, this intention of the Crimean Government is encountering stiff resistance from Ukraine. In the banking sphere its government is conducting a policy of isolationism and refusal to allow foreign banks on its territory. The amount of internal capital needed to open a new bank has also increased. It is equivalent to 3 million ECU's. At the market exchange rate this is $1 million. Not everyone can meet this requirement. I should also like to mention the fact that Crimea is not getting its fair share of credit resources. It is necessary to enter a negotiating process with Ukraine so that the republic will receive them at least on the same level as other oblasts. This would make it possible for enterprises and trade organizations to breathe more freely. [Savchenko] Do you discuss the crucial problems of the present day with the leaders of the enterprises? [Chernyavskiy] Yes. Conversations with directors show that there are many obstacles to their normal activity. The Crimean economy is extremely open and many enterprises are oriented toward trade primarily with Russia. They receive raw material from there and Russia is a sales market for their finished products. But, as of today, trade with Russia is extremely difficult if only because of the demand for prepayment introduced by Ukraine. Russia can be a sales market if goods are delivered there without demanding prepayment. As a result of this requirement problems have arisen for the Foton plant, although Russian trade is ready to buy Simferopol television sets in order to sell them there. The government will contribute to concluding agreements, including on the territorial principle. Perhaps on this basis we will succeed in setting up mutual deliveries of finished products so as to invigorate industry and agriculture. Additionally, we will search for financial resources for resolving the agrarian situation. Perhaps steps will be taken to work on incomplete construction projects. It would be hard to speak of this with complete confidence at this point. [Savchenko] Will privatization be started in Crimea? The previous deputy corps, as we know, placed a moratorium on it. [Chernyavskiy] Privatization is being dragged out disgracefully in the Crimea. The Ministry of Economics has prepared a privatization program that will be submitted to the government for discussion and then to the Supreme Council. We already have a thick file of applications from enterprises for privatization, although I must say that the directors have various attitudes toward this process. The four trade ports that ended up on the list for privatization according to the edict of the president of Crimea (and Ukraine also) are categorically against it. And world experience suggests that the majority of ports in the world are not private property. But the enterprises are basically in favor of privatization. Since Ukraine considers a number of enterprises to be its property it could begin the privatization process itself. Certain steps have already been taken in this direction, incidentally. By an edict of the Ukrainian president a state petroleum and gas holding company has been created in which the Chernomorneftegaz Association accounts for more than half of the property. This alarms us extremely. [Savchenko] You have exchanged the chair of a scholar for the post of minister--is that the fashion today? [Chernyavskiy] It seems to me that the activity in the ministry is interesting and forward-looking, and, of course, I am counting on doing something useful for Crimea, for otherwise it would not be worth getting into this. But our Moscow team began to work in a very difficult period. The situation may get worse for a number of reasons that are beyond our control. The government of the transition period is very much under the gun. It can always be accused of allowing things to get worse than they were. We are in a difficult situation because our work with the Supreme Council is not going smoothly and we do not know when it will. But the most dangerous thing now is not to do anything. The government will take steps in all the directions earmarked in the program. [Savchenko] Is your ministry's team fully staffed? [Chernyavskiy] It is very difficult to recruit people. The salary of the minister is about 1 million karbovantsy. The workers will receive even less. Naturally, it is difficult to find educated, energetic people who are willing to work for such wages. [Savchenko] How much time does the Moscow team intend to spend working in Crimea? Will you last long? [Chernyavskiy] I do not know how long we will last. But catching up with things, learning about the enterprises, drawing up more concrete action plans, implementing them, setting up stable contacts with Kiev, and evaluating the first results of the reforms will take a minimum of about two years. We would like to be useful to Crimea, the Crimean economy, and the people who are living on this peninsula.
