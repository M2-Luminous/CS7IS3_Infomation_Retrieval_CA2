Troops fatally shot Fadil Ibrahim Rihan, 19, in the mouth after he threw stones at an army jeep patrolling the Jabalyah refugee camp, while elite troops shot 'Abbas Khadir al-Sa'idi, 18, in the al-Shati' camp, they said. Taxi driver Ibrahim Abu-Dan told AFP that he saw soldiers, who were looking for Palestinians who had fled in a Peugeot 404 car, first wounding al-Sa'idi and then finishing him off with a second shot. Farid Sha'rawi, 19, was killed by a bullet which penetrated his abdomen when Israeli soldiers opened fire in the al-Shati' camp at demonstrators showering them with stones. Tension was clearly mounting in Gaza Monday night despite a curfew which takes effect every evening as of 8:00 p.m. (1800 GMT), the same sources said. These deaths bring to 1,163 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli bullets in the occupied territories since the uprising erupted six years ago, according to an AFP toll. Also on Monday, Palestinian sources here said Israeli troops have arrested two members of PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah faction who are suspected of murdering two Israelis last week. In a raid Sunday on the Gaza Strip's Khan Yunus refugee camp, they arrested Farid al-Qaysi, 21, and 'Ala Abu-Sita, 20, on charges of killing alleged drug dealers Hayim Weizmann, 34, and David Bublil, 41, near Tel Aviv last Friday. The two were reportedly seen writing on the main Khan Yunus mosque that "the Ahmad Abu-Rish group carried out the murder of the two Zionist dogs at al-Ramlah to avenge the army's killing of Ahmad Abu Rish." Al-Qaysi, Abu-Sita and two other Palestinians who were at large had shown camp residents four ears they said they had cut from their victims, Palestinians said. Undercover Israeli troops shot dead Ahmad Khalid Abu-Rish, a 20-year-old member of the Fatah Hawks, on November 28, shortly after he had been set free from prison. The Hawks vowed afterwards to resume their armed attacks which they had abandoned on Arafat's orders following the September 13 autonomy accord. The army also arrested Muhammad Abu-Rish, a former member of the Islamic Jihad movement who had been pardoned at the same time as his brother Ahmad. Soldiers also raided the al-Burayj camp and arrested Yasir Taha, 20, a member of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qasim, the armed wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
