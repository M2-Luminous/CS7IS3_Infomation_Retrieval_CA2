It has even been claimed that some of them requested his extradition but there is no official confirmation of such claims. The same sources said that Bin-Ladin, whose home neighboring the mosque was attacked by the group, as a result of which three of his visitors were wounded, used to stay at home and not leave there and was in the habit of receiving the engineers working for his company at 1700 every Friday. That is why the attack on his house was timed at 1630. The attackers searched all the rooms of the house for him, including his bedroom, and opened fire on the engineers, wounding three of them. Then they attacked the neighboring mosque to cover up the operation. They added that the group consisted of four people, two of them Mauritanian, one Moroccan, and one Yemeni. They belonged to the extremist al-Takfir Wa al-Hijrah [renunciation and repudiation] Movement. They said that some members of the movement held an open debate a week earlier at the same mosque that was attacked. They disagreed with and repudiated Ansar al-Sunnah and regarded Dr. Hasan al-Turabi and President al-Bashir and members of his government as infidels. Sudanese security sources say that the way the group operated and carried out its attack confirmed that its members were well-trained professionals. They did not leave behind any passports, identity cards, or papers that would betray their identity or the parties financing them. The sources also say that they came from different places and that the date of their entry into Sudan was not known. There are numerous questions the investigators are trying to find answers for as they interrogate the detained members of the group, especially the Yemeni who was wounded in the exchange of fire with the police during the attack. The Sudanese sources emphasized that there was no connection between the mosque and Bin-Ladin although they did say that Ansar al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyah, to which the mosque belongs, is an Islamic Wahhabi group known for its links with Saudi Arabia but with no significant activity or influence in Sudan to make it a target for such a serious attack. Furthermore, there are no differences between the Wahhabi group and Sudan. It is worth noting that the Saudi businessman Bin-Ladin was one of the most prominent supporters of the Afghan Mojahedin when they were fighting for the liberation of Afghanistan from communist influence. He used his own money for the training of Arab volunteers and their transportation to join the Afghan mojahedin. He recently moved to Sudan and was the target of criticism by Egypt, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia.
