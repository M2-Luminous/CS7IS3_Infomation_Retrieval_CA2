In a statement delivered to ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson Mandela at their meeting in Durban on Tuesday [1 March], the IFP president repeated the interim constitution was a "prescription for disaster". Mr Buthelezi said however he remained totally committed to a negotiated settlement. "Together we could relieve the prohibitive pressure of time and create a space to salvage failed negotiations. This would mean extending the election period and providing for mediation regarding the problems that are separating us." Mr Buthelezi's memorandum, presented to Mr Mandela at the beginning of their Durban summit, was leaked to the media. Mr Buthelezi said that the failure to reach a comprehensive constitutional settlement "will have disastrous consequences, and no amount of talks in advance of tanks rolling down on Ulundi, or of white rightwing resistance being crushed, will justify the retention of the 1993 constitution as a [word indistinct] of the promise to come". The IFP president said it was glib of some leaders to say that only elections would curb violence, adding: "There will not be stability, and democracy will not flow from what the ANC has done in an unholy alliance with the National Party and the government." "The 1993 constitution...is fatally flawed. No amount of political dressage and no amount of constitutional rephrasing of the text around the fatal flaws can hide them." In addition, there was the question of the transition process, said the IFP leader. "We reject the TEC (transitional executive council) and we reject the decisions it makes, and we will not be willing accomplices in implementing them." He said there was a "very substantial" number of South Africans who rejected the constitution and the TEC. "How, Mr Mandela, do you think there can be fair and free elections when millions of South Africans reject the constitution under which it will be held? We are democrats, Mr Mandela, and we will exercise our democratic right to oppose a constitution we reject and to oppose the election under it." On the issue of the Zulu monarchy, Mr Buthelezi said King Goodwill Zwelithini had noted the failure of negotiations to deliver a federal dispensation. "Zulus want their land back, and they now lay claim to it and they will not listen to any ANC talk about anything to the contrary." Mr Buthelezi said the king's demand for a sovereign kingdom had made recent constitutional concessions "irrelevant". "They can only be seen to be treating the symptoms of the constitutional malady even within the drive for federalism. They do not address the concerns of his majesty." The Zulu people would not put themselves and their kingdom and ultimately their destiny in the hands of central government rule, said Mr Buthelezi. He added that he would stand with his ANC counterpart in an attempt to end violence, adding that social reconstruction was an absolute prerequisite for addressing township and rural fighting.
