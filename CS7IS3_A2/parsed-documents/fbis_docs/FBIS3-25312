Mr. Meir Shumer, 48, an Israeli citizen, is in police custody after appearing in the Kempton Park magistrate's court on Tuesday. Police say this is the fourth time in 18 months they have seized diamonds or gold smuggled on El Al flights from Johannesburg to Tel Aviv. Immigration records show that Mr. Shumer's arrest came on his thirteenth trip to South Africa since 1990. On most of his visits, police said, he stayed for between one and three days before returning to Israel -- almost always choosing to fly El Al. Police say El Al's Saturday-night flight appears to have become a hot favourite with professional smugglers and dishonest emigrants in spite of El Al's reputation for having the strictest security in the world. The possibility that airline staff may be colluding with smugglers has not been ruled out. Last year Reserve Bank investigators working on a R179-million fraud case were told by an informant in a sworn statement that the airline's staff were helping wealthy South Africans get their riches out of the country. Within weeks of this, Germiston diamond and gold unit detectives arrested El Al security officer Derek Joel Niss, 35, for trying to smuggle a suitcase filled with more than 670 Krugerrands into a plane cargo hold. Niss said after his conviction that he suspected a cartel of emigrating South Africans had paid him the R5,000 cash bribe he received for each coin-filled suitcase he slipped on the plane. He said he had handled about 20 consignments before his arrest. Niss's arrest was the second time police had seized gold coins destined for Israel on an El Al flight. Last February they found a suitcase containing 1,100 Krugerrands which had been checked in for transport to Tel Aviv. The owner has still not been traced. And in another diamond-smuggling case, police arrested Israeli courier Moshe Landman when he tried to board an El Al flight 18 months ago with R55,000 in diamonds hidden in one of his boots. Landman had travelled to South Africa 15 times -- mostly with El Al -- before being caught. Last Saturday police swooped on passengers travelling overseas on various airlines at Jan Smuts. Diamonds and gold unit detectives Colonel Clement Jackson and Captain Henk van Rensburg picked out Mr. Shumer from the line of passengers moving through passport control. Mr. Shumer, who claims to be a diamond consultant, was taken to a cubicle and asked to strip down to his underwear, said police. He was then arrested. Police said Mr. Shumer arrived in South Africa with his wife -- it was her first trip -- two weeks ago and the two apparently took time off to holiday in George and Cape Town. Mrs. Shumer, who was also searched, went on to Tel Aviv. Mr. Shumer was not asked to plead when he appeared in the Kempton Park magistrate's court on Tuesday. A bail hearing has been set for February 23. If convicted, Mr. Shumer faces a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment and R250,000 fine. Police says they are now obliged to carry out more frequent and more thorough searches of passengers using El Al. Explaining how smugglers were slipping past his security officers, an El Al security spokesman said the airline was mainly concerned with apprehending potential hijackers and terrorists.
