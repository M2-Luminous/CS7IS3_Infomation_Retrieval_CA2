At a press conference in Vilnius Tuesday, Butkevicius said the campaign was initiated by certain politicians who want deterioration of Lithuanian-Russian relations and seek to strike a blow to Russia's democratic forces, President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. The former minister said businessmen who are annoyed by Selma's activities are also involved in the affair. Butkevicius said other motives are even more pragmatic. He noted that in order to complete the withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuanian territory in time it was necessary to prove to the Russian military that every family would be given an apartment. But neither Lithuania nor Russia had money to build housing. The ex-minister said an agreement was reached that the money paid by Lithuania for Russian weapons would be used for the purpose. Lithuania purchased 5,000 Russian-made automatic rifles and two PT boats. Russia chose Selma to build apartments by way of contest and agreed to transfer the money to its account. Butkevicius noted that the sum paid for the weapons was enough to carry out only part of the housing project. In his words, Russia decided to find other ways of financing the project and agreed with Selma to barter oil for apartments. The former minister said a barter contract was supposed to be signed in Kaliningrad March 18, but the association's president was arrested. Butkevicius said actions of the Lithuanian prosecutor's office clearly show that the whole case is fabricated. The ex-minister said everybody, including himself, found out 10 days in advance that searches would be carried out in apartments of former and present Defense Ministry employees. There were constant leaks of information and "even if anybody had anything, nothing was kept at home," he said. In Butkevicius' opinion, an attempt is made to create tension in Lithuanian-Russian relations. "Everybody knows that an army, whose concentration in the Kaliningrad region is the biggest in Europe, can be involved in politics only through social problems." The ex-minister sharply criticized activities of Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas, MP Vytautas Petkevicius, who heads the parliament's National Security Committee, and MP Vytautas Juskus, who is the head of the parliamentary economic crimes commission. Butkevicius said he met with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius Monday and agreed to participate, if necessary, in the premier's meeting with the military and administrative leadership of the Kaliningrad region. "But when I found out that such experts as Paulauskas, Petkevicius and Juskus would take part -- I decided to hold aloof." Butkevicius categorically denied reports that the actual weapon prices considerably differed from the ones indicated in contracts. The ex-minister said he expected a scandal and has documents and contracts to deny all accusations.
