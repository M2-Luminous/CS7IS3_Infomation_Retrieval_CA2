FR940705-2-00219 FR940705-2-00091 Why is the transfer of recombinant DNA necessary for the proposed research? What questions can be answered by using recombinant DNA? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;A&hyph;2&hyph;b. What alternative methodologies exist? What are their relative advantages and disadvantages as compared to the use of recombinant DNA? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B. Research Design, Anticipated Risks and Benefits Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;1. Structure and Characteristics of the Biological System. Provide a full description of the methods and reagents to be employed for gene delivery and the rationale for their use. The following are specific points to be addressed: Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;a. What is the structure of the cloned DNA that will be used? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(1). Describe the gene (genomic or cDNA), the bacterial plasmid or phage vector, and the delivery vector (if any). Provide complete nucleotide sequence analysis or a detailed restriction enzyme map of the total construct. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(2). What regulatory elements does the construct contain (e.g., promoters, enhancers, polyadenylation sites, replication origins, etc.)? From what source are these elements derived? Summarize what is currently known about the regulatory character of each element. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(3). Describe the steps used to derive the DNA construct. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;b. What is the structure of the material that will be administered to the patient? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1). Describe the preparation, structure, and composition of the materials that will be given to the patient or used to treat the patient's cells: (i) If DNA, what is the purity (both in terms of being a single DNA species and in terms of other contaminants)? What tests have been used and what is the sensitivity of the tests? (ii) If a virus, how is it prepared from the DNA construct? In what cell is the virus grown (any special features)? What medium and serum are used? How is the virus purified? What is its structure and purity? What steps are being taken (and assays used with their sensitivity) to detect and eliminate any contaminating materials (for example, VL30 RNA, other nucleic acids, or proteins) or contaminating viruses (both replication-competent or replication-defective) or other organisms in the cells or serum used for preparation of the virus stock including any contaminants that may have biological effects? (iii) If co-cultivation is employed, what kinds of cells are being used for co-cultivation? What steps are being taken (and assays used with their sensitivity) to detect and eliminate any contaminating materials? Specifically, what tests are being conducted to assess the material to be returned to the patient for the presence of live or killed donor cells or other non-vector materials (for example, VL30 sequences) originating from those cells? (iv) If methods other than those covered by Appendices M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;b-(1)-(i) through (iii) are used to introduce new genetic information into target cells, what steps are being taken to detect and eliminate any contaminating materials? What are possible sources of contamination? What is the sensitivity of tests used to monitor contamination? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;b-(2). Describe any other material to be used in preparation of the material to be administered to the patient. For example, if a viral vector is proposed, what is the nature of the helper virus or cell line? If carrier particles are to be used, what is the nature of these? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;2. Preclinical Studies, Including Risk-Assessment Studies. Provide results that demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of the proposed procedures using animal and/or cell culture model systems, and explain why the model(s) chosen is/are most appropriate.
