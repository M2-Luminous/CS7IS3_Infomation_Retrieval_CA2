NEC has succeeded in leading the world in the formation of a practical dielectric film with an average thickness of 50 nm by a proprietary CVD method that concentrates on a technique to supply the raw material gases. In order to realize a 1 Gbit DRAM, it is indispensable to break through the barriers using new technologies that differ from the conventional in every manufacturing process. NEC's new technology is recognized to be one of these. Ordinary memory cells are configured by one transistor and one capacitor. The current technological development involves a technology that forms a dielectric film on an electrode that is a capacitor and accumulates electric charge. The charge accumulates on the surface of the electrode and the dielectric film, and a signal is stored in memory. It is difficult to maintain the volume of capacitor accumulation charges while improving the degree of DRAM integration and promoting the miniaturization of processes, and this has become a big problem. For this reason, in order to realize 1 Gbit DRAM's it is indispensable to replace conventionally used silicon oxide and nitride films and tantalum oxide films, and to establish a thin film formation technology for substances with a higher conductivity. NEC's use of strontium titanate to form a thin film is a electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) and metal oxide CVD method. Gasified strontium, titanium and oxygen are transported via separate piping, and are mixed directly before blowing them on a substrate maintained at 600Â° C. An ECR plasma of oxygen is generated during the formation of the film, and this promotes the decomposition of the raw material gases and the supply of oxygen necessary in the film. Thin films can be formed that have an even chemical composition by incorporating propriety techniques into the equipment such as supplying the three kinds of gases in a stabilized condition in separate piping, and introducing technology that controls the pressure of the titanium group gases. The characteristics of the film made by this technology have achieved practical levels for the light refractive index, for the dielectric constant and for current leaks. This shows the uniform quality of the materials. NEC already developed a thin film formation technology for strontium titanate using the physical vapor deposition method called sputtering, but it was difficult to form a film of a fixed thickness on electrodes that have a three dimensional structure. This problem can be solved by thin film formation technology using the proprietary CVD method. NEC will announce the results of its research at the American Materials Society that will convene in San Francisco. Making X-ray exposure practical is also indispensable to realizing DRAM's.
