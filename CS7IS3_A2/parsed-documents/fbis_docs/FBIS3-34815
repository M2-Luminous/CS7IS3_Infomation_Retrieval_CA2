On Alain Juppe's arrival yesterday for his first official visit there, Jerusalem celebrated the markedly improved relations the two countries have enjoyed since the new French Government came into power. Diplomacy is not immune from paradox -- and the bitter memories left by [former socialist foreign ministers] Claude Cheysson and Roland Dumas only serve to accentuate today's favorable climate. "This time we do not have to wonder what the minister is going to lecture us on," an Israeli diplomat told French correspondents yesterday. Newspapers indicate that Alain Juppe was the first French foreign minister to come to the Israeli Embassy for the Independence celebrations -- in May 1993 -- since the Six Day War. A symbolical gesture, but a welcome one. In any event, since the Oslo agreement and the beginning of the dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat, a diplomatic "slip" has become unlikely. This is something the Israelis now do very well by themselves. For instance, new Labor Party Leader Nissim Zvili [name as published] has said that a Palestinian State is an unavoidable perspective, just like that of the Golan Heights being returned to Syria. Before leaving Jordan, Alain Juppe simply stated on Israeli television that "meeting the deadlines" is a necessity if the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is to be achieved: "It is important to prevent the peace process from getting bogged down: time is not on the side of those who want peace." In Amman, as his contribution to a peace he wishes will be "extensive," the French foreign minister promised to push for a rescheduling of Jordan's debt at the meeting of Club de Paris creditors next month. Perspectives With his Israeli and Palestinian partners, Mr. Juppe will strive to lay the groundwork for France's contribution to the peace process. Already very active within multilateral negotiations, Paris has agreed to head working groups on the economy, refugees, and water-related issues. As regards infrastructure projects, French firms try to position themselves in the perspective of an actual peace. Mr. Juppe's visit takes place after the Cairo "breakthrough" on security, at a time when negotiations on the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho have resumed in Taba, Egypt. On the agenda: the Palestinian police force and issues relating to water and electricity supply, as well as telecommunications and the Palestinian radio and television, a project in which France is a partner. The Israelis hope that improved relations between the two countries will afford Mr. Juppe an opportunity to announce the lifting of the visa requirement imposed on Israeli citizens wishing to go to France since the 1986 terrorist bombings in Paris. This has not been facilitated by [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua's decision to require exit visas from Palestinians leaving France, thus putting them in the same class as Iranians, Iraqis, Afghans, or Libyans. The visit's highlight will take place tomorrow with Alain Juppe going to the Gaza strip, where he intends to visit the Chati [name as published] seaboard refugee camp. The first French foreign minister to go to Gaza, Mr. Juppe made it clear to [Police Affairs Minister] Shahal that he did not want to be escorted by jeeps. Consequently, he had to sign a letter releasing Israeli authorities from any responsibility as to his personal safety. "With the perspectives opened by the Gaza and Jericho agreement, we must show that the Gaza strip can be viable without an Israeli presence," French sources argue.
