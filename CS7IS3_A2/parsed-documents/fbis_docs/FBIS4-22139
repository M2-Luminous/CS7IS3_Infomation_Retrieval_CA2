In fact, after sending them across the Atlantic, the Provisionals used the detonators in a bombing campaign in Ulster and England, according to the BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight programme. The devices, made by a U.S. firm and allegedly bought by a Belfast man in Arizona, started turning up three years ago in an assortment of bombs. Others were found in unexploded bombs in England, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. American agents posing as arms dealers and involved in a so- called "sting" operation agreed to sell a Stinger surface-to-air missile to the man who, it is claimed, also told them of his plans to buy 2,900 detonators. Kevin McKinley was later arrested for his part in the missile sale, but the detonators were sent to Ireland, the report says. Details emerged at a trial in Tucson where four other Irishmen and two Americans face charges connected to the sale. The case is expected to end soon. According to the report, the U.S. authorities failed to keep a tail on McKinley after he unwittingly warned them of his plans to buy the detonators. Had they known they were going to be used for bombs, he probably would have been followed, one agent claimed. One of the defence lawyers at the hearing claimed the law enforcement agencies were more interested in a successful "sting" involving the missile. Bates Butler said: "Even though they had been told detonators were involved, they didn't care ... it could have been stopped."
