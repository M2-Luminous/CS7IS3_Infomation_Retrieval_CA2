FR941102-2-00027 FR941102-2-00018 [Project Nos. 2323&hyph;012; 2334&hyph;001; Deerfield River, VT, MA] New England Power Co. Western Massachusetts Electric Co.; Notice of Intention To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings October 27, 1994. The Federal Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received applications for two new licenses for the continued operation of the Deerfield River Project No. 2323, and the Gardners Falls Project No. 2334. The projects are located on the Deerfield River, in Windham and Bennington Counties, Vermont, and Franklin and Berkshire Counties, Massachusetts. The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental effects of the projects and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decisions. Scoping Meetings FERC staff will conduct three scoping meetings. The two evening scoping meetings, one each in Massachusetts and Vermont, are primarily for public input while the day-time meeting will focus on resource agency and non-governmental organization (NGO) concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. To help focus discussions, a preliminary scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed at the meeting will be distributed by mail to interested parties on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the preliminary scoping document will also be available at the scoping meetings. The times and locations of the scoping meetings are as follows: Massachusetts Public Scoping Meeting Tuesday, November 15, 1994, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Mohawk Trail Regional High School, Buckland, Massachusetts Vermont Public Scoping Meeting Wednesday, November 16, 1994, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Wilmington High School, Wilmington, Vermont Agency Scoping Meeting Thursday, November 17, 1994, 9:00 a.m. to 12 noon, New England Power Company, Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts Objectives At the scoping meetings, the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis in the planned EIS; (2) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantifiable data, on the resources at issue, (3) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EIS, including viewpoints in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views, (4) determine the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EIS, and (5) identify resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis. Procedures The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and will become part of the formal record of the Commission proceeding on the Deerfield River projects under consideration. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to sign in before the meeting starts and to clearly identify themselves for the record. Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EIS. Participants wishing to make oral comments in the public meeting are asked to keep them to five minutes to allow everyone the opportunity to speak. Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meeting. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20426. All correspondence should clearly show one or more of the following captions on the first page: Deerfield River Project No. 2323&hyph;012; and, Gardners Falls Project No. 2334&hyph;001. All those that are formally recognized by the Commission as intervenors in the Deerfield and Gardners Falls projects' proceedings are asked to refrain from engaging the staff in discussions of the merits of the projects outside of any announced meetings. Further, parties are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, which require parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name is on the official service list, including agents of the applicants.
