The message read by the hooded man, who was accompanied by another hooded Shining Path member, emphasizes the need to reach a peace agreement with President Alberto Fujimori's administration. The letter states that the Communist Party of Peru, which is Shining Path's official name, feels that because the government "has made progress in its efforts following 5 April 1992" -- the day Fujimori staged a self-inflicted coup through which he dissolved Congress and assumed total power with the support of the military, the Communist Party of Peru "has thought at length about this situation." The message adds: "The party and its Directorate must make a decision, because, if in the past we advocated a popular war, we must now reach a peace agreement." The letter points out: "All popular war activities must be suspended, except those that are defensive in nature, under the condition that the government also suspends its activities." Once this condition is met, the hooded man added, a peace agreement can be reached. A few days ago, President Fujimori said he received a third letter from Abimael Guzman, which he did not plan to divulge. He added that this letter was stored in a safe to which he alone knows the combination. In October 1993, Guzman sent two letters to Fujimori in which he also called for peace and appealed to his followers to suspend their violent activities. This appeal, however, has gone unheeded by at least one Shining Path faction. In his letters, Guzman, who was arrested on 12 September 1992 in Lima and has been sentenced to life in prison, did not say that he had surrendered.
