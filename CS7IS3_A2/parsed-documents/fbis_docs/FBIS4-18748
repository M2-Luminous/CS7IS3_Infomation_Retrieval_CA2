First, there is an appeal to UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali. On behalf of the government, the prime minister and the foreign minister reminded the UN secretary general of the urgent need to reinforce the safety of the Blue Helmets stationed in Rwanda. Mr. Butrus Ghali made remarks to that effect today. The government also expressed its concern for the safety of Belgian nationals living in Rwanda. This terse sentence follows: The government stresses that it has consequently decided on measures needed to guarantee the safety of our nationals. No further details are given. These measures can be interpreted as the protection of Belgians living in Rwanda and, most probably, an operation to evacuate them.
