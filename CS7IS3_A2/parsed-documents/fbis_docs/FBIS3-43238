He said he had seen three girls in a corner of the pub "shooting up and down into the air like puppets" as they were being gunned down with automatic rifles. SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported the unnamed witness had walked into the pub to buy cigarettes and was busy chatting when he heard sounds resembling firecrackers. "I knew they were gunshots" he said, adding he "instinctively hit the deck". "When I looked around everything was very quiet. But I heard the gunshots and I saw three girls in a corner going like puppets, shooting up and down into the air". He said people were running all over, hurrying outside, trying to get to their cars. "Why did this happen in Observatory?" He asked. "I have been all over the country and Obs is such a peaceful place, very multiracial ...Why did they attack here?" "They were young people (the victims)...They keep talking about peace, peace, peace, but that's not peace. That was sick. I can't stop thinking about those three girls. I've seen action here, there and everywhere but this was different, because it was in my home town, right here. It's not fair," the witness said.
