It is an obstacle to many things in addition to the counternarcotics effort. Anything said about corruption in Venezuela is no exaggeration." Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made those statements in Congress, where he was called to answer questions about a U.S. State Department report that corruption in Venezuela hinders the fight against drug trafficking. The interior minister clarified that he had not read the report in question and did not have any details on this specific case. He did say, however, that "corruption is a very leafy tree in Venezuela." The Legislators For his part, Gustavo Tarre Briceno, representative of the Social Christian Party and chairman of the Chamber of Deputies finance committee, said he had read that corruption hindered counternarcotics efforts just as it negatively affected any other government action. The legislator added that he had not read the State Department report, which has only appeared in the press, and thus could not comment "on a report that only mentions Venezuela in a few lines. I prefer that Venezuela be evaluated by Venezuelans." He admitted that this type of report negatively affects the government. MIN [National Integrity Movement] legislator Gonzalo Perez Hernandez said that if the U.S. Government has such information on Venezuela "it is probably true, because it is hard to believe that drug traffickers do not know the importance of politicians in quieting investigations that could take them or their representatives to jail." He added that drug traffickers promote corruption in the government security organizations to keep drug traffickers from being punished. "If the United States has the names of people and institutions at the service of drug traffickers in our countries, it should identify them to help us combat drug trafficking and the corruption it generates."
