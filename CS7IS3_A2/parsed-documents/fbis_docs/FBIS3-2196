An authoritative source from the sector said that the phenomenon showed a steady transition of the exchange rate of the currency, seen as a solid foundation for a number of measures for the restructuring of the foreign exchange administration system to be adopted. With the implementation of the unification of the exchange rate of the renminbi, the currency has a floating exchange rate decided by the market. The People's Bank of China makes public an exchange rate of the renminbi every day by making reference to the exchange rate involved in trade among banks on the previous day. The exchange rate of one U.S. dollar against RMB 8.7 has been the price seen in the swap market since the beginning of last year, meaning little fluctuation in the swap market following the practice of unifying the exchange rate of the renminbi. The foreign exchange market has proceeded normally and the price of the curency remains stable. The exchange rate of 8.7 yuan is regarded as the bottom line for the renminbi with a fluctuation rate of not more than 0.1 yuan. Before the establishment of a unified foreign exchange market among banks, swap markets for foreign exchange which are considered a transition move still play an important role across the country. Individual business entities undertaking the trade of foreign exchange, however, have withdrawn from the market while most foreign trade companies as well as import and export companies have employed a wait-and-see practice and therefore seldom take part in transactions in the market through means of brokers, resulting in a small traded volume in the foreign exchange market. Conversion of foreign exchange certificates into renminbi has returned to normal following a brief market fluctuation in the wake of a decision halting the issuance of the certificates. Stability in the market after the unification of the exchange rate of the renminbi is because such reform was line with the market economy system. There is need by the authorities for some problems arising from the new practice. Improvements should be made in order to offer sound conditions for the restructuring of the foreign exchange administration system.
