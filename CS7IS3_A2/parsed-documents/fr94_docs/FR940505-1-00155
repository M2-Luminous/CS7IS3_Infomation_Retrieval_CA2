FR940505-1-00155 FR940505-1-00012 EPA will establish in a subsequent rulemaking action a series of declining seasonal emissions allowances for NO X and VOC as described above using the modified baseline emissions inventory. Both the baseline inventory and the seasonal targets will be expressed as allowable tons of pollutant emitted on average per day during the control period. An additional concern regards the requirement for baseline inventories for installations that are closing. The DOD working group further recommended that inventories not be required for bases closing before 2000. Emission sources are already being phased out and there would be no benefit derived from funding such inventories in terms of helping to design emission control strategies for those bases. On the other hand, the estimates of emissions eliminated by base closures will affect the effective stringency of a declining cap program if the baseline for the cap was prior to closure since there will be credit for base closings. ( c ) Averaging and Trading. EPA proposes to determine compliance for military air base operations by averaging emissions across the control area, rather than establishing specific seasonal emission limits for individual air bases. Such a control strategy would provide the military with the flexibility to transfer operations between air bases as needed to meet realignment requirements or other specific mission needs, as long as the overall emissions reduction target is met. Alternatively, the Agency could establish seasonal emission allowances for each military air base in the control area. EPA requests comment on the desirability of using area-wide averaging to determine military compliance, and on possible alternative compliance determination schemes. The Agency also requests comment on the inclusion of military air base operations in any civilian emission credit trading scheme if such a program is established by a local government. Such an expansion could provide the Department of Defense with additional incentive to implement emission reduction measures that generate tradable credits, or provide a mechanism for obtaining credits from other sources to ensure compliance should unforeseen difficulties arise. (See the discussion of averaging and trading for commercial aviation for more detail of this topic.) Several of the military air installations in the FIP areas have already been identified for closure (Table F), and military operations will cease at the identified bases prior to the year 2000. These reductions do not even consider BRAC 95 which could result in further reductions. The DOD Working Group recommends that any emission reductions resulting from closure or realignment should be credited to the Military Department. These credits would then be available for transfer by the Military Department as part of the President's five point plan for community redevelopment at closing bases and/or to meet service Department needs within the specific FIP areas. ( d ) Annual Compliance Determination. Beginning in 1999, military air bases will be required to submit annual emissions reports as described below. The total military emissions inventory from subject mobile sources at all air bases in the area will be compared to the given year's seasonal emissions target to determine compliance with the FIP requirements. ( e ) Reporting and recordkeeping. (i) Compliance Plans. The stationary source cap program includes a requirement for affected sources to submit compliance plans that describe planned emission reduction measures. EPA could establish a similar requirement for military air bases as part of today's proposed control strategy. Such compliance plans would be submitted by Department of Defense in advance of the control period and would describe in some detail the various emission reduction measures planned for air base operations in the control areas. Compliance plans would impose a significant administrative burden on EPA and the Department of Defense, however. EPA therefore requests comment on the desirability of requiring compliance plans, and on the information that should be provided should they be required. EPA does not contemplate that these plans, if required, would legally bind the military, since that would impede flexibility and is not essential to the effectiveness of the program. However, any deliberate misrepresentation in the compliance plan may be made a violation of the FIP.
