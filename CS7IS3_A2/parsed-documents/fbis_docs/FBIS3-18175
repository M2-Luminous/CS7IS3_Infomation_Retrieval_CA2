Cetin also indicated that initiatives regarding this issue are under way at the UN Security Council. Concluding his two-day official visit to the Netherlands, Cetin returned to the country tonight. In a statement he issued at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin said that various issues were discussed and assessed with the Dutch officials, adding that he believes this visit will contribute to further relations between the two countries. Expressing the concern that unless necessary measures are taken against the terrorism perpetrated by the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization, terrorism could spread to other areas in Europe, Cetin stated that the Dutch authorities indicated that they are undertaking great efforts regarding both terrorism and xenophobia. Noting that in the course of the meetings he pointed out to Turkey's determination to join the Customs Union, Cetin noted that for a long time now, the EC had not undertaken any financial contributions in that direction. Cetin further explained that assessments and discussions were conducted with the Dutch authorities on alternate ways and means of obtaining financial support for Turkey on its joining the Customs Union, since the lack of financial assistance on the part of the EC meant that the European Unity was not fulfilling its requirements toward Turkey. Cetin also pointed out that during the meetings they stressed the advantages of the integration of Turks into the Netherlands community while retaining their cultural identity.
