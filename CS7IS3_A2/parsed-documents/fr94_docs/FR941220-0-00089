FR941220-0-00089 FR941220-0-00014 b. Payment of wages; deductions from wages (See ยง XXXX .731 (c).) At several stages in the rulemaking process, the Department has addressed the issue of what constitutes the payment of wages for purposes of an employer satisfying the required wage obligation under the H&hyph;1B program. This matter was discussed in some detail in the Preambles to the January 13, 1992, Interim Final Rule (57 FR 1316, 1322) and the October 6, 1993, Proposed Rule (58 FR 52152, 52154). The rulemaking has also dealt with the related issue of guidelines or standards for allowable deductions from employee wages under the program. Based on careful consideration of the comments, the legislative intent, and extensive program experience, the Department in the Final Rule is adopting a ``bright line'' test for ``payment of wages,'' coupled with a three-part standard for authorized deductions. Taken together, these standards enable employers to determine, with certainty, their obligations and options, assure employees will be afforded their rights under the law, and better enable the Department, in its enforcement proceedings, to identify violations, while leaving bona fide, valid pay practices unhampered. The principal focal point in the rulemaking, with regard to payment of wages, has been the matter of whether ``in-kind'' perquisites or direct or indirect payments other than cash constitute wages. On this point, the Department has taken the position in the interim final and the Proposed Rule, as well as in the administration and enforcement of the program, that such wage credit is not permitted. However, in the Preamble to the Interim Final Rule, the Department set out possible standards for wage credit, and invited comments as to the appropriateness of these, or some other, tests. A total of 39 commenters on the interim final and the Proposed Rule responded to this point. Six of these submitted comments to both Rules, with two of the six modifying their views in their second comments. Eight of the 39 commenters (including the AFL&hyph;CIO) suggested that the Department should not permit any in-kind wage credit. The other 31 commenters urged the Department to permit such wage credit. While none of these commenters endorsed the tests set out in the Interim Final Rule's Preamble, several of them suggested that the regulatory standard should be a flexible test that would take into account the peculiarities of the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants ( e.g., family relocation expenses). Several others (including Senators Alan K. Simpson and David Durenberger) suggested that the regulatory standard should focus on the employer's actual costs in employing the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant, as well as on the comparative costs of employing such a worker and a U.S. worker. Seven of the 39 commenters (including a multinational computer software company, a multinational pharmaceutical company, a national association of computer businesses, and a national association on international personnel concerns) suggested that, as a regulatory standard, the Department should permit the employer to credit as wages any payment or perquisite which is reported to the Internal Revenue Service as the employee's wages. The Department has considered carefully all the comments, and has found many of them persuasive and helpful with regard to appropriate regulatory standards. In addition, the Department has reviewed thoroughly the information obtained through administration and enforcement of the program regarding various pay practices and expenditures in the employment of nonimmigrants in the U.S. Based on these considerations and review, the Department has concluded that, in determining the ``wages paid'' for purposes of the employer's satisfaction of the H&hyph;1B required wage, it is not necessary or appropriate to focus on the issue of in-kind wages. Instead, the Department has concluded the regulatory standard should consider the broader picture of compensation to employees and costs to employers in the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants. Further, in the Department's view, the regulation should provide a practical, predictable, and somewhat flexible standard, so that the regulated community, as well as the Department, can act with confidence in assuring compliance with the Act's requirements. Thus, the Department is promulgating a Final Rule which modifies the NPRM provision to create a less burdensome, more effective, ``bright line'' test for ``wages paid.'' Under this test, any compensation which is treated as the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant employee's earnings for income tax and FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act_social security tax) proposes will be considered to be wages paid for purposes of the H&hyph;1B program. Amounts to be treated as ``wages paid'' shall be paid to the employee free and clear when due, except that certain deductions from wages may be made by the employer in accordance with the restrictions set forth in the regulation and discussed below. In order to claim such ``wages paid,'' the employer shall document that all required earnings reports have been filed and withholdings (including the employer's FICA tax) have been paid to appropriate governmental entities, in accordance with applicable laws (including any payments in the employee's home country pursuant to any totalization arrangement between the social security systems of the U.S. and such home country, as authorized by section 233 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 433). The wages of salaried employees are due in pro-rata installments, except that some limited flexibility with regard to pro rata installments is provided for the employer which clearly documents the use of supplemental payments (such as quarterly bonuses) as described in the regulation.
