Before that this "bully," who had been insufferably arrogant in the past, already knew that he had become a target in the anticorruption drive and that he could hardly escape. Before he met his fate, however, there were two regrettable things: First, he did not have time to enjoy his three bottles of Louis XIII (each bottle of this wine is worth 6,700 yuan). Second, he never got to stay in a presidential suite at Guangzhou's White Swan Hotel. He would have spent several thousand yuan enjoying it had he had the opportunity.... Hong Yonglin departed for another world with too many "regrets," but his execution has left room for reflection, because he was not the "black sheep" that the CPC propaganda machine described him to be, but the epitome of corruption and degeneration in the whole body of public security organs. Corruption in the public security organs has not only aroused the people's call for overhauling them but also drawn the attention of the senior CPC authorities to the seriousness of the matter. In mid-November 1993, the NPC Standing Committee received a joint letter addressed to Qiao Shi and Li Peng by more than 20 important members urging for the overhaul of the public security organs and for holding them accountable for "unhealthy tendencies." They urged the dismissal of Public Security Minister Tao Siju. This was the second time the NPC Standing Committee made such a request. What on earth is behind the "public anger" toward the public security minister and the public security organs? To understand this, let us begin with the relevant instructions given by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi. Strongly Worded Instructions by Jiang, Li, and Qiao On 8 November, Jiang Zemin gave these instructions: The problems in public security organs are very salient. Their personnel and organization are very loose and their discipline and systems very disorganized. This can no longer be tolerated and must be handled and overhauled as a major project by the local party committees. One can see the seriousness of the matter when Jiang Zemin described the lawlessness among public security organs with such adjectives as "very salient," "very loose," and "very disorganized" and when he asserted that the situation can no longer be tolerated. Li Peng's instructions, however, illustrated the popular anger at the law-enforcement organizations' knowing violation of the law when he said: "The public security organs are the state's law- enforcement organs. The present situation has led to strong dissatisfaction within and outside the party. This must be changed radically, and the role of the state's law-enforcement organs should be brought into full play." Qiao Shi, long in charge of procuratorial and judicial work, gave very specific instructions when he said: "The situation of some public security organs and leading groups is very serious. The investigation teams and stationary teams sent to the basic units should rely on their local party committees and on the policemen of public security organs to quickly change the current passivity. Those who should be dismissed should be dismissed; those who should be transferred should be transferred; those who should be coped with should be coped with, and those who should be punished should be punished in accordance with the law." This trouble has been brewing for quite some time. The deterioration of the public security contingent has long been a knotty problem for the CPC. Recently, the central authorities even organized "working teams," "investigation teams," and "stationary teams" to tackle the serious problems in the public security organs. In fact, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi made the above instructions in light of the preliminary investigations of these working teams. The Working Teams Are Threatened With "Death" This time, the overhaul embraces a wide scope unseen in recent years. It stretches to every level from the center to localities. On 11 November, the State Council General Office, the Ministry of Supervision, various organs, and various ministries and commissions and offices sent 35 investigation teams and stationary teams to the public security departments (bureaus) of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions and to the public security bureaus of some key special zones. This was followed by the 270 or more working teams and investigation teams or stationary teams sent on 15 November to the public security bureaus of various prefectures, cities, and autonomous prefectures. Nevertheless, the investigations met strong resistance. It reportedly happened in Shaanxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Hainan, and Hunan that the central investigation teams or stationary teams were confronted and threatened. It even happened that anonymous letters containing "death" threats were received in Shaanxi. The gravity of the problem can be understood from a piece of statistical information issued by the Ministry of Public Security--out of the public security departments (bureaus) at the provincial level across China, 22 public security departments (bureaus) have had their party committee leaders reshuffled or readjusted; 47 vice department (bureau) heads have either been dismissed, transferred, or persuaded to retire; and over 180 sectional cadres have either been dismissed, transferred, or persuaded to retire. The Serious Damage Lies in the Fact That the Law-Enforcement Organs Break the Law Figures released internally by the State Council General Office and public security organs have revealed the "internal scandal" of the public security organs: In 1992, the relevant quarters received over 32,300 reports and complaints about the misdeeds of public security organs and public security personnel. Between January and October 1993, the number of such reports and complaints reached over 27,600. Over 70 percent of the reports and complaints concerned breaches of the law, racketeering, and blackmail. In addition, over 830 serious homicides were caused in 1992 as a result of public security departments breaking the law and closing their eyes to national laws. In 1992, 1.86 percent of public security personnel received party discipline or administrative punishment, 0.97 percent were prosecuted, and over 72,500 were transferred or had their names expunged. They Got Their Jobs Through Improper Means Many factors contribute to the poor quality of the CPC's public security contingent, of which a very important one is that the new public security recruits are of poor quality. The reason that they are of such low quality is that some unemployed young people or former young prisoners have been used to fill the police ranks as an expedient means of livelihood, whereas many good young people -- taking into consideration the bad image of the "cops" -- do not want to join the force. Even worse, many of them have joined the police force through improper means such as utilizing connections. Obviously, they have joined in order to hide their infamous past. According to GONGAN TONGXUN [Public Security Newsletter] published by the Ministry of Public Security, the Guangdong Public Security Department recently organized a task force to investigate the new recruits of the public security organs in the special economic zones and coastal areas. They found that over 60 percent of the new recruits had previously been unemployed or idle young people; over 40 percent had had medium poor or poor character at school; and over 20 percent had engaged in gang fighting, theft, hooliganism, and the like. Moreover, they found that the 65 percent of formerly unemployed or idle young people had joined public security organs without going the through normal examination process. The Anhui Provincial Public Security Department's findings were even more startling. With the help of the central and provincial party committee's investigation teams, they conducted investigations of the personnel of the public security organs in the cities of Huainan, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Maanshan, and Huaibei. They found that over 85 percent of the personnel recruited since the fall of 1990 were formerly unemployed or idle young people and that 20 percent were rural young people who had only finished the first year of their secondary education and had joined the police force through unusual connections. After rechecking them, they found that over 36 percent of the new recruits had either been punished for criminal activities or had received administrative warnings. Public security organs have their own records: By examining the sources of public security personnel in over 600 large, medium, and small cities, between 1986 and 1989, we can see that 12 percent graduated from public security and police academies, 22 percent were demobilized and retired servicemen, 30 percent were young people from industrial and mining establishments, and 36 percent were formerly unemployed young people. Excepting those in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shandong, the recruits had only finished the first year of their secondary education. Since 1990, 14 percent of the recruits have graduated from public security or police academies, 19 percent have been demobilized and retired servicemen, 26 percent have been young people from industrial and mining establishments, and 41 percent have been unemployed young people. Except for those in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, and Liaoning, recruits have, on average, finished the second year of their secondary education. Eighty Percent of the People Are Dissatisfied With the Public Security Personnel The CPC's propaganda machine describes the public security personnel as guards "defending the dignity of the motherland." Unfortunately, their lofty image is no longer popular in society today. In public opinion polls, policemen are often the most unwelcome individuals. On 23 November, the State Statistical Bureau empowered 16 large and medium cities in Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hebei to conduct a large-scale public opinion poll. Regarding the situation of public security organs and public security personnel, they interviewed over 15,000 people, including party and government cadres, intellectuals, staff and workers, students, and housewives. They found that 73 percent of the interviewees were dissatisfied with the practice and work performance of the public security organs, 8 percent were extremely dissatisfied, and only 19 percent were satisfied. It does not help change the bad image of public security personnel in the eyes of the people to merely depend on instructions from the central authorities, on overhauling leading groups, or on shooting a few people, because the question of the public security organs concerns the overall CPC structure. Public security personnel wearing hats with the national emblem are not above the common man. They have already lost their sense of values in pursuit of money and luxury. Shielded by the one-party dictatorship, their power has become the best weapon in the service of graft and corruption. Law enforcement personnel who break the law and are corrupt and degenerate are the product of the rule by man in the CPC.
