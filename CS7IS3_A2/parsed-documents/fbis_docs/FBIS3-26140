Autonomous regional leaders Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Wang Lequan, and Keyum Bawundun attended the conference. In 1993, our region reaped bumper harvests in agriculture, registered industrial growth, enjoyed booming market activity, conducted brisk border trade, increased financial revenue, improved living standards, and achieved initial success in implementing central macroeconomic regulatory and control measures. By and large, Xinjiang enjoyed good financial order and economic operations. Nevertheless, secondary and tertiary industries, which are primarily based on village and town enterprises, still constituted a small proportion of the economy. Although industrial production developed well, the general level of economic efficiency in enterprises remained low. The general guiding thought for our region's economic work and trade in 1994 is: Earnestly implementing the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Sixth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Xinjiang Autonomous Regional Party Committee, turning reform into a driving force, focusing on development, exploiting resources, optimizing the economic structure, opening wider to the outside world, improving economic efficiency, and promoting rapid development of Xinjiang's economy based on high efficiency. This year, we should expedite the pace of deepening reform in state-run enterprises, further improve large and medium enterprises, vigorously advance tehnological progress in enterprises, and further improve quality control. We should also accelerate the development of village and town enterprises, nurture new economic growth sectors, accelerate economic and market development, increase commercial and trade flows, tighten and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, and coordinate work in all aspects of economic operations.
