A few days ago the head of the cabinet appealed to the Duma to urgently adopt the law "On Changing, Suspending, and Nullifying Some Legislative Acts." It is proposed that the operation of a number of articles of 14 laws and 5 decrees adopted by the Supreme Soviet, which establish numerous privileges and monetary compensations for various categories of individuals, that is, tax police workers, judges, procurators, donors, athletes, servicemen, Chernobyl residents, victims of illegal repressions, and so forth, be abolished "for the period until the deficit level reaches 5 percent." For the purpose of saving budget funds, the government proposes that those that suffered from the Chernobyl accident be squeezed "with respect to the receipt of an interest-free loan" and the pardoned "enemies of the people" be deprived of the "right to free passage on railroad and city transport and the right to a 50-percent reduction in the amounts of payment for living space and municipal services." According to the prime minister's estimates, by abolishing the indicated privileges and compensations, the state will save 90 trillion rubles, which will greatly improve the financial situation. Warding off possible suspicions of a negative attitude toward the acts of the former parliament, the cabinet of ministers also abolishes 37 of its own decrees, denying tax indulgences and subsidies to a number of sectors, subjects of the Federation, and mass information media. Moreover, the government proposed that 12 presidential edicts, in which the head of the state promised much to various citizens, sectors, and regions, be abolished. Although the prime minister did not spare the pride of both branches of power, his proposals irritated many Duma members. Vladimir Isakov announced that "responsibility for the nonfulfillment of Yeltsin's high-sounding promises made on the eve of the elections and the referendum on the Constitution is shifted to the Duma." Fractions of communists and agrarians became indignant and decided not to support such an "anti-popular" budget. Nikolay Petrakov, a Yabloko member, called all this a "farce." Most of all, parliament members were offended by the fact that, apparently, the government had already excluded from the draft budget all the expenditures specified by documents, which were still to be abolished. The Duma, discussing and approving the budget "in the main," naturally, did not know the above. The Explanatory Note on Expenditures on the Maintenance of Bodies of Power also surprised deputies. In all, a little over 7 trillion rubles are to be spent on this matter. Out of this sum 154.6 billion are allocated to the Federal Assembly. The parliament values itself slightly more, in connection with which the government note states: "According to the data of the Administration of Affairs of the Russian Federation President, the implementation of the Law on the Status of a Deputy will additionally require 172.8 billion rubles," a sum which the government did not take into account in the draft budget, because appropriate calculations were late. This explanation did not comfort deputies at all. Moreover, they noted with malicious pleasure that the president's Administration of Affairs managed to assign all 400 billion rubles for its own needs. Individual Duma members assume that expenditures on one department of the president's administration cannot exceed twofold expenditures on both chambers of the federal parliament. Be that as it may, new circumstances, which have become known after the official introduction of the draft budget in the Duma, threaten to complicate the procedure of its approval. The process can drag out until the summer, or maybe until the fall. Next the rejection of the budget by the Federation Council and even a presidential "veto" are possible, if deputies do not take all government wishes into account. However, this will only be good for executive power: All these months the government will live according to a budget, which it "approved" for itself. At the end of the year it is too late and pointless to rectify or refine anything.
