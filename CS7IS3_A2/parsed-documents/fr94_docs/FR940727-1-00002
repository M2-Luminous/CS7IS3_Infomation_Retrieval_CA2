FR940727-1-00002 FR940727-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 58 [DA&hyph;93&hyph;18] Grading and Inspection, General Specifications for Approved Plants and Standards for Grades of Dairy Products; General Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading Service AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes to amend the General Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading Service (General Specifications). The proposed changes would revise the requirements for anhydrous milkfat to allow butter to be used as an ingredient and would revise the requirements for butteroil to allow the addition of safe and suitable antioxidants. The proposal to allow the use of butter was initiated at the request of the American Butter Institute. DATES: Comments should be filed by September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to: Director, Dairy Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 2968&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. They will be made available for public inspection at the Dairy Division in Room 2750&hyph;S during regular business hours. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Duane R. Spomer, Chief, Dairy Standardization Branch, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Room 2750&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 720&hyph;7473. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. The proposed rule also has been reviewed in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq . The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has determined that this proposed rule, if promulgated, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because participation in the USDA-approved plant program is voluntary and the amendments would not increase the costs to those utilizing the program. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. The General Specifications, established in 1975, do not provide for butter to be used in making anhydrous milkfat in USDA-approved dairy plants. This is inconsistent with international standards that allow butter to be used in anhydrous milkfat. The General Specifications also do not provide for the addition of antioxidants to butteroil, which also is permitted in international standards. These restrictions have placed the domestic manufacturer at a disadvantage when competing in the world market.
