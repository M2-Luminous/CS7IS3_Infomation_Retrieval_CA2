FR940114-2-00123 FR940114-2-00072 [Finance Docket No. 32439] Summit View Corp._Continuance in Control Exemption_The Warren & Trumbull Railroad Co. Summit View Corporation (Summit), a noncarrier holding company, has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of the Warren & Trumbull Railroad Company (WTRM), upon WTRM becoming a class III rail carrier. WTRM has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in The Warren & Trumbull Railroad Company_Operation Exemption_Rail Line in Trumbull County, OH, Finance Docket No. 32438, to operate over 5.28 miles of rail line under contract with the Mahoning Valley Economic Development Rail Corporation (EDRC). The parties intend to consummate the transaction on or soon after the effective date of the exemption. Summit controls three other nonconnecting class III rail carriers operating in Ohio: Ohio Central Railroad, Inc., Ohio Southern Railroad, Inc. and the Youngstown & Austintown Railroad, Inc. Summit states that: (1) The properties operated by these four carriers do not connect with each other; (2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of transactions that would connect the four railroads with each other or any other railroad currently controlled by Summit; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. Therefore, the transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed by with the Commission and served on: Kelvin J. Dowd, Esq., Slover & Loftus, 1224 Seventeenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036. Decided: January 7, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1015 Filed 1&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
