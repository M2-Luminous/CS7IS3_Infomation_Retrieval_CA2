Srivastava, director (bulk carriers and tankers), Shipping Corporation of India, told a seminar here on Wednesday. It was revealed at the seminar, organised by Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda), a leading P&I (protection and indemnity) Club, and Crowe Boda and Co, its Indian correspondents, that the U.S. has rejected the international conventions and their protocols and had its own pollution legislation--the Oil Pollution Act. Referring to the U.S. legislation, Mr. Srivastava said such laws, if they are not reality-based, would act as disincentive. As the issue had become highly emotive, all protests about the perceived imbalance between the degree of the ship-generated pollution and the draconian nature of the law were proving to be a cry in the wilderness. There has also been concern that the ready availability of ever-increasing compensation funds for marine pollution tends to instil a sense of complacency within the operational sector of the shipping industry, according to him. The P&I Clubs had a role in mitigating the problem as pollution related claims, not only accounted for a sizeable part of the total P&I claims but also because the wide publicity that is being given to the incidents of pollution affected the professional image of the shipping industry, he said. The clubs cover claims against their members for loss damage and expense arising from pollution caused by an escape or discharge of oil from their vessels including fines, up to a limit, at present, of $500 million per accident or occurrence. Dr. I.C. White, managing director of the International Tanker Owners' Pollution Federation, the UK, gave details about the federation's computerised oil spill response database and said it also provided practical information on oil spill response techniques. He said the incidence of oil spills greater than 5,000 barrels (about 700 tonnes) from vessels had come down from an average a year in the 1970's to nine in 1980's, spills of the size resulting from recent accidents involving the Nagasaki Spirit, Aegean Sea, Braer and Maersk Navigator being exceptional. The ``entry into force'' provisions of the conventions and their protocols have, therefore, been amended so that they will take effect without the U.S. support. One of them is the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 (CLC) and the other International Convention on the establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971 (the Fund Convention), established to provide additional compensation in cases where the damage claims exceeded the shipowners' liability under the CLC or where the case fell within one of the exceptions of defences under the CLC. CLC is funded by the tanker owners through their insurers, where the Fund Convention is funded by contributions levied on crude and fuel oil cargo receivers who get more than 15,000 million tonnes of oil by sea in any one year. The main amendments to them adopted by the protocols have increased the limits of liability under CLC and Fund Convention, taken into account not only actual pollution but also pure threat situations, extended the geographical scope of the conventions and amended the definition of pollution. The CLC is now applied in 79 countries, excluding the U.S., and 56 of them have adopted the Fund convention. The protocols have yet to come into force. Anticipating delays in the ratification of international conventions, the tanker and oil industries established voluntary agreements such as Tanker Owners' Voluntary Agreement Concerning Liability for Oil Pollution (TOVALOP), supported by P&I clubs, who are insurers of the tanker industry, and Contract Regarding a Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution (CRISTAL), an agreement between oil companies anticipating the coming into force of the Fund Convention. Limits of liability which apply under CLC and the Fund are exceeded by the limits under the voluntary schemes as the voluntary schemes have moved ahead of the international conventions.
