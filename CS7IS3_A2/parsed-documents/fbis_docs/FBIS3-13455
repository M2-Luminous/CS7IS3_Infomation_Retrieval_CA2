Ahmad al-Jabir categorically denied reports that the detention of some Kuwaiti fishermen by Iranian coastal guards has dampened bilateral relations . "I do not know from where you come with these false information," Ahmad al-Jabir replied to the AL-MAJALLAH correspondent when he alleged that Tehran-Kuwait relations are "disturbed" because of the arrest of "many" Kuwaiti fishermen by Iranian border guards. "Concerning the problem of the Kuwaiti fishermen and the detention of some of them by Iranian coastal guards, this is due to the interlocking of the territorial waters of the two countries. "Officials of both countries are now taking practical steps to avoid such problems in the future which I do not think disturb the good and growing relations between the two countries and their two friendly peoples," the Kuwaiti foreign minister added. In the interview published in last week's issue of the Arab magazine, Ahmad al-Jabir said Kuwait continues to support the just struggle of the Palestinian people "despite the position of its leadership."
