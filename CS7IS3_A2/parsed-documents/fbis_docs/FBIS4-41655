Service head Sergey Stepashin arrived in Kishinev today on an official visit. The treaty provides for information exchange and interaction of the Russian and Moldovan secret services against terrorism, contraband, illicit arms sales, drug trafficking. The two services will also prevent attempts of citizens of third states to use Russian and Moldovan territories for illegal transit. The sides take an obligation not to carry out force or subversive actions against each other. In the words of Calmoi, Moldova and Russia have signed similar agreements with the Ukrainian Secret Service. The treaty is another proof that Russian secret services plan no subversive actions against Kishinev, a representative of the Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service's delegation told ITAR-TASS. Russia keeps to unconditional recognition of independence and territorial integrity of Moldova. Speaking of the Trans-Dniester problem, the official said it "should be settled only peacefully and the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service will help it with all legal means." Stepashin and Calmoi will leave for the Trans-Dniester region on Saturday to visit Russian troops stationed in the area.
