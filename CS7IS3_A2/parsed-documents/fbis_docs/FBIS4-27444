FBIS4-27444 "dreas106__a94031" FBIS-EAS-94-106-A Daily Report 23 May 1994 ANNEX Japan MPT Backs Tests of New Fiber Optic Circuits MPT Backs Tests of New Fiber Optic Circuits 942A0269A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 23 May 94 Evening Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0269A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] will sponsor experiments on the nation's first high-volume optical fiber circuit. A research council will be established with representation from private computer and communications-related firms such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), NEC and Japan IBM to engage in the development of technology to operate and utilize optical fiber circuits that have a capacity about 100 times that of high-speed communications networks currently in operation. The council will establish technology designed to build a foundation for a multimedia firm to integrate broadcasting and communications and will embrace the goal of catching up with the United States which currently leads in the move toward such a system. The research council, which will operate under the sponsorship of the MPT is called "G (the first letter of the communications measurement unit, gigabit) Net Association." The general meeting to inaugurate the council will be held in the first part of June and, besides the three firms mentioned above, will be attended by Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), NHK [Japan Broadcasting Corporation], Fujitsu, Hitachi, Japan Digital Equipment, Japan Sun Microsystems, and Japan Cray. Experiments are scheduled to begin in September 1994. NTT will link 10 cities, including Tokyo and Osaka, throughout the nation with optical fiber cables capable of transmitting data at the rate of 156 megabits per second and offer their use free of charge for the experiments. Firms participating in the experiments will link their firms' research facilities with such cables and conduct tests in the area of computer networks, television conferences, and remote medical services. The Telecommunications Council, an advisory organ of the MPT, will complete a report providing a blueprint for the construction of an information infrastructure designed for a sophisticated information society of the 21st century. The MOPT will consider the G-Net Association experiments as a precursor of the type of pioneering experimental projects sought by the report and intends to offer low-interest loans in support of such projects. Since 1990, the United States has established a National Research and Education Network (NREN) plan as one phase of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). Already feasibility experiments have been initiated at five sites throughout the United States. NREN's budget for fiscal year 1994 totaled about $170 million. MPT plans to develop the G-Net Association project into a rival of the NREN plan.
