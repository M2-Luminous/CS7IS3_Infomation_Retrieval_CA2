The decision, adopted by the Slovenian government at a session on January 13, means that Slovenia no longer pays its outstanding liabilities directly to the account of Commercial Banks in New York, but instead accumulates the money in its special account. The government decided to take this step following the unsuccessful negotiations with the Consortium. The Consortium was not prepared to accept Slovenia's proposal to pay off 16.4 percent (US $500 million) of the total former Yugoslavia's US $4,200 million debt. While other financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club, were in favour of the assessed 16.4 percent Slovenian share in the total Yugoslav debt, the Consortium insisted on the solidarity clause, to which the former Yugoslav republics bound themselves when they took out the loans. The Consortium insists that Slovenia should pay off $1,200 million, which is 28 percent of the joint Yugoslav debt. Slovenia will be channeling the money, intended for repaying outstanding liabilities to the Consortium of Commercial Banks, to its special account in Luxembourg until the two parties reach an agreement.
