The scandal erupted after interior troops were sent close to the building where the parliamentary session is going on late on Thursday. Lawmaker Ivan Gerasyuk asked the parliament to clear up on whose orders the troops arrived. "Without naming the concrete people who gave the order it is impossible to continue the work of the session," he said. Parliament Speaker Stanislav Shushkevich said that troops appeared in full combat readiness in downtown city and this could have been sanctioned only by the prime minister. Shushkevich also informed that he had called Interior Minister Vladimir Yegorov and instructed him that his first deputy -- interior troops Commander Konstantin Platonov -- appears in parliament. Shushkevich recalled that when the current parliamentary session began interior and reinforced police units appeared on Independence Square as well. This time the troops appeared after two days of parliamentary discussions about who allowed Lithuanian police to arrest two communist leaders of Lithuania on the territory of independent Belarus. Mikolas Burokiavicius and Yuozas Jarmalavicius arrived in Minsk for a secret meeting of communist leaders of the three Baltic states, were arrested by Lithuanian police and taken to Vilnius.
