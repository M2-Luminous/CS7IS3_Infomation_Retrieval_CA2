The date for this state visit has not yet been established. Menem extended this promise to PRC Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu during a meeting they had yesterday on the occasion of the latter's visit to Argentina. According to the Foreign Ministry's tentative program, Menem will travel to the PRC this year as part of a tour that would also include the ROK. Sources close to the Foreign Ministry told CLARIN that a final confirmation of this trip is still pending. Liu, a career diplomat specialized in Latin American affairs, was accompanied to the meeting with Menem by PRC Ambassador to Argentina Tang Yonggui and Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, among other officials.
