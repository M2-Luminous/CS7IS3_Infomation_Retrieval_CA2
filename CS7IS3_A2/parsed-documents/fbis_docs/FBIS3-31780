But [UNPROFOR spokesman] Aikman presented reporters Wednesday with a long list of weapons sites still being investigated. He also said a reported mortar attack in Sarajevo Tuesday was under investigation. Aikman said there was a "surprising" amount of Serb heavy weapons still left in "every location imaginable" around Sarajevo. The problem was that "a lot of these positions are in deep snow, ice, in rugged terrain," he said. He said some artillery was literally "frozen in position" and could not be pulled out until there was a thaw. But he said this did not mean Serb troops besieging Sarajevo were not complying with the ultimatum since Sarajevo was no longer being shelled. Air reconnaissance, including helicopters, had over the past 48 hours found 66 sites. Twelve of these were non-weapons, 42 turned out to be either abandoned or non-weapons sites, at one there was an inoperable weapon, one was still to be verified and 10 of the sites were taken over by UN troops. UN ground patrols were dealing with 55 sites, of which 23 were abandoned or non-weapons, two had inoperable weapons, four had weapons which patrols would have to neutralize, nine were taken over by UNPROFOR, eight were large collection centers and nine were yet to be verified. This left a total of 12 sites where weapons were still to be checked, Aikman said. He also said Serb soldiers had come to two of the weapons collection sites asking to retrieve the artillery they had surrendered in order to take it out of the 20-kilometres (12-mile) exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital. He said they came in vehicles to load up the guns but were turned back by UN soldiers. There was no violence. He identified one site as at Krivoglavci, just northwest of Sarajevo, but did not name the second site. Aikman also said UNPROFOR was investigating a reported mortar shelling of Sarajevo. The Bosnian Army said an 82-mm mortar shell hit the Brekin Potok neighborhood in northeast Sarajevo at about 9 PM (0800 GMT) [times as received] Tuesday. Aikman said that if confirmed this attack on the front-line that runs in and around the city "would cause some action (by UNPROFOR or NATO) but what action it would be I don't know." Meanwhile, there was fighting in another Bosnian hotspot, Tuzla. Aikman said nine shells fell there, two very close to the airfield that NATO has said is to be opened to humanitarian flights on March 7. Serb forces and Serbia oppose reopening this airport. In Zagreb, UNPROFOR said a French UN unit was to be deployed Wednesday around a bridge on the border between Croatia and Bosnia blocked by about 100 secessionist Serbs for almost a week. Two contingents of UN troops, comprising Jordanians and Argentines, were placed on alert Tuesday because of mounting tension at the site. About 100 Serb police and soldiers have held the bridge over the River Sava since they overpowered a UN control post manned by Nepalese troops on Friday. [passage omitted]
