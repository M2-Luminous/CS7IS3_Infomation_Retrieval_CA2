"I resolve, before signing a Russian-Estonian border treaty, to unilaterally mark the Estonian section of the Russian state border where it existed on the moment when the Russian Federation recognised the sovereingty of the Estonian Republic on August 24, 1991," said the decree received by TASS on Tuesday. The decision was adopted "to protect Russian political and economic interests" and also because "of the negative attitude" of Estonia to bilateral demarcation of the border. Estonia claims some bordering Russian territories.
