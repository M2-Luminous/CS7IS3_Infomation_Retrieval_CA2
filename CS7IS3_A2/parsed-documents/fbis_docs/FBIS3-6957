The government's North Korea policy was finally pushed into a hard-line corner by the aggressive and crude remarks made by the chief North Korean delegate to an inter-Korean working-level contact last Saturday, when he threatened war against the South. Realizing the futility of efforts to persuade Pyongyang to accept full IAEA inspections and help resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue, officials at Chongwadae [presidential office] and national security-related ministries huddled to discuss countermeasures against further North Korean provocation. President Kim Yong-sam said Tuesday his government has asked the United States to deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles across the country as soon as possible. South Korea and the United States have also agreed in principle to resume their joint military exercise "Team Spirit" this year. President Kim said a final decision on the war games will be made after he visits Japan and China. Kim disclosed these plans at a meeting of senior Democratic Liberal Party officials including Chairman Kim Chong-pil and four party postholders. Almost at the same time, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae met with U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney and the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, Gen. Gary Luck, to discuss the deployment of Patriot missiles here and the Team Spirit exercise. Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs Chong Chong-uk noted, "There has been nearly no change in North Korea's attitude since it announced its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last March. "North Korea obviously wants to pursue its policy of improving relations with the United States while delaying inter-Korean dialogue with the eventual aim of eliminating Seoul's links with the United States," Chong said. North Korea's use of "such a nuclear card," however, will no longer be effective, Chong declared. At the hour-long breakfast meeting with ruling party leaders, President Kim expressed confidence that the South would repel any kind of provocation from North Korea. After recalling all instances in which Pyongyang unilaterally frustrated Seoul's sincere attempts at dialogue and reconciliation, Kim said, "I did not expect the North to bring up talk of war last Saturday." The matter was especially appalling because the North Korean chief delegate did not speak spontaneously but was reading a statement prepared earlier in Pyongyang, Kim said. "Since we do not want the North isolated from the world community, we will leave the door open for dialogue," Kim said. "But war should never break out on the Korean peninsula again under any circumstances. Preventing war is possible only when we are strong," Kim said, explaining his reason for ordering the deployment of Patriot missiles and considering resumption of Team Spirit this year. The main opposition Democratic Party [DP], meanwhile, counselled the government Tuesday to refrain from "physical sanctions" against North Korea in favor of dialogue. "If the government has determined that there is no immediate danger of war, it should be cautious in deciding on the deployment of the Patriot missiles and resumption of Team Spirit," said the party following a meeting of its policy-making Supreme Council. "No one should be allowed to heighten tension on the Korean peninsula," the party said in a statement. "Resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue has to be made through a package deal." The proposed exchange of special envoys between Seoul and Pyongyang will also have to be undertaken not as a precondition to resolve the issue but at the same time, the party said. The DP then urged North Korea to accept IAEA inspection of its nuclear facilities to guarantee transparency of nuclear safeguards and apologize for the chief delegate's statement that "Seoul will turn into a sea of fire if war breaks out." In addition, the opposition party pointed out that the Seoul government should have a consistent North Korea policy. Kim Tae-chung, former chairman of the Democratic Party, said he "could not help being aghast at the sea-of-fire statement by the North Korean delegate," according to his spokesman, Chong Tong-chae. Kim Tae-chung was extremely shocked after reading the remark, since the North Korean regime has been saying it was for "the people of Korea" whenever there was a chance. Kim, however, advised South Korea to avoid being taken in by such an irrational provocation, Chong said.
