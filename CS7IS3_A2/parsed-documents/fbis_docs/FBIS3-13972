India's relations with the United States are also becoming tense. Not only Indian, but foreign newspapers have also written a lot about the tension among India, Pakistan, and the United States of America at international level. Analyses are being made at international levels on this situation. Let us first discuss the tension between India and Pakistan. The day Benazir Bhutto became Pakistan's prime minister a second time, she started to spew poison against India over the Kashmir issue. Recently, in Davos, Switzerland, and after her return from Geneva after attending the Human Rights Conference, Benazir Bhutto spoke against India continuously to international and national correspondents with regard to Kashmir. Benazir, who is nervous about her "civil war" with her brother and her mother, has started to emphasize her statements against India in order to divert the attention of her country and of opposition parties from her family. Bhutto has also been encouraged by the United States to speak out against India. Benazir also knows that U. S. President Clinton is opposed to India. Why is that? I will go over that later; however, after Pakistan failed in spreading terrorism in Punjab, all Benazir had left with her to condemn India all over the world was her "one-point program" on Kashmir. The way the Indian government started to pressure various terrorist groups in the Kashmir Valley; the way these terrorists had to submit after the Hazratbal incident; and the way Pakistan's efforts to encourage terrorism at the international level was exposed have all pushed Pakistan to start efforts to spread unrest in Kashmir across the actual line of control. On one side, across the actual line of control, rockets are fired toward the Indian side. On the other side, bombs are set off in Jammu and Kashmir, and sensitive areas like TV towers are burned. We do not know how many times terrorist groups attacked our security forces in that state during the last month. The time has come for the ice to melt, and thousands of trained terrorists are waiting to cross the border into India. While the terrorist groups are misleading the youths in Kashmir, Pakistani troops are shooting rockets loaded with time bombs into Indian territory. Recently, Pakistani-trained terrorists led an early morning organized attack in Kutwara city and forced security forces to shoot back in retaliation. Twenty-one people were killed in this exchange of fire, including three members of the Jammu-Kashmir police. The Hizb-ul Mujaheddin and the Jamat-ul Mujaheddin both started to raise a hue and cry over this and began to propagate that atrocities were being committed against Kashmiri Muslims. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto also agreed with them and began to beat a drum at the international level that the Indian government was committing atrocities against the Kashmiri people and violating their human rights. A few days ago, a bomb went off in a Kathua movie house, killing two people and wounding 23 others. Pakistan is not worried about the people who were killed or wounded by that bomb blast, nor are any of the terrorist groups in the region. However, when the security forces take any action in their defense or to protect the people, then it is propagated that the Indian government is committing atrocities against the Kashmiri people. The international conspiracies hatched in Jammu-Kashmir are only aimed at attaining one goal: protecting the seat of power in Pakistan and keeping the attention of the Pakistani people focused on Kashmir. This gives Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto time to issue anti-Indian statements in the United Nations and the UN Human Rights Commission. She tells them, "Look at how the Indian government is committing atrocities against Kashmiri Muslims!" Can there be another goal for Pakistan? Does Pakistan want to start another war with India? Is the Pakistani army inciting India to start a war? According to Indian military intelligence sources, we cannot deny the possibility that the Pakistani army is inciting India into war by shooting rockets across the India-Pakistan control line. According to intelligence sources, the Pakistani army, by shooting rockets in that region, is diverting the Indian armed forces attention from fighting the terrorists and is trying to divert their attention toward the Pakistani army. The intelligence sources claim that with the new wave of terrorism in Jammu-Kashmir, the Indian armed forces and security forces are busy dealing with terrorist acts. This will facilitate the entry of thousands of trained terrorists into the Kashmir Valley. The Pakistani army will take advantage of this opportunity and will take control of part of Indian territory. That means the Indian army would have to start a war with Pakistan to get those areas back. This way, two battle fronts will open in Kashmir. In this situation, when the Indian army is not getting cooperation from the Kashmiri people, and Pakistan is getting sympathy at the international level--including the United States of America--the United States will be able to pressure India on this issue, and Pakistan will be showered with new modern weapons and dollars. Using this pretext, Pakistan will be able to continue its Islamic bomb program, and during this period, Benazir Bhutto will be able to strengthen her position as prime minister. If we analyze Jammu-Kashmir and Pakistan's present situation closely, then the facts related above support the hypothesis that an international-level conspiracy is being implemented against India. Are the Americans involved with Pakistan in this conspiracy? Is not this a conspiracy to stop India from emerging as an economic power in South Asia? The anti-India international powers have perhaps begun to feel that after India has successfully suppressed terrorism in Punjab, sooner or later, terrorism in Kashmir will also end, and Pakistan will be defeated there also. What kind of attitude does the only superpower in the world, the United States, have toward India in this whole situation? I will talk about this in the next installment of this article. [8 Feb p 4] [Text] Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and the Indian Foreign Ministry are now clear on the fact that President Clinton's policy on India-Pakistan relations and Kashmir and Punjab is against India. It was noted in the past that whenever there a Democrat was president in the United States, U.S. government policy was neither opposed to India nor in support it. American policy on Kashmir was always neutral. The Republican presidents have always implemented anti-India and pro-Pakistan policies. During John F. Kennedy's and Jimmy Carter's administrations, the United States had neutral policies about India. During the eras of Nixon, Reagan, and Bush, the United States encouraged Pakistan to spread an anti-Indian tirade and keep the Kashmir issue alive. Perhaps this is the first time in the history of United States-India relations that a Democrat, President Clinton, has adopted an anti-India attitude on Kashmir, Punjab, and India-Pakistan relations fronts. Have the attitudes of Democratic Party leaders changed regarding India, or has India failed to present its case appropriately to the United States? Whatever the reason, the United States tried to control India's economy through the World Bank recently and has given up its neutral position on the human rights issue of Kashmir and Punjab. The way the United States is encouraging Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to spew poison against India clearly indicates its changed attitude toward India. In light of this changed situation, India also started to speak out against U.S. high-handedness. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao opposed U.S. economic, political, Kashmir, and Punjab policies in his speech in Davos, Switzerland. This was perhaps the first time since the late Mrs. Gandhi that an Indian prime minister used such words against the United States. The situation at that time was very different. At that time, India had the full support of the Soviet Union. At this time, however, it is surviving at the mercy of the United States, which is controlling the politics of the entire world. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's speech and the hints sent by our Foreign Ministry to the United States have made it clear that India does not like U.S. interference in its internal affairs. The way India has expressed its reaction to the United States' anti-India policies makes it clear that there is a lot of tension between Delhi and Washington. Both sides will have to work very hard over the next few days to ease this tension. President Clinton is fully responsible for the problem in U.S.-India relations. The way he issued pro-Pakistan statements about Kashmir and Punjab against India has disappointed the Indian government. This is perhaps the first time that the United States has failed to appoint an ambassador to its embassy in New Delhi. This can give us an idea of how important India is to the president of the United States. It was heard before that former Senator Stephen Solarz, who is pro-India, could be appointed ambassador to India. If this happens, there would be efforts to improve relations between India and the United States. Neither the U.S. administration nor President Clinton, however, have made a final decision about this. The situation has deteriorated so much now that Indian Ambassador Siddhartha Shankar Ray in Washington and our Foreign Ministry have been forced to believe that Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's proposed trip to the United States should be canceled. Mr. Rao had planned to visit the United States in February. There are still plans for Mr. Narasimha Rao to meet with Bill Clinton; however, according to Foreign Ministry sources, if President Clinton is so convinced against India on the Punjab and Kashmir issues that he is making open statements at the international level, Mr. Narasimha Rao's trip to the United States and meeting with Clinton will not yield any positive results. As for India, the terrorism in Punjab has almost ended. The situation there has improved, and Punjab is making economic progress. A year ago, India's Foreign Ministry complained that the way terrorism was ended in Punjab under Narasimha Rao's leadership, and the way the U. S. policies opened the Indian economic system to the international market will cause the young U.S. President Clinton to praise India and invite our prime minister to visit the United States. He is the prime minister of the world's largest democracy and was visiting other countries. But the U.S. president did not invite him. Instead of praising Mr. Rao, Mr. Clinton encouraged propaganda against India. It is surprising to learn that Clinton, who is the president of the world's only superpower, still believes there is terrorism in Punjab and that rights are violated there. The whole world knows that the situation in Punjab has changed over the last two years and that peace has been established there. The controversial letter that Mr. Clinton wrote to Ghulam Nabi Fai, who is president of the Pro-Pakistan Kashmir Council in the United States, and the way anti-India propaganda was accelerated in U.S. policy, forced Mr. Siddhartha Shankar Ray to threaten that if the U.S. government's attitude remained anti-India, then the Indian prime minister would cancel his trip to the United States. Such talk from the Indian ambassador and our foreign ministry will not have much of an effect on a powerful nation like the United States; however, by telling this to the United States at the international level, we have at least demonstrated our pride in independent policies. This step is praiseworthy. In my personal opinion, after the United States started its propaganda against India, it was the first time our Foreign Ministry responded strongly to it. Before this, all U.S. decisions were considered as new laws by the whole world. India is the only country in the world with the courage to tell the United States, the policeman of the world, that India is fully alert to human rights and democracy, and that it will not accept external interference in this area. What will be the result of India's bluntness? How will it affect Indo-U.S. relations in the future? Will Pakistan's position become stronger because of the India-Pakistan tension? It is natural for such questions to arise; however, at this point, the most important question is of India's pride and self-respect. If we have to pay a heavy price to protect our pride and self-respect, we should be fully prepared to do so. *
