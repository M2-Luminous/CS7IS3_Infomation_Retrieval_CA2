An agreement on survey efforts was reached between the administration of the oblast and the concern as early as 1991. However, implementation of the project became possible only after the government resolved to exempt Elf Aquitaine from customs duties on medical [as published] equipment it imports to Russia. Experts estimate that there are about 300 million tonnes of oil under the oblast. According to the terms of the contract, 60 percent of the oil produced will remain in Russia, and 40 percent will become the property of the concern.
