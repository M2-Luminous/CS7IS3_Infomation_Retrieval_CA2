The program is continuing to develop. Unique packages of shares of major enterprises, of interest to shareholders, will be issued at check auctions in the near future. Check auctions in the power and oil industries are now being developed. Shares from the Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant, the "Optoyuviler" Joint-Stock Company, the Novorossiysk Shipping Company, and dozens of other efficient enterprises will be issued at check auctions in the near future. That, strictly speaking, was how our program was structured. Today the key issue for us is the question of the postprivatization functioning of the enterprises. Therefore, to a great extent, all of us are switching our activity and our influence to everything that is connected with the creation of sources of investment for the privatized enterprises. My colleagues and I have recently been putting forward various initiatives concerning the search for new sources of investments. We are also actively supporting Western initiatives in this sphere. A Russian-U.S. enterprise fund is now being created in Russia, which will only be involved in investments in privatized enterprises, and this means no less than $300 million. Dozens of funds like this will come into being in the near future, and we are trying to help them as much as possible in their practicable work.
