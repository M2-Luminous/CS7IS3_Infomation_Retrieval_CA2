Meanwhile, Cairo University has decided to cancel two Arabic musical concerts scheduled for today and to postpone until 3 March a folk dance show by Rida Group, in solidarity with the families of the Palestinian martyrs and as an expression of denunciation for this appalling crime. At Al-Azhar University students demonstrated today for half an hour while the opening session of an international competition on the Koran was held on campus.
