Ruzickova; place and date not given: "First Goal--Get Into the Parliament; Second Goal--Win the Elections"] [Text] The Conservative Democratic Party [KDS] is one of the parties that only came into existence after the June elections--on the ruins, so to speak, of the former Public Against Violence [VPN]. Therefore, it is one of the parties that so far have had no possibility to try for a seat in the parliament or the government, and, as is known, it has not the most modest of goals for the future in that respect. We talked about where it is coming from and where it is aiming with its chairman and active participant in the area of justice, trade, as well as production, Dr. Pavol Hagyari: [Hagyari] I'll begin with the reason why we came into being. Since the political right lost in the election because of its fragmentation, this orientation in effect totally lost its influence in the solving of society's problems. We conceive and constitute ourselves as a conservative party positioned between the center and the right, and when we look at this area of the political spectrum today, we see there, besides us, practically only the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and the "pseudoright" Slovak National Party [SNS], which embraces the right in words, but if I am to judge it by its concrete actions in the parliament--that is, according to its voting on important laws--then it really is not particularly noted for its right orientation.... [Ruzickova] Not even Cernak's wing? [Hagyari] Mr. Cernak, besides the rightist rhetoric, also knows where SNS should be aiming as a party of the right. Maybe there are a few more people like that around him, but for the time being it is difficult to say how the party will actually develop. Somehow it has not yet crystallized. But I shall go back to the characteristics of our party, which I mentioned at the beginning. If we also categorize KDH as a rightist and conservative party, it should also be said that it speaks to its followers on the denominational basis. Whereas we cast ourselves as a civic party. We would like to appeal to the right-oriented citizens who, let's say, do not share with KDH a common view on the questions of faith, abortion, and attitude toward the Slovak state. We have already merged with the former Civic Democratic Party [ODS] on the basis of this common objective and signed an agreement on integration with the Democratic Party [DS]. When you realize that together this political right gained 10 percent of votes in the last elections, and you add to it our effort not to engage in needless politicking and philosophizing but to really pursue practical politics directed at the citizen, I believe that our plans for the future are not unrealistic even though they are not, I admit, modest. [Ruzickova] Will you disclose them? [Hagyari] We make no secret of them. In the next elections--and I should point out that I think it should be early elections--we want to become a parliamentary party, and even to win as an integrated right the next elections after that. Because if we want to achieve our goals, we must be in power. But we are not looking only at the parliament, we are also systematically preparing ourselves for the local elections. I can say that today the majority of mayors in towns sympathizes with us; 90 percent of them are right-oriented. By joining with DS, we gained influence also with mayors in those communities where DS is in a good position. Specifically in order to be useful to them, we are now formulating an agricultural program. We are making a great effort to bring prominent people into our party, because without them and their appearances and statements in the media, we cannot influence public opinion. We hold to the principle that a person must already be in some respect prominent when entering politics. He or she must already have the image of an expert, an influential entrepreneur, or a public official. We do not want it to be the other way around--that only through being active in politics they become prominent. [Ruzickova] Your effort to bring in prominent people obviously stems from the fact that many known representatives of VPN, ODS, and DS are actively engaged in KDS--therefore rightists who lost in the elections, and although they are very active even now within the KDS, nevertheless, it would probably not be very good tactics for them to work too arduously at making themselves "visible" so soon after the election debacle. But I cannot altogether agree with you when you place primary importance on personalities. I believe that the citizen--especially after the innumerable disappointments with beautiful words and promises--will be paying more careful attention in the next elections to the programs. And the programs are what particularly interests us, all the more so because you are talking about helping entrepreneurs and transforming the economy, but in the same breath you are also talking about solving the problems of retirees, health care, and education. How do you propose to reconcile these interests and needs that are more antagonistic than synergetic? When our society, which is in the beginning stage of transformation, is faced with overcoming cutbacks, difficulties, and failures until we reach a certain degree of growth? Of course, a populist program, which only promises that everything will be fine, would be a mistake. No. The program must also say that there will he hard times. And a program for overcoming the hard times needs arguments and prominent people who know how to present the program and convince people. What, then, in brief are the characteristics of the individual parts of your program? [Hagyari] It is essential to tell the truth. Even an unpleasant truth, so that people would at long last understand that socialism is really gone. But because there are actually areas that always and everywhere have to be subsidized, it is all the more important to think about creating resources. To do that it is possible to stay with the tried-and-tested approaches that are in fact used everywhere, and those form the basis of our programs. They are antistatism, that is, minimizing the role of the state, anticollectivism, because it was never progressive, and anti-egalitarianism--which means, the principle that people are equal under the law but are not equal in their abilities. We place emphasis on the individual, that is, the men or women who are able to lead, who know how to take care of themselves but also of others. The most important is the economic program.... [Ruzickova] And what about education, for example? [Hagyari] We propose to minimize state expenditures for education, establish as many private schools as possible, and, since we are now talking about the social sphere, privatize health care. The social sphere is dependent on the economic sphere, therefore there can be no miracles, they do not exist. The foundation is the economic program based on privatization by all the methods. [Ruzickova] But privatization affects the former socialist properties. It includes the large enterprises. And as we know, in every good economy the smaller enterprises are the foundation. The middle stratum. But it has to grow from different roots, not from the privatization of the giants, but from increased private entrepreneurial activity. What mechanisms do you have ready to help this middle stratum come into existence? Meaning small workshops, medium-sized workshops, smaller factories. [Hagyari] We already have the middle stratum. It was being formed during the small privatization. I myself am the co-owner of a small factory, which I acquired in 1991. Since that time, we substantially increased wages in it and invested in the development of technology. Truly, the best way to achieve growth leads through small and medium-sized enterprises. But here we find ourselves in a vicious circle that we have to break out of. The small and medium-size enterpreneurs do not have sufficient credit resources, because banks are still providing loans to unproductive state enterprises. [Ruzickova] And the solution? [Hagyari] Bankruptcies! I do not think that bankruptcies are some kind of tragedy. An enterprise declares bankruptcy, a competent entrepreneur appears and buys the factory. He will be interested in doing well, so he obtains the technology and employs people again. The second possibility is to bring in foreign capital. But that requires stabilization of the political scene. Our party has represented itself from the beginning as a party that wants to benefit precisely the entrepreneurial sphere. We enjoy very good cooperation with the Party of Enterpreneurs and Small Businessmen, and are thinking about integrating with them. We do not think, you see, that a special party of enterpreneurs has any prospects; unfortunately, nowhere in the world are such parties in power. And so we are making an effort if not to directly integrate with them, at least to create a bloc of the right. [Ruzickova] What specifically have you already done for the small and medium-size entrepreneurs? [Hagyari] Our economic program is based on creating the best possible conditions for entrepreneurs. Since we are not a government party, we at least make proposals in the legislative sphere that are in their interest. We pointed out, for example, that the law on land is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, that the penal code incorrectly establishes criminal responsibility for unintentional failure to pay tax, and we initiated the protest against mandatory settlement of claims through Fizako. Our proposals are presented as initiatives for the Constitutional Court. [Ruzickova] How do you want to cooperate with the Democratic Alliance, and what possibility do you see for cooperation with the liberal wing of HZDS [Movement for Democratic Slovakia]? [Hagyari] I already said that we are ready to create a rightist bloc. There will be official discussions with the Democratic Alliance of the Slovak Republic following their congress. I believe that we will find points on which we agree. [Ruzickova] I would also like to ask about your foreign contacts. You indicated that you are endeavoring to become members of suprastate, supranational central organizations. Which way do your lean? Toward the liberal or the conservative ones? [Hagyari] We are a conservative-liberal, or to put it another way, a neoconservative party, and we have applied for membership in the European Democratic Union. There they welcomed our effort to integrate the Slovak right and promised us support not only moral but also specific. They will organize various educational seminars here. We are interested in becoming members of the European Democratic Union. [Ruzickova] If you succeed in that, it will certainly increase not only the international but also the domestic standing of KDS, which you head. Your main goal--success in the elections--will nevertheless depend on whether you find the correct, balanced, and for other parties acceptable way for integrating the right. No matter how cautionary the election loss caused by the fragmentation of the right is, its memory by itself certainly will not be enough to unite the right. [Hagyari] It would be ideal if on the right spectrum of the political scene we had only one or two parties; but, such a situation pobably will not exist here for a long time yet. As I said at the beginning, if the right is in fact represented by KDH and us, I think that KDH should address its people on the denominational principle, and we should address ours on the civic principle. We already succeeded in integrating with ODS and DS, which today also includes the former Movement for Understanding Between Czechs and Slovaks. I think that considering the Slovak conditions it is quite a good accomplishment. I believe that the Party of Enterpreneurs and Small Businessmen will also identify with our goals. We have an almost identical economic program with KDH, and their social program was formulated by one of our members. It is a strong movement. So far they have not expressed their view on the coalition of rightist parties--we are really ready to begin discussions on forming the rightist bloc at a moment's notice. It would be a good thing if the entire right were to succeed in uniting. Finally--the acid test of such tactics could come already in the local elections....
