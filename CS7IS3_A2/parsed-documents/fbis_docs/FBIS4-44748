This will serve as a platform for researchers in the broad field of microelectronics; from the manufacturing of simple chips to the design and realization of complete systems, including peripheral electronics. STW's annual report announces that 60 researchers are involved in the Prorisc program. Contacts also exist with researchers from Belgium. Prorisc is recognized by the IEEE, the American Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
