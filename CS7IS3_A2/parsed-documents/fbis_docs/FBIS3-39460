At a CDU election event in Hannover on Wednesday evening [16 February], Kohl said Rau had "not felt solidarity with the Germans of the GDR" in the second half of the 1980's. If the Social Democrats now say that the discussion of their behavior toward the former GDR leadership is "mudslinging," they only want to divert the people's attention, the CDU chairman told 2,500 participants in the event. He sticks to his accusation that at that time leading Social Democrats had given in to central demands of ex-GDR head of state Erich Honecker. They had advocated dissolving the Salzgitter documentation center for human rights violations in the GDR and abandoning joint German citizenship. "We never betrayed the ideal of German unity, despite all the mistakes we made," Kohl cried to the CDU membership. In the event of wage conflicts in the metal industry, Kohl warned against strikes and lockouts. He called on both sides of industry to solve the wage conflicts at the negotiating table. "I do not believe that strikes and lockouts would be helpful for jobs and the unemployed in this situation," Kohl said. On the contrary, an industrial conflict would "seriously damage" the competitiveness of the German economy. Therefore, the employers and the trade unions should get together. Kohl again presented the latest conclusion of a collective agreement in the chemical industry as an "act of reason," both regarding the wage agreement of 2 percent and more flexible working hours.
