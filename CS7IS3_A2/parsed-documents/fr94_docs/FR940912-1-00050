FR940912-1-00050 FR940912-1-00011 There are many statutes that authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into specific agreements for the incidental use of Reclamation projects and project lands. These activities may take place on both withdrawn public domain lands and on lands acquired for Reclamation projects either by purchase, exchange, or condemnation. In addition, activities may be authorized for the use of project facilities or may address the sale or disposal of water. Generally those statutes detailed the specific manner in which revenues generated by these incidental uses were to be distributed. The revenues are funds of the United States and, as required by the U. S. Constitution, cannot be expended or credited other than as Congress directs. In those instances where Congress has not provided specific crediting criteria, Reclamation has adopted the manner of revenues crediting specified for other activities from authorized use of Reclamation lands. Examples of the types of uses on Reclamation projects and project lands include: (1) Leasing of minerals_ The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, (30 U.S.C. 181, et seq.), and the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947 (30 U.S.C. 351, et seq.), authorized the Secretary of the Interior to engage in the leasing and extraction of minerals, i.e., oil, gas, oil shale, gilsonite, sodium, phosphate, potassium, sulphur, and asphalt either on lands (specifically the mineral estates) in the public domain, or on lands acquired for a specific project and administered by Reclamation. (Jurisdiction over leasing activities does not rest with Reclamation). (2) Mineral leases (geothermal steam)_ The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 1001, et seq.) authorized the United States to issue leases for geothermal steam on both public domain and on acquired Federal lands. (Jurisdiction over leasing activities does not rest with Reclamation). (3) Recreation/concession agreements_ The Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 (Pub. L. 88&hyph;578); the Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;72), as amended by the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;251); and the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 (Title 28, Pub. L. 102&hyph;575), provide for the charging and collection of fees for public recreational uses of the land and water under the jurisdiction of Reclamation. (4) Sale of products and rights-of-use_ Section 10 of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. 387) grants authority to the Secretary of the Interior to permit the removal of sand, gravel, and certain other types of mineral materials and building materials, including the sale of timber, and to grant leases, licenses, easements, and rights-of-way on lands either withdrawn or acquired by the Government. This authority was valid only so long as the granting of the rights-of-use was not incompatible with the purposes for which the lands were designated. (5) Rights-of-way authorized by Mineral Leasing Act of 1920_The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 181, et seq.) authorized the granting of rights-of-way for the transportation of oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid or gaseous fuels, or any refined product produced to a common collection point, a refiner, or to the point of sale.
