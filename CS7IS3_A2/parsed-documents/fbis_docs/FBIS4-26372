The weekly, which is coming off here Wednesday [21 June], said that the devices have been brought into Iran in "diplomatic pouches" over the past few months. The shipment of the listening devices had been decided upon months before the British intelligence service planted bugging devices in the Iranian Embassy in London, it added. The official report said that the devices have enabled the British intelligence service to listen in on sensitive Iranian departments including ministries. The main targets are the intelligence, foreign and interior ministries. A group of Iranian students studying electronics in British Universities were quoted by the weekly magazine as saying that the British Telecommunications had confirmed the shipment but had not elaborated. The students have called on the Iranian Government to take adequate legal measures and order the British to remove the devices from their embassy. With regard to the recent exposure of bugging devices planted by British intelligence in the Iranian Embassy in London, the students criticized the Iranian Government for failing to employ Iranians to repair damage to the embassy building. The weekly quoted the students as saying that "British workers had helped British intelligence to plant the bugging devices while repairing the embassy." The recent hostile actions between the two sides have undermined the already fragile relations between Teheran and London. The political row between the two countries has led to the expulsion of one diplomat from each side.
