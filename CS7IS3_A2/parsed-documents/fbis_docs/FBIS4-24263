The increase was due to the introduction of a double ballot, an staff increase from seven monitors to 22,000, and the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] decision in the final stage of the elections to take part. Mr Justice Kriegler appeared before the committee against the background of the total R4-billion transition-to-democracy costs announced in last week's budget. Outlining the escalation in election costs, the judge said an original budget of R286-million was derived from a "superficial survey". After five weeks, a revised budget of about R700-million was prepared for then State President F W de Klerk and the Transitional Executive Council. The R700-million was made up of R375-million for election administration, R163-million for monitoring and R27-million for voter education. "That was the budget with which we proceeded until the eve of the elections," the judge told the committee. At that stage a second appropriation document was prepared asking for an additional R302-million which brought the total budget to R1-billion. The IFP's entry into the election meant an additional 549 voting stations had to be established. The IFP sticker affixed to ballot papers cost R20-million. The IEC had not yet finalised its accounts, but was expecting to do so by the third week of July. Thus far, the IEC had accounted for expenditure of R825-million. It had R51-million in outstanding payments and about R1.3-million in respect of salaries. "We will either be within our end of April budget or not substantially over that figure." The judge said it had been impossible to mount the elections operation cost-effectively in four months. There had been excessive and wasteful expenditure. "Don't put any other administration in this fix ever again." Answering questions on why the elections had gone more smoothly in white areas than in townships, the judge said that in Soweto for example there had been uncertainty over the number of voting stations until April 17. The IEC had identified 237 stations but the then South African Police had indicated that security could only be provided at 180. The IEC eventually settled on 137. There was also the disparity in the level of services and infrastructure between black and white areas. At 90 per cent of the stations, there had been no problems. He said it was correct that the election had cost R50 a voter. This compared favourably with a figure provided by the Commonwealth of 13 US dollars per voter in countries where a voters' roll was drawn up in tandem with an election. He conceded that there had been losses and pilfering but said all IEC equipment had been insured. Less than 20 vehicles were still unaccounted for. Mr Saki Macozoma (ANC) said the IEC needed to be congratulated for the work it had done. It had been seen by many as a way of getting "easy money". The judge warned against trying to run another election without a voters' roll and said it would take eight months to prepare one.
