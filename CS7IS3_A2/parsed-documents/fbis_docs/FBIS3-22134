They include Aberdeen, Dundee, Newport and several English industrial centres such as Bradford, Stoke and Wolverhampton. The gaps in the monitoring of potentially dangerous pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulphur dioxide are disclosed in a study commissioned by The Times and carried out by Friends of the Earth. The results underline the criticisms being expressed by many health and environmental groups at apparent lack of concern in local and national government at the risk to the nation's health posed by air pollution. Dr Malcolm Green, chairman of the British Lung Foundation, said: "People are affected not just by one source of pollution but by a cocktail of pollutants. Studies are pointing towards the cocktail as the major culprit for the health problems associated with poor air quality." Separate figures collated for the first time from the existing monitoring stations show hundreds of occasions in 1992 when pollutants exceeded international guidelines. The findings follow a survey of all local authorities by the National Society for Clean Air, which reported that air-quality guidelines are exceeded in more than 100 areas, yet 60 authorities that measure pollutants do not know what are the guidelines. Friends of the Earth checked the air-monitoring arrangements in 58 British towns and cities with populations of more than 100,000 and found most did not monitor the air. Some intend to start and the Government is to set up a further 12 "enhanced urban monitoring sites" that will measure five key pollutants. Friends of the Earth said, however, that even when all the new sites were operational, 20 of the largest towns and cities would still have no nitrogen dioxide monitoring, 23 would fail to monitor sulphur dioxide and 24 would not check ozone levels. The survey also reveals how often the main pollutants exceed international guidelines. The figures for 1992 show that levels of ozone, which aggravates bronchitis and asthma but also affects normally healthy adults, exceeded World Health Organisation guidelines on 269 days at 21 monitoring sites. Levels of nitrogen oxide exceeded guidelines on 60 days at four London sites, and Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield also reported several days with worrying levels. High levels of sulphur dioxide, which comes mostly from power stations and heavy industry, were recorded on 100 days at the two worst sites in central Belfast and Barnsley, South Yorkshire. "The figures show what a chronic problem air pollution has become, especially for the millions of people at risk," Fiona Weir, senior pollution campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said. Her concern is shared by the Environment Department, although not by the rest of the Government, according to health experts. In a recent report on environmental protection, civil servants at the department admitted that Britain's commitment to reducing nitrogen oxide emissions this year "will be a tougher target than we had expected." The report continued: "In the longer term, traffic growth in line with current projections could ultimately reverse the improvements we will secure from new vehicle standards." The civil servants also expressed concern at the continuing high levels of sulphur dioxide recorded in Belfast. Scientists accept that none of the guidelines by which air pollution is measured can address the problem of inhaling several different pollutants and it is this immeasurable cocktail that is causing the greatest concern. Friends of the Earth believes the figures underestimate the problem because of the shortage of monitoring sites. Britain has only seven sites, designed in compliance with European directives to measure nitrogen dioxide, compared with 53 in The Netherlands, 85 in France and 200 in Germany. It also criticised the Government for the way it monitored ozone levels, warning people of poor air quality only when the levels exceeded high-peak figures. Friends of the Earth believes that people should be warned of poor air when lower limits are breached for eight-hour periods.
