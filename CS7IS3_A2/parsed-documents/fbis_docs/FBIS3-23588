The servicemen from a military unit in the city of Kremenchuk are turning to you. How much longer are we to serve if we were drafted into active service in the fall of 1992 for 18 months? Rumors are now circulating that we will serve for two years." [Signed] Respectfully, servicemen from military unit 39226. We approached Major General Ostap Sapsa, first deputy chief of the Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with a request to comment on this and many other letters to the editor on this account. We quote his answer. "In keeping with the Law of Ukraine dated 19 November 1993, `On Amendments and Additions to the Law of Ukraine "On Universal Military Obligation and Military Service,"' amendments concerning the duration of military service for soldiers, sailors, sergeants and petty officers who will be in compulsory military service for 24 rather than 18 months have been made to Point `a,' Article 23. These changes occurred during the time of service of the category of servicemen in question, rather than upon completion of the previously established duration of 18 months, i.e. in December 1993. In the case in question, the effect of the law concerning the extension of the duration of compulsory military service by another six months covers this category of servicemen who were drafted into the army in June 1992."
