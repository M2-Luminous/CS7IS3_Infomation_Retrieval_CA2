It quotes the great leader President Kim Il-song as saying in his New Year address that now in the international arena the imperialists are vaunting the "end" of socialism, but they cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence, sovereignty and socialism, nor can they reverse the tide of history. The article says: Though the imperialists and the reactionaries are leaving no stone unturned in their attempt to stifle socialism, they can never put down the people's aspiration to socialism and reverse the tide of history. Describing the frustration of socialism in some countries as a change in the tide of history is nothing but an anti- popular, unscientific sophism ignoring the social nature of man and the law governing the development of history. As long as the popular masses remain the makers of history and mankind exists, socialism will surely advance and emerge victorious. This is well illustrated by the fact that the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists are now on the brink of total bankruptcy and the struggle of the popular masses for rebuilding socialism and vigorously advancing it is ever growing. That advancing towards socialism is the main trend of our time is also proven by the fact that the contradiction and crisis of the imperialists are becoming all the more serious and the people's struggle for independence is growing worldwide. In the past the imperialist powers joined hands with each other against socialism. Now, however, they are locked in a fierce fight with each other to expand their sphere of influence and capture markets by interfering in different regional disputes. It is a stark fact that the imperialists' contradiction and crisis are growing more acute and imperialism is rushing headlong to its destruction, finding itself on the deathbed in face of the people's struggle for building a new independent world. Socialism has definitely turned into the demand of our age. It is well illustrated also by the fact that the Pyongyang declaration calling for defending and advancing the cause of socialism has spread rapidly worldwide with a never diminishing attraction. The declaration has been signed by 200 political parties. This clearly proves its significance and vitality. There is no shadow of doubt that when the revolutionary parties and peoples across the world are closely united with each other under the banner of independence and powerful makers of history for a new world are prepared, the human cause of independence, the cause of socialism, will win a final victory.
