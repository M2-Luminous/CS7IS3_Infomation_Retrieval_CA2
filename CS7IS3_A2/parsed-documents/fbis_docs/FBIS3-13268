He said: [Begin recording] [Darawshah] We met with the president to perform a pan-Arab, social, and humanitarian duty, to offer condolences on the death of his son Basil, may God have mercy upon his soul. That is the primary objective of our visit. The president received us very warmly, as a great father of all the sons of the Arab nation. He welcomed us, and gave us a detailed briefing on Syria's position. I can say the president is a vital scholar for our Arab masses everywhere. He explained that Syria's strategic position is a peaceful position. Syria wants to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on international legitimacy. He pointed to the UN resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. He said Syria wants to achieve the peace of the brave, the peace that guarantees the end of Israeli occupation of all Arab territories, not just the Syrian Golan. He said he wants the implementation of the land for peace principle, Israel's withdrawal in return for peace. He said Syria has a lofty stand, a militant stand, a stand of pride and dignity. He said Syria's position is based on free Syrian Arab will, and that Syria will not submit to pressure from outside to adopt any particular position. He said: We adopt our stands based on our strategic vision, and on our belief in the Arab cause and Arab rights. [Dari] You toured Damascus and some other areas. What is your impression of Syria and the Golan? [Darawshah] Our meeting with President al-Asad; our meetings with the sons of our people in Syria; our tours of the Golan, the al-Qunaytirah Governorate, and the Damascus Governorate; our meetings with the brother governors; and our meetings with the masses of our people in markets and streets; as well as our meeting with the masses of our Palestinian people in the al-Yarmuk camp and elsewhere, have proved to us that this country, Syria, of which we are proud, is an oasis of freedom, dignity, and pride, and that all the requirements of honorable life are in Syria. Basic needs are available at prices that are cheaper than in any other state in the world. I have toured the world. Now, I have learned that the cheapest prices are in Syria. Commodities and goods are first class, very excellent. They are high-standard Syrian-made commodities. This conflicts with the propaganda campaign launched against Syria in the past, on the pretext that it is a police state, a state that suppresses freedoms, a state where Jews are persecuted, and a state that suffers a shortage of the basic needs. We have found that everything is abundant, that freedom is available, and that loftiness and dignity characterize every action by Syria, led by President Hafiz al-Asad, may God preserve him. [Dari] Mr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, you have come from the occupied Arab territories. Following the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the situation became very tense. Can you tell us your impression of the massacre and the Israeli army's actions against Palestinian Arab citizens, not only in Hebron, but also in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip? [Darawshah] We have continuous contact with the sons of our Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. We are very close to them, to their feelings, and their stands. We support their cause and their persistent struggle to achieve freedom and independence and to kick out the occupation. We bless the valiant intifadah of the sons of our Palestinian people to get rid of this occupation. Based on this, every time anything takes place, we call upon each other and rise up to defend the sons of our people. Following the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the heinous massacre perpetrated by settlers protected by the Israeli army, we visited Hebron, offered condolences to the martyrs' families, visited the wounded in hospitals, and met with the masses of our people in the city of Hebron and its governorate. We denounced this massacre. We call on the Israeli Government to deter the settlers, to disarm them, and to deport them from Hebron, from Qiryat Arba', the accursed settlement, and from all settlements established in the occupied Arab territories. We call for international protection of the Palestinian people, because the Israeli occupation not only did not protect the Palestinian people, but also allowed the settlers to carry out repressive acts against the Palestinian people. The Israeli army itself has carried out repressive and suppressive acts against the sons of our Palestinian people. The massacre that began at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque was continued later by the Israeli army, to the extent that the number of martyrs and wounded was much greater than the number of those killed at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. [Dari] Are you trying to say the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has confirmed the impossibility of coexistence between settlers and Palestinian citizens? [Darawshah] There will be no coexistence under occupation. There will be no coexistence as long as settlements continue. Therefore, all the settlers must be evicted and returned to Israel. These settlements should be turned into homes for Palestinian refugees and evacuees. Let them return and take these settlements as their houses. This is how we can achieve peace. This also applies to the occupied Syrian Golan. Settlers there must be evicted, the Golan must be returned in full, and these settlements should be turned into houses for Syrian evacuees who return to the Syrian Golan. [Dari] Thank you.
