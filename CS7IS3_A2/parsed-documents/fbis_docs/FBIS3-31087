Agani said the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo would put both warring sides into an approximately equal position, and explained that "as long as the Serbs are holding dominant positions there is no basis for a just peaceful solution." Commenting on Albania's official offer of its airports for NATO actions in Bosnia, Agani said briefly that "this is Albania's obligation, as a member of the international community," adding that similar offers had been made by Italy, Turkey, and Germany. Agani described DSK president Ibrahim Rugova's visit to the United States as successful, in particular the contacts he had with President Bill Clinton and representatives of the U.S. Administration.
