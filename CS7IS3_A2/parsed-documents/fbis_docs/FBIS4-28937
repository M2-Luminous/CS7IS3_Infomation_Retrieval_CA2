The U.S. imperialist war mongers were bent on inciting a war fever by babbling that the assault helicopters, which they brought in last March as part of their maneuverings to reinforce the Armed Forces aimed at a northward invasion, are high performance helicopters. The U.S. imperialist war mongers also made a show of Patriot missiles not long ago and staged a farce of demonstrating how to operate those missiles.
