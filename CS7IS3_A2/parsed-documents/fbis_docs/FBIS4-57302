He noted that the rumor mill has been active these past few days, and that even the health of President Rafael Caldera has been questioned. Escovar Salom gave no information on the inquiry conducted on a destabilization plan that includes this chain of rumors but termed them sources of unrest that seek to crumble the public's support for the Caldera government. He insisted this thing about the bogeyman is no cliche, but rather a conspiracy that involves a manipulation of the public and in no way is related to social unhappiness or protests over the water shortage. [Begin Escovar Salom recording] Some people have made the absurd assertion that I want to explain the social crisis by blaming the bogeyman. I never said that. You are the first to know that is not so. You clearly heard what I said. The social crisis, which the government acknowledges, the economic crisis, and severe difficulties the country is experiencing is one matter. The manipulation and tactics by some sectors that have an interest in heightening the crisis and seeking other goals is another matter. That is what these sectors are trying to do. The events that took place over the weekend are clear proof that my remarks were serious and justified. I mean the rumor campaign. This rumor mill is criminal. I mean all these announcements of the future of the bolivar, devaluation, and alleged financial and fiscal measures the government is purportedly going to take. [end recording] Commenting on the resignation of some members of the cabinet, Escovar Salom said any decision on the matter falls solely within the purview of President Caldera. On another matter, the Interior Minister commented on the border dispute between Merida and Zulia States. He noted this problem must be handled with utmost caution and prudence.
