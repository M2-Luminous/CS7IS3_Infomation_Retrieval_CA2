Diplomats Believe Boris Yeltsin Was Given the Wrong Document To Sign"] [Text] "The agreements concluded between Russia and Lativa, including the agreement on the military facility at Skrunde, were approved by President Yeltsin. There have been no changes in our position," IZVESTIYA was told by Sergey Zotov, special envoy and head of the state delegation to the talks with Latvia. "In the interstate agreements that have been initialed, the radar station at Skrunde is defined as a `Russian military establishment under civilian control,' and it is stated that it cannot be 'endowed with the status of a military base,'" Zotov said. According to information obtained by IZVESTIYA from various sources, the Russian Foreign Ministry does not know how the Skrunda radar station found its way into President Yeltsin's directive on the creation of military bases on the territory of CIS states. Especially since Latvia is not a member of the Commonwealth. Diplomats rule out the existence of a political subtext to the presidential directive, and are inclined to think it is a question of an annoying technical error. In their opinion the president was given an old draft to sign, which had been circulating around the bureaucracy for a long time. The officials responsible for drafting it had not made the necessary amendments to the text. People in the president's entourage, judging by Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov's statement, are also inclined to think in terms of a "technical error" causing the furor which is threatening to wreck the accords that had been reached. They are studying the history of the error and considering how to avoid possible negative consequences.
