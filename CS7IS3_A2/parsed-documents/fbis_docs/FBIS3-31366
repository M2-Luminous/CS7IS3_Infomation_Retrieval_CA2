The National Committee [KK], which held a session on Wednesday [16 February] in Gdansk, negatively evaluated the prime minister's reply to the proposal to meet with Chairman Marian Krzaklewski. "It seems that the prime minister does not want to hold this meeting at all," said KK Spokesman Piotr Zak regarding Pawlak's letter. In reply to the proposal submitted by Krzaklewski, the prime minister stated that "it is a bad tradition to transfer any conflict to the central level," and he pointed to the negotiations that are going on in the Labor Ministry. He suggested that, during those talks, Solidarity should try to discuss its tasks. The meeting between the prime minister and the chairman should be held at a later date. Krzaklewski did not conceal his disappointment over the contents of Pawlak's letter. It was unofficially recalled that last fall the Solidarity chairman was favorably impressed by Pawlak, and he counted on his help. Observers recall at the same time that, in the past, Krzaklewski relied very heavily on the help of Prime Minister Suchocka; the disappointment turned into enmity that ended up in conflict. According to Krzklewski and the KK, only strong and permanent pressure on the government will force it to implement the trade union's demands. By the middle of March, the government should submit credible guarantees of performing the following tasks: limiting energy price increases, giving property to the people, passing a law on collective agreements, respecting the principle of representation for employee and employer organizations, changing fiscal policy, and departing from the principle of centrally regulated wages. Solidarity also demands that the "Pact on Enterprise" be implemented; it wants corrections to the budget that would make it possible to perform the above-mentioned tasks. A strike headquarters has been set up that will decide the time and form of strikes in the regions and branches. Solidarity authorities will rely, among others things, on the secretariats of the Steel Works Industry, Transport, Mining and Energy, as well as Communications. The union is setting up a strike fund; the Solidarity authorities propose that each member pay half of his day's earning, which would yield as much as 112 billion zlotys [Z]. The resignation of KK Deputy Chairman Leszek Szewc, who was the head of the election staff, was not accepted. The union did not receive financial compensation for the introduction of nine legislators to the Senate. It is a sum of Z1.3 billion. The Solidarity election committee did not publish its financial report on the campaign in time. The union's authorities appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court over the decision of the Finance Ministry. However, they unofficially admit that they do not expect a verdict favorable to Solidarity.
