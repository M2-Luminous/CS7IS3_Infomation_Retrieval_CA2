Peter Marvanyi, our special correspondent, reports from their joint news conference in Ungvar: [Marvanyi] Both countries will soon sign in Brussels the document registering their joining the Partnership for Peace program. This was said at the news briefing held after the negotiations. [passage omitted] Both politicians returned from the Balkans recently and during their discussion it became clear that they agreed that the conflict there must be solved by political means. Indeed, Zlenko confirmed that Ukraine opposes any kind of external interference. He said that a possible step of this kind by NATO would have negative consequences for the entire Balkans. According to the Ukrainian politician, nothing could justify the bombing of Serbian positions. Naturally, mention was made -- mainly appreciatively -- about bilateral relations and the situation of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine. Anatoliy Zlenko said that the harmony between the minorities in Sub-Carpathia creates the conditions for cultural autonomy. In his view, the situation of Hungarians living here may be a yardstick for many countries where a solution to the nationality issue is being sought.
