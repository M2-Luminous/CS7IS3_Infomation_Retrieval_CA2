In a special session of the landtag, Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek, and Health Minister Franz Muentefering, who is responsible for the narcotics policy, said the reasons for sticking to the "provisional guidelines" on the identical application of Paragraph 31a of the Narcotics Law in North Rhine-Westphalia was that the decree was "consistent with the law on all points, well-balanced, and well founded on substance." The opposition has denied that. The SPD and the Greens have accused the CDU and the FDP of having created insecurity among the public through "deliberately wrong information." The land government was acting in line with the law because it did not legalize drugs and because possession of drugs will continue to be an offense in North Rhine-Westphalia, the SPD and Greens said.
