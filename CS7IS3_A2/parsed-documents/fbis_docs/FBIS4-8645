For more, Mehmet Haziri: [Haziri] The frequent movements of the Serbian Army are giving distressing dimensions to the wave of the Serbian repression in Kosova, which have, in the last months, been displayed in raids, mistreatment, and arrests. The Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] in Peje reports that in Tabje, a small hill near the city, a group of Serbian solders and policemen have been stationed since yesterday, while the bridge of Zall over Bistrice is kept under continuous control. Another report from Zhur stresses that recently a Serbian Army convoy that marched in front of this locality, provoked the inhabitants by mistreating several Albanian youths. It is reported that the trucks were carrying large-caliber weapons. Reports that arrived today at our editorial office in Prishtina and the Kosova Information Center confirmed Serbian police raids in many Kosova localities. On the pretext of searching for arms, dozens of families were raided in Drenoce and Balince of Malisheve, Dobercan in Gjilan, in Bratash in Podujeve, in Rahoshish and Jabllanice in Peje, in Ogosh in Kamenice, and in Suhareke. There are reports that many persons were maltreated and were held under arrest for many hours. As part of the wave of continuous Serbian repression, we should mention the dismissal of Albanian workers with no pretext at all. The Serbian-installed leadership at the Coca Cola Factory in Lipjan dismissed 49 Albanian workers. Sometime ago, the Serb occupying power fired 30 other workers from this Kosovar factory. Thus, the number of the Albanian workers in this factory in Kosova is now only symbolic.
