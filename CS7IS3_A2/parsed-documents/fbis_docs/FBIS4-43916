Speaking to the press in Bonn today, Kinkel also called for the "interlocking" of the EU with the Western European Union (WEU) defense alliance to be pushed forward. A common European foreign policy is particularly necessary in view of the events in former Yugoslavia, Kinkel said. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany) criticized the European Commission's white paper at the news conference, saying that "a series of interventionist principles" can be identified in it. Rexrodt argued by contrast for private initiative to be given priority over state activity.
